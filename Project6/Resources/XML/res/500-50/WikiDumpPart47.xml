 This doesn't come over any political reason of mine, I'm just lazy.
 I might come back a few years from now, and I realize that I
 should've mentioned this earlier, but eh.  Good luck all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Embouchure ==

The embouchure is an essential part of creating a good tone; it's like a carefully crafted doorway that the air stream flows through.  The embouchure has only one job, and it should feel the same all the time, and that job is to allow the airflow to act upon the clarinet so that the best possible quality of sound results.  Keith Stein calls the clarinet embouchure a combination of &quot;sets and draws,&quot; meaning that you set some muscles and pull on others.  And David Pino writes that only one basic embouchure setting is needed for the entire range of the clarinet (assuming the reed is doing what it's supposed to.)  The clarinet embouchure is so sensitive that the subtle, most minute change in the muscular structure can result in variations of tuning and color that the clarinet is producing.

== Relaxation ==

Playing the clarinet is all about comfort. For most, standing is preferred during auditions - it is actually best if the player sits in a comfortable straight chair, which is to say that a normal chair with padding on the seat and the back would be perfect (best without any arms,) but a chair like a recliner would be unacceptable.  The idea of being comfortable is so that the player relaxes, so that there is no extra tension anywhere in the body. Extra tension would start at the airflow, which would trickle down to the embouchure, which would give the player a bad sound, then the player would be confused as to why the clarinet is producing a worse sound, so with the sound the tonguing would be off, and finally the technique would go wrong as well.  That just shows you how important relaxation is! Clarinets are cool but as long as you are relaxed and comfortable there is nothing to worry about

== Embouchure Formation ==

Before actually touching mouth to mouthpiece, it is best if the player does a preliminary exercise to further prove the point of how everything should feel the same.  First, with the reed, mouthpiece, and ligature together, take the mouthpiece and hold it sideways to the light.  Look to see where the reed and the mouthpiece touch; this is where your bottom lip will touch.  Now stretch your bottom lip across your bottom teeth so that the red part of the lip is on top of the teeth. This should, in turn, make your chin &quot;dimple.&quot; Though it does, keep your chin flat and pointing downward.  This is one of the most important parts of the embouchure, since if you don't keep your chin flat, drool will run down your chin.  Now instead of a mouthpiece, take your thumb and place it inside your mouth, and gently lay your top teeth down.  You should not be biting your thumb, but the purpose of the top teeth is to merely hold the mouthpiece in place.  Now exhale air as if you were to produce a good airflow, and gradually close your lips around your thumb, being sure that your chin is still flat, and your to teeth are lightly resting on your thumb.  Close your lips around your thumb until all of the air stops leaking from your mouth.  Take note of what this feels like, this is what it should always feel like when you are playing the clarinet.  Your abdomen muscles have a constant pressure against them, you have a certain amount of speed that your air is moving (imagine that its moving, the pressure will feel the same,) your chin is flat, and your top teeth are just sitting there.  Try this a couple of times, then try blowing faster air, you will find that you don't need any much more muscle in your lips to keep it from leaking.

Now take your mouthpiece and barrel joint assembled in your right hand, and take your left hand and place it over the bottom of the barrel, and do the same thing.  After that take your left hand away from the barrel, and again, do the same thing.

This is a great exercise to help get an idea of what things should feel like.  To create an embouchure this way is very unnatural for the human lip, so it will take a good deal of practice to concentrate on the airflow and embouchure at the same time, but that's okay - Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.  These are issues that college students still have to address, and some instances the beginning college student doesn't know how to create a good airflow, or a good embouchure until his or her instructor teaches the player.  Your teacher may have a different exercise he or she may want you to do, as stated in the introduction, these are guidelines, this will never take the place of individual instruction.

Besides the standard embouchure described above, a small number of clarinetists use a technique taught by Auguste Périer at the Paris Conservatory early in the 20th Century. Rather than resting the upper teeth on the mouthpiece, the upper lip is rolled over them in a manner similar to the lower.

This technique, which is more difficult to acquire than the standard one, requires slow, careful development of the musculature in the upper lip. A beginner should not try to use it more that five minutes during a practice session during the first couple of months. Otherwise, there is risk that the muscles will be damaged, making it impossible to employ this technique.

To compensate the difficulty learning the “double lip” technique, practitioners contend that it produces a fuller, sweeter sound. Famous clarinetists who have used double lip include Ralph McLean, Harold Wright, Kalmen Opperman and his students, who include many orchestral players including Steven Hartman and soloists including Richard Stoltzman.

== '''The Big Misconception''' ==

A big misconception about the clarinet embouchure is that it should look like you're smiling. This is not true at all!  The &quot;smiling&quot; exercise will allow air-leaks, will tire out the embouchure more quickly, and will create more tension on the reed, making a good clarinet sound harder to produce.

== Holding the Clarinet ==

This section to this &quot;subchapter&quot; is in in its place because the author has decided that holding the clarinet has everything to do with how the face looks.  The clarinet should be held at a thirty-five to forty degree angle. When assembled, the clarinet's bell should either be between the players knees, or a little closer than that.  The idea is that you want the airflow to go through the clarinet as easily as possible, i.e. a straight line.  If the clarinet is positioned too far up, then the air bounces back and forth between the reed and the mouthpiece before settling in at a straight line, and this squeezes the reed so that you can't produce a good sound (this problem is more common that holding the clarinet too closely.)  Holding the clarinet too close makes the airflow bounce off the bore of the mouthpiece, and though its a little different from holding it too far away, it's just as ineffective.  In some rare cases the clarinet may have to be held a little higher or lower than normal due to its players dental condition. Those with overbites tend to need the clarinet closer to them while those with under-bites tend to need the clarinet away from them, and from then on its just how the teeth are arranged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A definition of war would be helpful here.

&quot;However, throughout history there are as many invasions and annexations that did not lead to a war, such as the U.S.-led invasion of Haiti in 1994&quot;
Depending on your definition of war, the US intervention in Haiti in 1994 could be seen as causing the recent (2004?) overthrow of Aristide.  Also, Cedras allowed the US-led forces into Haiti (as did Aristide, whatever scrap of power he had), so although Powell et al verbally threatened that they would invade anyway if they didn't have Cedras's permission, isn't that the point of diplomacy?  If they had his permission, it wasn't an act of aggression.  Obviously this is a detailed topic, but I don't believe it is a good example for what you are saying.

Also, discussion of old wars versus new wars would be good (Kaldor, van Creveld, etc), as would perhaps more of a discussion on political philosophy's different views of war</text>

'''Vorschmack''' has long traditions in Finnish cuisine. Vorschmack can be served as an everyday meal, as well as a festive speciality. To be served heated, with pickled beetroot in vinegar, pickled cucumber and sour cream.

The Savoy restaurant is located on the top floor of Eteläesplanadi 14 in Helsinki. The restaurant has traditions that go back generations. One of the frequented guests in the 1920’s and 1930’s was [[w:Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Marshal Mannerheim]]. Mannerheim’s table at the Savoy was always reserved, and out of respect no one would ever consider demanding to be seated there. Vorschmack was one of Mannerheim’s favorite appetizers.

==Ingredients==
* 4 lbs. (1800g) boned leg of [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]]
* ½ lbs. (225g) of boned [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* six [[Cookbook:Herring|herring fillets]] in [[Cookbook:Brining|salt brine]]
* one can of [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]], about 2 ounces (60g)
* 5 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* five [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
# Let the herring fillets soak in 1 G cold water over night. Dry the fillets on paper towels. Preheat the oven to 400°F (220°C). Cut the meat in 1&quot; (2.5cm) cubes. Slice the onions. Arrange the meat and onion in a greased baking dish and roast on the medium shelf until golden brown (about 15-20 minutes).
# Let the dish cool, and then grind the contents with the herring and anchovy using a meat grinder. In a large bowl, add some water to the mixture to give it the consistency of thick porridge. Season with white pepper and pressed garlic.
# Place the contents in a baking dish. Spread out some tomato paste over the surface of the mixture. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for two hours. Add water if the Vorschmack looks dry. If the consistency is too light, continue baking to evaporate excess water. The consistency should resemble thick hot porridge.
# Serve hot with baked potatoes, smetana and a shot of ice cold vodka, filled to the rim. The saltiness of the Vorschmack is regulated by the time used to soak the herring fillets. For high saltiness, let the herring soak two hours, for low saltiness let them soak eight hours.

This is a delicious, refreshing, and simple Brazilian dessert. It does have some alcohol (Creme de Cassis -- blackcurrant liqueur), but a non-alcoholic blackcurrant syrup could be substituted.

==Ingredients ==
* 1 ripe [[cookbook:papaya|papaya]]
* 1 scoop [[cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|vanilla ice cream]]
* 1 tbsp [[cookbook:blackcurrant|blackcurrant liqueur]]
* 1 sprig of [[cookbook:mint|mint]] for decoration (optional)

== Procedure ==
;Method 1: 
#Peel papaya and remove seeds. [[cookbook:Cube|Cube]] the papaya. 
#Put papaya pieces in [[cookbook:blender|blender]] with ice cream and blackcurrant liqueur. [[cookbook:Puree|Blend]] well until smooth. 
#Pour into a small bowl and decorate with mint. 

;Method 2: 
#Peel papaya and remove seeds. Cube the papaya. 
#Put papaya pieces in blender with ice cream and blend until creamy consistency. 
#Pour some blackcurrant liqueur on the bottom of a large dessert glass. 
#Add the cream mixture. Add a swirl of blackcurrant liqueur on the top. 

;Method 3: 
#Cut papaya in half and remove seeds. Scoop papaya from peel with a spoon (this is easier and cleaner than peeling the fruit). 
#Place approximately equal portions of papaya and vanilla ice cream in a blender. Blend until creamy. 
#Place the mixture into a serving dish and pour about an ounce of [[Bartending/Alcohol/Crème liqueur#Crème de Cassis|Crème de Cassis]] on top.

Either way, it is best served immediately, but can be chilled for a short time.

Serves one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Common Lisp has much more support for performing number-crunching tasks than most programming languages. This is achieved by having support for large integers, rational numbers, and complex numbers, as well as many functions to work on them.

==Types of numbers==

The hierarchy of the '''number''' type is as follows:

*'''number'''
**'''real'''
***'''rational'''
****'''integer'''
*****'''fixnum'''
*****'''bignum'''
****'''ratio'''
***'''float'''
****'''short-float''' 
****'''single-float'''
****'''double-float'''
****'''long-float'''
**'''complex'''

===Fixnums and Bignums===
'''Fixnums''' are integers which are not too large and can be manipulated very efficiently. Which numbers are considered fixnums is implementation-dependant, but all integers in &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;-2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;,2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;-1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; are guaranteed to be such.

'''Bignums''' are integers which are not fixnums. Their size is limited by the amount of memory allocated for Lisp, and as such they can be really large. Operations on them are significantly slower than on fixnums. Of course, that doesn't make them less useful.


===Ratios===
'''Ratios''' represent the ratio of two integers. They have the form ''numerator''/''denominator''. The function '''/''' which performs division always produces ratios when its arguments are integers or ratios. For example &lt;code&gt;(/ 1 2)&lt;/code&gt; will result in 1/2, not 0.5. Other arithmetic operations also work fine with ratios.

===Floats===
'''Float''' is short for [[w:floating-point number|floating-point number]], a datatype used to represent non-integer numbers in most programming languages. There are four kinds of floats in Common Lisp, which provide increasing precision (implementation-dependent).  By default, implementations assume short floats, which have limited precision.  To input a more precise float, other textual notations must be used, e.g., &quot;1.0d0&quot; for a double-float.

===Complex===
'''Complex''' is a datatype for representing [[w:complex numbers|complex numbers]]. The notation for complexes is #C(''real'' ''imaginary''). Real and imaginary parts are both either rational or floating-point. The operations that can be performed on complexes include all arithmetic operations and also many other functions which can be extended to complex numbers (such as exponentiation and logarithm).

==Numeric Operations==
The following functions are defined for all kinds of numbers:
*The arithmetical operations '''+''','''-''','''*''','''/''' are quite obvious (note, though, that they can have more than two parameters).
*'''sin''', '''cos''', '''tan''', '''acos''', '''asin''', '''atan''' provide trigonometric functions.
*The same, with '''h''' at the end (like '''asinh''') provide corresponding hyperbolic functions.
*'''exp''' and '''expt''' perform exponentiation. '''exp''' accepts one parameter and calculates e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;, while '''expt''' accepts two parameters (base and power).
*'''sqrt''' calculates the square root of a number.
*'''log''' calculates logarithms. If one parameter is supplied, the natural logarithm is calculated. If there are two parameters, the second parameter is used as the base.
*'''conjugate''' returns the [[w:complex conjugate|complex conjugate]] of a number. For real numbers the result is the number itself.
*'''abs''' returns the absolute value (or magnitude) of a number.
*'''phase''' returns the complex argument (angular component) of a number.
*'''signum''' returns a number with the same phase as its argument, but with unit magnitude.

The following functions are defined for specific kinds of numbers:
*'''gcd''' and '''lcm''' calculate [[w:greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] and [[w:least common multiple|least common multiple]] of several integers.
*'''isqrt''' returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the exact square root of a given natural number.
*'''cis''' calculates e&lt;sup&gt;iφ&lt;/sup&gt; where φ is supplied in radians.

==Comparison of numbers==

The following functions can be used for comparison of numbers. Each of these functions accepts any number of arguments.

*'''=''' returns '''t''' if all arguments are numbers of the same value and '''nil''' otherwise. Due to imprecise nature of floating-point numbers it is not advised to use '''=''' on them. 

*'''/=''' returns '''t''' if all arguments are numbers of ''different'' value. Note that &lt;code&gt;(/= a b c)&lt;/code&gt; is not always the same as &lt;code&gt;(not (= a b c))&lt;/code&gt;.

*'''&lt;''', '''&lt;=''', '''&gt;''', '''&gt;=''' check if their arguments are in the appropriate monotonous order. These functions can't be applied to complex numbers for obvious reasons.

*'''max''' and '''min''' return the largest and the least of their arguments, respectively.

==Numeric type manipulation==
These functions are used to convert numbers from one type to another.

*'''floor''', '''ceiling''', '''truncate''', '''round''' take two arguments: ''number'' and ''divisor'' and return ''quotient'' (an integer) and ''reminder''=''number''-''quotient''*''divisor''. The method for choosing the quotient depends on the function. '''floor''' chooses the largest integer that is not greater than ''ratio''=''number''/''divisor'', '''ceiling''' chooses the smaller integer that is larger than ''ratio'', '''truncate''' chooses the integer of the same sign as ''ratio'' with the largest absolute value that is less than absolute value of ''ratio'', and '''round''' chooses an integer that is closest to ''ratio'' (if there are two such numbers, an even integer is chosen). ''Note'': these functions return two values (see [[Programming:Common Lisp/Multiple values|Multiple values]]).
*'''ffloor''', '''fceiling''', '''ftruncate''', '''fround''' are the same as above but the ''quotient'' is converted to the same float type as ''number''.
*('''mod''' a b) returns the second value of ('''floor''' a b).
*('''rem''' a b) returns the second value of ('''truncate''' a b).
*'''float''' converts its first argument (a real) to a float. It may be useful to avoid slow operations with rational numbers (see example 1). The second optional argument may be supplied, which must be float - it will be used as a ''prototype''. The result would be of the same floating-point type as a prototype.
*'''rational''' and '''rationalize''' convert a real number to rational. When this number is a float '''rational''' returns a rational number that is mathematically equivalent to float. '''rationalize''' approximates the floating-point number. The former function usually produces ratios with a huge denominator so it's not as useful as you may think.
*'''numerator''' and '''denominator''' return the corresponding parts of a rational number.
*'''complex''' creates a complex number from its real part and imaginary part. Functions '''realpart''' and '''imagpart''' return real and imaginary part of a number.

==Predicates related to numbers==
Predicate returns a non-nil result if it's true and '''nil''' if it is false.
*'''zerop''' - the number is zero (there may be several zeros in Lisp - integer zero, real zero, complex zero, there may be negative zeros too).
*'''plusp''', '''minusp''' - the real number is positive/negative.
*'''evenp''', '''oddp''' - the integer is odd/even. 
*'''integerp''' - the number is integer (of the type '''integer''' - see type tree above).
*'''floatp''' - the number is float.
*'''rationalp''' - the number is rational.
*'''realp''' - the number is real.
*'''complexp''' - the number is complex.

__NOTOC__
'''Pumpkin bread''' is a type of quick bread that's popular in the United States in October and November when fresh pumpkins are in season. There are countless variations.

Although pumpkin bread and other pumpkin recipes are closely associated with [[cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] cuisine, these foods have a lengthy pre-Columbian history in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountainstudies.org/databank/history/Anasazi.htm History of the Anasazi]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native Americans tribes developed their own pumpkin-based recipes prior to the arrival of European settlers in the New World. Native tribes taught those settlers how to dry pumpkin flesh and grind it into a meal for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art24245.asp The history of pumpkin as a food on BellaOnline]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pumpkin based foods are so old in North America that archaeologists have found pumpkin remnants among the 800-year-old ruins of the Anasazi in the southwestern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art24245.asp The history of pumpkin as a food on BellaOnline]&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a pumpkin bread recipe that's very easy as long as you use canned pumpkin. You can use fresh pumpkin, if you prefer, but you'll have to put a lot of work into cutting, boiling, peeling and mashing.

== Some Notes ==
If you plan on cooking this recipie in a bundt pan, you'll want to cover your pan for it to cook right. This will almost fill a standard aluminum bundt pan. In my gas oven, it needed almost exactly the full cooking time, and came out nice and moist.

This recipie may need some cloves, possibly a teaspoon of ground cloves.

Update: I just tried this recipe again. Didn't cover the bundt pan, but it didn't seem to need it in my fiancee's oven. I used only 3/4 cup of oil and added about 1/8 tsp of cloves, and it came out perfect. Yes, I know my IP is different; I've changed service packages twice since 2010.

'''Hot water crust''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]] used for savory [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]]s, such as pork pie and steak and kidney pie. As it contains [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], it is unsuitable for [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarians]]. Vegetable fat or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]] can be substituted in equal measure, but the texture will be slightly different (and mouth-feel will be somewhat lighter) due to the &quot;grain&quot; of lard. 

== Ingredients ==

* 170g (6 oz) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 170ml (6 fl oz) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 85g (3 oz) [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
* [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
# Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre.
# Place the water and lard into a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] over low heat. When the lard has melted, bring to a boil.
# Pour the mixture into the centre of the flour.
# Working very quickly, mix with a wooden spoon.
# Knead with hands to produce a smooth dough.
# This pastry must be used while still warm; otherwise it will become brittle and hard to mould.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Sometimes an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg yolk]] is added to the flour and salt mixture.
* To shape the dough for a small pie, the bottom of a jam jar works well.

Has anyone actually had success with this recipe? I think someone might have messed things up when converting between volumes (i.e, cups) to weights (the current ounces). I tried using this recipe recently and the crust was way too soft; it wouldn't hold any sort of shape. Other recipes on the Internet have a much larger ratio of flour and lard to water. For instance, [http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-make-melton-mowbray-pork-pie this recipe] uses 16 oz flour, 6 oz lard and 3.5 oz milk. That's about a 6:1 ratio of flour:liquid, compared to the current 1:1 - which I think is a glaring disparity. Perhaps someone who's successfully made a hot water crust pastry before should look at this recipe?

'''Butter tea''', known as ''Po Cha'', is a traditional drink of the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibetans]] and is also consumed in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Bhutan|Bhutan]]. Butter tea is an indispensable part of Tibetan life. Before work, a Tibetan will down several bowlfuls of this tangy beverage, and it is always served to guests. Since butter is the main ingredient, butter tea is a very warming drink and a good antidote to the cold, so it is especially suited to high altitudes. 

According to the Tibetan custom, butter tea is drunk in separate sips, and after each sip the host refills the bowl to the brim. Thus the guest never drains his bowl yet it is constantly topped up. If the visitor does not wish to drink, the best thing to do is leave the tea untouched until the time comes to leave and then drain the bowl. In this way etiquette is observed and the host will not be offended. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 tablespoon regular [[Cookbook:Tea|black tea]] (preferably [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Nepal|Nepalese]] or [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]])
* 3 cups whole [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (or 1½ cup &quot;half-and-half&quot;/&quot;cereal&quot; [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] + 1½ cup water)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

== Procedure == 
# Boil tea with milk for 2-10 min, depending upon the strength of tea desired
# Strain into tea cups. 
# Add butter and salt. Stir thoroughly - ideally by carefully using a blender - and serve. Makes two servings.

It is the most disgusting drink I've ever tasted. Please try it only if you want a bad taste in your mouth. I had to have lemon tea over it to mask the bad taste. It does not taste like tea, nor does it have much a butter flavour. I guess you'd have to get used to it to enjoy it. {{User:Nichalp/sg}} 15:12, September 9, 2005 (UTC)

'''Boilo''' is a traditional Yuletide drink of the north-eastern United States, specifically  Pennsylvania.

Boilo is a type of whiskey-based liqueur made with oranges, lemons, sugar and various different spices such as cinnamon.  Recipes vary and may include nutmeg, cloves, caraway seed and aniseed.

== Ingredients == 
* 2 medium-large [[cookbook:orange|orange]]s 
* 2 [[cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s
* 1 small box [[cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s (about 1½ ounces [40g])
* 8 oz (220g) [[cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 12 oz (355 mL) [[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Whisky, whiskey|whiskey]] or more, to taste. Use a whiskey that is at least 80 proof (40% alcohol).
* ½ to 1 teaspoon each of any or all of these spices: [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[cookbook:clove|cloves]], [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seed]], [[Cookbook:Anise|aniseed]]

==Procedure==
#Make this in a [[Cookbook:Crock Pot|crock pot]]. It's easier than cooking on the stove and much less likely to overcook or scorch. For the quantities shown here, a small (1.5 quart) crock pot will do.
#Peel the oranges and lemons. Cut up the fruit and squeeze them into the crock pot. A [[Cookbook:Garlic Press|garlic press]] or [[Cookbook:Potato-ricer|potato-ricer]] works, or some kind of juicer or fruit squeezer. Put the remaining fruit pulp into the crock pot as well.
#Add the raisins, honey, and spices. Stir.
#*NOTE: do not add whiskey yet!
#Start the crock pot and let the mixture cook for about 2-4 hours. Stir occasionally. It's complete when the fruit pulp gets cooked down.
#Strain into a pitcher. Mash down the fruit in the strainer to get all the liquid. Now add the whiskey to the pitcher and stir. If you cook the whiskey, even for a short time, the alcohol will start to evaporate . Taste, and add more whiskey to your liking.
#Serve hot in shot glasses, espresso cups, or coffee mugs. After the first round, each individual serving can be heated in the microwave.
#This recipe makes about 12 ounces (355 mL) of &quot;virgin&quot; boilo. Add 12 ounces of whiskey to this and you get 24 ounces (710 mL) of coal region nectar, enough for 12-18 servings.

== Introduction ==

Internet is bringing sweeping changes in most of our daily activities. It is offering access to news, banking services, business opportunities, mails, educational facilities and technology online at our desktops, laptops, and mobile phones. This has changed the overall ways and means, mode and methods of information dissemination. Here the only mantra is how fast the information can be sent to the end users. Like other fields, in the field of library and information science too it has made a great impact. It has changed the overall concept of libraries, role of librarians and has shown the library professionals how the information can be disseminated to their clientele at minimum cost, effort and time. With the fast growth and easy accessibility to internet, libraries either now or in the near future have to develop their own homepages to meet the wide information requirements of their clientele. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2 WEBSITE: its Definition

A web page is an electronic document, written in computer language called HTML, which can be viewed in the computer screen by using the Internet. A website, Web site or WWW site (often shortened to just site) is a collection of Web pages - that is, HTML/XHTML documents accessible generally via HTTP on the Internet; all publicly accessible websites in existence comprise the World Wide Web. The pages of a website will be accessed from a common root URL, the homepage, and usually reside on the same physical server. The homepage may be the only or the first page of a website, or may act as a guide to various carefully planned sections of a large professionally designed site. 

The technical definition of a website is that it is a distinct location on the Internet, identified by an IP address that returns a response code of 200 and a webpage in response to an HTTP request for the root page. The website consists of all interrelated webpages residing at the IP address. The URLs of the pages organize them into a hierarchy, although the hyperlinks between them control how the reader perceives the overall structure and how the traffic flows between the different parts of the site.

Homepage or Home may refer to: the start page or main web page of a website, the website of a group or individual, the page that is displayed when you enter only a domain name as URL (e.g. http://domain.tld), the URL or local file that is automatically loaded when a web browser starts. To take the visitors to other pages, the home page carries hyperlinks, so that one can jump between them by clicking on a link.

Websites are written in, or dynamically converted to, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and are accessed using a software package called a web browser. Web pages can be viewed on computers or various portable devices (PDAs, cell phones, etc.) that have Internet-capable functionality and an available Internet connection.

Static websites can be created using text editors like Notepad, or WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver. Active Server Pages (ASP), Java Server Pages (JSP) and/or a host of other dynamic web-scripting languages can also be used to generate web pages. Static content may also be dynamically generated periodically or if certain conditions for regeneration occur, (cached) to avoid the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection basis.

Dynamic HTML also provides for user interactivity and real-time element updating within web pages (ie - pages don't have to be loaded or reloaded to effect any changes), mainly using the DOM and JavaScript - support for which is built-in to most modern browsers.

A website also requires software known as an HTTP Server. Two very common examples include Apache, the most commonly used web server software used on the Internet (according to Netcraft statistics), and Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS). Often websites may include content that is pulled from one or more databases or using XML-based technologies such as RSS.
--------------------------------------------------------

3 LIBRARY WEBSITE: NEED AND PURPOSE 

The Library's website is built within the context of its hosting institution. It reflects the mission, objectives, and resources of the public library. “A library website is a virtual library service that should be no different than a fixed library facility, a clean well-lighted place filled with services and information for library users.” (Anderson: www.wiredlibrarian.com/htmlw/htmlfront.htm). The public library website &quot;statement of purpose&quot; should align with overall public library mission or philosophy. Many websites have their mission statements on an &quot;about this site&quot; or &quot;background&quot; page. The purpose of the public library's website mirrors a few of the Libraries' goals in the Strategic Plan (ie - learning, teaching, and scholarship). It emphasizes access and communication. Explore the statements below. These kinds of purpose statements can be found on many sites. One can use these to formulate his/her own statement of purpose.

3.1 Easy to understand: The visual or graphical information system of library website is more popular as compared to text based information system.

3.2 Shifting of the environment: Today’s generation heavily uses online shopping, banking and news reading, amongst other activities. They also prefer to transfer those experiences to other actions in their lives. This increases their expectation about the functionality of a library website and how one interacts with it. The new generation user may only be happy when they will be able to read from the computer screen.

3.3 Multiple function of same information: In the case of library websites which utilise hypertext, it is possible to structure and organize the same digital information in a variety of ways which serve multiple functions. 

3.4 Information explosion: A library website is expected to be able to handle the problem of information explosion in some way. It will be able to handle and manage large amounts of digital content by simply providing links - without actually procuring the document. 

3.5 Information retrieval: By using a library website, one will be able to retrieve specific information - for example, a particular image, photo, a definition and so on. Supplementary access to the library's resources, such as the online catalog and databases, its collections, services, and staff may also be available.

3.6 Distance learning: Provide a &quot;library without walls&quot; that can be accessed 24/7, anytime, anywhere, for example - from home, office or other places which are convenient to the user. 

3.7 To procure online publication: More and more information is going to be published over internet. A library website needs to be able to procure the online publication, such as electronic book, electronic journal and to provide links to important sources of information.

3.8 Facilitate the public library's mission of learning and teaching: improve information literacy, promote life-long learning, reading and literacy.

3.9 Communications channel: Through the library website, the user can have access to reference assistance at any time and from anywhere. 

3.10 Online help: Encourages positive, productive experiences - both in and out of the library - for children and young adults. Supports the sharing of student work and curriculum needs of teachers and research scholars.

3.11 Wide range of services: Provide access to community information with a wide range of other services, such as downloading of catalog records, reading and so forth.

3.12 Psychological need: Library users are changing and technology continues to evolve. Education is adapting to these changes and libraries need to anticipate the effect of these changes 
	-----------------------------------------------------

4. USERS OF LIBRARY WEBSITE
The primary audiences of the public library website are the general public - for example, children, students, teachers, researchers, faculty and staff of the public library. These people expect the website to help them facilitate their learning, teaching, and scholarships. The following tiers of users can be enumerated and ranked as the website's primary audiences with the understanding that services and collections created for lesser tiered audiences should not detract from the functionality and usability of services and collections of higher tiered audiences. Below is a list of possible audiences for public library websites. 

I). Students, teachers, scholars, administrators and board members of local schools. 
II). Parents and local community members.
III). Students, T=teachers, A=administrators and board members from other areas.
IV). People from outside the community or locality.
V). Staff of the particular library.
VI). People who arrive at library website site through a search for an unrelated topic.
VII). Users from all over the world, in other words - everybody else.

------------------------------------------------------------

5. LIBRARY WEBSITE: PROBLEMS IN DEVELOPMENT

In the Internet era, for a library to be recognized and its services to be made available globally, the creation of library website is indispensable. However, the huge costs involved in developing the necessary infrastructure such as owning and maintaining the web servers, high bandwidth internet connection, the required software, and the necessary technical knowledge has made it difficult for many libraries - especially in developing countries like India - to take steps in this direction. However, lack of funds or certain infrastructure should not be constraints for owning and designing a library website. With even minimal knowledge of HTML, librarians can develop homepages utilizing the services of web space providers like Geocities, Tripod, Xoom etc. The main problems in developing a library website are:

I) Lack of technically qualified manpower/librarian.
II) Lack of motivation of library staff.
III) Traditional view of the librarian.
IV) Lack of leadership role of the librarian.
V) Lack of common platform.
VI) Lack of funding.

--------------------------------------------------------------
6. PRINCIPLES FOR DESIGNING A LIBRARY WEBSITE:
The following Guiding Principles are suggested for the development of any library's website in order to provide excellent service to all users. These guidelines should be reviewed annually as capabilities are enhanced.

SELF DESCRIBING: The public library website should have enough information for completing a specific task. It should direct where to start, and move within the site's information architecture - in particular with relatiion to interpreting various categories and their labels.

CORRECTLY USE CAMPUS AND LIBRARY INDENTITY STANDARDS: Correct usage of names, logos and seals must be followed. 

INFORMED BY ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH AGENDAS: Wherever appropriate, the Library website design should be informed by the academic programs and research agendas of the campus.
 
PROVIDE TARGETED AND TIMELY RESPONSE: User interfaces should be designed to get users started in the direction most likely to result in success for their current need. The system should provide a response time that is acceptable to the user. 

BASED ON USER-CENTERED DESIGN: Design will be focused on how the user will use the system. This includes user testing and usability studies at the appropriate stages of the design process. 

FACILITATE COMMENT AND FEEDBACK: Users should be able to easily report problems they encounter with interfaces and search engines, databases and applications. Feedback forms should be readily available.
 
PROVIDE ACCESS ON and OFF-CAMPUS: Off-campus access should be as easy as on-campus access for authorized users. 

CONCISE:  Library web pages should be in a brief and concise format. 

CONTINUOUSLY EVALUTED AND UPDATED: To keep the website looking fresh and up-to-date it constantly needs to be reviewed as new capabilities are added. 

INTEGRATE VARIOUS INFORMATION SOURCES: Wherever appropriate, library web pages should provide, to each level of user, a single interface that transparently integrates separate resources (for example, the local catalog, the union catalog, the CDL directory, and perhaps information on / access to Library services). 

MAINTAIN USER TASK CONTEXT: The user interface should keep users informed about where they are in the session and, as much as possible, help them keep their place in the web-based user interfaces. 

MAINTAIN SETTING VISIBILITY: Make objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 

LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PLACES USER HAS TO GO TO SEARCH: Make access to the multitude of electronic resources easy and simple for the user to find. 
ABILITY TO SEARCH THE ENTIRE LIBRARY WEBSITE: (http://www.google.com/services). 

PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE BROWSERS: Access needs to allow for a number of different browsers and versions. 

HAVE ABILITY TO CHECK LINKS TO KEEP BROKEN LINKS TO A MINIMUM: Reduce the number of broken links by having them checked automatically periodically.

JARGON-FREE: The interface should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than using jargon, acronyms, and system-oriented terms. The names of library services and systems or their explanatory labels should reflect what they do. 

ORGANIZED, SIMPLE, AND CLEAN AND SHOW CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION, NAVIGATION, TERMINOLOGY AND CONTENT: To assist users in assessing the information interface should provide useful, consistent navigational tools (eg - navigation bars) that represent the most-used navigational features. Standard language and terminology should be used throughout the website to refer to the same activity or item. 

BROWSING OPTION:  A hierarchical, supplemental, or contextual browsing approach should be provided to user (http:// 42explore.com).

INDEXING:  Provide indexing of the entire website (http://www.boxesandarrow.com/archives/what_is a_control_vocabulary.php)
(http://www.boxesandarrow.com/archives/Creating_a_ Controlled _Vocabulary .php)

PROVIDE TIPS FOR IMPROVING SEARCH RESULTS: Assist users to refine their searches.
 
PROVIDE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON USE: Help screens should be easy to find and search, be focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out and be brief. 

REFER USER TO HUMAN ASSISTANCE: The site should be able to refer a user, who needs more help, to a person. 

COMPLY WITH ALL CAMPUS AND UCOP POLICIES: The library website should comply with all policies and guidelines. Copyright standards should be adhered to. 

COMPLY WITH ALL STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS: The website should comply with the American Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 requirements that information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. 

COMPLY WITH THE WEB content ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES: The website should comply with the web content accessibility guideline as outlined by the W3C http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/full-checklist.html .

DATA SECURITY AND INTEGRITY: All those intending to place information on the server should first seek approval from the authority.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
STEPS IN THE CREATION OF LIBRARY WEBSITE: The creation of homepage/ website and its subsequent hosting involves certain major steps such as signing with the webspace provider, creating contents, uploading the site by using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and so on. Each one of these has to be dealt with carefully to make the website live and interesting.

PLANNING: Why spend the time and effort to create a website that isn't used? All planning must start by exploring the users' information needs. Quality web resources begin with a user investigation that incorporates a wide range of tools to discover the information needs of the target audience. While the website entry page may be designed for a number of audiences, you'll want to focus selections to particular audiences. For example, the section for children should be written at a low reading level and contain developmentally-appropriate materials. A section designed for the elderly might contain larger font sizes to accommodate the visual needs of seniors.

SIGNING WITH THE FREE WEBSPACE PROVIDERS: A whole industry has been created around placing the website. Good placement can mean major increases in visitor traffic, leading to increased site visibility and users. A good number of service providers available on the Internet offer free webspace for developing homepages. The amount of space provided by them varies from company to company. Most of these services are ad-based - in other words, they are sponsored and will therefore have sponsor advertisements on the site. The advertisement may be a banner or a pop-up. It is needless to say that the service providers earn revenue from these advertisements. Therefore, while seeking free service, it becomes mandatory to accept certain conditions posed by the service providers. These ads really will not be distractions and make no much difference as these appear on top of the page or at a corner. There are some services which provide webspace without advertising being featured. However, this should not be the sole criterion for selecting service providers. Main consideration should be the speed, i.e., how fast the service provider's site gets loaded on to the browser and how fast will be the subsequent retrieval.
The following table gives a comparative statement of some of the major service providers.
Table-1
Website	Free Space Per account (in MB)	Advertisement	
www.1freespace.com	50	YES	
www.50megs.com	50	YES	
www.freeservers.com	20	YES	
www.geocities.com	15	YES	
www.netcolony.com	35	YES	
Free.prohosting.com	50	NO	
www.tripod.com	11	YES	
www.webjump.com	25	YES	
 A detailed comparative study of various service providers can be had from the website http://www.freewebspace.net, which eases the selection process.
On signing the agreement with the service provider, one can get user name and a password of one's choice. This user name later becomes the web address of a site on the internet. It is also known as URL (Uniform/Universal Resource Locator). 
An URL may look like: http://www.geocities.com/library/index.htm.
 
 CONTENTS ANALYSIS FOR THE WEBSITE:
After signing with the service provider, one has to create contents for library's homepage. However, people who are familiar with HTML can even keep the homepage ready before signing. There are certain tools, which can be had from the service providers if one is not acquainted with HTML. According to Eric Anderson, web developers should keep three simple ideas in mind: (1) keep it current, (2) develop as much local content as possible, and (3) make it interactive for your users.
           The library website should reflect the mission and the needs of  users. The content of the website is not very much different from the content of traditional, physical libraries, and therefore it contains tools to access bibliographic information, access to digital library services and collections, instructions for pedagogy, and last but not least, access to people who can help with all these processes -- librarians. The website is not designed to be comprehensive list of resources. Instead, it is designed to highlight the most significant resources and provide starting points for learning and research. The content of the website is very much like the content of traditional library pathfinders. 
It should be noted the things articulated in this dissertation were not conceived of arbitrarily. Analysis of existing strategic planning documents, extensive focus group interviews, surveys, usability tests, and many discussions with as many people as possible have all played a significant part in the creation of this document's content and so all these are should be consider before determine the content of a public library website. 
To start with, one can include the following information:
1. Brief introduction about library
2. Working hours
3. Details about Collection
4. List of Current journals
5. Journal Holdings list (Back volumes)
6. Monthly additions 
7. Staff
8. Services
9. Databases available etc.
10. Links to other sites (with a disclaimer)


IMPLEMENTATION 
	To create a homepage with above-mentioned contents, one needs to have an HTML editor. These editors are popularly called as WYSIWYG editors. These editors basically hide HTML codes and make creation of HTML pages a simple process just like word processing documents.  Netscape composer or Front Page Express can also be used to create a HTML page. These come along with Netscape and Internet Explorer respectively. The HTML pages can also be created using MS-WORD. People who are familiar with HTML are recommended to use text editors such Norton Editor, EDIT or NOTEPAD and then insert the HTML commands to get the desired output. 
	Whenever possible, the data transferred from the Web server to the browser will be in the form of XHTML documents. By adhering to the XHTML standards the Libraries will reap all the benefits of XML, namely, separation of presentation from content, compatibility with future Web standards, and the ability to reformat content for different purposes and reading devices (http://www.useit.comalertbox/20031222.html)(http://www.webstyleguide.com/site/index.html). 
	In the implementation phase the librarian or website designer can use a builder to create a web site from scratch for getting all necessary help. There are several types of website builders i.e. Online Website Builders, Offline Website Builder Programs etc.
Programs like Dreamweaver or FrontPage  of offline category are very popular among designers. But they are costly and require a learning curve. 

A). Technical Standards: Standards keep the Internet functioning efficiently. There are standards related to hardware, software, graphics, email, and almost everything related to the Internet. For information one can scan the following references
(Adkisson:http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/examining the role of de_facto_standards on the Web.php); (http://www.wigglebits.com/standards.html) (http://www.webstandards.org/).
B). How to pick a memorable website name and file name: When possible, the file names should be very short, and should represent the library and are of memorable value. File names should be less than 8 characters plus a file extension. The file extension can be .htm or .html. It doesn't matter. However it is better to maintain consistency. File names should be all lowercase letters. If you want to separate words use a dash - or underscore _. Your home page should be called index.html or index.htm. 
C). Folders/Directories: Create a folder for your website. Keep all files in this folder. Create subdirectories or additional folders for major areas of your website. The core page for each of these sections should be named index.html.
D). Use HTML and CSS to build web pages: HTML is the language used to build websites. You can do amazing things with so little of it. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can create and control the style of the page (colors, sizes, spacing) but also the layout (the position of text, navigation, graphics). 
E). How much screen should your website use: Some websites that don't use up all of the available space. Building liquid designs fixes this problem of by making the layout fit the screen. 
F). What background colors work best? The rule of thumb is to build a website with dark text on light colored background or white background. Some argue that the background should not be completely white, but just slightly darker. Often, the best choice for a background has proved to be a single color. 
G). How to and build good navigation: All web pages should point back to the home page and any other important &quot;first level&quot; pages. It is better to put links where people expect to see them. Build a horizontal menu bar with 7 or 8 options maximum. Put it at the top of the screen. Create a left hand side menu to list options at deeper levels.
If you have more than three levels, you might consider hiding some of the options from the level above. Listing only local options related to the page people are on. Always keep the main menu visible. Avoid drop down menus.
	Top-down and bottom-up are the two main approaches to building information architectures. In many cases these two approaches are interwoven and occur simultaneously.
For more information on navigation one can consult the following references

H) Browsing: The library website must provide browse using a hierarchical, supplemental, or contexual approach. 
I) How to make the text easier to read: The type of fonts that work best on websites are sans serif. These are simplified type letters created to be very readable at small sizes and on most screens. To make the text attractive to read the librarian should use different sizes and colors for headings, subheadings and paragraphs proves and give plenty of space in between. People should be given provision for increase font size for easier reading. Nearly all browsers have an option to increase text size but only if the web page is designed to allow it. 
J). Why serve information in bite sized chunks? Breaking up the information in smaller paragraphs can greatly cut the time people need to scan the content so rather than using endless paragraphs of information, librarian may consider chunking information into small pieces, Separate paragraphs with spaces and use indentation to show levels of importance. Or, use tables to organize major areas. 
K). Sound: There are many ways to incorporate sound into a page. But the librarian should be sure the sounds attract rather than distract from the content.
L). What graphics to use:  The librarian should accept the fact that words is the core reason people visit their website. Graphics should be used only when they are essential to communicate something that is not possible to with words alone. Avoid using graphics that have no relation to the surrounding text. 
M). GIF Animation: The librarian should choose animations that contribute to the theme. For example, he/she might use a rotating globe on the geography page. (http://www.frsd.k12.nj.us/barleylibrary/lib/5fingrtst.htm) 
N). What should stand out on each page:  The librarian should create a list of important features to go on every page. He/She should decide which the most important element is.
If the librarian want visitors to look at the special announcement, then it is better to place them in the home page itself.
O). How to use links on your website? People learned early on that links were the blue, underlined phrases you can click on. Visited links were purple. All other text was black. So if possible follow the same line, again the Links should always stand out and be easily distinguished from regular text.
P). Why put load speed above anything else: The library website designer can cut load times to a minimum by Taking out any graphic that doesn't add to the user experience,  
By removing font tags and by using CSS instead to style your text etc. 
Q).How to make websites popular with search engines: Most people use search engines to find the information they want on the web. If the website can get top rankings for keywords that match the content then there is a guaranteed to see a spike in visitor numbers. One way to achive this is to follow the guidelines of W3C. 
2.9.5. VERIFICATION OF THE WEBSITE: After creating the pages, one has to verify the contents and design before finally putting these on the net. This can be done by loading the page(s) on the browser locally. It is necessary to check the results both on Netscape and Internet Explorer and on some other browser as pages may look differently on different browsers and even on different versions of the same browser.

To make the site known to all, it is necessary to submit the site to search engines. This will increase the hits to the site. The submission can be done either automatically or manually. To get best results, it is suggested that submission be done manually to each one of the search engines. 
Automatic submission can be done by using the services of following sites:
http://uswebsites.com/submit
http://www.netcreations.com/postmaster
http://addme.com
Manual submission can be done individually by going to the respective sites of the search engines. The search engines index sites under various categories such as education, business, sports etc. To submit a site one has to click on the option 'Submit your site or Add URL', which in turn asks for URL, category, description and keywords. The category could be 'Education' and then 'Libraries' and all these information need to be typed manually. Some search engines do accept URL without asking for categories. Depending upon the keywords and description given, search engines themselves will put the submitted site under the appropriate category. Important search engines available on the net are:
http://www.google.com
http://www.yahoo.com
http://www.altavista.com
http://www.lycos.com
http://www.infoseek.com
http://www.khoj.com
http://www.indianindex.com
http://www.hotbot.com
Each search engine has its own rules for accepting the sites for indexing. All search engines may not accept sites of all categories. Therefore, one has to do some homework for knowing the policy and specificity. Search engines will take some time to index the submitted site. Hence, it may please be noted that results will not be immediate.
For further reading and help on HTML, webpage design, graphics etc, a list of internet resources has been given in APPENDIX-II

 MANAGEMENT: Management involves a wide range of functions related to website development and can be group into policies, promotion, and staff development.
A).Policies: Policies are essential for a smooth running of public library website.
Rather than building all new policies one can use existing collection development policy. The web resources that librarian choose for inclusion in the library website should meet the guidelines established in the collection development policy. The policies should include collection development policy, Acceptable Use Policy, Licensing Policy, Content Disclaimer etc.
B).Promotion: The librarian will need a plan for website promotion.Like any good promotion, he/she will need a strategy to establish client base, then keep them coming back. The librarian might start with posters, bookmarks, demonstrations, and public service announcements to advertise the library website resources. Next, general people should make aware that new things are being posted all the time. Posting student projects, user comments, and other local materials are a good way to generate interest. 
C). Staff Involvement: Everyone on the library staff should be familiar with the content and use of the website. Although not everyone will be developing and posting pages themselves, everyone should be encouraged to play a role in the success of the materials. From content development to checking links, there is many ways staff members can help. A truly interactive website may require a number of ongoing responsibilities such as checking email, monitoring discussion groups, or checking online registrations or scheduling. In order for staff to play an active role, the librarian may need to set up training sessions. He/she can do the same with student workers.

MAINTENANCE: The librarian will need a mechanism in place to handle the ongoing needs of library website including new content, revisions and link rot. There’s nothing more frustrating for users than link rot. This occurs when URLs become outdated or change. The librarian can explore each of the following ways to deal with link rot and other similar problem.

 EVALUATION OF THE LIBRARY WEBSITE

The library WebPages should be modified and expanded, rename and gives a prominent place on the home page based upon its evaluation by the user. A particular department within the public library must assign the jobs of continuous evaluation of the Public Library website with a whole lot of help from user community, faculty, staff, and Libraries employees of the public library. For example, user community, faculty, and staff will be regularly enlisted for the purpose of focus group interviews and usability studies. According to E.A.Dupis for the evaluation of the library homepage “call it what they’ll understand and put it where they’ll find it” (Cox, Suellen and Housewright, Elizabeth: 2001, Pp.3) 

 Libraries must have good understanding of its audience before it can be re-created,. 

 CONCLUSION

Users don't notice when a website works well for them because they're too busy taking in the information they came for. They do notice, however, when the pages take too long to load, the text is hard to read, that top right image is blinking all the time and they have no idea where to go next. In the above description an effort has only been made to describe how a basic library homepage can be created at minimum cost without investing on webservers and related softwares. This may not be an exhaustive article where- in one may find every thing on web page development under one roof. Future development of homepage can be done by using other programming languages and software such as JAVA, PERL, WWWISIS, ISEARCH etc.</text>

'''''Bua Loi''''' or '''Thai Rice Balls in Coconut Milk'''

== Ingredients ==
* 3 cups (700g) [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|glutinous rice flour]]
* 1.5 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Pandan Essence|pandan essence]]
* 4 cups (950ml) [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut cream]]
* 2 cups (480g) [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon (5ml) [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 3 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s (optional)

== Procedure ==
# Mix the rice flour with enough water to make a stiff paste. The pandan essence should be added to the water before mixing with the rice flour. [[cookbook:Knead|Knead]] well and then form pea-sized balls.
# Bring a large pot of water to a [[cookbook:boil|boil]], toss in the balls and remove when they float to the surface. Drain. 
# Bring half the coconut cream to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent it from separating, then add the flour balls. 
# When the mixture returns to a boil, remove from heat and stir in the remaining coconut cream.
# Serve as dessert in small bowls. Thais often add [[Cookbook:Maize|sweet corn]] kernels to the final product.

If serving this dish with eggs, in a separate saucepan bring water to a boil and reduce heat, crack eggs one at a time into the water. When eggs are done, remove from water and set aside. One egg should be added to each bowl prior to serving.

With the &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; element you can define, as the name says, code. This could be any code, [[Subject:PHP scripting language|PHP]], [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]], [[HTML]] anything. Anywhere you have some code in a line of text you should use a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; element to indicate it, e.g.

The &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element must contain exactly one &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element.

Using the element consistently allows you to specify a special layout in [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] for code.

If you are writing an article that uses code you will probably want to use the related elements:
; var : a variable in computer code;
; kbd : text the reader should type at the keyboard;
; samp : sample output from a program or script.

== Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;?php echo 'Hello World!';?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Multi-line blocks of code should be wrapped in a &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; element to preserve formatting.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;
  // Prints the authors' names as
  //  surname, forename
  for (Iterator i = authorList.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    Person author = (Person)i.next();
    System.out.println(author.surname() + &quot;, &quot; + author.forename());
  }
 &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==

This is an attempt to create a HTML Tag reference to offer an alternative to the W3Schools one, preferable a better one of course :D. I have checked it on the W3Schools site, and you are allowed to link to any of their pages, as long as you don't embed it in an iframe or something (which we don't). I have also created the Standard Attributes List, as to provide information about those.
Here's how a tag page is built up:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
== Use ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''Here some information about what this tag can be used for''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Example ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''An example of the tag in use, preferably with as many attributes as possible''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Required attributes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

====&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A required attribute''&lt;nowiki&gt;====&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
...&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Optional attributes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

====&lt;/nowiki&gt;''An optional attribute''&lt;nowiki&gt;====&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== Standard attributes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

====[[HTML Standard Attributes List: &lt;/nowiki&gt;''A standard attribute''|''A standard attribute''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]====&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

== More info ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A link to a page with more info, then the name of the site the info came from (i.e. W3Schools).''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

[[Category: HTML Tag List|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''First letter of tag''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

[[nl: HTML:_&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Tag name''&lt;nowiki&gt;-tag]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Dutch Wikibooks is also busy on a tag list, that's what the link at the bottom points to. They haven't finished it yet, but at least when it is, the link will point there. [[User:Vincentt|Vincentt]] 13:28, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

==Merger==

This module has once been the book &quot;HTML Tag List&quot;, intended to be a ''reference''. It has been merged on 4 June 2006 with the present book, originally called &quot;HTML Programming&quot;, now called &quot;HyperText Markup Language&quot;, which is intended and currently structured and written as a ''user guide''. This merger of two completely different kinds of works is going to create problems; the two kinds of materials use different organizing principles. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 12:06, 14 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The process of woodturning is not without its dangers. Some are fairly obvious, some less so. Some may result in short term minor injuries, some may be much more serious, and others may cause long-term health problems that may not be apparent for many years.

The purpose of this chapter is to highlight these dangers and make recommendations to minimize or remove the risk. Ultimately, safety is the individual's responsiblity and will depend largely on both their knowledge and attitude. If in doubt seek proper training or advice.


* As with any rotating machinery, the operator must take care not to let their clothing, hair or jewelry get caught by the machine or wood.
* Work pieces must be securely attached to the lathe before turning it on.
* Make sure that the workpiece can be fully rotated without hitting the lathe bed, toolrest, banjo or other objects around the lathe.
* Workpieces must be of sound material that will not break while being shaped. Wearing a face mask is recommended.
* Tools must be supported by the toolrest before contacting the wood.
* Beware of turning wood which is not perfectly round. Irregular edges turn to a nearly invisible blur when spinning. Examples include work not yet roughed down to a round, or natural edge. Some chucks may pose a similar hazard.
* Wood dust of any type can cause problems with the respiratory system, skin or eyes. Some woods are toxic and present even worse hazards. Dust extraction and dust masks or respirators are recommended.
* Many finishes use solvents that are dangerous, either through skin contact or inhalation of fumes. 
* Many finishes cure by polymerisation which is an exothermic chemical reaction. Rags used for applying these finishes should be disposed of so they cannot spontaneously combust and cause a fire.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blood Pressure is the pressure that blood exerts on the wall of the blood vessels. The pressure originates in the contraction of the [[../Heart|heart]], in turn, forcing blood out of the heart and into the blood vessels. The concept is more mechanical than biochemical.

There are two mechanisms that take place in the heart, Diastole and Systole. Diastole is the relaxation of the chambers of the heart whereas Systole is the contraction of the heart chambers. This is regulated through measuring your blood pressure of which the normal blood pressure should be around 120/80 to be accounted for at a safe level. The figure 120 is measured through Systole and the 80 accounts for Diastole. The Systolic Pressure will show the pressure that your heart emits when blood is forced out of the heart, whereas Diastolic Pressure is the pressure that your heart shows when it's relaxing. This is the main mechanism by which blood pressure operates.

'''
It is the part of nervous system concerned with the receiving of stimulus and sending those signals to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) for interpretation and action.

== Components==

Sensory system consists of two main parts, peripheral &amp; central.

Peripheral portion of the sensory system consists of:
* '''receptors''': the part which senses the stimuli it can the peripheral terminals of the primary Aferants spatially in pain sensation. The activation of these receptors will discharge the primary Aferant neurons.
* '''Primary Aferant neurons''': They are  peripheral Neurons that transmit the signals of stimuli in the form of action potential to the central portions of sensory system.
Central portion of the sensory system consists of: 
* '''nuclei &amp; ganglions of the spinal cord &amp; sensory nuclei &amp; ganglions of cerebral nerves'''.They amplitude the signals to the upper portions or altered sensations.
* '''Secondary Aferants'''. They are neurons in the central nerves system that transmit Aferant signals to the upper regions in the brain.
* '''The sensory regions of the brain'''. They process incoming signals and make sensations ultimately.

== Function ==
# Reception of impulses from environment as well as from within the body
# Conversion of impulses in the form of action potential
# Transmission of action potential through nerves to the [[../Central Nervous System|central nervous system]]

===Guiding Principles &amp; Policy Framework===

====General Guiding Principles====
:'''Status--'''  No specific tasks to implement these general principles have been identified by the Georgia Water Council.

The Council believes the following principles (from the work of the [[Georgia Water/Georgia Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committe|JCWPSC]]) should guide the development of the State Water Plan:
#Effective water resources management protects health and the safety and welfare of Georgia’s citizens;
#Water resources are managed in a sustainable manner so that current and future generations have access to adequate supplies of quality water that supports both human and natural systems;
#All citizens have a stewardship responsibility to conserve and protect the water resources of Georgia;
#Water management efforts recognize that economic prosperity and environmental quality are interdependent;
#Water quality and quantity and surface and ground water are interrelated and require integrated planning as well as reasonable and efficient use;
#A comprehensive and accessible database must be developed to provide sound scientific and economic information upon which effective water management decisions can be based;
#Water resources management encourages local/regional innovation, implementation, adaptability, and responsibility for watershed and river basin management;
#Sound water resources management involves meaningful participation, coordination, and cooperation among interested and affected stakeholders and citizens, as well as all levels of governmental and other entities managing or utilizing water
#Periodic revisions of the comprehensive statewide water management plan may be required to accommodate new scientific and policy insights as well as changing social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors.

====Current Statutory, Regulatory, and Water Management Policy Framework====
:The Law Department would be enlisted to provide a description of Georgia’s current water quality and water quantity management statutory framework. A description of Georgia’s water quantity management statutory framework – produced by the Law Department - has already been completed for other purposes, and may require editing for inclusion in a State Water Plan.  Additionally advice and guidance should be sought from the governor’s legal counsel.  As the State agency with principal water management regulatory responsibilities, EPD would be assigned the task of describing the current regulatory requirements related to the statutory framework completed by the Law Department. Before completing this section, EPD would seek input from other State government entities having water management responsibilities under Georgia law.

====Guidance on Water Public Policy Issues====
:'''Status--''' No task has been initiated.
:('''[[Statewide Water Resources Management Plan for Georgia:Comments#Sub-state Guidance on Policy Issues|Comments]]''')


===Planning Standards===
:'''Status--''' No task has been initiated.
:('''[[Statewide Water Resources Management Plan for Georgia:Comments#Planning Standards|Comments]]''')


===Executive Summary of Sub-State Components of State Water Plan===
:This section of the “State Components” of the Plan would provide an executive summary of each of the sub-state components of the State Plan. Such a summary will not be possible for many of the sub-state components until some time after completion of the “State Components”; however as the State Plan must be a ‘living’ document, these substate executive summaries can/should be added whenever the sub-state plans have been completed.
:This summary might also generally address itself to an appropriate subset – or all - of the [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/issues.php 42 issues] the [[Georgia Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committee|JWSC]] identified during the conduct of its work.  '''Status--''' A subset of the 42 issues has been identified.  [[Georgia Water/Statewide Plan/Technical Advisory Committees|Technical Advisory Committees]] are being set up to address some of these issues.

== Introduction ==
You may have heard various people talk about HDR images. (WETA, Lucas, even Tim Sweeny). HDR images are part of a technology called HDRi which stands for &quot;High Dynamic Range (image)&quot;. So... what on earth does that mean?

Here's a link to Wikipedia's article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging the HDR format] which I personally give all my credit to Paul Debevec for putting it to use for computer graphics purposes. Anyway, before you start trying to understand the usefulness of HDRi, please read the wikipedia link.

Also, visit [http://www.debevec.org Paul Debevec's website] if you've got some more time to spare.

To sum up the excitement of HDR CG, think of it like the hype of the next-generation videogames that are about to come out, except set the stage for 1996 instead of 2006. Paul Debevec pioneered paralax mapping, HDR lighting, image-based modeling, his latest work includes some even more amazing technologies, and for the record he's my hero too.

To use HDRi images for 3D rendering, you need something called a [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating a Light Probe|light probe]]...

== Definitions == 

;HDRI:
[[File:Ball3 1 2.jpg|300px|right|HDR image file example]]
HDRI stands for '''High Dynamic Range Imaging''', and is basically an image format that contains from the deepest shadow up to the brightest highlight information. While an 'ordinary' digital image contains only 8 bits of information per color (red, green, blue) which gives you 256 gradations per color, the HDR image format stores the 3 colors with floating point accuracy. Thus the 'depth' from dark to light per color is virtually unlimited.
Using HDR images in a 3D environment will result in very realistic and convincing shadows, highlights and reflections. This is very important for realistic emulation of chrome for example.

;Light Probe:
A Light Probe is a HDR image containing 360 by 360 degrees ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle solid angle] 4π [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian steradians]) image information. In other words : it's a 360 degree spherical panorama image, not only looking around the horizon, but also up and down. Thus a Light Probe image contains all visible information as can be seen from a specific point, wherever you turn your head.

== Usage ==
Given that a Light Probe image is an 'all around' image with a high dynamic range, it's the perfect solution for your 'world' background, especially for a 3D animation.

== Quick Tutorial ''(for experienced blendies)'' ==

First of all, you'll need an HDR image. There is a whole range at http://debevec.org/Probes/ that you can download for free. (There are even more at http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=24038 ). I will use the St. Peter's Basilica probe, but any other HDR image will do just fine.

To apply the HDRI environment to your scene:

* Go to the shading settings (press F5) and click the World button.
* Enable &quot;Real&quot; to force the horizon to stay still, as opposed to follow the camera
* If you're rendering with Blender Internal (ver. 2.49), go to &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot; tab and activate &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot;, then activate &quot;Sky Texture&quot;. Skip this step if you're using external renderers.
* In the &quot;Texture and Input&quot; tab, click &quot;Add New&quot; and &quot;Angmap&quot;.
* Then go to the &quot;Map To&quot; tab and deactivate &quot;Blend&quot; and activate &quot;Hori&quot;.
* Now go to the Texture settings (press F6) and change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Image&quot;.
* Click the &quot;Load Image&quot; button and locate your HDR image.
* If you're using YafRay or other external renderers, you need to turn on Global Illumination and to set the quality to something other than &quot;none&quot;.

== Step-by-step Tutorial ==

===Build a simple scene===
To see the advantage of using a 360 by 360 world image, the simplest example to demonstrate this is a scene with a mirrored sphere.
[[File:Blender 3D Scene.jpg|frame|Scene]]
#Add a sphere and a cube to your scene and place them in a bit of an interesting position. (note that I added a second lamp to light up the shadow part of the cube)
#Perhaps give the cube a different color than the default grey.
[[Image:Blender_HDR_Mirror.jpg|frame|Material setting for a mirror surface and a preview of it]]
#Give the sphere a mirrored material : go to the '''Shading -&gt; Material''' panel (F5) and find the '''Mirror Trans''' buttons.
#Check that '''Ray Mirror''' button is pressed. If it is not, check it.
#Set the '''RayMir''' value to a value of 0.5 or higher. Your preview should show the reflection of the checkboard environment.

===Render with HDR (Blender Internal v2.49)===
#Download a HDR image (see Paul Debevec's website)
#Go to the shading settings (press F5) and click the World button.
[[Image:Blender_HDR_AngMap.jpg|frame|AngMap enabled]]
#Go to &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot; tab and activate &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot;, then make sure &quot;Raytrace&quot; is chosen as gather method, and activate &quot;Sky Texture&quot; 
#Adjust quality settings:
##Increasing number of samples reduces noise, but increases render times
##Adaptive QMC is faster, but generates more noise than Constant QMC
#In the &quot;Texture and Input&quot; tab, click &quot;Add New&quot; and &quot;Angmap&quot;
#Then go to the &quot;Map To&quot; tab and deactivate &quot;Blend&quot; and activate &quot;Hori&quot;.
#Now go to the Texture settings (press F6) and change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Image&quot;.
#Click the &quot;Load Image&quot; button and locate your HDR image.

===Render with HDR (Blender Internal v2.69)===
#Download a HDR image (see Paul Debevec's website)
#Go to Properties tab and click the World button.In the World Section check the &quot;Real Sky&quot; Button
#(optional)Go to &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot; section and activate &quot;Ambient Occlusion&quot;, then make sure &quot;Raytrace&quot; is chosen as gather method in Gather section&quot; 
#(optional)Adjust quality settings:
##Increasing number of samples reduces noise, but increases render times
##Adaptive QMC is faster, but generates more noise than Constant QMC
#In the Properties tab click Texture button-&gt;then click on 'show world texture'-&gt;then select type as 'image or movie'-&gt;then in mapping section select coordinates as 'Angmap'-&gt;then in in influence section uncheck the 'blend' button and check the 'horizon' button.
#In the Image section click on open button and locate your HDR image and Load it.

===Render with YafRay===
#Download a HDR image (see Paul Debevec's website).
#Go to the shading settings (press F5) and click the World button.
#In the &quot;Texture and Input&quot; tab, click &quot;Add New&quot; and &quot;Angmap&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff0000&quot;&gt;Note that the Angmap button is the important thing to tell Blender that this file is a Light Probe file !&lt;/span&gt;
#Then go to the &quot;Map To&quot; tab and deactivate &quot;Blend&quot; and activate &quot;Hori&quot;.
#Now go to the Texture settings (press F6) and change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Image&quot;.
#Click the &quot;Load Image&quot; button and locate your HDR image.
(optional step, as it was not needed for my setup :)
:5. Press F10 and change the &quot;Blender Internal&quot; to &quot;YafRay&quot;.  You need to turn on Global Illumination and to set the quality to something other than &quot;none&quot;. Note that the YafRay renderer does not come standard with the Blender installation. You need to download and install this separately.
Your result should look like this: (Rendering: left with Blender, right with YafRay) Click for larger version&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Blender_HDR_Result.jpg|300px]][[Image:Blender_HDR_YafRay_Result.jpg|300px]]&lt;br/&gt;
Note that the reflecting ball reflects the whole interior from every angle, even though we added just a single image to the World settings !&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Disclaimer:  While this method is reasonably likely to get a mechanical watch running again, it is also likely to cause greatly increased wear if the watch is run much afterwards.  I recommend this in limited circumstances only.  One is to sort watches--If you can get a watch running with this, a standard clean/lube/regulate will very likely put the watch in good condition.  The other situation is when a watch would be interesting, but even in good running condition would not be worth the cost of a servicing.  

With that in mind--Many watches can be resurrected by oiling the critical friction surfaces that are accessible without disassembly.  If you can get an oiler to the escape wheel, a drop of oil on each of about 3 teeth will be the most likely to revive the watch.  Be extremely careful--you will be working in the area of the most fragile parts of the watch.  Additionally, oil to each of the visible pivot jewels can help.

The light probe is, in the simplest terms, a photograph of your environment. they work in very much the same way that reflection maps do, and are made the same way.

Equipment:
#A pure silver ball. Try a plastic Christmas tree ball ornament.
#A camera, prefferably digital. If you have a high-end digital camera, you'll have less work ahead.
#A place you'd like to capture the lighting from. Try laying different things in your environment to get a good idea.
#Something to fire the shutter without touching the camera. For digital cameras, Paul Debevec recommends using a program that will take all the pictures for you.
#A tripod.

Set it up like so. Remember that the height of your camera and the height of the ball relative to each other controls the angle at which the horizon will be shot. In other words, shoot the ball at the same angle that you plan to shoot your 3D scene in. If your scene is animated... consider making a similar rig except attaching your reflective ball to a video camera as was done for [[wikipedia:Flight_of_the_Navigator|Flight of the Navigator]].

[[Image:Lightprobe_hardware_diagram.png]]

#Note that the diagram is incorrect.  The camera will see items reflected from behind the sphere as well.
The process:
#Set up your rig and take a series of images with varying exposure times.
#Taking 2 sets of pictures, each offset by 90 degrees, will enable you to get better coverage of the background and eliminate the reflection of the camera taking the picture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scene Summaries==
====Act One : Scene 1====
In a short 16 lines, Shakespeare quickly and effectively sets the scene for this play.
From the first the play is restless and unnatural.

The witches, emblems of darkness and deceit, are the only characters present. They discuss a battle which they ''know'' will be finished shortly, they also ''know'' they will meet Macbeth &quot;upon the heath&quot;, i.e. they have insight into the future. Their unnatural powers are further underlined in the last line of the scene &quot;Hover through the fog and filthy air&quot;

The restlessness and unease of the play as a whole is evoked in the thunder and lightening and the mentions of &quot;hurly burly&quot; and &quot;battle&quot;.

====Act One: Scene 2====
This scene opens with the King Duncan awaiting news of the battle we have just heard the witches discussing. A &quot;bloody man&quot; has just arrived to report. 
What is significant is that Duncan himself is not fighting the battle. This indicates that he is perhaps too old or too weak to fight himself.

Malcolm, Duncan's son, and next in line to the throne, comments that the bloody man has saved him from being captured - &quot;fought gainst my captivity&quot;. This suggests that Malcolm is a poor fighter, not capable of looking after himself on the battlefield. The question of why this is, is left open, perhaps he is simply young and inexperienced. 

Next the Seargeant answers Duncan's enquiries and describes the battle. 
&quot;Macdonwald&quot; is the internal rebel being fought, there is evidently unrest in the kingdom. &quot;Macdonwald&quot; is not a weak enemy he is strong and tough - &quot;merciless Macdonwald--Worthy to be a rebel&quot;. Indeed it looked like Macdonwald would win the day until by dint of some very hard fighting by Macbeth, Duncan's side won. To further emphasize the problems troubling Duncan's kingdom Shakespeare introduces an external foe who landed just as Macdonwald had been beaten. Instead of being disheartened by this Duncan's two leading soldiers redoubled their efforts and beat the second enemy.

Next two noblemen Ross and Lennox arrive bringing further news of the battle.
It turns out that the external enemy (Norway) was being assisted by another internal traitor - The Thane of Cawdor. However not only has Macbeth succeeded in defeating them, he has made them pay a large fine to Duncan.

Duncan is very grateful to Macbeth for his courage, valour and success. Macbeth (along with Banquo) has succeeded in saving Duncan's Kingdom for him, against stiff odds. In addition he has enriched Duncan with the fine. Duncan concludes by granting Macbeth the title of the traitor. Macbeth becomes '''The Thane of Cawdor'''

Most significant in this scene is the emphasis on Macbeth's loyalty. Traitors are portrayed as evil but powerful, and Macbeth's bravery and courage in facing them are emphasized. This emphasis becomes ironic later in the play when Macbeth becomes the rebel

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:L. Peter Deutsch|L. Peter Deutsch]] asserted:

Essentially everyone, when they first build a distributed application, makes the following eight assumptions. All prove to be false in the long run and all cause big trouble and painful learning experiences.
*[[Jini and Network Computing:The network is reliable|The network is reliable]]
*[[Jini and Network Computing:Latency is zero|Latency is zero]]

This set of fallacies provide a wide range of responses and reactions, as one might imagine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">JavaSpace05 (http://www.jini.org/nonav/standards/porter/doc/specs/api/net/jini/space/package-summary.html) is a standard extension interface which JavaSpaces implementations may optionally support.  It provides:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batch operations for write and take designed to reduce network round-trips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contents() - a streaming read which has some properties of an iterator but is adapted for remote operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;registerForAvailabilitEvent - a notify() variant which provides a broader set of events concerning the state transitions of an Entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In some cases, it's expected that contents() and registerForAvailabilityEvent() will be used together to bring a client up to speed with current state.  This is achieved by having the client first register for events and then using contents() to recover state which was created prior to registration for events.

Both the batch operations and contents() support the use of multiple templates to allow logical OR matching semantics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When using the JRMP mechanisms provided in the java.rmi package, the java.rmi.UnicastRemoteObject class can be subclassed to get some simple programming tasks done for you.

In Jini2.0 and later, the use of net.jini.export.Exporter implementations, requires that subclassing not be performed, and instead, explicit exporting and unexporting be done.  There are several important points about this.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each place that a remote object leaves the VM might need to explicitly export, and manage the lifecycle of the remote object returned by the exporter.
&lt;li&gt;If there is local and remote use of the same object, you might need to keep two different references around, one for local use, and one that will be passed out of the VM for remote use unless #1 applies, in which case, you can just export as needed.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Set the section on [[Jini and Network Computing:Using Jini Exporters|Using Jini Exporters]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The net.jini.export package provides a power feature in Jini 2.0 and later.  The foundation of this package is the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.export.Exporter|net.jini.export.Exporter]] interface.  An instance of this interface provides the ability to export and unexport a single object used for remote access.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method Signature&lt;th&gt;Javadoc Summary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;public java.rmi.Remote export( java.rmi.Remote impl );&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Exports the specified remote object and returns a proxy that can be
used to invoke remote methods on the exported remote object.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;tt&gt;public boolean unexport(boolean force);&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
 Unexports the remote object that was exported by this Exporter
 such that it will no longer receive remote method invocations 
 that were made possible as a result of exporting it with this Exporter.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Typically, an instance of an [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.export.Exporter|Exporter]] will be obtained using the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.Configuration|net.jini.config.Configuration]] implementation established at service startup. The section on [[Jini and Network Computing:Using Configuration Files|Using Configuration Files]] has more information on how a &lt;b&gt;Configuration&lt;/b&gt; instance is typically obtained.

There are many types of scenarios for using an Exporter.  Your particular circumstances will largely govern whether a single exported object can be used by all external references, or if you need to have multiple exports of the same object.  As noted above, each export will require a separate Exporter, and for any [[Jini and Network Computing:java.rmi.Remote|Remote]] object exported, you will need to maintain a strong reference to the Exporter, if unexporting will be done and the Remote object, if it will be reused by other remote clients at a later time.

[[Jini and Network Computing:Distributed Garbage Collection|Distributed Garbage Collection]] (DGC) provides the ability for you to export a remote reference to a local object, send the reference back to a remote client, and to then have the Remote object be unexported and reclaimed when the remote client finishes using the remote object, or otherwise can no longer maintain its reference to that object because of network partitioning or other failures that keep it from updating its lease.

Some types of applications utilize a single Remote object for all clients.  Other types of applications will, in fact, export a single object reference for remote use, one per remote client.  In the former case, DGC is not needed, and can create problems because of its attempts to manage leases.  In the later case, either DGC, or some other type of lease based lifecycle management needs to occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config|net.jini.config]] package provides the facility to utilize live objects for configuring not just Jini services, but any Java application that can have this package and the associated dependencies in its classpath.  The primary implementation of the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.Configuration|net.jini.config.Configuration]] interface is the [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.ConfigurationFile|net.jini.config.ConfigurationFile]] class.  

The [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider|net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider]] Service Provider Interface (SPI) provides the generic mechanism for allowing a service deployer to provide a configuration in whatever way is appropriate.  In almost all cases, the correct way to get a configuration for a service is to use the expression:
&lt;pre&gt;
String args[] = ...
Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getInstance(args);
&lt;/pre&gt;
For many types of services, the args[] value is the set of command line arguments that the Java virtual machine would be started with.

Services utilizing the [[Jini and Network Computing:com.sun.jini.start|com.sun.jini.start]] package, will receive the args[] value in the required constructor which has the signature &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;( java.lang.String[], com.sun.jini.start.LifeCycle )&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[Jini and Network Computing:net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider|ConfigurationProvider]] javadocs provides more information on how one can use the SPI to provide a completely different source for configuration data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">present tense, parasmaipada

the verb is formed by putting a personal affix on the verbal root, sometimes using an infix.

endings:

:ti, tha, nti
:si, thah, tha
:ami, avah, amah

:-ति, -थ, -न्ति
:-सि, -थः, -थ
:-अमि, -अवः, -अमः

infixes: 

:1P: -अ-
:4P: -य-
:10P: -अय-

for verbs in the 1, 4, and 10 class, the vowel in the verbal root is strengthened to its gunah substitute, eg:

तृ (1P) (to cross over) -- to form the 1st person singular, we convert &quot;ऋ&quot; to &quot;अर्&quot;, giving &quot;तर्&quot;.  we then add the infix for 1P verbs, &quot;-अ-&quot;, to get &quot;तर&quot;.  then we add the 1st person singular ending, &quot;ति&quot; to get the conjugated verb, &quot;तरति&quot; (&quot;he crosses over&quot;).

गम् (1P) (to go) -- to form the 3rd person singular, we convert &quot;गम्&quot; to &quot;गच्छ्&quot;.  we then add the infix for 1P verbs, &quot;-अ-&quot;, to get &quot;गच्छ&quot;. we then add the postfix &quot;अमि&quot; to get the conjugated form &quot;गच्छामि&quot;.

चुर् (10P) (to steal) -- to form 1st person plural, we change &quot;चुर्&quot; to &quot;चोर्&quot;, then add infix &quot;-अय-&quot; and termination &quot;-न्ति&quot; to form &quot;चोरयन्ति&quot; (&quot;they steal&quot;).

&quot;The Exchange
In pretty much any game, a player will have the opportunity to take one of his opponents pieces in exchange for one of his own pieces. This should NOT be done for its own sake!&quot;

Not be done for its own sake?  I always trade pieces because I play a better game with less pieces on the board.  This statement seems a little shallow :-P.  Especially trading in the beginning to force the other player into a weak board position.
: If it's forcing the other player into a weak position, then it's not for its own sake.  Similarly, it's a valid tactic to reduce the number of pieces in play when facing a superior opponent (and thus reduce the scope of his advantage) but that's not for its own sake either. Really though, it's a poor habit that prevents you developing the skills needed to handle a more cluttered board. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 10:05, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

--

&quot;Forking with check
Forks which also include the king are the most powerful. The opponent must then move his king to safety and the other piece in the fork has no chance of escape.&quot;

Move his king... or kill the position causing the fork... or block the piece from putting the king in check.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Macules are small skin lesions (&lt;10 mm) characterised by change in colour of skin without any palpable elevation of skin.  To be &quot;macular&quot; means the area of abnormality is not palpable; it can't be felt.  You might find macular erythema (an area of redness) or a &quot;macular pigmented skin lesion&quot;, which could be a junctional nevus (often referred to as a &quot;mole&quot;) or lentigo (a kind of freckle).  Being macular implies the process does not thicken the skin or represent an increase or decrease of the keratinocytes in this area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The piece on Homer is useful because it introduces the whole area of how minds or outlooks may have changed as well as how they were. We need an entry in the 20th century section on Jaynes' Bicameral Mind thesis ( http://julianjaynessociety.tripod.com/ ).  On the subject of Homer, some quotes from Iliad showing how thoughts and actions of gods etc. were intertwined would be helpful (though I appreciate that locating apposite quotes will be time consuming). I put Aristotle up front because he is so central to medieval and modern science and philosophy, not because I believe he is &quot;better&quot;, the order of the other philosophers is probably immaterial. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

I think you need to consider how you motivate the history of consciousness per se as opposed to the history of subjectivity or personal identity or the relation of personal subjectivity to biological life or any number of related issues. If you go back to these sorts of concerns, then I think you need to perhaps do as Karen Armstrong doesin her (2006?) book The Great Transformation and show the origins of this look inward within religions around the world.  If you want to limit your self to consciousness, perhaps it is better to focus on the Socratics--especially the Latin Stoics, like Seneca--who used 'conscientia' in this inward sense and had a big impact on Augustine.--[[User:Michelferrari|Michelferrari]] 00:03, 8 June 2007 (UTC)---

:Good points. The big problem here is that consciousness studies is so contentious. The biographical approach has been adopted to permit the historical section to contain divergent approaches yet still be useful to academic students, a sort of &quot;lucky dip&quot; of historical work. This is also why it has so many quotes - nothing should be reported without being supported! This section desperately needs articles on both Seneca and Augustine, particularly Augustine's view on time - any volunteers? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:58, 8 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Aberwulf. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Aberwulf~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The ''Passé Récent'' is the tense which represents doing something.

e.g. I just returned.

However, in French you say that you '''come''' from doing something rather than having just done it, so that sentence would be:
e.g. 'Je viens de revenir''

If we break it down into its parts it looks like this:

(pronoun) (conjugated form of venir) de (infinitive verb)

Here are some more examples:

We have just finished = Nous venons de finir

She has just arrived = Elle vient d'arriver

They have just eaten = Ils viennent de manger

The teaching of Special Relativity on undergraduate physics courses involves a considerable mathematical background knowledge. Particularly important are the manipulation of vectors and matrices and an elementary knowledge of curvature. The background mathematics is given at the end of this section and can be referenced by those who are unfamiliar with these techniques.

==The Lorentz transformation==

The Lorentz transformation deals with the problem of observers who are moving relative to each other. How are the coordinates of an event recorded by one observer related to the coordinates of the event recorded by the other observer? The '''standard configuration''' used in the calculation of the Lorentz transformation is shown below:

[[Image:relstandard.gif]]

There are several ways of deriving the Lorentz transformations. The usual method is to work from Einstein's postulates (that the laws of physics are the same between all inertial reference frames and the speed of light is constant) whilst adding assumptions about isotropy, linearity and homogeneity. The second is to work from the assumption of a four dimensional Minkowskian metric.

In mathematics transformations are frequently symbolised with the &quot;maps to&quot; symbol:

===The '''linearity''' and '''homogeneity''' of spacetime===

Consider a clock moving freely. According to Newton's first law, objects continue in a state of uniform motion unless acted upon by a force; so, the velocity of the clock in any given direction (&lt;math&gt;dx_i/dt&lt;/math&gt;) must be a constant. 

If the clock is a real clock with readings given by &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; then the rate of change with respect to these readings of the elapsed time at any other point in an inertial frame of reference,  &lt;math&gt;dt/d\tau&lt;/math&gt;, will be a constant. If the clock were to tick at an uneven rate compared with other clocks then the universe would not be homogeneous in time—at some times the clock would appear to accelerate. This would also mean that Newton's first law would be broken and the universe would not be homogeneous in space.

If &lt;math&gt;dx_i/dt&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dt/d\tau&lt;/math&gt; are constant then &lt;math&gt;dx_{\mu} (\mu=1,2,3,4)&lt;/math&gt; is also constant. This means that the clock is not accelerating, i.e. that &lt;math&gt;d^2x_{\mu}/d\tau^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Linearity is demonstrated by the way that the length of things does not depend on position or relative position; for instance, if &lt;math&gt;x' = ax^2&lt;/math&gt; the distance between two points would depend upon the position of the observer whereas if the relationship is linear (&lt;math&gt;x' = ax&lt;/math&gt;) separations are independent of position. 

The linearity and homogeneity assumptions mean that the coordinates of objects in the &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; inertial frame are related to those in the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; inertial frame by:

&lt;math&gt;x_{\nu}' = (\sum \Lambda_{\nu\mu}x_\mu) + B_\nu&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is known as a '''Poincaré transformation'''. It can be expressed in indicial notation as:

&lt;math&gt;x^{'\nu} = \Lambda_{\mu}^\nu x^\mu + B^\nu&lt;/math&gt;

If the origins of the frames coincide then &lt;math&gt;B_\nu&lt;/math&gt; can be assumed to be zero and the equation:

&lt;math&gt;x_{\nu}' = \sum \Lambda_{\nu\mu}x_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

Those who are unfamiliar with the notation should note that the symbols &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; etc. mean &lt;math&gt;x_1=x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2=y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_3=z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_4=t&lt;/math&gt; so the equation above is shorthand for:

&lt;math&gt;x' = a_{11} x + a_{12} y + a_{13} z  + a_{14} t &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y' = a_{21} x + a_{22} y + a_{23} z  + a_{24} t &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z' = a_{31} x + a_{32} y + a_{33} z  + a_{34} t &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t' = a_{41} x + a_{42} y + a_{43} z  + a_{44} t &lt;/math&gt;

In matrix notation the set of equations can be written as: 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'}=\mathbf{\Lambda x}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''standard configuration''' (see diagram above) has several properties, for instance:

:The spatial origin of both observer's coordinate systems lies on the line of motion so the x axes can be chosen to be parallel.

:The point given by &lt;math&gt;x=vt&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;x'=0&lt;/math&gt;.

:The origins of both coordinate systems can coincide so that clocks can be synchronised when they are next to each other.

:The coordinate planes ,y, y' and z,z', can be arranged to be orthogonal (at right angles) to the direction of motion.

:Isotropy means that coordinate planes that are orthogonal at y=0 and z=0 in one frame are orthogonal at y'=0 and z'=0 in the other frame.

According to the relativity principle any transformations between the same two inertial frames of reference must be the same. This is known as the '''reciprocity theorem'''.

===The Lorentz transformation===

From the linearity assumption and given that at the origin &lt;math&gt;y=0=y^'&lt;/math&gt; so there is no constant offset then &lt;math&gt;y^'=Ky&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=Ky^'&lt;/math&gt;, therefore K=1. So:

&lt;math&gt;y^'=y&lt;/math&gt;

and, by the same reasoning:

&lt;math&gt;z^'=z&lt;/math&gt;

Now, considering the x coordinate of the event, the z and y axes can be assumed to be 0 (ie: an arbitrary shift of the coordinates to allow the event to lie on the x axes). If this is done then the linearity consideration and the fact that &lt;math&gt;x=vt&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^'=0&lt;/math&gt; are the same point gives:

(1) &lt;math&gt;x^' = \gamma (x - vt)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. According to the reciprocity theorem we also have:

(2) &lt;math&gt;x = \gamma (x^' + vt^')&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein's assumption that the speed of light is a constant can now be introduced so that &lt;math&gt;x=ct&lt;/math&gt; and also &lt;math&gt;x^'=ct^'&lt;/math&gt;. So:

&lt;math&gt;ct^'= \gamma t(c - v)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;ct= \gamma t^'(c + v)&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;c^2tt^'= \gamma^2tt^'(c^2 - v^2)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\gamma = \frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^2/c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the Lorentz transformation equations are:

&lt;math&gt;t^' = \gamma (t - vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^' = \gamma (x - vt)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y^'=y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z^'=z&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation for the time coordinate can derived from the transformation for the x coordinate assuming &lt;math&gt;x=ct&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^'=ct^'&lt;/math&gt; or directly from equations (1) and (2) with a similar substitution for &lt;math&gt;x=ct&lt;/math&gt;.

The coefficients of the Lorentz transformation can be represented in matrix format:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
c t' \\x' \\y' \\z'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\gamma&amp;-\frac{v}{c} \gamma&amp;0&amp;0\\
-\frac{v}{c} \gamma&amp;\gamma&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c t\\x\\y\\z
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A coordinate transformation of this type, that is due to motion, is known as a '''boost'''.

[[Image:relltex.gif]]

The Lorentz transformation equations can be used to show that:

&lt;math&gt;c^2dt^{'2} - dx^{'2} - dy^{'2} - dz^{'2} = c^2dt^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Although whether the assumptions of linearity, isotropy and homogeneity in the derivation of the Lorentz transformation actually assumed this identity from the outset is a moot point.

Given that: &lt;math&gt;c^2dt^{'2} - dx^{'2} - dy^{'2} - dz^{'2}&lt;/math&gt; also equals &lt;math&gt;c^2dt^{''2} - dx^{''2} - dy^{''2} - dz^{''2}&lt;/math&gt; and a continuous range of other transformations it is clear that:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta s}^2 = c^2\Delta{t}^{2} - \Delta{x}^{2} - \Delta{y}^{2} - \Delta{z}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''spacetime interval''' and the quantity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Delta s}^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''squared displacement'''.

A given squared displacement is constant for all observers, no matter how fast they are travelling, it is said to be '''invariant'''. 

The equation:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = c^2dt^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

is known as the '''metric''' of spacetime.

===Another look at the Lorentz transformation===

We have seen how length and duration both look different to a moving observer:

* lengths are contracted by a factor &amp;gamma;, ''when measured at the same time''.
* durations are contracted by a factor &amp;gamma;, ''when measured in the same place''.

We can extend these results to allow for measurements taking place at different times and places.

Lets consider two observers, O and O' such that O' is moving at velocity ''v'' along the ''x''-axis with respect to O. We'll use primed variables for all the measurements O' makes.

We can assume for now both observers have the same origin and ''x''-axis because we already know how to allow for observers being relatively rotated and displaced. We can put these complications back in later.

Now any length or duration can be written as the difference between two coordinates, for the two ends of the body or the start and end of the event, so it is sufficient to know how to change coordinates from one frame to the other.

We know how to do this in classical physics,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} x' &amp; = &amp; x-vt \\ t' &amp; = &amp; t \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

we need to extend this to relativity.

Notice that the in classical physics the relationship is linear; the graphs of these equations are straight lines. This makes the maths much simpler, so we will try to find a linear relationship between the coordinates for relativity, i.e equations of the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} x' &amp; = &amp; mx + nt \\ t' &amp; = &amp; px + qt \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''q'' are all independent of the coordinates.

To begin with know that

*when ''t''=0, ''x&amp;prime;'' = &amp;gamma;''x'' (Lorentz contraction)
*when ''x''=0, ''t&amp;prime;'' = &amp;gamma;''t'' (Time dilation)

and that O' is travelling at velocity ''v''. They measure their position to be at ''x&amp;prime;''=0, but O measures it to be at ''vt'' so we must have

:''x&amp;prime;''=0 when ''x''-''vt''=0

The only relationship between ''x'' and ''x&amp;prime;'' that satisfies these criteria is

:&lt;math&gt;x'=\gamma (x - vt) \, &lt;/math&gt;

Both observers must measure the same speed for light,

:&lt;math&gt; x=ct \Rightarrow x'=ct' \,&lt;/math&gt;

or, substituting and rearranging,

:&lt;math&gt; x=ct \Rightarrow t'=\gamma \frac{x-vt}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

The only linear relationship between ''t'' and ''t&amp;prime;'' that satisfies these criteria is

:&lt;math&gt;t'=\gamma (-\frac{vx}{c^2} + t) \, &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--leave proof for exercises --&gt;

So the primed and unprimed coordinates are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
x' &amp; = &amp; \gamma (x-vt) \\ t' &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left(-\frac{vx}{c^2} + t \right)
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

These equations are called the Lorentz transform.

They look simpler if we write them in terms of ''ct'' rather than ''t''

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
x' &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( x-\frac{v}{c}ct \right) \\ 
ct' &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( -\frac{v}{c}x + ct \right)
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Written this way they look much like the equations describing a rotation in three dimensions. In fact, once we allow for the different Pythagorean theorem, they are ''exactly'' like the equations for rotation.

* If observers are moving relative to each other, their coordinate systems are rotated in the (''x'',''ct'') plane.

===The derivation of the constancy of the speed of light from the first postulate alone===

The following text was taken from a &quot;Wikiversity&quot; lecture.

The [[wikipedia: lorentz transformation | lorentz transformation]] can be deduced from the first postulate alone with no additional assumptions.

The Lorentz transformation describes the way a vector in spacetime as seen by an observer O1 changes when it is seen by an observer O2 in a different inertial system.

The postulate of special relativity states that the laws of physics are independent of the velocity of an observer. This is equivalent to the requirement that the mathematical formulation of the laws of physics must be invariant if the coordinates of space and time are altered using a lorentz transformation.

This is the reason why the Lorentz transformation is a central concept in special relativity.

Four-vectors are vectors that, subjected to the Lorentz transformation, behave like vectors from spacetime. The standard approach to find relativistic laws to the corresponding non-relativistic ones is to find four-vectors to replace space vectors. Surprisingly often this simple approach is successful.

Here, for simplicity, the space coordinates are choosen so that the x-axis points in the direction in which O2 is moving with respect to O1 and the y and z coordinates are not considered.

Here is a way to determine a matrix &lt;math&gt;L(v)&lt;/math&gt; that transforms coordinates from O1 to O2 where ''v'' is the velocity of O2 seen from O1.

Most generally, this matrix looks like &lt;math&gt;L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and transforms &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t^\prime \\ x^\prime\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t' \\ x'\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ x\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The first requirement on this matrix is that O2 will be at rest (in space) within its own coordinate system.

Therfore &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t' \\ 0\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix} t \\ tv\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt; for any time t.

This gives us &lt;math&gt; ct +tvd = 0 \Rightarrow c = -vd &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ -vd &amp; d\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The backward transformation from O2 to O1 is described by the inverse matrix &lt;math&gt;L(v') = L(v)^{-1} =  (\det(L(v))^{-1}\left(\begin{matrix}d &amp; -b \\ vd &amp; a\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\, v'&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of O1 seen from O2) has to leave O1 at rest  in its own coordinates.

Assuming &lt;math&gt; v' = -v &lt;/math&gt; (being strict this would have to be proved) we have 
&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix}t \\ 0\end{matrix}\right) = (\det(L(v))^{-1}\left(\begin{matrix}d &amp; -b \\ vd &amp; a\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix} t' \\ -t'v\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt; for any time &lt;math&gt;\, t'&lt;/math&gt;
resulting in &lt;math&gt; a=d \Rightarrow L(v) =\left(\begin{matrix}a &amp; b \\ -va &amp; a\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The coefficients are functions of ''v''.
For all ''v'' the transformation is invertible, so &lt;math&gt;0 \neq \det L(v) = a(v)^2 + v a(v) b(v) \Rightarrow a(v) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For ''v=0'' ''L(v)'' is the identity matrix, so ''b(0)=0''. This allows to rewrite &lt;math&gt; b(v) = -v a(v) \varepsilon(v) &lt;/math&gt; with a yet unknown function &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(v)&lt;/math&gt;.


Now &lt;math&gt; L(v) =a(v) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v\varepsilon(v) \\ -v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.


Now for every &lt;math&gt;v_0, v_1&lt;/math&gt; there exists a velocity &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;L(v_0) L(v_1) = L(v_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Using what we have proved up to now gives
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L(v_0)L(v_1) &amp; = a(v_0) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v_0\varepsilon(v_0) \\ -v_0 &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) a(v_1) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v_1\varepsilon(v_1) \\ -v_1 &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) \\
&amp; = a(v_0) a(v_1)\left(\begin{matrix} 1+v_0v_1\varepsilon(v_0) &amp; -v_1\varepsilon(v_1)-v_0\varepsilon(v_0) \\ -v_0-v_1 &amp; 1+v_0 v_1 \varepsilon(v_1)\end{matrix}\right) \\
&amp; = a(v_2) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v_2\varepsilon(v_2) \\ -v_2 &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) \\
&amp; = L(v_2).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the diagonal components, we see immediately that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(v_0) = \varepsilon(v_1)&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary values of &lt;math&gt;v_0, v_1&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(v) = \operatorname{const.} = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Using this we can rewrite the equation for the  
&lt;math&gt;a(v_0)a(v_1)(1+v_0v_1\varepsilon) = a(v_2)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt;\,a(v_0)a(v_1)(-v_0-v_1) = -v_2 a(v_2)&lt;/math&gt;
by comparing each of the components at indeces ''(1,1)'' and ''(2,1)'' respectively.
Substituting &lt;math&gt;a(v_2)&lt;/math&gt; yields

&lt;math&gt;(1) \ \ a(v_0)a(v_1)(-v_0-v_1) = -v_2 a(v_0)a(v_1)(1+v_0v_1\varepsilon) &lt;/math&gt;

from which we have &lt;math&gt;v_2 = \frac{v_0+v_1}{1+v_0v_1\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;.

Reinserting this into the first equation we have
&lt;math&gt;
a(v_0)a(v_1)(1+v_0v_1\varepsilon) = a(\frac{v_0+v_1}{1+v_0v_1\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

In case &lt;math&gt; v := v_0 = -v_1&lt;/math&gt; this simplifies to 
&lt;math&gt;
a(v)a(-v)(1-v^2\varepsilon) = a(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;  as &lt;math&gt;\, L(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix.


Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) = \varphi(-x)&lt;/math&gt; be an even function and &lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = -\psi(-x)&lt;/math&gt; an odd function
such that &lt;math&gt;a(v) = e^{\varphi(v) + \psi(v)}&lt;/math&gt;.

This gives us &lt;math&gt;e^{\varphi(v) + \psi(v) + \varphi(v) - \psi(v)-2\pi\operatorname i k} = (1-v^2\varepsilon)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Taking the logarithm and simplifying yields &lt;math&gt;\varphi(v) = -\frac12\ln (1-v^2\varepsilon) + \pi\operatorname i k&lt;/math&gt;
from which we get &lt;math&gt;a(v)=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-v^2\varepsilon)}} e^{\psi(v)}&lt;/math&gt; with any odd function
&lt;math&gt;\,\psi(-v)=-\psi(v)&lt;/math&gt;. The negative sign is ruled out by &lt;math&gt;\, a(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;.


Substituting &lt;math&gt;\, a(v)&lt;/math&gt; in equation (1) verifies the solution but leaves us with
&lt;math&gt;\psi(v_0) + \psi(v_1) = \psi(\frac{v_0+v_1}{1+v_0v_1\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

To prove &lt;math&gt;\psi(v) \equiv 0 &lt;/math&gt; we flip the direction of the x-axis in the base system as well as in the transformed system. The choice of the direction of the axis must not lead to different results. In the flipped coordinates the Lorentz transformation takes the form &lt;math&gt;L(v') = a(v') \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v'\varepsilon \\ -v' &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) = a(-v) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; v\varepsilon \\ v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;v' = -v&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand we can compute &lt;math&gt;L(v')&lt;/math&gt; by using a coordinate transformation on &lt;math&gt;L(v)&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; L(v') = \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1\end{matrix}\right) a(v) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; v\varepsilon \\ v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1\end{matrix}\right) =
a(v)\left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -v\varepsilon \\ -v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; from which we get
&lt;math&gt;\,a(-v) = a(v)&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\,\psi(-v)=\psi(v)&lt;/math&gt;. Together with &lt;math&gt;\,\psi(-v)=-\psi(v)&lt;/math&gt;
this gives &lt;math&gt;\psi(v) \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Looking at the [[wikipedia:eigenvector | eigenvectors]] of ''L(v)'' we see they are &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{matrix} 1 \\ \pm\frac{1}{\sqrt\varepsilon}\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; independent of ''v''.

This is equivalent to a ''transformation invariant'' velocity &lt;math&gt;\frac1\sqrt\varepsilon=:c_0&lt;/math&gt; which experimentation shows to be equal to the speed of light. 
Altogether we have:

 &lt;center&gt; 

 &lt;math&gt;L(v)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c_0^2}}}\left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; -\frac{v}{c_0^2} \\ -v &amp; 1\end{matrix}\right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0&lt;/math&gt; we would have the Galileian case with no finite invariant velocity.

Behold that if we did the same deduction not in the spacetime plane for ''(t, x)'' but in the space plane ''(x, y)'' with [[wikipedia:slope | slope]] ''m=y/x'' instead of velocity ''v=x/t'' nothing would change except that, not by calculation but by experimentation alone, it would have turned out that &lt;math&gt;\,\varepsilon = -1&lt;/math&gt; and ''L(m)'' is just a rotation in the [[wikipedia: Euclidean geometry | euclidian]] space with no real valued eigenvectors.

{{clr}}
It is an interesting exercise to compare this result with the assumptions of reciprocity, homogeneity and isotropy mentioned earlier. Do the linear equations contained in the matrix formulation of the Lorentz transformation above assume a particular spacetime from the outset? 

{{clr}}
It is further important to mention that the [[wikipedia:determinant | determinant]] &lt;math&gt;\, \det L(v) = 1&lt;/math&gt; independent of velocity. This directly implicates that ''spacetime volumes are conserved.''

=== The geometry of space-time ===

SR uses a 'flat' 4-dimensional Minkowski space, which is an example of a space-time.  This space, however, is very similar to the standard 3 dimensional Euclidean space, and fortunately by that fact, very easy to work with.

The differential of distance(''ds'') in Cartesian 3D space is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(dx_1,dx_2,dx_3)&lt;/math&gt; are the differentials of the three spatial dimensions. In the geometry of special relativity, a fourth dimension, time, is added, with units of c, so that the equation for the differential of distance becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

In many situations it may be convenient to treat time as imaginary  (e.g. it may simplify equations), in which case &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation is replaced by &lt;math&gt;i.t'&lt;/math&gt;, and the  metric becomes

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 + c^2(dt')^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that ds in this case is the distance, and not the interval. Caution should be exercised in the use of 'imaginary' time, it is not part of the modern theory of relativity.  Blandford and Thorne (2004) in their &quot;Applications of Classical Physics&quot; (http://www.pma.caltech.edu/Courses/ph136/yr2004/ ), write the following about imaginary time: &quot;(i) it hides the true physical geometry of Minkowski spacetime, (ii) it cannot be extended in any reasonable manner to non-orthonormal bases in flat spacetime, and (iii) it cannot be extended in any reasonable manner to the curvilinear coordinates that one must use in general relativity.&quot; 

If we reduce the spatial dimensions to 2, so that we can represent the physics in a 3-D space

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

We see that things such as light which move at the speed of light lie along a dual-cone:

[[image:sr1.jpg]]

defined by the equation 

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = 0 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 = c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the equation of a circle with &lt;math&gt;r=c dt&lt;/math&gt;.
The path of something that moves at the speed of light is known as a '''null geodesic'''. If we extend the equation above to three spatial dimensions, the null geodesics are
continuous concentric spheres, with radius = distance = c×(±time).

[[image:Null_spherical_space_(special_relativity).jpg]]

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = 0 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 - c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 = c^2 dt^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This null dual-cone represents the &quot;line of sight&quot; of a point in space.  That is, when we look at the stars and say &quot;The light from that star which I am receiving is X years old.&quot;, we are looking down this line of sight: a null geodesic.  We are looking at an event &lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2} &lt;/math&gt; meters away and ''d/c'' seconds in the past. For this reason the null dual cone is also known as the 'light cone'. (The point in the lower left of the picture below represents the star, the origin represents the observer, and the line represents the null geodesic &quot;line of sight&quot;.)

The cone in the ''-t'' region is the information that the point is 'receiving', while the cone in the ''+t'' section is the information that the point is 'sending'.

===Length contraction, time dilation and phase===
Consider two inertial frames in standard configuration.  There is a rigid rod moving along in the second frame at v m/s. The length of the rod is determined by observing the positions of the end points of the rod simultaneously - if the rod is moving it would be nonsense to use any other measure of length. An observer who is moving at the same velocity as the rod measures its &quot;rest length&quot;. The Lorentz transformation for coordinates along the x axis is:

&lt;math&gt;x^' = \gamma (x - vt)&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose the positions, &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2&lt;/math&gt;, of the two ends of the rod are determined simultaneously (ie: &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is constant):

&lt;math&gt;(x^'_1 - x^'_2) = \gamma (x_1 - x_2) &lt;/math&gt;

Or, using &lt;math&gt;L_0 = (x^'_1 - x^'_2) &lt;/math&gt; for the rest length of the rod and &lt;math&gt;L = (x_1 - x_2)&lt;/math&gt; for the length of the rod that is measured by the observer who sees it fly past at v m/s:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L_0 = \gamma L}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, elaborating &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L = {L_0}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words the length of an object moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is contracted in the direction of motion by a factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of motion.

The Lorentz transformation also affects the rate at which clocks appear to change their readings. The Lorentz transformation for time is:

&lt;math&gt;t^' = \gamma (t - vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

This transformation has two components:

&lt;math&gt;t^' = \gamma t - \gamma vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;

and is a straight line graph (ie: &lt;math&gt;t^' = mt + c&lt;/math&gt;).

The gradient of the graph is &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta t^' = \gamma \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;

or:

&lt;math&gt;t^'_1-t^'_2 = \gamma (t_1 - t_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore clocks in the moving frame will appear to go slow, if &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is a time interval in the rest frame and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a time interval in the moving frame:

&lt;math&gt;T = \gamma T_0&lt;/math&gt;

Or, expanding:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T = \frac{T_0}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The intercept of the graph is:

&lt;math&gt;-\gamma vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;

This means that if a clock at point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is compared with a clock that was synchronised between frames at the origin it will show a constant time difference of &lt;math&gt;\gamma vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt; seconds. This quantity is known as the relativistic phase difference or &quot;phase&quot;.

[[Image:reldil.gif]]

The relativistic phase is as important as the length contraction and time dilation results. It is the amount by which clocks that are synchronised at the origin go out of synchronisation with distance along the direction of travel. Phase affects all clocks except those at the point where clocks are syncronised and the infinitessimal y and z planes that cut this point. All clocks everywhere else will be out of synchronisation between the frames. The effect of phase is shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:rel1.gif]]

If the inertial frames are each composed of arrays of clocks spread over space then the clocks will be out of synchronisation as shown in the illustration above.

It is interesting to see how the phase term cancels out when time differences are being considered. It cancels out because the phase term &lt;math&gt;x^'v/c^2&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the clock that is at a constant position in the primed frame. The Lorentz transform for time is:

: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{t^' + (v/c^2)x^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

A difference between two times is:

: &lt;math&gt;t_1 - t_2 = \frac{t_1^' + (v/c^2)x^' - t_2^' - (v/c^2)x^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The important thing to note is that the clock is at the same position &lt;math&gt;x^'&lt;/math&gt; '''in its own reference frame'''.

The result is that: 

: &lt;math&gt;t_1 - t_2 = \frac{t_1^' - t_2^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Where the phase terms have cancelled.

==Hyperbolic geometry==

In the flat spacetime of Special Relativity: 

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = c^2t^{2} - x^{2} - y^2 - z^2&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the x-axis alone:

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = c^2t^{2} - x^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The standard equation of a hyperbola is:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of spacetime:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{(ct)^2}{s^2} - \frac{x^2}{s^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Spacetime intervals separate one place or event in spacetime from another. So, for a given motion from one place to another or a given fixed length in one reference frame, given time interval etc. the metric of spacetime describes a hyperbolic space. This hyperbolic space encompasses the coordinates of all the observations made of the given interval by any observers.

[[Image:relhyperb.gif]]

It is possible to conceive of rotations in hyperbolic space in a similar way to rotations in Euclidean space. The idea of a rotation in hyperbolic space is summarised in the illustration below:

[[Image:relhyper2.gif]]

A rotation in hyperbolic space is equivalent to changing from one frame of reference to another whilst observing the same spacetime interval. It is moving from coordinates that give:

&lt;math&gt;(ct)^2 - x^2 = s^2&lt;/math&gt;

to coordinates that give:

&lt;math&gt;(ct^')^2 - {x^'}^2 = s^2&lt;/math&gt;

The formula for a rotation in hyperbolic space provides an alternative form of the Lorentz transformation ie:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c t \\x 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cosh \phi &amp; \sinh \phi \\
\sinh \phi &amp; \cosh \phi 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c t'\\x'
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

From which:

&lt;math&gt;x = x^' \cosh \phi + ct^' \sinh \phi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;ct = x^' \sinh \phi + ct^' \cosh \phi&lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be determined by considering the coordinates assigned to a moving light that moves along the x axis from the origin at &lt;math&gt;v m sec^1&lt;/math&gt; flashes on for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; seconds then flashes off.

The coordinates assigned by an observer on the light are: &lt;math&gt;t',0,0,0&lt;/math&gt;, the coordinates assigned by the stationary observer are &lt;math&gt;t, x=vt, 0, 0&lt;/math&gt;. The hyperbola representing these observations is illustrated below:

[[Image:relbeta.gif]]

The equation of the hyperbola is:

&lt;math&gt;(ct)^2 - x^2 = s^2 = (ct^')^2&lt;/math&gt;

but x=vt for the end of the flash so:

&lt;math&gt;\tanh \phi = \frac {v}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, from hyperbolic trigonometry:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\tanh^2{\phi}}} = \sqrt{ 
\frac{\cosh^2\phi} 
{\cosh^2\phi-\sinh^2\phi}
}= \cosh\phi&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\tanh\phi = \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;\cosh\phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

and, from the hyperbolic trigonometric formula &lt;math&gt;\sinh\phi = \tanh\phi \cosh\phi&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\sinh\phi = {\frac{v}{c}}\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting these values into the equations for the hyperbolic rotation:

&lt;math&gt;x = x^' \cosh \phi + ct^' \sinh \phi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma x^' + ct^' \gamma v/c &lt;/math&gt;

Which gives the standard transform for x:

&lt;math&gt;x = \gamma ( x^' + vt^')&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar way &lt;math&gt;ct = x^' \sinh \phi + ct^' \cosh \phi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt;t = \gamma (t^' + vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

So the Lorentz transformations can also be derived from the assumption that boosts are equivalent to rotations in hyperbolic space with a metric &lt;math&gt;s^2 = c^2t^{2} - x^{2} - y^2 - z^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''rapidity''' of the boost.

===Addition of velocities===

Suppose there are three observers 1, 2, and 3 who are moving at different velocities along the x-axis. Observers 1 and 2 are moving at a relative velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and observers 2 and 3 are moving at a relative velocity of &lt;math&gt;u^'&lt;/math&gt;. The problem is to determine the velocity of observer 3 as observed by observer 1 (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;).

It turns out that there is a very convenient relationship between rapidities that solves this problem:

If &lt;math&gt;v/c = \tanh{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u^'/c = \tanh{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; then:

&lt;math&gt;u/c = \tanh(\phi + \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words the rapidities can be simply added from one observer to another ie:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \phi + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Hence: 

&lt;math&gt;\tanh(\sigma) =  \tanh(\phi + \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

So the velocities can be added by simply adding the rapidities. Using hyperbolic trigonometry:

&lt;math&gt;u/c = \tanh(\alpha + \phi) = \frac{\tanh{\alpha} + \tanh{\phi}}{1+\tanh{\alpha}\tanh{\phi}} = \frac{u^'/c + v/c}{1+u^'v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;  Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u = \frac{u^' + v}{1+u^'v/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the relativistic velocity addition theorem.

The relationship &lt;math&gt;u/c = \tanh(\phi + \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is shown below:

[[Image:relvelh.gif]]

Velocity transformations can be obtained without referring to the rapidity. The general case of the transformation of velocities in any direction is derived as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u^'}= (u^'_1, u^'_2, u^'_3) &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;u^'_1&lt;/math&gt; etc. are the components of the velocity in the x, y, z directions.

Writing out the components of velocity:

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = dx^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = dy^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = dz^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;

But from the Lorentz transformations:

&lt;math&gt;dx^' = \gamma (dx - v dt)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dy^' = dy&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dz^' = dz&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dt^' = \gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = dx^'/dt^' = \frac{\gamma (dx - v dt)}{\gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = dy^'/dt^' = \frac{dy}{\gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = dz^'/dt^' = \frac{dz}{\gamma (dt - vdx/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing top and bottom of each fraction by &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = \frac{\gamma (dx/dt - v)}{\gamma (1 - vdx/dt/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = \frac{dy/dt}{\gamma (1 - vdx/dt/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = \frac{dz/dt}{\gamma (1 - vdx/dt/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_1 = \frac{u - v}{1 - uv/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^'_2 = \frac{u_2}{\gamma (1 - uv/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^'_3 = \frac{u_3}{\gamma (1 - uv/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

The full velocity transformations are tabulated below:

&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;

&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Having calculated the components of the velocity vector it it now possible to calculate the magnitudes of the overall vectors between frames:

&lt;math&gt;u = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^' = \sqrt{u^{'2}_1 + u^{'2}_2 + u^{'2}_3}&lt;/math&gt;

====Addition of velocities - another approach====

In classical physics, velocities simply add. If an object moves with speed ''u'' in one reference frame, which is itself moving at ''v'' with respect to a second frame, the object moves at speed ''u''+''v'' in that second frame.

This is inconsistant with relativity because it predicts that if the speed of light is ''c'' in the first frame it will be ''v''+''c'' in the second.

We need to find an alternative formula for combining velocities. We can do this with the Lorentz transform.

Because the factor ''v''/''c'' will keep recurring we shall call that ratio &amp;beta;.

We are considering three frames; frame O, frame O' which moves at speed ''u'' with respect to frame O, and frame O&quot; which moves at speed ''v'' with respect to frame O'.

We want to know the speed of O&quot; with respect to frame O,''U'' which would classically be ''u''+''v''.

The transforms from O to O' and O' to O&quot; can be written as matrix equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x' \\ ct' \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta \\ -\beta &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \gamma' 
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta' \\ -\beta' &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x' \\ ct' \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where we are defining the &amp;beta;'s and &amp;gamma;'s as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\beta = \frac{u}{c} &amp; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2 }} \\
\beta^\prime = \frac{v}{c} &amp; 
\gamma^\prime  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\beta^\prime}^2 }} 
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

We can combine these to get the relationship between the O and O&quot; coordinates simply by multiplying the matrices, giving

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = \gamma \gamma^\prime 
\begin{pmatrix} 1+\beta \beta' &amp; - (\beta + \beta') \\
- (\beta + \beta')  &amp; 1+\beta \beta'  \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

This should be the same as the Lorentz transform between the two frames,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = 
\gamma'' \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta'' \\ -\beta'' &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad (2) \mbox{  where }
\begin{matrix} \beta'' &amp; = &amp; \frac{U}{c} \\
\gamma'' &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\beta''}^2 }} \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

These two sets of equations do look similar. We can make them look more similar still by taking a factor of 1+&amp;beta;&amp;beta;' out of the matrix in (1) giving:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = \gamma \gamma' (1+\beta \beta')  
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'} \\
- \frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'}  &amp; 1  \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This will be identical with equation 2 if

:&lt;math&gt;\beta''=\frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'} \mbox{ (3a)   and } 
\gamma'' = \gamma \gamma' (1+\beta \beta')  \mbox{ (3b)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the two equations ''must'' give identical results, we know these conditions must be true.

Writing the &amp;beta;'s in terms of the velocities equation 3a becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U}{c}=\frac{\frac{u}{c} + \frac{v}{c}}{1+\frac{uv}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which tells us ''U'' in terms of ''u'' and ''v''.

A little algebra shows that this implies equation 3b is also true &lt;!-- exercise --&gt;

Multiplying by ''c'' we can finally write.

&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{u+v}{1+\frac{uv}{c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that if ''u'' or ''v'' is much smaller than ''c'' the denominator is approximately 1, and the velocities approximately add but if either ''u'' or ''v'' is ''c'' then so is ''U'', just as we expected.

===Acceleration transformation===

'''This section is under development'''. 

It was seen above that:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {u}{c} = \tanh{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

and, if &lt;math&gt;\frac {v}{c} =\tanh \beta&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{u^'}{c} = \tanh \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; the velocity addition theorem can be expressed as the sum of the rapidities:

&lt;math&gt;\phi = \beta + \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

If we differentiate this equation with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to investigate acceleration, then assuming &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is constant:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac{d\epsilon}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

so


(1) &lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac{d\epsilon}{dt^'}\frac{dt^'}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} \!&lt;/math&gt; is also equal to:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac {d\phi}{du}\frac{du}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\phi = \tanh^{-1} (u/c) \!&lt;/math&gt; and the derivative of an arctangent is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \tanh^{-1}(x)}{dx} = \frac{1}{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{du} = \frac{1}{c}\frac {1}{(1-u^2/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

For brevity we will use the notation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{1-u^2/c^2} = \gamma^2(u)&lt;/math&gt;

ie: &lt;math&gt;\gamma(u)&lt;/math&gt; is gamma for observers moving at a relative velocity of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.

So:

(2)&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\phi}{dt} = \frac{1}{c} \gamma^2(u) \frac{du}{dt}\!&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of the object observed by the unprimed and primed observers is:

&lt;math&gt;u^2 = {u_1}^2 + {u_2}^2 + {u_3}^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^{'2} = {u_1}^{'2} + {u_2}^{'2} + {u_3}^{'2}\!&lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{dr}{dt}\!&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;u^' = \frac{dr^'}{dt^'}\!&lt;/math&gt; 

So:

&lt;math&gt;u^2dt^2 = dr^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u^{'2}dt^{'2} = dr^{'2} \!&lt;/math&gt;

and using the Minkowski metric:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dr^2 - cdt^2 = dr^{'2} - cdt^{'2} \!&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;u^2dt^2 - cdt^2 = u^{'2}dt^{'2} - cdt^{'2} \!&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;dt^2(c^2 - u^2) = dt^{'2}(u^{'2} - c^2) \!&lt;/math&gt;

Given that &lt;math&gt;\gamma (u) = \frac {c}{\sqrt{c^2 - u^2}} \!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma (u^') = \frac {c}{\sqrt{c^2 - u^{'2}}}\!&lt;/math&gt;

(3)&lt;math&gt;\frac{dt^'}{dt} = \frac {\gamma(u^')}{\gamma(u)}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, substituting (2) and (3) in (1):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c} \gamma^2(u) \frac{du}{dt} = \frac{d\epsilon}{dt^'}\frac {\gamma(u^')}{\gamma(u)}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the differential of arctanh as before to determine &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\epsilon}{dt^'}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma^3(u^')\frac {du^'}{dt^'} = \gamma^3(u)\frac {du}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a different result from the Newtonian formula in which &lt;math&gt;du/dt = du^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''proper acceleration''', &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the acceleration of an object in its rest frame. It is the instantaneous change in velocity for an observer for whom &lt;math&gt;u^'=0 \!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = du^'/dt^' \!&lt;/math&gt;.  In these circumstances:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \gamma^3(u)\frac{du}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The term 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{dt}\!&lt;/math&gt; is called &quot;coordinate acceleration&quot;.

==Another approach to acceleration==

Classically we would talk about a particle at ''x''(''t'') with acceleration ''d''&amp;sup2;''x''/''dt''&amp;sup2;. In relativity we must treat time as just another coordinate, and use derivatives with respect to proper time, which means our notion of acceleration will change. We can assume the particle is moving slower than light.

Since &amp;tau; increases monotonically with ''t'' (no time travel allowed) we can easily parameterise the path of the particle with &amp;tau; rather than ''t''. Derivatives with respect to these two variables then differ only by a factor of &amp;gamma;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\tau} = \gamma \frac{d}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

which gives us the connection between the classical and relativstic formulae.

Lets suppose we have a particle moving on the path (''x''(&amp;tau;),''ct''(&amp;tau;)), where &amp;tau; is the particle's proper time.

Its velocity four vector is

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{u} = \frac{d}{d\tau}(x, ct) = \gamma (\dot{\mathbf{x}}, c) &lt;/math&gt;

In the particles rest frame this is (0,''c''), which has constant magnitude -''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but this scalar must be the same in all frames, thus

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{u} \cdot \underline{u} = -c^2 &lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''the magnitude of the velocity is '''always''' constant.''

Differentiating this, we can immediately say

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{u} \cdot \underline{a} = 
\frac{d}{d\tau} \underline{u} \cdot \underline{u}= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so, ''velocity and acceleration are '''always''' perpendicular''.

These two results are much simpler than in classical physics.

Differentiating the velocity gives us, after some algebra &lt;!-- appropriate level of detail  here? --&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = \gamma^4 \ddot{x} (1, \frac{v}{c}) &lt;/math&gt;

when the motion is along the ''x''-axis. Since the spatial and temporal components must be 3-vectors and scalars respectively we immediately see that for motion in arbitary directions,


:&lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = \gamma^4 \left( \ddot{\mathbf{x}} , \frac{\ddot{\mathbf{x}}\cdot \mathbf{v} }{c} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of this is 

:&lt;math&gt;|\underline{a}| = \gamma^3 \ddot{x} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the classical magnitude, corrected by a factor dependant on &amp;gamma;. When the velocity is much less than ''c'' this factor is approximately 1, so in that limit the magnitudes are the same, as they should be.

Knowing this, we can work out the equation of motion for a particle with constant acceleration ''a'' along the ''x''-axis. For simplicity, we'll assume the initial velocity is 0.

Since the accleration is constant

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\dot{v}}{\left( 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}} = a &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating once we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = at &lt;/math&gt;

or, on rearranging

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{at}{\sqrt{1+a^2t^2/c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

If ''at'' is much less than ''c'' this gives a velocity of approximately ''at'', identical to the classical result, but as ''t'' tends to infinity the velocity tends to ''c''.

The position is

:&lt;math&gt; x = d+ \frac{c^2}{a}\sqrt{1+ \frac{a^2 t^2}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is some constant. We can choose our coordinate system to make ''d'' zero.

Calling the interval between the origin and the particle, ''I'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
I^2 &amp; = &amp; x^2 &amp; - &amp; c^2t^2 \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{c^4}{a^2} \left( 1+ \frac{a^2 t^2}{c^2} \right) &amp; - &amp; c^2t^2\\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{c^4}{a^2} &amp; &amp; \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the interval between the particle and the origin is constant. Notice, this is the equation for an hyperbola, so we know the particle's trajectory.

==Momentum==

Classically, momentum is velocity multiplied by mass. We can use the same definition in relativity, and see where it takes us.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{p}=m_0 \underline{u}= m_0 \gamma (\mathbf{v}, c)&lt;/math&gt;

You may sometimes see the product ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gamma; which shows up here called the ''relativistic mass'', but we will not be using this approach.

The mass, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is generally called the ''rest mass'', to distinguish it from the relativistic mass.

The spatial component of the four-momemntum is clearly the classical momentum, scaled by a factor of &amp;gamma;. At speeds much less than ''c'' this will be approximately 1.

The temporal component is ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gamma;''c''. To see what this means we can look at its value when ''v''/''c'' is small.

:&lt;math&gt;m_0 \gamma c = \frac{m_0 c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}= 
m_0 c \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{v^4}{c^4} + \cdots
\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The first term in this expansion is a constant.

The second term is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_0 v^2}{2c}&lt;/math&gt;
which we recognise as being the classical kinetic energy, divided by ''c''.

Now, adding a constant to the definition of kinetic energy makes no real difference, since all that matters are changes in energy, so we can identify this temporal component of relativistic momentum with the energy over ''c''.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{p}= (\gamma \mathbf{p}, E/c)&lt;/math&gt;

We then have

:&lt;math&gt;E = m_0 c^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_0 v^2 + \frac{3}{8}\frac{m_0 v^4}{c^2} 
+ \cdots  &lt;/math&gt;

Even at rest, the particle has a kinetic energy,

&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: thick solid blue;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E=m_0 c^2, \,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

the most famous relativistic equation.

==Force==

Classically, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

We can get the equivalent relativistic equation simply by replacing 3-vectors with 4-vectors and ''t'' with &amp;tau;, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = \frac{d\underline{p}}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

Provided the rest mass is constant, as it is for all simple systems, we can rewrite this as  

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = m \underline{a}&lt;/math&gt;

We already know about &lt;u&gt;''a''&lt;/u&gt; so we can now write

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{F} = \gamma^4 \left( \mathbf{F}, 
\frac{ \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} }{c} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The temporal component of this is essentially the ''power'', the rate of change of energy with time, as might be expected from energy being the temporal component of momentum.

==Accelerated Frames and Event Horizons==

Figure: Spacetime diagram showing the world line of the origin of a reference frame undergoing constant acceleration.  

We know this world line is an hyperbola, with asymptotes ''x''=&amp;plusmn;''ct''. Looking at the diagram show another property.

'''No''' light from the 'twilight zone', where ''x'' is smaller than ''ct'', can  '''ever''' reach the accelerated observer. Hence, no event in the twilight zone can affect the observer. 

Conversely, there is a region, where ''x'' is smaller than -''ct'', which '''no''' light from the accelerated observer can '''ever''' reach. Hence the observer can not affect any events in this region.

Because of this we call the two aymptotes ''event horizons''. In some ways, they are like one-way barriers in space-time. The accelerated observer can see objects vanishing behind an event horizon, but they never see any re-emerge from it.

These particular event horizons are observer dependent, as are all event horizons in special relativity. However, general relativity permits event-horizons which are observer independent.

We are not going to prove this, but we can some idea about how event horizons apply to general relativity by using its basic principle, called the equivalence principle by Einstein: that gravity is nothing more than an inertial force. 

This means that gravity is locally indistinguishable from forces due to acceleration; if the elevator doors are closed, we can't tell whether we are stationary in a 1g gravity field or being accelerated at 1g in zero gravity.

This suggests that something can be learned about general relativity by examining the properties of accelerated reference frames

Now, since the gravitational force on the Earth points downward, it follows that we must be constantly accelerating upward as we stand on the surface of the Earth. The obvious problem with this interpretation of gravity is that we don't appear to be moving away from the center of the Earth, which would seem to be a natural consequence of such an acceleration. 

However, the calculation of the previous chapter shows that even though the object associated with the curved world line in the figure above is accelerating away from the origin, it always remains the same distance (in its own frame) from the origin. In other words, even though we are accelerating away from the center of the Earth, the distance to the center of the Earth remains constant!

Therefore, because of the equivalence principle, we can expect to see the same things as an accelerated observer in special relativity, ''including an event horizon.''

For acceleration in special relativity, ''inertial'' objects pass the event horizon at speed ''c'' at time infinity, ''relative to the observer''.

Similarly, in general relativity, ''freely falling'' objects pass the event horizon at speed ''c'' at time infinity, ''relative to a static observer.''
By reversing the trajectories we can conclude that at the event horizon the escape velocity is ''c'', i.e gravity is so strong light can not escape.

Thus, using the equivalence principle, and behaviour under acceleration in special relativity, we've predicted black holes.

There isn't actually an event horizon inside the earth, since the mass of the earth is not concentrated in a point and the earth can only be treated as a point mass while outside the earth's surface, which lies outside where the event horizon should otherwise have been.

==The red shift==

Spacetime diagram for explaining the gravitational red shift. 

Light emitted at a lower level in a gravitational field has its frequency reduced as it travels to a higher level. This phenomenon is called the gravitational red shift. 

We can see why this happens by using the principle of equivalence. Being in a gravitational field is equivalent to being in an accelerated frame, so knowing how the doppler shift works in such a frame will tell us how it works in a gravitational field. 

We view the process of light emission and absorption from the the unaccelerated or inertial frame, as shown in the figure above. In this reference frame the observer of the light is accelerating to the right, as indicated by the curved red world line, which is equivalent to a gravitational force to the left. 

The light is emitted at point A with frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; by a source which is stationary at this instant. At this instant the observer is also stationary in this frame. However, by the time the light gets to the observer, they have a velocity to the right which means that the observer measures a Doppler shifted freqency &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;/math&gt; for the light. Since the observer is moving away from the source, &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, as indicated above.

The relativistic Doppler shift is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\omega'}{\omega} = \sqrt{ \frac{1 - U/c}{1 + U/c}} , &lt;/math&gt;

so we need to compute ''U''/''c''. The line of simultaneity for the observer at point B goes through the origin, and is thus given by line segment OB. The slope of this line is ''U''/''c'', where ''U'' is the velocity of the observer at point B. From the figure we see that this slope is also given by the ratio ''X' /X''. 

Equating these, eliminating ''X'' in favor of ''L'' = &amp;radic;(''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''X''&amp;prime;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the actual invariant distance of the observer from the origin, and substituting into the previous equation results in our gravitational red shift formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
\frac{\omega'}{\omega} &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{ \frac{X - X'}{X + X'} } &amp; = &amp;
\sqrt{\frac{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} - X'}{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} + X'} }\\
&amp; =&amp; \frac{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} - X'}{L} &amp; =&amp; \frac{X-X'}{L}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X''&amp;prime; = 0, then there is no redshift, because the source is collocated with the observer. On the other hand, if the source is located at the origin, so ''X''&amp;prime;=''X'', the Doppler shifted frequency is zero. In addition, the light never gets to the observer, since the world line is asymptotic to the light world line passing through the origin. If the source is at a higher level in the gravitational field than the observer, so that ''X''&amp;prime; &lt; 0, then the frequency is shifted to a higher value, i. e., it becomes a ''blue shift''.

To see how this doppler shift relates to the strength of gravity, ''g'', and the distance ''h'' between the source and the observer, first note that

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{c^2}{g} \qquad X-X'=L-h &lt;/math&gt;

Making these substitutions gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega'}{\omega} = 1-\frac{gh}{c^2} \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

So the redshift is proportional to gravity.

Since this doppler shift doesn't depend on the type of wave we can conclude that it is actually caused by time dilation, just like the doppler shift due to relative motion.

That is, gravity slows down time.

==Energy and frequency==

In equation 1 ''gh'' is the change in gravitational potential energy so the change in frequency is proportional to change in potential energy, which suggests there might be a connection with energy conservation.

However, since we haven't yet established any connection between frequency and energy, we can't simply apply an energy conservation argument. Instead, we can argue in reverse, finding out what the energy-frequency relationship must be if energy is to be conserved.

Suppose we have two identical systems, both at rest in a uniform gravitational field ''g'' with initial energy ''E'' separated by a vertical distance ''h''.

The system has mass ''E''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, giving it potential energy, so the total energy of the two systems is initially 

:&lt;math&gt;E_i=2E - \frac{gh}{c^2}E &lt;/math&gt;

where the second term is due to the lesser potential energy of the lower system.

The lower system emits a burst of waves, frequency &amp;omega;, energy ''E''(&amp;omega;). When this reaches the upper system the waves have been
red-shifted to frequency &amp;omega;', energy ''E''(&amp;omega;'). This energy is absorbed by the upper system.

The total energy is now

:&lt;math&gt;E_f=E-E(\omega)+E+ E(\omega') - \left(E-E(\omega)\right)\frac{gh}{c^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since we want to preserve energy conservation, these two equations must give the same result. Equating them, we get

:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega') = E(\omega)(1-\frac{gh}{c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this with the doppler shift we see that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E(\omega')}{E(\omega)} = \frac{\omega'}{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;

which can only be true if ''E''(&amp;omega;) is proportional to &amp;omega;

I.e, energy conservation implies ''energy is proportional to frequency'', which is one of the axioms of quantum theory.

We could equally well have started with the quantum result and proved the gravitational red shift must exist. Either theory requires the other for consistency.

Since energy and frequency are each the temporal components of a four-vector, their being proportional implies the four-vectors themselves, and their spatial components, are also proportional. So, for waves, momentum is proportional to '''k'''.

Remember too, we saw earlier, when we looked at Hamilton's equations, that classical mechanics would be equivalent to a theory of anisotropic waves, in the geometrical optics limit, if energy were proportional to frequency and momentum to wave number. This proportionality isn't just required for energy conservation, it would make possible a theory uniting waves and particles.

None of this actually proves the proportionality, doing that requires experiment, but it does make it a natural assumptiom, which is indeed
confirmed by experiment.

Because of all this, from now on we'll assume that energy and frequency are related in this way, with the constant of proportionality being &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (c\mathbf{p}, E) = \hbar (c\mathbf{k}, \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

==Gravity and curvature==

The gravitational redshift also implies that space is curved. We can see this by considering a rectangle in space-time.

Without gravity, if we start at some point A, wait for time ''t'', then move at light-speed to the right for a distance ''h'', we get to the same place, B, as if we move at light-speed for a distance ''h'' then wait for time ''t'' at rest with respect to A. &lt;!-- diagram? --&gt;

With gravity, if we follow the first path, we rise a distance of ''ct'' then wait for time ''t''. On the second path, we begin by waiting for time ''t'', ''but this is dilated by gravity.'' To an observer at B we appear to be waiting for a time ''t''(1+''gh''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) before we start, so we end up at B later than on the first path. 

Thus, with gravity, it matters which order we add distance vectors in. This can't happen if space is flat, so ''space must be curved.''

To describe how it's curved we'd need the techniques of General Relativity.

==Potential Momentum==

In classical physics we know that kinematics can often be described by a potential energy alone. Now we've seen that in relativity the energy is just the temporal component of the momentum 4-vector, so we should expect the same of the potential energy. To see how this works, we'll reason by analogy from the classical case. 

For a free, non-relativistic particle of mass ''m'', the total energy ''E'' equals the kinetic energy ''K'' and is related to the momentum &amp;Pi; of the particle by

:&lt;math&gt; E = K = \frac{| \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2}{2m} \qquad \mbox{(free, non-relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt;

In the non-relativistic case, the momentum is  &amp;Pi;= ''m'''v''''', where '''v''' is the particle velocity.

If the particle is not free, but is subject to forces associated with a potential energy ''U''(''x'',''y'',''z''), then the equation must be modified to account for the contribution of ''U'' to the total energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = K = \frac{| \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2}{2m} \qquad \mbox{(non-free, non-relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt; 

The force on the particle is related to the potential energy by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = - \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} , \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} , \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \right) . &lt;/math&gt; 	

For a free, relativistic particle, we have
:&lt;math&gt; E = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(free, relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

The obvious way to add forces to the relativistic case is by rewriting this equation with a potential energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(incomplete!)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

However &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Pi = (\Pi, E/c)&lt;/math&gt; is a four-vector, so an equation with something subtracted from just one of the components of this four-vector is not relativistically invariant. In other words, this equation doesn't obey the principle of relativity, and therefore cannot be correct!

How can we fix this problem? One way is to define a new four-vector with ''U/c'' being its timelike part and some new vector '''Q''' being its spacelike part:
:&lt;math&gt; \underline{Q} \equiv ( \mathbf{ Q} , U/c) \qquad \mbox{(potential four-momentum)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

We then subtract '''Q''' from the momentum '''&amp;Pi;'''. When we do this, equation (13.5) becomes
:&lt;math&gt; E - U = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{ Q}|^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(non-free, relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt;

The quantity '''Q''' is called the potential momentum and &lt;u&gt;''Q''&lt;/u&gt; is the potential four-momentum.

If |'''&amp;Pi;'''-'''Q'''| is much smaller than ''mc'', this becomes approximately

:&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2m}\left( \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{Q} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This expression for the energy has the same form as the Hamiltonian we looked at for classical [[General Mechanics/Velocity Dependent Forces|velocity dependent forces]], so we know it predicts a force perpendicular to the velocity, when the condition is met. It turns out to be perpendicular even when the condition is met.

In classical physics the potential momentum is an optional extra. In relativity it is a necessary part of any potential field.

Some additional terminology is useful. We define
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ p} \equiv \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{ Q} \qquad \mbox{(kinetic momentum}) &lt;/math&gt;

as the kinetic momentum since in the classical case it reduces to ''m'''v'''''. In order to avoid confusion, we rename '''&amp;Pi;''' the total momentum. Thus, the total momentum equals the kinetic plus the potential momentum, in analogy with energy.

&lt;!-- Now superfluous
So far, we have shown that the introduction of a potential momentum complements the potential energy so as to make the energy-momentum relationship for a particle relativistically invariant. However, we as yet have no idea what causes potential momentum and what it does to the affected particle. We shall put off answering the former question and address only the latter at this point. A hint comes from the corresponding behavior of energy. The total energy of a particle is related to the quantum mechanical frequency &amp;omega; of the particle, and the total momentum is related to its wave vector '''k''':
:&lt;math&gt; E = \hbar \omega \qquad\qquad \boldsymbol{\Pi} = \hbar \mathbf{ k} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

However, the kinetic energy and the kinetic momentum are related to the particle's velocity '''v''':

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = \frac{mc^2}{(1 - v^2 / c^2 )^{1/2}} \qquad 
\mathbf{p}= \boldsymbol{\Pi}-\mathbf{Q} = 
\frac{m \mathbf{ v}}{(1 - v^2 / c^2 )^{1/2}} , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' = |'''v'''|.

The relationship between kinetic momentum and velocity can be proven by dividing equation (13.7) by &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a dispersion relation and then computing the group velocity, which we equate to the particle velocity. However, we will not do this here.
--&gt;

==Conservation of 4 momentum==

We earlier introduced the ideas of energy and momentum conservation. In other words, if we have a number of particles isolated from the rest of the universe, each with momentum '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then particles may be created and destroyed and they may collide with each other.

In these interactions the energy and momentum of each particle may change, but the sum total of all the energy and the sum total of all the momentum remains constant with time:

:&lt;math&gt; E = \sum_i E_i = \mbox{const} \qquad 
\mathbf{p} = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i = \mbox{const}  &lt;/math&gt;

The expression is simpler in terms of four-momentum:

:&lt;math&gt; \underline{p} = \sum_i \underline{p}_i = \mbox{const} &lt;/math&gt;

At this point a statement such as the one above should ring alarm bells. Just what does it mean to say that the total energy and momentum remain constant with time in the context of relativity? Which time? The time in which reference frame?

Suppose two particles exchange four-momentum remotely at the time indicated by the fat horizontal bar in the left panel. Conservation of four-momentum implies that

&lt;math&gt; \underline{p}_A + \underline{p}_B = \underline{p}'_A + \underline{p}'_B
&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripted letters correspond to the particle labels in the figure. Primed values refer to the momentum after the exchange while no primes indicates values before the exchange.

Now view the exchange from the reference frame in the right panel. A problem with four-momentum conservation exists in the region between the thin horizontal lines. In this region particle B has already transferred its four-momentum, but it has yet to be received by particle A. In other words, four-momentum is not conserved in this reference frame!

This problem is so serious that we must eliminate the concept of action at a distance from the repertoire of physics. The only way to have particles interact remotely and still conserve four-momentum in all reference frames is to assume that all remote interactions are mediated by another particle, or by a field.

If the force is being mediated by a particle then first, particle A emits particle C in a manner which conserves the four-momentum. Second, particle C is absorbed by particle B in a similarly conservative interaction. 

If the force is being mediated by a field then first, particle A emits wave C, with momentum proportional to its wavenumber in a manner, which conserves the four-momentum. Wave C then travels at ''c'' or less until it is absorbed by particle B in a similarly conservative interaction. 

We'll see that in quantum theory the difference between a particle and a field vanishes, so these two pictures actually both describe the same mechanism a different perspective. Which every picture we use, four-momentum is conserved at all times in all reference frames.

In other words, momentum and energy are transferred from particle A to particle B in a two step process. In between the momentum resides in a particle or field.</text>

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== A-Level computing ==

Thanks. I'm currently studying the AQA course so I'll be able to update as I glide (hopefully!) through it. [[User:TheGenius1|TheGenius1]] 17:50, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== Hello ==

Hi I´m Oceancetaceen, want to ask you something about Wikistudy. I come from Germany Duisburg Rheinhausen and want to ask you: Are you the main author and did you need a Germanbook for it, you could be look on the german wikibook pages, there I work mainly and write books for school, please reanswere on my dicussion page. 

I sorry that I cant so many english, do you know germans in english Wikibooks?--[[User:Oceancetaceen|Oceancetaceen]] ([[User talk:Oceancetaceen|talk]]) 15:29, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

== defining tables w/ integrity rule ==

Hi Pluke. I've been looking at your book - our curricula are not the same as the UK's, but similar - and I came across the DDL page. The primary key definition seems to be a bit different from what I've learnt at school. I'm wondering if this 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE crooks
(
ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
NAME CHAR(16),
GENDER CHAR(6),
DOB DATE,
TOWN CHAR(20),
NUMSCARS INTEGER
)&lt;/source&gt;

What I learnt at school was:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE crooks
(
ID INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
NAME CHAR(16),
GENDER CHAR(6),
DOB DATE,
TOWN CHAR(20),
NUMSCARS INTEGER,
PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);&lt;/source&gt;

I've tested yours and it works well, but I wonder if your code tells the RDBMS that the field is supposed to be not null and unique, or if that's already 'implied' in this code. Of course, RDBMSes are supposed to alert the data entry operator if the key field is null or non-unique, but I think it's better to define it explicitly. Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) &lt;/small&gt; 12:31, 25 January 2013 (UTC)

== Can you explain your edit revertion? ==

Hi , 

Why did you revert my revertion on a page?&lt;br&gt;
I reverted that page because the content was quite mixed-up , attribution content was changed without reason(names) and there did not seem to be anything proper with that set of edits.&lt;br&gt;
Of course I may be wrong , so I'm interested to hear your response.

== Adding BBC BASIC answers ==

[[A-level Computing/AQA/Problem Solving, Programming, Data Representation and Practical Exercise/Skeleton code/2011 Exam/Section B]]

I added some alternative answer's using BBC BASIC (which is still highly regarded in the UK). It's also something that's provided on the Raspberry Pi (as Brandy).

If it assists there is a manual for the Windows version (which for most practical purposes is the same as BASIC V on Arm/RISC OS based systems (the exception being related to the host platform)  here http://www.cix.co.uk/~rrussell/bbcwin/manual/index.html.

Many many years ago there was a British publication called 30 Hour Basic, which may also prove useful.

===Formulating Water Conservation Plans===

Ten Key Steps to Planning a Successful Water Conservation Program*
*Identify conservation goals
*Develop a water-use profile and forecast
*Evaluate planned facilities
*Identify and evaluate conservation measures
*Identify and assess conservation incentives
*Analyze benefits and costs
*Select conservation measures and incentives
*Prepare and implement the conservation plan
*Integrate conservation and supply plans, modify forecasts
*Monitor, evaluate and revise program as needed

=== Files and channels ===
In addition to the functionalities known from C's stdio, Tcl offers more commands that deal with files, similar to what shells provide, though often a bit more verbose. Here are some examples:

 glob *.tcl

List all files in the current directory that match the pattern *.tcl.

 file copy /from/path/file.ext /to/path
 .
 file delete /from/path/file.ext
 .
 file rename before.txt after.txt
 .
 cd /an/other/directory
 .
 pwd
To let code temporarily execute in another directory, use this pattern:
 set here [pwd]
 cd $someotherdir
 #... code here
 cd $here

More precisely, many &quot;file&quot; operations work in general on &quot;channels&quot;, which can be
* standard channels (stdin, stdout, stderr)
* files as opened with '''open ...'''
* pipes as opened with '''open |...''
* sockets (TCP)

=== File names ===
Files are often addressed with ''path names'', which indicate their position in the directory tree. Like Unix, Tcl uses &quot;/&quot; as path separator, while on Windows &quot;\&quot; is the native way - which brings trouble not only to Tcl, but even to C, because &quot;\&quot; is the escape character on both, so that e.g. \t is parsed as horizontal tab, \n as newline, etc. Fortunately Windows accepts natively &quot;/&quot; as well, so you can use forward slash in both Tcl and C programs as path separator without worries. However, you still have to take care of escape sequences. One stopgap measure is 
* to escape the escape character, i.e. write \\ for \, or
* brace backslashed names, e.g. {\foo\bar\grill.txt}
But Tcl allows to use the &quot;normal&quot; separator / in almost all situations, so you're safer off with that. Unfortunately, things are sad for Mac users, since MacOS (before X) accepts only &quot;:&quot; as file separator. 

If you need to, here's ways to convert between the two forms:
 % file normalize \\foo\\bar\\grill.txt
 C:/foo/bar/grill.txt
 % file nativename /foo/bar/grill.txt
 \foo\bar\grill.txt

You can even use file join command:
''file join arg1 arg2 ... argN''

Tcl will then take care of all platform dependent details to create platform independent path. For example:

''set somepath [file join foo bar grill.txt]''

will result in following path (on windows machine): foo/bar/grill.txt

=== Input and output ===
Tcl's input/output commands are pretty closely based on those from C's stdio (just strip off the leading ''f''):

* set handle ['''open''' ''filename ?mode?'']
* set data ['''read''' ''$handle ?int?'']
* '''tell''' ''$handle''
* '''seek''' ''$handle offset ?from?''
* '''puts''' ''?-nonewline? ?$handle? content''
* '''gets''' ''$handle ?varname?''
* '''close''' ''$handle''

C's ''printf'' functionality is split in two steps:
* format the data into a string with '''format''' (which is very much like ''sprintf'')
* output the resulting string with '''puts'''. For example,
 puts $handle [format &quot;%05d %s&quot; $number $text]

To process a text file line by line, you have two choices. If the file is smaller than several megabytes, you can read it just in one go:
 set f [open $filename]
 foreach line [split [read $f] \n] {
     # work with $line here ...
 }
 close $f
For files of any big size, you can read the lines one by one (though this is slightly slower than the above approach):
 set f [open $filename]
 while {[gets $f line] &gt;= 0} {
     # work with $line here ...
 }
 close $f
 
Finally, if you can format your file so that it is executable Tcl code, the following reading method is fastest:
 source $filename

To &quot;touch a file&quot;, i.e. create it if not exists, and in any case update its modification time, you can use this:
 proc touch name {close [open $name a]}

=== &quot;Binary&quot; files ===

All files are made of bytes, which are made of bits, which are binary. The term &quot;binary&quot; with files relates mostly to the fact that they can contain bytes of any value, and line-ends (Carriage Return+Newline in the DOS/Windows world) are not to be translated. Tcl can handle &quot;binary&quot; files without a problem -- just configure the channel as binary after opening:
 set fp [open tmp.jpg]
 fconfigure $fp -translation binary
 set content [read $fp]
 close $fp
Now the variable ''content'' holds the file's contents, byte for byte.

To test whether a file is &quot;binary&quot;, in the sense that it contains NUL bytes:
 proc binary? filename {
    set f [open $filename]
    set data [read $f 1024]
    close $f
    expr {[string first \x00 $data]&gt;=0}
 }

=== The file command ===
Many useful operations with files are collected in the '''file''' command. The first argument tells which operation to do:

* file atime name ?time? 
* file attributes name 
* file attributes name ?option? 
* file attributes name ?option value option value...? 
* file channels ?pattern? - returns the handles of currently open files
* file copy ?-force? ?- -? source target 
* file copy ?-force? ?- -? source ?source ...? targetDir 
* file delete ?-force? ?- -? pathname ?pathname ... ? 
* file dirname name - e.g. [file dirname /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; /foo/bar
* file executable name 
* file exists name 
* file extension name - e.g. [file extension /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; .txt
* file isdirectory name 
* file isfile name 
* file join name ?name ...? 
* file link ?-linktype? linkName ?target? 
* file lstat name varName 
* file mkdir dir ?dir ...? - creates one or more directories (folders)
* file mtime name ?time? 
* file nativename name 
* file normalize name 
* file owned name 
* file pathtype name 
* file readable name 
* file readlink name 
* file rename ?-force? ?- -? source target 
* file rename ?-force? ?- -? source ?source ...? targetDir 
* file rootname name - e.g. [file rootname /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; /foo/bar/grill
* file separator ?name? 
* file size name 
* file split name - e.g [file split /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; {foo bar grill.txt}
* file stat name varName 
* file system name 
* file tail name - e.g. [file tail /foo/bar/grill.txt] -&gt; grill.txt
* file type name 
* file volumes - Windows: returns your &quot;drive letters&quot;, e.g {A:/ C:/}
* file writable name

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Whitenoise. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Whitenoise~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

[[Image:Seitan.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chunks of seitan]]
'''Seitan''' is a food made from [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] protein that has been extracted from wheat flour. It has a springy texture, with protein strands similar to those in chicken running through it, making it a reasonable replacement for meat in vegan or vegetarian dishes.

== Ingredients ==
* 10 oz (280g) High-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour)
* Water

== Procedure ==

# Add 2 cups water to 10 oz (280g) high-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour).
# Knead together until '''well-combined''' and elastic. It is advisable to keep hands wet so that the gluten doesn't stick to the hands.
# Cover with water and place in refrigerator for 1 hour. 
# Knead under water until water is cloudy; dump cloudy water and replace with clear, cold water. In the beginning the dough can still easily dissolve underwater so it is advisable to only cautiously squeeze it against the bowl. Later you might find it easier to knead over the water, squeezing out the water, and only to dip the mass into the water to wash off the starch, if the mass contains too much water you easily wash out gluten as well. The enriched water can be used to gain the insoluble starch, which settles on the bottom of the container, and what remains can serve as a base for grain milk.
# Continue kneading and replacing water until water remains clear after kneading.
# Divide gluten mass into loaf- or roll-shaped halves. At this point, there are several things you can add to the mass.
## Adding [[Cookbook:soy_sauce|soy sauce]] is recommended; this is traditional in the making of seitan.
## Spices. For example, the seitan can simulate Italian sausage by adding the correct spices, or adding poultry seasoning can make the seitan more similar to chicken or turkey.
## Adding [[Cookbook:Nutritional_Yeast|nutritional yeast]] is recommended, particularly if those consuming the seitan are vegetarian, and especially vegan. The B12 in nutritional yeast is a vitamin that is usually obtained through meats, eggs and/or dairy products.
# Place halves in pot, cover with vegetable broth or ''[[Cookbook:dashi|dashi]]''.
# Bring to a boil.
# Reduce heat to simmer; simmer for 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
# Remove from heat and serve as desired or use in place of meat.

Unused portions of Seitan can be kept in broth under refrigeration for up to a week, or can be frozen (drained from broth) for up to a month.

This will make approximately 28 oz (790g). of gluten. Because of their high protein content, gluten &quot;steaks&quot; can be grilled and fried to good effect.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* To avoid the washing process you can also buy 100% gluten flour in some stores. This flour would require only enough water to form it into a solid mass.
* Gluten created using just gluten flour can be rubbery and has a very &quot;gluteny&quot; taste. Adding 1 part garbanzo bean flour (Chick pea flour or gram flour) to 4 parts gluten flour makes for a less chewy texture and a better flavor.

'''Seitan burgers''' (''[[wikipedia:Schnitzel|vegetarian Schnitzel]]'') have a consistency similar to that of [[w:fillet|fillet]] and are easy to cover with breading.
For the breading the usual spices for meat can be used.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Gluten|Gluten]] (see [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]] for how to gain gluten from wheat flour)
* [[Cookbook:Soy_sauce|Soy sauce]]
* Salt
* optional:
** Spices (e.g. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]])
** [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
** Breading: [[Cookbook:breading|breading mix]], salt, pepper, optional: [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Savory|savory]]

==Procedure==
* Take 25% (volume) more water than gluten flour.
* Mix liquid ingredients (e.g. soy sauce) with the water.
* Mix solid ingredients (e.g. spices) with the flour. It is much easier to mix solid and liquid ingredients separately than adding ingredients to the gluten dough later, as it is very rubbery and sticky.
* Make gluten dough from 100% gluten flour (or use wheat flour, see above) and water. The dough should be suitable for kneading.
* The patties can be formed easily by hand and are sticky enough to pick up the breading mix easily.
* The finished patties can be fried in an oiled pan. Don't use too much oil but enough to let the breading pick up some oil on both sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to start programming in Common Lisp, you need to obtain a Common Lisp implementation. There are many of them available for most operating systems. There are both free and commercial implementations.

== Browser-based ==

To try out Common Lisp commands without installing anything, the most practical tools are browser-based implementations:
* [http://davazp.net/jscl/jscl.html JSCL] ([https://github.com/davazp/jscl#jscl about])
* [http://lisperator.net/s/slip/?ide Slip] ([http://lisperator.net/slip/impl about])

There are also online REPL environments for other Lisp dialects, which can be useful:
* [http://repl.it/languages/Scheme repl.it] (uses the [[Scheme Programming|Scheme]] dialect, but with [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~novak/schemevscl.html minor] [http://dept-info.labri.fr/~strandh/Teaching/Langages-Enchasses/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/diff-scheme.html differences], can be used for basic Common Lisp commands)
* [http://himera.herokuapp.com/ Himera] (uses the [[Clojure Programming|Clojure]] dialect)

== Complete environments ==

=== Lispbox ===

[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/lispbox/ Lispbox] is an attempt to provide a newbie-friendly Common Lisp environment working out of the box. In addition to a Common Lisp implementation, Lispbox includes:
* [[Emacs]], a powerful and extensible text editor,
* SLIME, an Emacs extension which provides very good Common Lisp integration,
* ASDF, a Common Lisp extension for loading and installing code libraries and
* examples from the book &quot;Practical Common Lisp.&quot;

Using Lispbox should be quite easy. After running it, Emacs should display a Lisp prompt, where you can edit code interactively. Try to paste examples from this book and see what happens. If you don't want your code to be lost, you should learn how to manipulate files and buffers in Emacs, which is outside the scope of this book (check out the tutorial that comes with Emacs, which you can either find through the editor's &quot;Help&quot; menu or by hitting '''Ctrl-H, T''' or '''C-h t''' in Emacs-speak). Once you created a new file with Emacs that contains Lisp code, check if you're in Lisp mode (if the file's extension is .lisp, then you probably are) and hit '''C-c C-k''' to compile and load the whole file, or '''C-c C-c''' to compile and load the top-level expression you're currently editing.  

''More info on using Slime should be included somewhere''

=== Able ===

[http://common-lisp.net/project/able/ Able] is an editor where installing libraries can be done by putting it in the directory able/systems. It hopes to work out of the box. It also includes some libraries by default.

== Free implementations ==

'''Note''': Even if you don't want to install Lispbox, it's still highly recommended to use the Emacs/SLIME combination to interface with these implementations. The reason is that the text console which they provide is quite awkward to work with, so most users prefer a nicer environment like the one SLIME provides.

=== GNU CLISP ===

[http://clisp.cons.org GNU CLISP] is a popular free implementation which can run on Windows and most Unix-like systems. If you're using Windows, you don't have much choice but to use CLISP. CLISP provides all ANSI Common Lisp features and is quite easy to install.

==== Features ====

* Full Unicode support
* Localised interface and compiler messages
* High portability: runs practically anywhere
* Compiles to portable bytecode (most or all other Common Lisp implementations compile to native code)
* Small memory footprint
* Arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic

==== Shortcomings ====

* Slow at number crunching

=== CMUCL ===

[http://www.cons.org/cmucl/ CMU Common Lisp] is a high performance Common Lisp implementation.

==== Features ====

* Non-native threading (“green” threads; x86 only)
* Produces fast code due to its optimizing compiler that produces native code
* Fast compiler

==== Shortcomings ====

* Relatively low portability (see the [http://www.cons.org/cmucl/platforms.html CMUCL portability webpage] for a list of supported platforms)

=== SBCL ===

[http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/ Steel Bank Common Lisp], a fork of CMU Common Lisp, is a portable implementation featuring native code compilation. It's easily the most popular Common Lisp compiler on platforms which neither CMUCL nor CCL will run on and an excellent choice even on those mainly because of its better debugging support (for instance, its compiler yields more warnings and is said to be stricter regarding ANSI compliance).

==== Features ====

* Unicode support
* Quite portable: runs on Unix-like systems including Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.
* Native threading support on Intel-based platforms
* Good speed because of the optimizing compiler that produces native code

==== Shortcomings ====

* Slow compilation speed (SBCL performs *many* optimizations, which can be slow)

=== Clozure CL ===

[http://www.clozure.com/clozurecl.html Clozure CL] is a Common Lisp implementation the PowerPC and AMD64. There is a pre-release x86 version. It is easily the most popular choice on Mac OS X, but it runs equally well on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD/amd64 systems; there is also a beta for Windows. On Mac OS X, CCL features a Cocoa interface.

==== Features ====

* Full Unicode support
* A fast compiler that produces equally fast code
* A Cocoa interface for Mac OS X GUI development
* Native threading

=== Embeddable CL (ECL)===

[http://ecls.sourceforge.net/ ECL] is a Common Lisp implementation focusing on portability and embeddability.  These goals are obtained by translating CL into C and passing that to a C compiler (typically gcc).  It runs on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Windows, running on top of the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and PowerPC processors.

==== Features ====

* Unicode support
* Translates CL into C, which produces relatively fast native code
* Interpreter which circumvents the slow build times
* Load on demand.  ECL defers loading modules until needed
* Ability to output portable C source files that can be compiled on other architectures
* Call C from Lisp and call Lisp from C (i.e. ECL can be used as an extension language for any program that can call a C function)
* Native threading

==== Shortcomings ====

* Relatively slow compilation method (gcc is slow, maybe if you use a faster C compiler)
* Relatively fragile error handling (i.e. you can seg-fault ECL fairly easily)

=== Armed Bear Common Lisp ===

[http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/ ABCL] is a Common Lisp implementation that runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine.  It provides a runtime system, a compiler that compiles Lisp source to JVM bytecode, and an interactive REPL for program development.

==== Features ====

* Produces portable Java bytecode
* Java libraries are transparently available

==== Shortcomings ====

* Quite slower than other implementations

== Commercial implementations ==

* [http://www.franz.com/ Allegro Common Lisp (ACL)]
* [http://www.lispworks.com/ LispWorks]
* [http://www.cormanlisp.com/ Corman Lisp]
* [http://www.scieneer.com/scl/ Scieneer Common Lisp]

There are free trial versions of Allegro, LispWorks, and Corman Lisp, which can be handy for learning the language. All of them work on Windows.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
==What is iLife?==
Often cited as a reason to use a Mac over a Windows PC, iLife is a suite of six digital media applications that let you organize photos, music, and videos; create home movies, songs, and podcasts; and publish your projects to the internet and DVDs. Although it isn't included with Mac OS X, it ''is'' included with every new Mac that Apple ships, and is available separately for $79.

==About this Wikibook==
Although iLife is considered very easy to use compared to the competition, using its six applications can prove difficult at times. New users may find they need help before they can use iLife by themselves. In addition, power users may wish to learn about some of iLife 06's new features.

In the past, the preferred way of learning how to use iLife was a traditional book. Unfortunately, these books can be expensive, especially when in color, which is important for a book pertaining to editing movies and photos. Many users simply try to learn iLife by themselves, often missing out on important features and time-saving tricks.

With the advent of the wikibook, you can learn iLife online for free. Don't worry, there are no hidden charges for using this site.

Wikibooks are great because anyone can edit them. See a confusing explanation of how to do something? Once you figure out a better way to explain, come back and fix it for everyone else. In a real book, you can't help other readers understand something the author explained poorly.

In addition, unlike traditional bound books, Wikibooks are always up-to-date. This is especially important for iTunes, the music-managing app in iLife, that is updated frequently over the course of the year. Features are added, new iPods debut, and the interface improves.

Keep in mind that this book assumes you already know how to use Mac OS X as a whole. If you don't, please read our companion wikibook, [[Mac OS X Tiger]].

This wikibook also covers Front Row, which while not part of iLife, is heavily dependent on it.

==Using this Wikibook==
===Structure===
This wikibook is divided into six &quot;parts&quot;, one for each application. Each part is divided into chapters. There is also an appendix on Front Row.

===Nesting===
Arrows &gt; Like &gt; These are used to show menus. For instance, &quot;Open the menu labeled File. In that menu is an item labeled Save As. Click Save As &quot; could be abbreviated to &quot;File &gt; Save As...&quot;. 

Likewise, these &gt; arrows are also used for file locations. &quot;Macintosh HD &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities&quot; is shorthand for &quot;Open the Macintosh HD folder. Inside is a folder labeled Applications. Inside that is another folder labeled Utilities. Open that.&quot;

===Right Click===
Another convention in this Wikibook is the use of &quot;right click&quot;. Mac OS X supports both one-button and two-button mice. On a two-button mouse, when told to &quot;right click&quot;, simply press the right mouse button. But if using a one-button mouse,  hold down the &quot;control&quot; key on your keyboard while you click.

===Info Boxes===
A computer book mainstay, info boxes have called attention to important items for ages. This wikibook is no exception, offering four different flavors.

{{Mac Note Box|Notes contain handy &quot;sidebar&quot; information that doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the chapter. We recomend reading them, since they're often quite interesting.}}

{{Mac Warning Box|Look out! Not reading these yellow Warning boxes could cause headaches and the loss of time, data, or equipment!}}

{{Mac Trick Box|Essential? Maybe not. Fun? Definitely. Learn about extra features and timesavers in these boxes.}}

{{Mac Background Box|Gather 'round for a bit of iLife history.}}

=Introduction=
Welcome to the Discussion page for the Mac OS X Tiger Wikibook! This page is divided into two main sections: the first is a guidelines section for outlining how to write this wikibook, and the second is a discussion section for discussing the guidelines and the wikibook itself.

=Guidelines=
==Who is this book Designed for?==
This book is designed for users with users with moderate computer experience. Assume that they know everything about the Tiger desktop and the Finder, and they know the general purpose of everything in the Mac OS X (e.g. they understand the concept of &quot;System Preferences&quot;, even if they don't actually know what all of the controls do).

==Detail==
Make sure this wikibook covers every detail of iLife: don't over-simplify.

==Priorities==
Applications should be written about in this order:
#iTunes
#iPhoto
#iMovie
#GarageBand
#iDVD
#iWeb

==Chapter Labels==
Chapters are labeled according to how far along they are:
*Empty - The chapter has not yet been created.
*Sparse - The chapter has gaping holes and desperately needs more content.
*Developing - The chapter is coming along, but is still not good enough.
*Developed - The chapter needs more content and polish.
*Almost Complete - The chapter needs a final layer of polish, and needs screenshots added.
*Complete - The chapter is done. While you may edit it, please leave it largely the same.

Labels should be in [brackets].

In addition, an &quot;Out of Date&quot; label should be used on chapters that contain information pertaining to an older version of a piece of software. This label should be in {braces}

==No Advertising!==
It's legitimate and helpful to mention an application (freeware, shareware, open source, commercial, or otherwise), brand of hardware, or website, but this wikibook shouldn't be a platform for advertising, nor should any tutorial contained in it ever rely on a non-Apple product.

==Book, Not Encyclopedia==
Remember that this is a book, not an encyclopedia. Keep a casual tone. This book is supposed to be the iLife user's best friend, not a dry encyclopedia of information.

==Screenshots==
Put in color screenshots, product images, and diagrams in important places. Use them when necessary, but never frivolously, so the pages can load over a dial-up connection. Also make sure the screenshots do not show any &quot;haxies&quot;, themes, etc. Screenshots should be taken only in Mac OS X Tiger. Keep the screens uncluttered and familiar to the average user (for instance, use bundled Apple wallpaper, don't over-customise toolbars, and don't show any alternative icons). Also, when talking about a window or a menu, the screenshot should not include anything else.

Screenshots should be centered except when absolutely necessary, always appear as thumbnails, and be labeled in this format: &quot;Fig 1. Here is a caption, which is relativly dry and does not contain instructions.&quot;

==Tables==
Tables should be used whenever appropriate.

*Table width should be set to 600px
*The border should be set to 0
*Cell Padding should be set to 3
*Cells should be either 4D804D (dark green) or B5E3B5 (light green)
*Tables should be labeled in this fashion &quot;Table 1. This is a simple caption.&quot;

==Info Boxes==
Use Info Boxes whenever they make sense. Use the following templates:

  &lt;nowiki&gt; {{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' Put Warning text here.}}
  
  {{Info|'''NOTE:''' Put Note Text here.}}

  {{Info|'''TRICK:''' Put Trick Text here.}}

  {{Book_Box|'''BACKGROUND:''' Put Background Text here.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=Discussion=
Use this section to discuss the above guidelines.

Remember that English language Wikibooks are read by English speakers the world over, not just in America. For many, English might also not be their first language. Refrain therefore from &quot;americanizations&quot; and watch your spelling. There's nothing more confusing (or annoying in some cases) for Europeans than to see text full of unnecessary zzzzzz's!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Music has taken many forms since the invention of the gramophone in 1887. First there were vinyl records, then cassette tapes, then CDs. Fast forward to now. The era of music stored on CDs is coming to a close, and &quot;digital music&quot; (music stored in files on your computer's hard drive) is rapidly replacing it. To manage your collection of digital music, you use a specialized music-managing application. And Apple's iTunes is widely considered to be the best availible.

iTunes lets you:
*Organize the music files on your Mac.
*Turn your current CD collection into digital files.
*Burn custom mix CDs.
*Manage your iPod.
*Legally download a variety of media (music, video, and more) from the internet.

Haskell has at least four toolkits for programming a graphical interface:
* [[:w:WxHaskell|wxHaskell]] - provides a Haskell interface to the cross-platform wxWidgets toolkit which supports Windows, OS X, and Gtk+ on GNU/Linux, among others.
* [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Gtk2Hs Gtk2Hs] - provides a Haskell interface to the GTK+ library
* [http://code.google.com/p/hoc/ hoc] (documentation at [http://hoc.sourceforge.net/ sourceforge]) - provides a Haskell to Objective-C binding which allows users to access to the Cocoa library on MacOS X
* [http://qthaskell.berlios.de/ qtHaskell] - provides a set of Haskell bindings for the Qt Widget Library from Nokia 

In this tutorial, we will focus on the wxHaskell toolkit.

==Getting and running wxHaskell==

To install wxHaskell, look for your version of instructions at:
[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell/Linux GNU/Linux] 
[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell/Mac Mac]
[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell/Windows Windows]


or the [http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/download.html wxHaskell download page] and follow the installation instructions provided on the wxHaskell download page. Don't forget to register wxHaskell with GHC, or else it won't run (automatically registered  with Cabal). To compile source.hs (which happens to use wxHaskell code), open a command line and type:

 ghc -package wx source.hs -o bin

Code for GHCi is similar:

 ghci -package wx

You can then load the files from within the GHCi interface. To test if everything works, go to $wxHaskellDir/samples/wx ($wxHaskellDir is the directory where you installed it) and load (or compile) HelloWorld.hs. It should show a window with title &quot;Hello World!&quot;, a menu bar with File and About, and a status bar at the bottom, that says &quot;Welcome to wxHaskell&quot;.

If it doesn't work, you might try to copy the contents of the $wxHaskellDir/lib directory to the ghc install directory.

=== Shortcut for Debian and Ubuntu ===
If your operating system is Debian or Ubuntu, you can simply run these commands from the terminal:

    sudo apt-get install g++
    sudo apt-get install libglu-dev
    sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev

==Hello World==

Here's the basic Haskell &quot;Hello World&quot; program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = putStr &quot;Hello World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

It will compile just fine, but how do we actually do GUI work with this? First, you must import the wxHaskell library &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WX&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore&lt;/code&gt; has some more stuff, but we won't need that now.

To start a GUI, use &lt;code&gt;start gui&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, &lt;code&gt;gui&lt;/code&gt; is the name of a function which we'll use to build the interface. It must have an IO type. Let's see what we have:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module Main where

import Graphics.UI.WX

main :: IO ()
main = start gui

gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  --GUI stuff
&lt;/source&gt;

To make a frame, we use &lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt; which has the type &lt;code&gt;[Prop (Frame ())] -&gt; IO (Frame ())&lt;/code&gt;.
It takes a list of &quot;frame properties&quot; and returns the corresponding frame. We'll look deeper into properties later,
but a property is typically a combination of an attribute and a value. What we're interested in now is the title.
This is in the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute and has type &lt;code&gt;(Textual w) =&gt; Attr w String&lt;/code&gt;. The most important
thing here, is that it's a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Here's how we code it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

The operator &lt;code&gt;(:=)&lt;/code&gt; takes an attribute and a value and combines both into a property. Note that &lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;IO (Frame ())&lt;/code&gt;. You can change the type of &lt;code&gt;gui&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;IO (Frame ())&lt;/code&gt;, but it might be better just to add &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt;. Now we have our own GUI consisting of a frame with title &quot;Hello World!&quot;. Its source:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module Main where

import Graphics.UI.WX

main :: IO ()
main = start gui

gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
  return ()
&lt;/source&gt;

The result should look like the screenshot.  (It might look slightly different on Linux or MacOS X, on which wxhaskell also runs)

==Controls==
{{Info|From here on, its good practice to keep a browser window or tab open with the [http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/doc/ wxHaskell documentation]. It's also available in $wxHaskellDir/doc/index.html.}}

===A text label===

A simple frame doesn't do much. In this section, we're going to add some more elements. Let's start simple with a label. wxHaskell has a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;, but that's a layout thing. We won't be doing layout until next section. What we're looking for is a &lt;code&gt;staticText&lt;/code&gt;. It's in &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;staticText&lt;/code&gt; function takes a &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt; as argument along with a list of properties. Do we have a window? Yup! Look at &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Frame&lt;/code&gt;. There, we see that a &lt;code&gt;Frame&lt;/code&gt; is merely a type-synonym of a special sort of window. We'll change the code in &lt;code&gt;gui&lt;/code&gt; so it looks like this:

[[Image:WxHaskell2_winxp.png|thumb|Hello StaticText! (winXP)]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
  staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
  return ()
&lt;/source&gt;

Again, &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is an attribute of a &lt;code&gt;staticText&lt;/code&gt; object, so this works. Try it!

===A button===

Now for a little more interaction. A button. We're not going to add functionality to it until the section about events, but already something visible will happen when you click on it.

A &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; is a control, just like &lt;code&gt;staticText&lt;/code&gt;. Look it up in &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/code&gt;.

Again, we need a window and a list of properties. We'll use the frame again. &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is also an attribute of a button:

[[Image:WxHaskell3_winxp.png|thumb|Overlapping button and StaticText (winXP)]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
  staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
  button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
  return ()
&lt;/source&gt;

Load it into GHCi (or compile it with GHC) and... hey!? What's that? The button's been covered up by the label! We're going to fix that next.

==Layout==

The reason that the label and the button overlap, is that we haven't set a ''layout'' for our frame yet. Layouts are created using the functions found in the documentation of &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore.Layout&lt;/code&gt;. Note that you don't have to import &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore&lt;/code&gt; to use layouts.

The documentation says we can turn a member of the widget class into a layout by using the &lt;code&gt;widget&lt;/code&gt; function. Also, windows are a member of the widget class. But, wait a minute... we only have one window, and that's the frame! Nope... we have more, look at &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/code&gt; and click on any occurrence of the word ''Control''. You'll be taken to &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WXCore.WxcClassTypes&lt;/code&gt;, and it is there we see that a Control is also a type synonym of a special type of window. We'll need to change the code a bit, but here it is.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
  st &lt;- staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
  b &lt;- button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
  return ()
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can use &lt;code&gt;widget st&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;widget b&lt;/code&gt; to create a layout of the staticText and the button. &lt;code&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; is an attribute of the frame, so we'll set it here:

[[Image:WxHaskell4_winxp.png|thumb|StaticText with layout (winXP)]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
  st &lt;- staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
  b &lt;- button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
  set f [layout := widget st]
  return ()
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function will be covered in the section below about attributes. Try the code, what's wrong? This only displays the staticText, not the button. We need a way to combine the two. We will use ''layout combinators'' for that. &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;column&lt;/code&gt; look nice. They take an integer and a list of layouts. We can easily make a list of layouts of the button and the staticText. The integer is the spacing between the elements of the list. Let's try something:

[[Image:WxHaskell5_row_winxp.png|thumb|A row layout (winXP)]]
[[Image:WxHaskell5_col_winxp.PNG|thumb|Column layout with a spacing of 25 (winXP)]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [text := &quot;Hello World!&quot;]
  st &lt;- staticText f [text := &quot;Hello StaticText!&quot;]
  b &lt;- button f [text := &quot;Hello Button!&quot;]
  set f [layout := 
          row 0 [widget st, widget b]
        ]
  return ()
&lt;/source&gt;

Play around with the integer and see what happens. Also, change &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;column&lt;/code&gt;. Try to change the order of the elements in the list to get a feeling of how it works. For fun, try to add &lt;code&gt;widget b&lt;/code&gt; several more times in the list. What happens?

Here are a few exercises to spark your imagination. Remember to use the documentation!


{{Exercises|1=
# Add a checkbox control. It doesn't have to do anything yet, just make sure it appears next to the staticText and the button when using row-layout, or below them when using column layout. &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is also an attribute of the checkbox.
# Notice that &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;column&lt;/code&gt; take a list of ''layouts'', and also generates a layout itself. Use this fact to make your checkbox appear on the left of the staticText and the button, with the staticText and the button in a column.
# Can you figure out how the radiobox control works? Take the layout of the previous exercise and add a radiobox with two (or more) options below the checkbox, staticText and button. Use the documentation!
# Use the &lt;code&gt;boxed&lt;/code&gt; combinator to create a nice looking border around the four controls, and another one around the staticText and the button. (''Note: the &lt;code&gt;boxed&lt;/code&gt; combinator might not be working on MacOS X - you might get widgets that can't be interacted with.  This is likely just a bug in wxhaskell.'')}}


After having completed the exercises, the end result should look like this:
[[Image:WxHaskell6_winxp.png|thumb|Answer to exercises]]
You could have used different spacing for &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;column&lt;/code&gt; or have the options of the radiobox displayed horizontally.

==Attributes==

After all this, you might be wondering: &quot;Where did that &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function suddenly come from?&quot; and &quot;How would ''I'' know if &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is an attribute of something?&quot;. Both answers lie in the attribute system of wxHaskell.

===Setting and modifying attributes===

In a wxHaskell program, you can set the properties of the widgets in two ways:
# during creation: &lt;code&gt;f &lt;- frame '''[ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]'''&lt;/code&gt;
# using the &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function: &lt;code&gt;set f '''[ layout := widget st ]'''&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; function takes two arguments: something of type &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; along with properties of &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;. In wxHaskell, these will be the widgets and the properties of these widgets. Some properties can only be set during creation, such as the &lt;code&gt;alignment&lt;/code&gt; of a &lt;code&gt;textEntry&lt;/code&gt;, but you can set most others in any IO-function in your program — as long as you have a reference to it (the &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;set '''f''' [''stuff'']&lt;/code&gt;).

Apart from setting properties, you can also get them. This is done with the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; function. Here's a silly example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
  st &lt;- staticText f []
  ftext &lt;- get f text
  set st [ text := ftext]
  set f [ text := ftext ++ &quot; And hello again!&quot; ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Look at the type signature of &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;. It's &lt;code&gt;w -&gt; Attr w a -&gt; IO a&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; attribute, so we have an &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt; which we can bind to &lt;code&gt;ftext&lt;/code&gt;. The last line edits the text of the frame. Yep, destructive updates are possible in wxHaskell. We can overwrite the properties using &lt;code&gt;(:=)&lt;/code&gt; anytime with &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;. This inspires us to write a modify function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
modify :: w -&gt; Attr w a -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; IO ()
modify w attr f = do
  val &lt;- get w attr
  set w [ attr := f val ]
&lt;/source&gt;

First it gets the value, then it sets it again after applying the function. Surely we're not the first one to think of that...

Look at this operator: &lt;code&gt;(:~)&lt;/code&gt;. You can use it in &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; because it takes an attribute and a function. The result is a property in which the original value is modified by the function. That means we can write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Hello World!&quot; ]
  st &lt;- staticText f []
  ftext &lt;- get f text
  set st [ text := ftext ]
  set f [ text :~ ++ &quot; And hello again!&quot; ]
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a great place to use anonymous functions with the lambda-notation.

There are two more operators we can use to set or modify properties: &lt;code&gt;(::=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(::~)&lt;/code&gt;. They do almost the same as &lt;code&gt;(:=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(:~)&lt;/code&gt; except a function of type &lt;code&gt;w -&gt; orig&lt;/code&gt; is expected, where &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; is the widget type, and &lt;code&gt;orig&lt;/code&gt; is the original &quot;value&quot; type (&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in case of &lt;code&gt;(:=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; in case of &lt;code&gt;(:~)&lt;/code&gt;). We won't be using them now, as we've only encountered attributes of non-IO types, and the widget needed in the function is generally only useful in IO-blocks.

===How to find attributes===

Now the second question. Where do we go to determine that &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is an attribute of all those things? Go to the documentation…

Let's see what attributes a button has: Go to [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/wx/0.10.2/doc/html/Graphics-UI-WX-Controls.html &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Controls&lt;/code&gt;]. Click the link that says [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/wx/0.10.2/doc/html/Graphics-UI-WX-Controls.html#4 &quot;Button&quot;]. You'll see that a &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; is a type synonym of a special kind of &lt;code&gt;Control&lt;/code&gt;, and a list of functions that can be used to create a button. After each function, there's a list of &quot;Instances&quot;. For the normal &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; function, we see ''Commanding -- Textual, Literate, Dimensions, Colored, Visible, Child, Able, Tipped, Identity, Styled, Reactive, Paint''. That's the list of classes of which a button is an instance. Read through the [[../Classes and types/]] chapter. It means that there are some class-specific functions available for the button. &lt;code&gt;Textual&lt;/code&gt;, for example, adds the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;appendText&lt;/code&gt; functions. If a widget is an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Textual&lt;/code&gt; class, it means that it has a &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute!

Note that while &lt;code&gt;StaticText&lt;/code&gt; hasn't got a list of instances, it's still a &lt;code&gt;Control&lt;/code&gt;, and that's a synonym for some kind of &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt;. When looking at the &lt;code&gt;Textual&lt;/code&gt; class, it says that &lt;code&gt;Window&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of it. That's an error on the side of the documentation!

Let's take a look at the attributes of a frame. They can be found in &lt;code&gt;Graphics.UI.WX.Frame&lt;/code&gt;. Another error in the documentation here: It says &lt;code&gt;Frame&lt;/code&gt; instantiates &lt;code&gt;HasImage&lt;/code&gt;. This was true in an older version of wxHaskell. It should say &lt;code&gt;Pictured&lt;/code&gt;. Apart from that, we have &lt;code&gt;Form&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Textual&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Dimensions&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Colored&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Able&lt;/code&gt; and a few more. We're already seen &lt;code&gt;Textual&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Form&lt;/code&gt;. Anything that is an instance of &lt;code&gt;Form&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

&lt;code&gt;Dimensions&lt;/code&gt; adds (among others) the &lt;code&gt;clientSize&lt;/code&gt; attribute. It's an attribute of the &lt;code&gt;Size&lt;/code&gt; type, which can be made with &lt;code&gt;sz&lt;/code&gt;. Please note that the &lt;code&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; attribute can also change the size. If you want to use &lt;code&gt;clientSize&lt;/code&gt; you should set it after the &lt;code&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;Colored&lt;/code&gt; adds the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bgcolor&lt;/code&gt; attributes.

&lt;code&gt;Able&lt;/code&gt; adds the Boolean &lt;code&gt;enabled&lt;/code&gt; attribute. This can be used to enable or disable certain form elements, which is often displayed as a greyed-out option.

There are lots of other attributes, read through the documentation for each class.

==Events==

There are a few classes that deserve special attention. They are the &lt;code&gt;Reactive&lt;/code&gt; class and the &lt;code&gt;Commanding&lt;/code&gt; class. As you can see in the documentation of these classes, they don't add attributes (of the form &lt;code&gt;Attr w a&lt;/code&gt;), but ''events''. The &lt;code&gt;Commanding&lt;/code&gt; class adds the &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; event. We'll use a button to demonstrate event handling.

Here's a simple GUI with a button and a staticText:

[[Image:WxHaskell7_before_winxp.png|thumb|Before (winXP)]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Event Handling&quot; ]
  st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;You haven\'t clicked the button yet.&quot; ]
  b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Click me!&quot; ]
  set f [ layout := column 25 [ widget st, widget b ] ]
&lt;/source&gt;

We want to change the staticText when you press the button. We'll need the &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
   b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Click me!&quot;
                 , on command := --stuff
                 ]
&lt;/source&gt;

The type of &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;Event w a -&gt; Attr w a&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;Event w (IO ())&lt;/code&gt;, so we need an IO-function. This function is called the ''Event handler''. Here's what we get:

&lt;noinclude&gt;
&lt;!--
[[Image:WxHaskell7_after_winxp.png|thumb|After (winXP)]]
--&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
  f &lt;- frame [ text := &quot;Event Handling&quot; ]
  st &lt;- staticText f [ text := &quot;You haven\'t clicked the button yet.&quot; ]
  b &lt;- button f [ text := &quot;Click me!&quot;
                , on command := set st [ text := &quot;You have clicked the button!&quot; ]
                ]
  set f [ layout := column 25 [ widget st, widget b ] ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Modules are the primary means of organizing Haskell code. We met them in passing when using &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statements to put library functions into scope. Beyond allowing us to make better use of libraries, knowledge of modules will help us to shape our own programs and create standalone programs which can be executed independently of GHCi (incidentally, that is the topic of the very next chapter, [[../Standalone programs/]]).

== Modules ==

Haskell modules&lt;ref&gt;See the Haskell report for [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/modules.html more details on the module system].&lt;/ref&gt; are a useful way to group a set of related functionalities into a single package and manage different functions that may have the same names. The module definition is the first thing that goes in your Haskell file.  

A basic module definition looks like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module YourModule where
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that
# the name of the module begins with a capital letter;
# each file contains only one module.

The name of the file is the name of the module plus the &lt;tt&gt;.hs&lt;/tt&gt; file extension. Any dots '&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;' in the module name are changed for directories.&lt;ref&gt;In Haskell98, the last standardised version of Haskell before Haskell 2010, the module system was fairly conservative, but recent common practice consists of employing a hierarchical module system, using periods to section off namespaces.&lt;/ref&gt; So the module &lt;tt&gt;YourModule&lt;/tt&gt; would be in the file &lt;tt&gt;YourModule.hs&lt;/tt&gt; while a module &lt;tt&gt;Foo.Bar&lt;/tt&gt; would be in the file &lt;tt&gt;Foo/Bar.hs&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Foo\Bar.hs&lt;/tt&gt;. Since the module name must begin with a capital letter, the file name must also start with a capital letter.

== Importing ==

Modules can themselves import functions from other modules. That is, in between the module declaration and the rest of your code, you may include some import declarations such as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Char (toLower, toUpper) -- import only the functions toLower and toUpper from Data.Char

import Data.List -- import everything exported from Data.List
 
import MyModule -- import everything exported from MyModule
&lt;/source&gt;

Imported datatypes are specified by their name, followed by a list of imported constructors in parenthesis.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Tree (Tree(Node)) -- import only the Tree data type and its Node constructor from Data.Tree
&lt;/source&gt;

What if you import some modules that have overlapping definitions? Or if you import a module but want to overwrite a function yourself? There are three ways to handle these cases: Qualified imports, hiding definitions, and renaming imports.

=== Qualified imports ===

Say MyModule and MyOtherModule both have a definition for &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt;, which removes all instances of ''e'' from a string. However, MyModule only removes lower-case e's, and MyOtherModule removes both upper and lower case. In this case the following code is ambiguous:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule
import MyOtherModule

-- someFunction puts a c in front of the text, and removes all e's from the rest
someFunction :: String -&gt; String
someFunction text = 'c' : remove_e text
&lt;/source&gt;

It isn't clear which &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; is meant! To avoid this, use the '''qualified''' keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified MyModule
import qualified MyOtherModule

someFunction text = 'c' : MyModule.remove_e text -- Will work, removes lower case e's
someOtherFunction text = 'c' : MyOtherModule.remove_e text -- Will work, removes all e's
someIllegalFunction text = 'c' : remove_e text -- Won't work as there is no remove_e defined
&lt;/source&gt;

In the latter code snippet, no function named &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; is available at all. When we do qualified imports, all the imported values include the module names as a prefix. Incidentally, you can also use the same prefixes even if you did a regular import (in our example, &lt;tt&gt;MyModule.remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; works even if the &quot;qualified&quot; keyword isn't included).

{{body note|There is an ambiguity between a qualified name like &lt;code&gt;MyModule.remove_e&lt;/code&gt; and the function composition operator &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;.  Writing &lt;code&gt;reverse.MyModule.remove_e&lt;/code&gt; is bound to confuse your Haskell compiler.  One solution is stylistic: always use spaces for function composition, for example, &lt;code&gt;reverse . remove_e&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Just . remove_e&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;Just . MyModule.remove_e&lt;/code&gt;}}

=== Hiding definitions ===

Now suppose we want to import both &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;MyOtherModule&lt;/tt&gt;, but we know for sure we want to remove all e's, not just the lower cased ones. It will become really tedious to add &lt;tt&gt;MyOtherModule&lt;/tt&gt; before every call to &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt;. Can't we just exclude the &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; from &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt;?

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule hiding (remove_e)
import MyOtherModule

someFunction text = 'c' : remove_e text
&lt;/source&gt;

This works because of the word '''hiding''' on the import line. Whatever follows the &quot;hiding&quot; keyword will not be imported. Hide multiple items by listing them with parentheses and comma-separation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule hiding (remove_e, remove_f)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that algebraic datatypes and type synonyms cannot be hidden. These are always imported. If you have a datatype defined in multiple imported modules, you must use qualified names.

=== Renaming imports ===

This is not really a technique to allow for overwriting, but it is often used along with the qualified flag. Imagine:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName

someFunction text = 'c' : MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName.remove_e $ text
&lt;/source&gt;

Especially when using qualified, this gets irritating. We can improve things by using the '''as''' keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName as Shorty

someFunction text = 'c' : Shorty.remove_e $ text
&lt;/source&gt;

This allows us to use &lt;tt&gt;Shorty&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;MyModuleWithAVeryLongModuleName&lt;/tt&gt; as prefix for the imported functions. This renaming works with both qualified and regular importing.

As long as there are no conflicting items, we can import multiple modules and rename them the same:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import MyModule as My
import MyCompletelyDifferentModule as My
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, both the functions in &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt; and the functions in &lt;tt&gt;MyCompletelyDifferentModule&lt;/tt&gt; can be prefixed with My.

=== Combining renaming with limited import ===

Sometimes it is convenient to use the import directive twice for the same module. A typical scenario is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import qualified Data.Set as Set
import Data.Set (Set, empty, insert)
&lt;/source&gt;

This give access to all of the Data.Set module via the alias &quot;Set&quot;, and also lets you access a few selected functions (empty, insert, and the constructor) without using the &quot;Set&quot; prefix.

== Exporting ==

In the examples at the start of this article, the words &quot;import ''everything exported'' from MyModule&quot; were used.&lt;ref&gt;A module may export functions that it imports. Mutually recursive modules are possible but need [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/separate-compilation.html#mutual-recursion some special treatment].&lt;/ref&gt; This raises a question. How can we decide which functions are exported and which stay &quot;internal&quot;? Here's how:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module MyModule (remove_e, add_two) where

add_one blah = blah + 1

remove_e text = filter (/= 'e') text

add_two blah = add_one . add_one $ blah
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, only &lt;tt&gt;remove_e&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;add_two&lt;/tt&gt; are exported. While &lt;tt&gt;add_two&lt;/tt&gt; is allowed to make use of &lt;tt&gt;add_one&lt;/tt&gt;, functions in modules that import &lt;tt&gt;MyModule&lt;/tt&gt; cannot use &lt;tt&gt;add_one&lt;/tt&gt; directly, as it isn't exported.

Datatype export specifications are written similarly to import.  You name the type, and follow with the list of constructors in parenthesis:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module MyModule2 (Tree(Branch, Leaf)) where

data Tree a = Branch {left, right :: Tree a} 
            | Leaf a
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, the module declaration could be rewritten &quot;MyModule2 (Tree(..))&quot;, declaring that all constructors are exported.

Maintaining an export list is good practice not only because it reduces namespace pollution but also because it enables certain [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/GHC#Inlining compile-time optimizations] which are unavailable otherwise.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Vozz. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Vozz~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Fundamentals==
Every class in Java can be composed of the following elements:
*'''fields''' or '''member variables''' or '''instance variables''' — Fields are variables that hold data specific to each object.  For example, an employee might have an ID number. There is one field for each object of a class.
*'''member methods''' or '''instance variables''' — Member methods perform operations on an object.  For example, an employee might have a method to issue his paycheck or to access his name.
*'''static fields''' — Static fields are common to any object of the same class.  For example, a static field within the Employee class could keep track of the last ID number issued. Only one static field exists for one class.
*'''static methods''' — Static methods are methods that do not affect a specific object.
*'''inner classes''' — Sometimes it is useful to contain a class within another one if it is useless outside of the class or should not be accessed outside the class.
*'''Constructors''' — A special method that generates a new object.
*'''Parameterized types''' — Since 1.5, ''parameterized types'' can be assigned to a class during definition.  The ''parameterized types'' will be substituted with the types specified at the class's instantiation. It is done by the compiler. It is similar to the C language macro '#define' statement, where a preprocessor evaluates the macros.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.1: Employee.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Employee {              // This defines the Employee class.
                                     // The public modifier indicates that
                                     // it can be accessed by any other class

    private static int nextID;       // Define a static field. Only one copy of this will exist,
                                     // no matter how many Employees are created.

    private int myID;                // Define fields that will be stored  
    private String myName;           // for each Employee. The private modifier indicates that
                                     // only code inside the Employee class can access it.
 
    public Employee(String name) {   // This is a constructor. You can pass a name to the constructor
                                     // and it will give you a newly created Employee object.
        myName = name;
        myID = nextID;               // Automatically assign an ID to the object
        nextID++;                    // Increment the ID counter
    }
 
    public String getName() {        // This is a member method that returns the
                                     // Employee object's name.
        return myName;               // Note how it can access the private field myName.
    }
 
    public int getID() {             // This is another member method.
   
        return myID;  
    }
 
    public static int getNextID() {  // This is a static method that returns the next ID
                                     // that will be assigned if another Employee is created.
        return nextID;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The following Java code would produce this output:

&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

== Constructors ==
A constructor is called to initialize an object immediately after the object has been allocated:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-3&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.3: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3-5&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
  // This is a constructor
  public Cheese() {
    System.out.println(&quot;Construct an instance&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Typically, a constructor is invoked using the {{java:new}} keyword:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.1: A constructor call.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Cheese cheese = new Cheese();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The constructor syntax is close to the method syntax. However, the constructor has the same name as the name of the class (with the same case) and the constructor has no return type. The second point is the most important difference as a method can also have the same name as the class, which is not recommended:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-4&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.4: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
  // This is a method with the same name as the class
  public void Cheese() {
    System.out.println(&quot;A method execution.&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The returned object is always a valid, meaningful object, as opposed to relying on a separate initialization method. A constructor cannot be {{java:abstract}}, {{java:final}}, {{java:native}}, {{java:static}}, {{java:strictfp}} nor {{java:synchronized}}. However, a constructor, like methods, can be overloaded and take parameters.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-5&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.5: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;8, 13&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
     // This is a constructor
     public Cheese() {
          doStuff();
     }

     // This is another constructor
     public Cheese(int weight) {
          doStuff();
     }

     // This is yet another constructor
     public Cheese(String type, int weight) {
          doStuff();
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

By convention, a constructor that accepts an object of its own type as a parameter and copies the data members is called a ''copy constructor''. One interesting feature of constructors is that if and only if you do not specify a constructor in your class, the compiler will create one for you. This default constructor, if written out would look like:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-6&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.6: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-4&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
     public Cheese() {
           super();
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; command calls the constructor of the superclass. If there is no explicit call to &lt;code&gt;super(...)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;this(...)&lt;/code&gt;, then the default superclass constructor &lt;code&gt;super();&lt;/code&gt; is called before the body of the constructor is executed. That said, there are instances where you need to add in the call manually. For example, if you write even one constructor, no matter what parameters it takes, the compiler will not add a default constructor. The [[#code-listing-8|code listing 4.8]] results in a runtime error:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-7&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.7: Cheese.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Cheese {
     public Cheese(int weight, String type) {
          doStuff();
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-8&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.8: Mouse.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class Mouse {
     public void eatCheese() {
             Cheese c = new Cheese(); // Oops, compile time error!
     }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
This is something to keep in mind when extending existing classes. Either make a default constructor, or make sure every class that inherits your class uses the correct constructor.

== Initializers ==
''Initializers'' are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for fields.

=== Static initializers ===
''Static initializers'' are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for static fields.  Static field initializers and static initializers are executed in the order declared.  The static initialization is executed after the class is loaded.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.2: Static initializer.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3-7&quot;&gt;
static int count = 20;
static int[] squares;
static {  // a static initializer
    squares = new int[count];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
        squares[i] = i * i;
}
static int x = squares[5];  // x is assigned the value 25
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

=== Instance initializers ===
''Instance initializers'' are blocks of code that are executed at the same time as initializers for instance (non-&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;) fields.  Instance field initializers and instance initializers are executed in the order declared. Both instance initializers and instance field initializers are executed during the invocation of a constructor.  The initializers are executed immediately after the superclass constructor and before the body of the constructor.

==Calculus==

A little category set aside for Calculus class questions.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 22:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

*[[School of Mathematics:Calculus]] looks fine. In what sense is it &quot;a practical approach&quot;? I want to make a module for people who are interested in biology. The module will deal with exponential growth and decay and will be built around examples from biological systems. It will be an introduction to calculus for biology students but can also provide some specific examples for [[Calculus/More Differentation Rules]]. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 00:20, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
**&quot;some other sort of synthesis action&quot; &lt;-- One of the powers of wiki technology is that wiki webpages can be highly inter-connected. Some of the topics I want to include in the Cell Biology part of Wikiversity involve complex biological processes where amplification and feedback are important and it is useful to apply mathematics. I want to be able to link from biology pages to useful parts of math books. I think it is helpful for people who are interested in biology to provide them with specific examples of how to use the math rather than just drop them into an abstract presentation of the math. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 19:53, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

==Residue Theory==

A little category set off if you came to talk about the [[Residue Theory]] book.  --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 19:59, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:I'm glad we finally have a book about this subject. I do alot of work on the EE bookshelf, and when i need to try and explain residues for my books, I personally don't know all the mathematical rigour. Good luck. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:29, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:48, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity ==

Hi Fephisto, and thanks for your questions about Wikiversity. I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to reply - I've just logged in to Wikibooks after a stint doing other things (including travelling)..

On what's going on with Wikiversity, I think the best pages are over on Meta. There's the [[m:Wikiversity subcommittee]] which is trying to put together a proposal to the board to get it set up as an official sister project - though this is not meant to stop anyone else get involved with this process (or even join the subcommittee). I don't see this as too far off in the future - we are just trying to figure out things like whether it will host courses at first and if so what types of courses, amongst other questions. On that page as well as the [[m:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal|current proposal]] there are a list to the most relevant links - but yes, there is a lot of text and an awful amount of discussion.

If you want to set up a class, it might be good to see (for now) whether it fits in with what the board last specified, ie. &quot;no online courses&quot;. We're still trying to figure this out, but this is the safest route. Still, there are plenty of people who want to set up live, active classes, so you're free to experiment with what you feel best. Overall, I would say for now, focus on creating the content of the course, rather than inviting students to participate. And no, there's nothing like accreditation involved, don't worry - and I don't think this would be productive for now anyway (though it may be an option for the future).

Thanks for your interest and all the best with your Wikiversity project(s). Let me know how it goes, and please don't hesitate to ask any further questions here or on Meta (where I'm more active). Cheers. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 18:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

== welcome to Wikireason ==

Hi Fephisto. Welcome to [[Wikireason:Forum Entrance|Wikireason]]! Thanks for your contributions--I provided a couple of responses to what you wrote about [[Wikireason:Category:Globalization|globalization]]. As stated at the forum entrance, we're still working out organizational issues and producing documentation to help newcomers. We would love to hear any feedback or questions that you have about the site. I look forward to your future contributions. It's best to reach me at [[Wikireason:User:Adam|my wikireason page]]--I was surprized to find that I even have an account here! [[User:AdamRetchless|AdamRetchless]] 23:57, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

== Calculus ==

Hi Fephisto - apologies for not replying sooner (I saw your message, just didn't have anything particular to say at the time). It occurs to me to ask (regarding your offer to teach Calculus), what/where were you thinking of teaching? Also, how? Wikiversity will need to have materials to teach with - particularly if it is to move from Wikibooks - as I think it should. So, where are the materials for this course? Is it simply directing people to the book [[Calculus]]? One one hand, I'm asking this because I'm curious; on the other, I'm eager to actually have some material to show people that this is a Wikiversity, not simply a library. I suppose another way of saying this is: teach me calculus! [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 15:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for the reply (btw, I've moved it to the bottom of my talk page, where it's easier to find). I suppose I was asking: &quot;where are the materials by which you're thinking of teaching Calculus?&quot;. And you're saying that they are in the Wikibooks mentioned on that page, and that you're going to then teach people about Calculus using those books, and according to their needs - right? Sounds fine. It's just that, with the process to separate Wikiversity and Wikibooks, there will need to be some content on Wikiversity itself in order to teach or learn about this subject. The current proposal for Wikiversity is a place where specific learning materials (eg. a segment of information and a related learning activity) will be hosted so that someone could come along and start learning by themselves, or a teacher could come along and print off that exercise (and possibly a lesson plan to go with it) to use in their class that afternoon. However, the interesting part is where people come to learn themselves and find that there are people there (like yourself) that could help them to learn further. You yourself could then not just direct that person to further reading on Wikibooks or Wikipedia (which I would expect there would be within the Wikiversity material anyway), but also ask further provocative questions, set tasks as you see fit, ie do what you were thinking of doing anyway. But if these projects are to separate (and I, amongst others, am working towards this), then we will need to prompt or facilitate learning somehow through the material we have in Wikiversity.

:This might all be a bit confusing to you - in fact, it occurs to me to ask you about what you say on your page (&quot;I hope Wikiversity doesn't go away&quot;) - does this mean you hope the projects don't separate? Are you aware of the context of all this? See the links to the current proposal I gave you before, if not. In any case, I'd really like to hear your views on the matter. Thanks. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 11:48, 14 July 2006 (UTC)


::Ok, thanks for clearing those points up. Maybe you could point me to some Wikiversity-specific material if/when you develop it, and hopefully we'll have a new project soon that we can start afresh with. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 16:12, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
'''
Hi Fephisto''' - I was wondering what you plan on doing for the Calculus Lessons and how I may join as a student. I already answered all the questions on the PRE-CALCULUS page. The only answer that I think you would be curious about would be to the comments question. I believe that if you are going to do lectures, it would be benificial for them to be in a downloadable. Preferably in an audio format such as mp3 or wav, or a PDF if typed.

Thank you
--[[User:Superwiki|Superwiki]] 03:52, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

#I'm just going to go over very basic 1st, 2nd, and 3rd semester Calculus as in University undergraduate Mathematics.  If by pre-calculus you take this as too simplistic, then this is probably not for you; however, if you said pre-calculus by meaning that you covered the pre-calculus section in the pre-test then go ahead and e-mail those answers to me and I can start making things from seeing where you stand.

#My original plan was just to have a planned lecture and go over it at a certain time so you could ask questions if you wanted to along the way.

#Other than that, if you have any other questions, go ahead and reply.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 01:43, 24 July 2006 (UTC)


== Regarding your query ==

Sorry to be so late responding.  I have been waiting a couple of years for Wikiversity to get a goahead and so not checking messages much.  Regarding your calculus class.  The Board was very concerned the term class might give people the wrong idea about what a wiki environment is capable of and so directed us not to use the term in the Wikiversity proposal.  Everything is very much up in the air regarding how to effectively use the wiki medium for  learning.  My advice to you is to experiment a bit.  If you have applicable credentials or education feel free to advertise them on a synopsis along with a proposed approach.  If anyone gets militant approach &lt;b&gt;NO COURSES&lt;/b&gt; invite them to go elsewhere and leave your group or materials alone.  Try to structure your material so that people feel welcome to simply work through them and leave comments or improvements behind.  As I see it the really tricky part is how to integrate those questions/comments/improvements back into concise material while still giving credit where credit is due.

Perhaps a useful method will be to start a credits page with an obvious link on the main course page and use footnotes pointing to the credits page from elsewhere.  That way you are giving credit while removing distracting questions or comments.   Another approach might be to establish a link from a specific area where expansions can be made.  A potential subloop in material where anyone felt a question or comment or request for clarification was useful.   This is still very new to all of us so please feel free to innovate.  I will try to drop.   I need some review if I am going to be useful to engineering students anyway.  Thanks for joining us here at Wikiversity!!!  [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 08:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

== Calculus course ==

Hi Fephisto - thanks for the update. Well, sorry that you didn't get all the participants you would have liked, but I'm not sure how many people would have seen it in the first place (this is regarding the participant base in Wikibooks:Wikiversity overall, not directed at anything of your own doing..)

In any case, I'm not sure if you heard, but Wikiversity is now a separate project - see [[v:Wikiversity:Main Page]]. We've been transwikiing some content from Wikibooks - I think your lectures (eg. [[Calculus/Building up to the Riemann-Darboux Definition]] would be useful to have there. I'm hoping to have material in place on Wikiversity so people can come and go as they please, rather than have to wait for a tutor to come along or initiate a timetable. You can request that this page be imported [[v:Wikiversity:Import|here]] (please don't simply copy and paste). Thanks. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 10:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Statistical Mechanics (Thermal Physics) ==

I believe the A-level Physics book doesn't have enough depth into the true rigourisation this subject has and will be starting a book in [[Statistical Mechanics]], for those who want to work with me, or have questions, leave me a line here.

== Partial Differential Equations ==

As far as I'm concerned, this needs a heavy inclusion (for more general techniques, adding some info abotu eigenfunctions, some fourier series uses, etc.) and rewrite, I'm going to try adding to this one too.  [[Partial Differential Equations]].

[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:31, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

== Statistics ==

I was kind of angered that when I last read [[Statistics]] there was no reasoning for the methods provided therein.  However, it seems as if it has been collaberated since I last saw it, so I might not need to put what I've learned in the subject in it.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:34, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

== Ring Theory, Algebra ==

We can put these individual subjects wherever we would like. For instance, we could create 2 &quot;versions&quot; of the linear algebra book, one that relies on concepts developed in [[Abstract Algebra]] and [[Ring Theory]] (for advanced readers), and one that only explores the &quot;highschool&quot; version of linear algebra from the standpoint of solving linear systems of equations.

I don't really care how the books are organized per se, but what I do know is that the way they were organized previously was terrible. Anything will be an improvement over what it was. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:06, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

Hi there Fephisto, I am a vagrant from en.wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cronholm144] and have found the calculus book to be a rather shabby affair. Any chance that we could get a team together to clean things up a little bit? Cheers --[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:14, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== Calculus ==

Hmm... I think that general clean-up is needed. I left messages at the multi-variable page and on some of the others in the book. One thing I found was that whoever wrote the more differentiation formulas page used Euler's formula to derive the trig derivatives. I think that is completely unacceptable. Anyway, I will leave my comment on each talk page of the book and then I will start editing. Pitch in whenever and where ever you are able. Hopefully we can make some progress.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Fephisto. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Fephisto~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">My van is a 1990 GMC Vandura 2500. It has a 5.7L (350) FUEL INJECTED V8. The caps are for the noobs out there that need to be schooled: electronic fuel injection or bust if you get a van.

I won't go into too much detail on the how, but the why is definitely a must. First, electricity is not the necessity we sometimes make it out to be. In order for you to have a good electrical setup that doesn't require a lot of driving to charge your batteries, you need to spend about 1,000 dollars...at least. I'd suggest you get off that idea. Right now my van meets all my needs, including food storage and preparation. Wal-Mart has all the toilet you need in a convenient 24 hour package, but I frequently suffer from diarrhea, so I'm getting a toilet in there too.

1. Sleeping: Just a twin mattress, but I suggest you build your own bedframe as I did. the 16 inches of vertical storage space underneath it is invaluable.

2. Food: Coleman camp stove/grill. The grill comes in handy when you don't want to clean a pan. It traps the grease. Don't cook heavily seasoned meat in your van though. It smells for days. Chicken leaves the least odor, unless you're a garlic fiend. These stoves claim to run 1.1 hour with both the grill and stove on high off of one 16.4 oz propane canister. You will never need to turn both on high or either on high individually, as this thing gets HOT! This translates into you getting about 10 meals out of 1 canister. Easy. Also, unless you want to die in a fire or of carbon monoxide poisoning, I suggest you get an ABC fire extinguisher and either a vent or cook with both front windows open and your curtain drawn. I've found also that just about any 5 day cooler (mine is a 60 US quart Igloo cooler) will keep your food cold enough.

3. Hygiene: Babywipes and mouthwash. I have a sink in my van that I cut into a dresser with the drawers removed.

== More Pronouns ==

For a laid back country such as Indonesia, the people can seem surprisingly status conscious to the new arrival.  One of the ways in which this social order is established and maintained is through the language one uses in conversation.

Unlike some other languages in the archipelago (notably Sundanese and Javanese) modern Indonesian does not have well defined language levels which indicate the status of each party in conversation, although there are certainly words one would not use in a discussion with one's boss, one's friend's parent and so on.

As a general rule, it is easier and safer to err on the side of politeness and always use ''saya'' for a first person pronoun and ''Bapak'' or ''Ibu'' for a second person pronoun, but to do so would exclude you from most everyday speech.  

Master the phrases below and be prepared to receive compliments aplenty.

=== Titles ===

In Indonesian instead of referring to the person you are talking to as &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; and yourself as &lt;i&gt;I/me&lt;/i&gt;, people often use their name, or term of address.  Using someone's title instead of a second person pronoun (&lt;i&gt;you, your&lt;/i&gt; etc.) is normally considered the most polite way of addressing someone, as long as you don't use the incorrect title...  Referring to yourself by name sounds a little childish if you are the person with lower social standing, and patronising if the reverse is true.  In most cases unless speaking with small children, or unless you are a small child, it's safer to stick with &lt;i&gt;saya&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;table class=wikitable align=top&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Word''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Origin''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Context''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''own name'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Almost exclusively used in conversation between adults and small children.  One's title is also often used.  This can also be used to hint at your preferred form of address. 
e.g. Pak Bambang: &quot;Selamat pagi, Tuan John&quot;  
John: &quot;Selamat pagi Pak, Mas John minta kopi biasa&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Bapak (m), Ibu (f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mr, Mrs.  Most respectful, used when the addressee is above the age of 20 or so in a formal setting.  Note: unless used in conjunction with a name ''Pak'' is not considered a second person pronoun, that is, ''Pak Bambang'', or ''Bapak'' can be used in place of ''kamu'' but ''Pak'' by itself can not.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Tuan (m), Nyonya (f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Malay&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sir, Madam.  Very formal, used almost exclusively for white expatriates, ''Tuan'' and ''Nyonya'' were used during colonial times and to many ears sound a little too colonial for contemporary society, although are still used in legal documents.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Mas (m), Mbak( f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Javanese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;An English equivalent would be ''buddy'', ''bro'', or ''mate'' (or ''miss'' for the feminine), but can also be used as a title (e.g. ''Mas John'', ''Mbak Vanessa'').  More formal than using the person's name directly, but still too informal to use unless the person is younger or you know them very well and they are around the same age.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Akang/Kang; Aang; Aa(m), Teteh; Ceuceu(f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sundanese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Practically identical to ''Mas'' or &quot;Mbak&quot; respectively but only really heard in Sundanese speaking areas; i.e. Bandung, and other places in West Java and Banten.  Extended form is Akang. 
How to use. &quot;where to go, brother?&quot;=''&quot;pergi kemana,'''A''' -or- '''Kang''' -or- '''Ang'''?&quot;''
&quot;where to go, sister?&quot;=''&quot;pergi kemana, '''Teh''' -or- '''Ceu'''?&quot;''
Brother John = ''Akang/Aa/Aang John''
Sister Mary = ''Teh/Ceu Mary''
&lt;/td&gt; the most popular form to address brother and sister in West Java and Banten is Aa and Teteh.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Bang, Bung (m)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Melayu&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Practically identical to ''Mas'' heard in Jakarta and most of Sumatera.  Extended form is Abang&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Bli (m), Gek (f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Balinese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Practically identical to ''Mas'/&quot;Mbak&quot;' but only used in Bali.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Oom (m), Tante (f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dutch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Equals to calling someone uncle or aunt. May be used to call an older man/woman but usually only used by Indonesian of Chinese or Dutch ancestry.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Kak (m/f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;From &quot;Kakak&quot; which means older sibling.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Koko (m), Cece (f)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chinese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Means older brother or sister. Used by Indonesian of Chinese ancestry, although becoming more mainstream and may be heard used by salesperson.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== First Person ===

&lt;table class=wikitable align=top&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Word''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Origin''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Context''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''saya''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Safest option for most conversations, though may seem overly formal if one is speaking with a child&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''aku''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian, also Javanese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;More familiar, used when the speaker is of a lower or similar social status and wants to be respectful, yet familiar. e.g. in discussions with one's friend's parents and so on.  Used more commonly by the Javanese where it is slightly closer to ''saya''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''gua, gue''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chinese via Betawi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Very familiar, used between people of a similar social standing and only in informal situations.  While coming from Jakarta, it is now common among the youth throughout the archipelago and adults in major cities.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''aye''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Betawi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Similar to ''gue'', only really heard in Jakarta.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''wo''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chinese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Used only by ethnic Chinese in conversation with other ethnic Chinese in some areas of Jakarta, Medan and other areas with high concentrations of ethnic Chinese&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''I''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Used mainly by Ethnic Chinese in Jakarta and other areas with high concentrations of ethnic Chinese, pronounced as the English ''I'', it functions as all forms of the first person pronoun just as other Indonesian first person pronouns. e.g. ''ini buku I'' = ''this is my book'', ''I mau pulang'' = ''I'm going home'', ''tolong jemput I'' = ''please pick me up''.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Second Person ===

As a general rule, Indonesians tend to use a person's title or their given name (often in conjunction with their title) in place of a true second person pronoun in spoken language.  This sounds less childish (as the younger person) or patronising (as the older person) than doing so with the first person pronoun and is probably your safest bet in most instances.

&lt;table class=wikitable align=top&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Word''&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;''Origin''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;''Context''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Anda''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You.  Very formal.  While theoretically the most correct form of standard Indonesian, you rarely hear it outside of advertisements and prepared speeches; and even then only rarely.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;''Kamu''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Standard Indonesian&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;You. Informal.  Used between people of a similar social standing or when the speaker is older or of a higher social standing than the addressee.&lt;/td&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to get help properly==
This guide is going to give you a good start in the world of Linux, but I'm sure you will have questions along the way. Don't be afraid to ask questions but be sure to ask them right.

#Try searching around for the answer first.
#:You can imagine that help forums get asked the same questions many times over so see if someone else has run into the same problem as you. You'll save time and effort for both yourself, and whoever you might ask.
#Go ahead and ask your question.
#:Especially on IRC, you should not ask to ask your question (&quot;Does anyone here know about linux?&quot;) -- just ask.
#Try to be concise and comprehensive with background information.
#:You’re more likely to get an answer if people don't have to read large chunks of possibly irrelevant information they could have deduced from hearing your problem or asked at a later date.

If you're getting help on IRC, read a tutorial like [http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc] or [http://www.reactor-core.org/irc-help.html] if you aren't familiar with getting help on IRC.

== Built-In ==
===help===
Help for built-in commands are available from the '''help''' command. For example
 help logout
Provides help on the logout command. Help just prints a few lines of text to the console. You may need to be in a shell for this to work.

Note that even common commands like [[Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities#cp|cp]] and [[Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities#mv|mv]] are not built-in. In addition, most built-in commands have man and info pages (see below) - so it is generally more useful to look in man or info first.

If you have no idea about what command you should use, but you have a vague idea about some keywords that may be related to the topic you want (e.g., you want to print something), you can use the apropos command, like this:
  apropos print
that will display a lot of things related to print.

===man===
''See also: [[Guide to Unix/Commands/Getting Help#man|Guide to Unix]]''

Man pages are a flexible format of help page: they can be viewed in the console, and can be viewed as HTML in a web browser. For example, to view the man page for cp, type
 man cp
If you don't know the name of the command, you can search by using -k
 man -k &quot;copy&quot;

Man is split into sections 
# Executable programs or shell commands
# System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
# Library calls (functions within program libraries)
# Special files (usually found in /dev)
# File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
# Games
# Miscellaneous  (including  macro  packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
# System administration commands (usually only for root)
# Kernel routines [Non standard]
If a page with the same name is in more than one section, the correct one can be accessed by specifying the section number:
 man 1 cp
alternatively, specify -a to walk through all the sections
 man -a cp

Man pages can also be viewed in web browsers. Some web browsers, such as [[w:Konqueror|Konqueror]] allow you to use man: like a protocol - for example, typing
 man:cp
into the location bar shows the man page for cp. More generally, however, the man command can generate an HTML file, and then display it in a browser by using the -H command with the browser of your choice - in this example, firefox:
 man cp -Hfirefox

===info===
''See also: [[Guide to Unix/Commands/Getting Help#info|Guide to Unix]]''

Info pages are another type of help page. Pages here are sometimes duplicates of man pages - and sometimes are more complete. To view an info page, type
 info cp

===Yelp===
Yelp is a graphical program to display help documentation on GNOME systems. Run the command 'yelp' to begin.

==LUGs==
[[w:Linux User Group|Linux Users' Groups]] are a great resource for getting help. They're typically local organizations, or perhaps specific to a university. They may have a website with helpful information, or a mailing list or IRC channel where you can get personal assistance. Depending on the area served by the LUG, you might be able to meet face-to-face with fellow users who may offer to help you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">cool :) i like this page. [[User:Boud|Boud]] 12:19, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

I also like this page.  I'm trying to teach myself relativity using an actual textbook.  I'd like to help make the wikitextbook on relativity accessable. [[User:Itzamna|Itzamna]] 27 Jan 2009

helpful. i am reading penrose 'the road to reality' and his explanation of tensors is very abstract (although a fascinating book overall). i have searched the web for an easier intro to tensors. this page is a good start as it uses real examples. further explanation especially around the super and subscript notation used with tensors would be good. (ib 6 Feb 09)

== T as a matrix ==

Hi,
Could you specify please, what is denoted as x, y, z and v in the first formula? (The matrix of T)

== Coordinate free paradigm ==

One can play around with the words. We talk about &quot;abstract vectors&quot; to remove ourselves from the specific representations of the vector, because we are so used to think of vectors as n-tuples of numbers, members of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. That was the old way. So the new way is the &quot;abstract&quot; one.  But in another perspective, the new way is actually more concrete.  Young students raised in the new way of thinking may not at all know what you mean when you say that the vector exists as something abstract.

The coordinate-free way of thinking about vectors and linear operators just pretends there is a vector space V that is not at all the same as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  In this thinking, any member of V is a physical entity with a physical direction and a magnitude with physical dimension (length, force, etc). The n-tuple of components is just an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, not an element of V.  This physical nature of ''v'' is why it does not seem particularly abstract. 

Also the equations are equations of physical entities, not component equations. We have F = Tw where F is a member of the (tangent) space of forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, w is a member of the space of wind speeds, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;, and T is a member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{W};\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt;, the space of linear operators &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}\to\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

I suggest that the text emphasizes the closeness to the physics, not the &quot;abstractness&quot;.  The &quot;abstract&quot; vectors and the &quot;abstract&quot; tensors or multilinear operators are (closer to) the real things that exist in the physical world independent of the observer that may choose a coordinate system and a representation.

It appears that some of the difficulty derives from a lack of a proper language to express things clearly. We talk about the &quot;vector (''x,y,z'')&quot; when we actually mean the vector &lt;math&gt;x\vec{i}+y\vec{j}+z\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\vec{i}&lt;/math&gt; etc, are physical basis vectors.  Now, (''x,y,z'') is more succinct, and &lt;math&gt;(x^{\mu})&lt;/math&gt; even more so.  But in introductory material we could use some way of making explicit that we mean a vector in the tangent space (or whichever space), not in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Perhaps we could introduce a name &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of the coordinate system and write e.g. &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)_\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, to make it that element of V whose components are x,y,z relative to the coordinate basis. Do the same with the matrices that represent the linear operators. When you get to the index gymnastics, say that you are dropping the chart/basis annotation where unambiguous, to avoid clutter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">DavidCary's formula is wrong:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dz^2 + (2 r \sin\frac{\theta}{2})^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If this is for a cylinder, with the standard definitions of ''z, r, &amp;theta;'', then the metric is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dz^2 + r^2 d\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The cylinder is intrinsically flat. Hmm, this has to be reorganised - the cylinder is flat like the plane. The sphere is different.
i'm rewording a bit.

i'm removing:
''The full formula for  arbitrary (r, &amp;phi;, &amp;theta;) will be worked out later.'' 
because we are interested primarily in [[w:calculus|differentials]]. i don't see any point in distracting the reader by talking about path integrals at this point... [[User:Boud|Boud]] 12:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

Someone changed it after you.  It's pretty inaccessible right now. 1.28.09

== Contravariant and Covariant Vectors ==

The covariant and contravariant example makes no sense. With '''w''', if you increase displacement, temperature goes up. With '''v''', if you increase time, displacement goes up. The author is either not being clear, or this is vandalism.

The author references two figures at the end of the ''Contravariant and Covariant Vectors'' section, however, the figures are not available.

[[User:Rabadi|Rabadi]] 05:54, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

Can one think of Contravariant Tensors as an example of proportionality relationship while the covariant Tensors are inversly proportional.
Like &lt;math&gt;X^{a}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to something while &lt;math&gt;X_{a}&lt;/math&gt; is inversly proportional to the same thing, personally i don't know because i am trying to learn about the stuff myself.

[[User:harryortho|harryortho]] 16:49, 22/12/06 (GMT)

On the next section i wondered is it like having matrices &lt;math&gt;v = v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w = v^{*}&lt;/math&gt;which is a conjugate matrix, like &lt;math&gt;1x2.2x1&lt;/math&gt; and when you multiply them together they end up makeing a number with no units, except in Tensors there is another tensor without units like before the inverse times the original equals 1 but in a Tensor kind of way? is there any sense here?

[[User:harryortho|harryortho]] 17:04, 22/12/06 (GMT)

== Confusion ==

Last line &quot;Finally, if we define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha (\mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = \delta_\alpha^\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (\mathbf{\omega}) = \mathbf{\omega} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;.&quot;

What is meant by that? Should it be &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{\sigma}) = \mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;? Also, isn't the multiplication commutative by definition? If it is not too important, can we omit it? --[[User:Hirak 99|Hirak 99]] 11:42, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

* Yes, it should have been &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{\sigma}) = \mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;; I corrected the error.  

It can be omitted, I suppose, but for now, I'd like to leave it there.  My reasoning is that, for beginners, commutativity may not be obvious or assumed.

-[[User:blathem|blathem]]

==Some comments==

I was getting confused by the lack of bullet points, in one place, so I added them.  Roll this back if you don't like it.  I am just trying to understand this.

Also does,

''We can now evaluate any functional (covariant vector) applied to any vector (contravariant vector).  If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then by linearity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v}) = \sigma_\alpha \mathbf{\omega}^\alpha (v^\beta \mathbf{e}_\beta) = \sigma_\alpha v^\beta \mathbf{\omega}^\alpha (\mathbf{e}_\beta) = \sigma_\alpha v^\beta \delta_\beta^\alpha = \sigma_\alpha v^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, if we define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha (\mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = \delta_\alpha^\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (\mathbf{\sigma}) = \mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;.''

mean,

''We can now evaluate any functional (covariant vector) applied to any vector (contravariant vector).  If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} \in V^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then by linearity,''
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v}) = \sigma_\alpha \mathbf{\omega}^\alpha (v^\beta \mathbf{e}_\beta) = \sigma_\alpha v^\beta \mathbf{\omega}^\alpha (\mathbf{e}_\beta) = \sigma_\alpha v^\beta \delta_\beta^\alpha = \sigma_\alpha v^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 

''Also, if we define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha (\mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = \delta_\alpha^\beta&lt;/math&gt; then,''
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (\mathbf{\sigma}) =  v^\alpha \mathbf{e}_\alpha(\sigma_\beta \mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = v^\alpha \sigma_\beta \mathbf{e}_\alpha ( \mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = v^\alpha \sigma_\beta \delta_\alpha^\beta = v^\alpha \sigma_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
''so,''
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (\mathbf{\sigma}) = \mathbf{\sigma} (\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;.

In terms of the beginner the whole linear functional idea hasn't really been explained here, and the reference [[w:vector space|vector space]] doesn't help much because it introduces a whole lot of other issues, to confuse the beginner.

I am confused because it is not clear that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is a (contra variant) vector.  
:&lt;nowiki&gt;\mathbf{\omega} ... &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; does not look bold.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;\mathbf{\sigma} ... &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; does not look bold.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;\mathbf{e} ... &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt; does look bold.

I would have preferred if you had written &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;.  The look of the thing is that the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt; are basis vectors, but maybe &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; are something different.  I guess they are basis vectors for the dual space that also act as linear functionals.

It seems the important bit is,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\alpha (\mathbf{\omega}^\beta) = \delta_\alpha^\beta&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}_\alpha (\mathbf{e}^\beta) = \delta_\alpha^\beta&lt;/math&gt;

Can you define these together earlier? Or is one derivable from the other?  I am just not sure about your precise argument.  Sorry if I am being dense.

for&lt;br /&gt;
GEORGIA'S COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PLAN
__FORCETOC__&lt;br /&gt;

===Role of TACs===
&quot;The Technical Advisory Committees are topic-specific groups of technical experts assembled to provide technical input – as needed – in discussions of specific new policy tools.&quot;  (The [[Georgia Water/Carl Vinson Institute of Government|Carl Vinson Institute of Government]] will provide discussion papers on the
range of options for the new water management policy tools.[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf])
These &quot;advisory committees are for advisory purposes only&quot; and are not decision-making in nature.  &quot;Their only role is to receive information and help evaluate that information and provide some understanding on whether or not proposals will work in target areas.&quot;  
[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf]  &quot;A technical advisory committee will be assembled to ascertain what technical questions on (a) topic must be asked and answered.&quot;

===Membership===
&quot;The Technical Advisory Committees are topic-specific groups of technical experts assembled to provide technical input – as needed – in discussions of specific new policy tools.  These technical advisors have extensive expertise and are actively participating and/or researching the topic being addressed.  TAC members represent diverse abilities and bring a broad range of scientific/technical experience and regional knowledge to EPD in this planning process.&quot; [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/Target_Flow_Regime_TAC.pdf]

===Public Participation===
&quot;... in additional to the formal advisory bodies, there will also need to be a series of town hall type meetings throughout the state in the later stages of the planning process.&quot;[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf]

E.g. &lt;math&gt;\lbrace  x : x \ge 2\rbrace&lt;/math&gt; means a set of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is bigger than or equal to 2.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; means the function f maps the set X is mapped into the set Y. Another way to write this is &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)=x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; - Natural Numbers – e.g. {1,2,3,. ..}&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; - Integers – e.g. {...−2,−1,0,1,2,. ..}&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; - Fractions (of rational numbers)&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; - Real Numbers, including rational and irrational numbers but not complex
numbers such as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Irrational numbers have no general symbol – their notation is specific - e.g. {&lt;math&gt;\pi\ e\ \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;}

===Definitions===
'''Mapping''': a rule connecting two sets of items.&lt;p&gt;
'''Object/Input''': an item in the starting set.&lt;p&gt;
'''Image/Output''': an item in the finishing set.&lt;p&gt;
'''Domain''': the set of all objects.&lt;p&gt;
'''Co-domain''': set of all possible finishing values.&lt;p&gt;
'''Range''': elements from the co-domain that are actually used.&lt;p&gt;

===Different Mappings===

1) unique &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; unique &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(1:1 or ''injective'' mapping)&lt;p&gt;
2) several &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; unique &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(many:one mapping)&lt;p&gt;
3) unique &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; several &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(one:many mapping)&lt;p&gt;
4) several &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; several &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;(many:many mapping)&lt;p&gt;

'''NB: A function can ''only'' be a 1:1 (injective) or many:one mapping.'''

===Basic Properties===
A function relates each of its inputs to exactly one output. If there are ever two outputs the formula it is not a function. For example  &lt;math&gt;y = x^2\,&lt;/math&gt; is a function because every x has only one output, but &lt;math&gt;y^2 = x \,&lt;/math&gt; is not a function because every x can have two values, for example 4 = &lt;math&gt;-2^2  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^2 &lt;/math&gt; so x can be 2 or -2. Graphs of circles (and similar shapes) represent many:many mappings and so they are not functions. You can determine if a graph is a function by using the vertical line test. This test states that a graph is a function if and only if any vertical line drawn will intersect the graph only once.
There are four ways to represent a function:&lt;p&gt;
1)A Formula&lt;p&gt;
2)A Graph&lt;p&gt;
3)A Table&lt;p&gt;
4)Verbally&lt;p&gt;

===Domain and Range===
Every function has a domain and range. The domain is the set of the input values. The range is the set of the output values. ''Remember if there is a reflection or translation in the function, there will be a reflection or translation in either one or both the domain and range.'' In example:&lt;p&gt;
The domain of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = +\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the range is &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; but the domain of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = -\sqrt{x + 6}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left[-6,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the range is &lt;math&gt;\left[0,-\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;. See [[../../C1/Coordinate_Geometry_and_Graphs#Stretching|Reflection Rule 1 and Translation Rule 2]]. 
====Domain====
The domain of a function is generally all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;  with these three notable exceptions:
1) If x is in the denominator, the point at which the denominator is zero is not in the domain, E.g&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{x}{x - 1}\,&lt;/math&gt; the domain will be all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;except for 1.&lt;p&gt;
2) If the exponent is less than zero and an even quantity, the domain will be &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, E.g&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; the domain will be &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt; will be all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
3) In a piecewise function the domain will be restricted by the definition, E.g&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} x, &amp; if\ x\le 5 \\ x^2, &amp; if\ 5&lt;x&lt;10 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; The domain of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; will be (5,10).

====Range====
There is one simple rule to remember for range. All even functions have a range of &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt; and odd functions have a range of all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Piecewise Functions===
[[Image:Upper_semi.svg|right]]A piecewise function is a function that is given by different expressions on different intervals.  The graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2, &amp; \mbox{if}\ x&lt; 2 \\ - \left(x - 3\right)^2 +9, &amp; \mbox{if}\ x\ge2 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; is shown on the right. The open circle indicates that the point is not included on the graph and the closed circle indicates that the point is included on the graph. So &lt;math&gt;f(2)&lt;/math&gt; = 8 not 4.

===One-One Function===
A one-one function must have a unique output for every input. In example &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; will not be one-one because the inputs -2 and 2 will both produce the output 4, but &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3&lt;/math&gt; will be one-one because every input will produce a unique output, f(-2)= -8 and f(2)=8. You can determine if a graph is one-one by using the horizontal line test. This test states that a function is one-one if and only if any horizontal line drawn will intersect the graph only once.

===Inverse Function===
The inverse of the function will produce the input value for the output value of the function. A function must be one-one in order for the inverse of the function to exist. To illustrate this mathematically: &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(y\right)= x&lt;/math&gt;. Also the composition of the inverse and the function will produce x: &lt;math&gt;ff^{-1}\left(x\right) = f^{-1}f\left(x\right) = x&lt;/math&gt;. An illustration involving apples and lemons can be found below. The original functions turns apples into lemons and the inverse function turns lemons into apples.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:Fruit_function_and_inverse.PNG]]&lt;p&gt;
To find the inverse of a function.&lt;p&gt;
1)Solve the equation in terms of x&lt;p&gt;
2)Switch y with x.&lt;p&gt;
3)Write in the notation &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In Example find the inverse of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = \frac{x - 1}{x + 2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
1) &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x - 1}{x + 2} \iff yx + 2y = x - 1 \iff yx - x = -2y -1 \iff x = \frac{-2y - 1}{y -1}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:11Inverse.png|right|300px]]
2)&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{-2x - 1}{x -1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
3)&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(x\right) = \frac{-2x - 1}{x -1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can test this out now &lt;math&gt;f\left(2\right) = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Graphical Representation of One-One Functions===
When we graph an inverse of a one-one function we simply have to switch the x and y co-ordinates:(x,y) becomes (y,x). The co-ordinate (5,7) will be (7,5) on the inverse graph. The graph will be a reflection through the line y=x. In the example on the right the red line is the graph of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = x^3&lt;/math&gt; and the green line is the graph of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(x\right) = \sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Composition of Functions==
The mathematical symbol for composition of a function is &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively a composition can be written as &lt;math&gt;f\left[g\left(x\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt; When you compose two functions you replace all instances of the variable with the second function. You can tell the order of the function by the order that the composition is written in &lt;math&gt;F \circ G&lt;/math&gt;, means F is composed of G. If the domain or range is restricted in some way in the original function it will be restricted in the same way in the composite function.In example &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = 2x^2 + 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\left(x\right) = \sqrt{5x}&lt;/math&gt; find &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;. Then find the domain and range&lt;p&gt;
1) Replace all instances of x in f with &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{5x}&lt;/math&gt; giving &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = 2\sqrt{5x}^2 + 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
2) Now simplify. &lt;math&gt;f\circ g\left(x\right) = 10x + 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
3) The domain will be &lt;math&gt;x\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; because g(x) can never have a negative x value, and the range will be &lt;math&gt;fg \left(x\right)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; because g(x) can never be negative.

well at least i am watching  it at the moment.First of all it is for doctors,and among them those who take USMLE exam of USA. so esoteric of course it is. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:202.125.143.67|202.125.143.67]] ([[User talk:202.125.143.67|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.125.143.67|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

::USMLE is the [[Wikipedia:United_States_Medical_Licensure_Examination|'''US''' '''M'''edical '''L'''icensing '''E'''xamination]], which is actually a series of exams (&quot;Steps&quot;) taken by medical students and physicians in the US. [[Wikipedia:USMLE_Step_1|Step 1]] is usually taken in the second year of medical school, before students begin clinical rotations; it is an eight-hour-long (!) test that covers all the medical, biological, biochemical and other pre-clinical study up to that point. The strange, occasionally foul mnemonics are a traditional device; they're useful for passing tests, but even more important for remembering things 'in the field'. The Wikipedia entry on [[Wikipedia:Cranial nerves|cranial nerves]] includes several examples of these. --[[User:Randomfloop|Randomfloop]] 11:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

== Section(s) Truncated ==

The info after &quot;Clinical - free association&quot; seems to have been truncated around Fanconi. This is the last intact version I found:

== Some broken and a link to surgery resource  ==

Hello , I am not sure if i should be making the changes to this book , but their are some broken links , and a link to surgery resource , which is weird as surgery is not a part of USMLE step 1 . Shall i got ahead and make the changes ?</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dragonexpert19. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dragonexpert19~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've come across this riddle several times in my life.  But why have I never seen a single explanation of the &quot;I can't operate on him&quot; bit of the story? -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 18:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)\

Discussion moved from [[Puzzles:Lateral puzzles:8:Solution]]:

Nobody seems to know a good explanation of the &quot;I cannot operate on this boy&quot; bit of the story.

* It's not that the doctor physically cannot, but his child is the boy boilogically. His legal father died in the car, who the boy considered a better father.
* It is not uncommon for doctors to refuse to treat family members as it may compromise professional objectivity.  In emergencies, doctors may treat family members until another doctor becomes available.
** Is it likely that this particular doctor meant &quot;refuse to&quot; when she said &quot;can't&quot;?  Besides, I don't at the moment see how this doesn't qualify as an emergency.  Anyway, my point is that the common answer is incomplete - we certainly should provide an explanation of this part in a suitable form. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 13:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Wikibooks:No original research]] is one of three content policies. The other two are [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]] and [[Wikibooks:Verifiability]]. The three policies are complementary, jointly determining the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|namespace]]. They should therefore not be interpreted in isolation from each other, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three.

==What is original research?==

'''Original research''' refers to original research by editors of Wikibooks. It does not refer to original research that is published or available elsewhere (although such research may be excluded if editors consider the source to be disreputable or inappropriate).

The phrase &quot;original research&quot; in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts or ideas that, in the words of Wikibooks's founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a &quot;novel narrative or historical interpretation&quot;.

===Primary and secondary sources===
*'''Primary sources''' present information or data, such as archeological artifacts; photographs (but see below); historical documents such as a diary, census, transcript of a public hearing, trial, or interview; tabulated results of surveys or questionnaires, records of laboratory assays or observations; records of field observations. 
*'''Secondary sources''' present a generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data. 

Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all modules on Wikibooks should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not &quot;original research,&quot; it is &quot;source-based research,&quot; and it is fundamental to writing a textbook.

In some cases, where a module (1) makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge, and (2) makes no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, or evaluative claims, a Wikibooks article may be based entirely on primary sources, but these are exceptions. 

In most cases, Wikibooks modules include material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. That is, we report what other reliable secondary sources have published, whether or not we regard the material as accurate. In order to avoid doing original research, and in order to help improve the quality of Wikibooks modules, it is essential that any primary-source material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data has been published by a third-party reputable publication (that is, not self-published) that is available to readers either from a website (other than Wikibooks) or through a public library. It is very important to [[Wikibooks:Cite sources|cite sources]] appropriately, so that readers can find your source and can satisfy themselves that Wikibooks has used the source correctly.

In some cases, there may be controversy or debate over what constitutes a legitimate or reputable authority or source. Where no agreement can be reached about this, the module should provide an account of the controversy and of the different authorities or sources. Such an account also helps ensure the article’s [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]].

&quot;No original research&quot; does not mean that experts on a specific topic cannot contribute to Wikibooks. Indeed, Wikibooks welcomes experts and academics. However, such experts do not occupy a privileged position within Wikibooks. They should refer to themselves and their publications in the third person and write from a neutral point of view (NPOV). They must also cite ''publications'', and may not use their ''unpublished knowledge'' as a source of information (which would be impossible to verify).

===Why do we exclude original research?===

# It's an obligation of Wikibooks to its readers that the information they read here be reliable and reputable, and so we rely only on credible or reputable published sources. See [[Wikibooks:No original research#What counts as a reputable_publication?]] for a discussion on how to judge whether a source is reliable. 
# Credible sources provide readers with resources they may consult to pursue their own research. After all, there are people who turn to textbooks as a first step in research, not as a last step.
# Relying on citable sources helps clarify what points of view are represented in a module, and thus helps us comply with our [[Wikibooks: Neutral point of view|NPOV]] policy.
# Relying on credible sources also may encourage new contributors.  For example, if someone knows of an important source that the module has ''not'' drawn on, he or she may feel more confident in adding important material to the module.

==Specific applications==
===The role of expert editors===
&quot;No original research&quot; does not mean that experts on a specific topic cannot contribute to Wikibooks. On the contrary, Wikibooks welcomes experts. We assume, however, that someone is an expert not only because of their personal and direct knowledge of a topic, but because of their knowledge of published sources on a topic. This policy prohibits expert editors from drawing on their personal and direct knowledge ''if'' such knowledge is [[Wikibooks:Verifiability|unverifiable]]. If an expert editor has published the results of his or her research elsewhere, in a reputable publication, the editor can [[Wikibooks:Cite sources|cite that source]] while writing in the third person and complying with our [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV policy]]. Otherwise, we hope expert editors will draw on their knowledge of other published sources to enrich our modules.  

===What is excluded from articles?===
A Wikibooks entry (including any part of a module) counts as original research if it '''proposes''' ideas; that is:

* it introduces a theory or method of solution; or
* it introduces original ideas; or
* it defines new terms; or
* it provides new definitions of pre-existing terms; or
* it introduces an argument without citing a reputable source, which purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; or
* it introduces or uses neologisms.

All of the above may be acceptable content once it has become a permanent feature of the public landscape. For example:

* the ideas have been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal; or
* the ideas have become newsworthy: they have been independently reported in newspapers or news stories.

If you have an idea that you think should become part of the corpus of knowledge that is Wikibooks, the best approach is to arrange to have your results published in a peer-reviewed journal or reputable news outlet, and then document your work in an appropriately [[WB:NPOV|non-partisan]] manner.

The fact that we exclude something does ''not'' necessarily mean that material is ''bad'' -- Wikibooks is simply '''not the proper venue for it'''. We would have to turn away even Pulitzer Prize-level journalism and Nobel Prize-level science if its authors tried to publish it first on Wikibooks.

===How to deal with Wikibooks entries about theories===
For theories:
# state the key concepts;
# state the known and popular ideas and identify general &quot;''consensus''&quot;, making clear which is which, and bearing in mind that extreme-minority theories or views need not be included.

Unstable neologisms, and ideas stemming from one individual who is not an authority, or from a small group of such individuals, should either go to &quot;votes for deletion&quot; (because they &quot;fail the test of confirmability&quot;, not because they are necessarily false), or should be copyedited out.

===What counts as a reputable publication?===

Reputable publications include peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house or university press, and divisions of a general publisher which have a good reputation for scholarly publications.

For non-academic subjects, it is impossible to pin down a clear definition of &quot;reputable&quot;. In general, most of us have a good intuition about the meaning of the word. A magazine or press release self-published by a very extreme political or religious group would often not be regarded as &quot;reputable&quot;. For example, Wikibooks would not rely only on an article in the Socialist Workers' Party newspaper, ''The Militant'', to publish a statement about President Bush being gay. However, if that same claim was in ''The New York Times'', then Wikibooks could refer to the article (and to the sources quoted in the article). The political magazine could, however, be used as a source of information about the party itself.

Ask yourself some questions when you are evaluating a publication. Is it openly partisan? Does it have a large or very small readership? Is it a vanity publisher? Is it run principally by a single person, or does it have a large, permanent staff? Does it seem to have any system of peer review, or do you get the feeling that it shoots from the hip? If you heard that the publication you are about to use as a source was considering publishing a very negative article about you, would you (a) be terrified because you suspect they are irresponsible and do not fact-check; or (b) feel somewhat reassured because the publication employs several layers of editing staff, fact-checkers, lawyers, an editor-in-chief, and a publisher, and will usually correct its mistakes? If it is (a), do not use it as a source. If it is (b), it is what Wikibooks calls &quot;reputable&quot;. 

When dispute arises regarding whether a publication is reputable, you can attempt to get more editors involved and work toward a consensus. There is no clear definition, but don't ignore your intuition.

===Original pictures===
Pictures have enjoyed a broad exception from the NOR policy. Wikibooks editors have always been encouraged to take photos or draw pictures and upload them, releasing them under the [[GFDL]] or another free licence, to illustrate modules. There are several reasons this is welcomed:
*Pictures are generally used for illustration and do not ''propose unpublished ideas or arguments'', the core reason behind the NOR policy.
*Due to copyright law in a number of countries and its relationship to the work of building free textbooks, there are relatively few publicly available images we can take and use. Wikibooks editors' pictures fill a needed role.

A known disadvantage of allowing original photographs to be uploaded is the possibility of editors using photo manipulation to distort the facts or position being illustrated by the photo. Manipulated images should be prominently noted as such and, if they are not, should be posted to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. Even noted as having been manipulated, they should not be used to illustrate modules in the main namespace, although editors are free to make use of them on user pages.

Images that constitute original research in any other way are not allowed, such as a diagram of a hydrogen atom showing extra particles in the nucleus as theorized by the uploader. All uploaded pictures are subject to Wikibooks's other policies and guidelines, notably [[Wikibooks:Verifiability]], and [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]].

==Related policies and guidelines==
===[[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]===
The prohibition against original research limits the possibility of an editor presenting his or her own point of view in a module. Moreover, by reinforcing the importance of including verifiable research produced by others, this policy promotes the inclusion of multiple points of view in a module.  Consequently, this policy reinforces our '''neutral point of view''' policy.

In many cases, there are multiple established views of any given topic. In such cases, no single position, no matter how well researched, is authoritative. It is not the responsibility of any one editor to research ''all'' points of view.  But when incorporating research into an module, it is important that editors situate the research; that is, provide contextual information about the point of view, indicating how prevalent the position is, and whether it is held by a majority or minority.

===[[Wikibooks:Verifiability]]===
The quality of a textbook depends on its accuracy and reliability. Our [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV]] policy acknowledges that people may disagree as to what &quot;the truth&quot; is.  People can, however, agree that certain points of view exist.  By relying on the research of others, and by presenting facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have been published by a reputable publisher, the no-original-research policy and our '''verifiability''' policy reinforce one another.

The threshold for inclusion in Wikibooks is '''verifiability''', not truth.

See [[Wikibooks:Verifiability]] for more detailed information.

===[[Wikibooks:Cite sources]]===
In order for people to be able to verify the research represented in a Wikibooks module, they must know where they can find the sources outside Wikibooks. Since this policy encourages editors to draw on previously published sources, it reinforces our '''cite sources''' policy.

See [[Wikibooks:Cite sources]] for more details and rationales, as well as an example of citation style (although formatting is of secondary importance).

==Origin of this policy: the opinion of Wikibooks's founder==

Wikibooks's founder, Jimmy Wales, has described original research as follows (although referencing Wikipedia, the same holds true here):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The phrase &quot;original research&quot; originated primarily as a practical means to deal with physics cranks, of which of course there are a number on the Web. The basic concept is as follows: It can be quite difficult for us to make any valid judgment as to whether a particular thing is ''true'' or not.  It isn't appropriate for us to try to determine whether someone's novel theory of physics is valid; we aren't really equipped to do that. But what we ''can'' do is check whether or not it actually has been published in reputable journals or by reputable publishers. So it's quite convenient to avoid judging the credibility of things by simply sticking to things that have been judged credible by people much better equipped to decide. The exact same principle will hold true for history&quot; (WikiEN-l, December 3, 2004).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An article that makes no new low-level claims, but nonetheless synthesizes work in a non-standard way, is effectively original research that I think we ought not to publish. This comes up most often in history, where there is a tendency by some Wikipedians to produce novel narratives and historical interpretations with citation to primary sources to back up their interpretation of events. Even if their citations are accurate, Wikipedia's poorly equipped to judge whether their particular synthesis of the available information is a reasonable one. ... I think in part this is just a symptom of an unfortunate tendency of disrespect for history as a professional discipline.  Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and synthesizing them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history&quot; (WikiEN-l, December 6, 2004).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==On talk pages and project pages==

Like most Wikibooks policies, ''No original research'' applies to modules, not to talk pages or project pages, although it may be regarded as poor taste to discuss personal theories on talk pages.

==Other options==
*[[meta:Main_Page|Meta-Wiki]] allows original research, see for instance [[m:research]], [[m:Wikiresearch]], [[m:Wikimedia Research Network]], [[m:wikiversity]], [[m:category:research]], and [[m:statistics]].

{{wikipedia|Binomial theorem}}
The notation ' &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; ' is defined as '''n factorial'''.

:&lt;math&gt;n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times (n-3) \times (n-4) \times...... 3 \times 2 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''0 factorial''' is equal to 1.'''
:&lt;math&gt;0! = 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof of 0 factorial = 1'''
:&lt;math&gt;n!= n \times (n-1)!&lt;/math&gt;
:When n = 1,
:&lt;math&gt;1!= 1 \times (1-1)!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1=1 \times 0!&lt;/math&gt;
:And thus,
:&lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt;

The binomial thereom gives the coefficients of the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^n &lt;/math&gt; .

We may consider without loss of generality the polynomial, of order n,
of a single variable z.
Assuming
&lt;math&gt; x \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;
set ''z = y / x''

:&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^n = x^n (1 + z)^n &lt;/math&gt; .

The expansion coefficients of &lt;math&gt; (1 + z)^n &lt;/math&gt; are known as the
binomial coefficients, and are denoted

:&lt;math&gt; (1 + z)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k &lt;/math&gt; .

Noting that

:&lt;math&gt; (x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} x^{n - k} y^k&lt;/math&gt;

is symmetric in ''x'' and ''y'', the identity

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n - k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

may be shown by replacing ''k'' by ''n - k'' and reversing the order of summation.

A recursive relationship between the &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
may be established by considering

:&lt;math&gt; (1 + z)^{n+1} = (1 + z)(1 + z)^n
= \sum_{k=0}^{n + 1} \begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k
= (1 + z) \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{k=0}^{n + 1} \begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k
= \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k + \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^{k + 1}
= \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} z^k + \sum_{k=1}^{n + 1} \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k - 1 \end{pmatrix} z^k
&lt;/math&gt; .

Since this must hold for all values of ''z'', the coefficients of &lt;math&gt; z^k &lt;/math&gt; on both sides of the equation must
be equal

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k - 1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

for k ranging from 1 through n, and

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ n + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{(n-n)!n!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} n + 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{(n-0)!0!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1
&lt;/math&gt; .

Pascal's Triangle is a schematic representation of the above recursion relation ...

Show
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

(proof by induction on ''n'').

A useful identity results by setting &lt;math&gt; z = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix}  = 2^n &lt;/math&gt; .

==The visual way to do the binomial theorem ==
{{wikipedia|Pascal's triangle}}
(this section is from difference triangles)

Lets look at the results for (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where n ranges from 0 to 3. 
 
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; =          1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;           =                1         
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; =        1x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;         =              1   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =      1x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;       =            1   2   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; =    1x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+3x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;     =          1   3   3   1

This new triangle is Pascal’s Triangle. 

It follows a counting method different from difference triangles.

 The sum of the x-th number in the n-th difference  and 
 the (x+1)-th number in the n-th difference yields the
 (x+1)-th number in the (n-1)-th difference.

It would take a lot of adding if we were to use the difference triangles in the X-gon to compute (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. However, using the Pascal’s Triangle which we have derived from it, the task becomes much simpler. Let’s expand Pascal’s Triangle.

 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;                                    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;                                  1   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;                                1   2   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;                             1    3   3    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;                           1    4   6   4    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;                         1   5   10   10   5   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;                      1   6   15   20   15   6   1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;                   1   7   21   35   35   21   7    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;                1   8   28   56   70   56   28   8    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;              1   9   36   84   126  126  84   36   9    1
 (x+1)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;          1   10  45   120  210  252  210  120  45   10    1 

The final line of the triangle tells us that

(x+1)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1x&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; + 10x&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; + 45x&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; + 120x&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; + 210x&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; + 252x&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 210x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 120x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 45x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 10x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.

A '''template''' is simply a page designed for inclusion on other pages. If a template is changed, this is usually reflected on every page that uses the template. As you might begin to imagine, templates are a powerful tool that when put to good use, can reduce work and increase maintainability. On this page you will learn how to use templates and how to make your own templates.

[[File:Transclusion-multiple-foo.svg|frame|center|Template B can be included on pages A, P, and Q to display its content.  Updating the template will change what is shown on the pages that make use of it.]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

== General ==
Templates may contain any desired wikitext, including calls to other templates. They have some limited programming capacities: customizable values (called [[#Parameters|parameters]]), calculation and branching (using [[#Parser functions|parser functions]]), and access to wiki-specific [[#Variables|variables]], such as dates, times, and page names.

To use a template in a page, a template tag (in the form &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template&amp;nbsp;name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, which is the name of the template enclosed in doubled curled brackets) is added where you want the template to appear.  When a reader wants to view the page, the servers fetch the contents of the template page, process any variables relevant to the page, and display the result in place of the template tag.

Templates are useful for any text for which one wants a copy in two or more pages, and there is no need for  each copy to be edited independently, to adapt it to the page it is in. Since parameters can be used, versions may to that extent even be different, and parameter values can be edited independently for each. Templates are not only convenient, but they can also “force” a useful uniformity, e.g., a certain “style”. 

Typical applications are:
*[[Wikibooks:Templates/Maintenance|Messages]] for displaying information ({{tl|split}})
*[[Wikibooks:Templates/Navigation|Navigation]] between a book's pages or chapters for easier reading online ({{tl|chapter navigation}})
*Placeholders for displaying visual information. Like tables, figures, diagrams, illustrations, etc.
*Composites composed of a table of simple images which display more complex ideas ({{tl|chess diagram}}

===Template pages and namespaces===
Templates have their own [[WB:NS|namespace]] which uses the prefix &quot;Template:&quot; (similar to the familiar &quot;User:&quot;, &quot;Help:&quot;, and &quot;Talk:&quot; namespaces).

Most templates exist in the [[Wikibooks:Templates|template namespace]], and can therefore be found on pages titled &quot;Template:''Template name''&quot;. Sometimes, however, users create templates in other namespaces, such as the User: namespace.  The normal use of a template (called ''transclusion'') is possible from any namespace, but the advantage of the template namespace is that the &quot;Template:&quot; prefix is not needed when transcluding. By contrast, in order to transclude content from any other namespace excepting the main namespace (where books reside), the full name is needed, including the namespace prefix. If transcluding from the mainspace (which is rarely done) a colon must be prefixed inside the template syntax, or the software treats the code as an uncreated template. Thus:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Namespaces !! Coding example !! Result 
|-
| Template: ||&lt;nowiki&gt; {{Name of template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || Transclusion of template content 
|-
| Outside template and mainspace  || &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikibooks talk:name of page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || Transclusion of page content 
|-
| Mainspace || &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Book title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || Transclusion of book content 
|-
| Mainspace without colon || &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || [[Help:Glossary#red link|Red-link]] to uncreated template
|}

Template names are exactly like other [[WB:CREATE|page names]]: case-sensitive except for the first letter, with spaces indistinguishable from underscores. If the symbol # (normally used to link to a [[WB:SECTION|section]] of a page) appears within the curly brackets, then it and any characters that follow it are ignored.

Template pages, like most other pages, have talk pages associated with them, where editors can discuss any issues relating to the template. (For this reason, templates should not be placed in &quot;Talk:&quot; namespace, even if they are intended for use on talk pages; since talk pages do not have talk pages of their own, there would be no page for discussing the template.)

===Template usage===
To transclude a template into another page, use the following syntax (called a '''template tag'''):
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''template name | parameter | parameter | ...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This consists of the template name and various parameters that are passed to the template, where each parameter is separated by a vertical bar (or ''pipe''), and the entirety is surrounded by doubled curly braces, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The template tag should be placed in a page wherever the template is intended to appear.  The &quot;Template:&quot; prefix is never needed for transclusion, only for finding and editing the template itself (though if the template is created in a different namespace that prefix ''is'' needed).  Not all templates have parameters, and not all templates that have parameters need to have values provided, so sometimes &lt;nowiki&gt;{{template name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is sufficient to use a template.  If a parameter is needed, but a value is not provided by the user, the template may render with something like {{mw-arg|...}} in the text, where the '...' might be a number or a parameter name.  This is to inform the user that a named or unnamed parameter is missing, and can be avoided by using [[#Parameter defaults|default values]] for the parameter.

Parameters come in two basic forms:
*unnamed parameters (sometimes called 'positional' parameters): values that are put into the template in the order they appear
*:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name|parameter1|parameter2|...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*named parameters: values associated with a particular named key in the template
*:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name| parametername1 = parameter1 | parametername2 = parameter2 | ...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
These may be mixed:
::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name|parameter1|parameter2| parametername1 = parameter3 | parametername2 = parameter4 | ...'' &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

By convention named parameters are listed last, though that is not a requirement. Whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, returns) are stripped from the beginnings and ends of ''named'' parameter values (unnamed parameters are unaffected), but not from the middle: thus &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ ... | myparam = this is a test }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will be treated as though the user had typed &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ ... |myparam=this is a test}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Template pages themselves may include material that is ''not'' transcluded with the template (such as documentation or categories that the template itself belongs to), or material that is ''only'' used when the page is transcluded (such as [[Help:Categories|categories]] that apply to the transclusion page, but not the template).  See the discussion of the [[#Noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude|''includeonly'' and ''noinclude'']] tags, below.

Attempting to transclude a template that does not exist produces a redlink, just like linking to any other nonexistent page.  Following the link allows one to create that particular template.

===Basic template usage examples===
If you wish to experiment with any of these, please use the [[Template:Template sandbox|template sandbox]].

====Templates with no parameters====
To see an example of a very simple template, look at [[Template:Tc]].  This template does nothing more than tranclude the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' into other pages.  For instance, editing the following phrases into any page will yield the associated results:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|+Using the template {{tl|tc}}
! Description  !! Text Entered !! Result after Processing
|-
| {{tl|Tc}} by itself
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{tc}}
|-
|Single use of {{tl|tc}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settling into the White House, we find the beginning of...&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settling into the White House, we find the beginning of...
|-
|Multiple uses of {{tl|tc}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settl{{tc}}g {{tc}}to the White House, we f{{tc}}d the beg{{tc}}n{{tc}}g of...&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{tc}} 2009, with Barack Obama settl{{tc}}g {{tc}}to the White House, we f{{tc}}d the beg{{tc}}n{{tc}}g of...
|}
You'll notice that the template includes only the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' when transcluded, despite the explanatory text on the template page (&quot;This template is used...&quot; click on the template link above to see).  If you edit the template page, (click [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Tc&amp;action=edit this link]), you'll see that everything except the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' is enclosed in '[[#noinclude|noinclude]]' tags, discussed later.

====Templates with unnamed parameters====
Transclusion with parameters is only slightly more complicated. For a quick example, the famous [[w:dead man's hand|dead man's hand]] can be reproduced by the following templates, using unnamed parameters:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|+ Making the Dead Man's Hand
! Description  !! Text Entered !! Result after Processing
|-
|Using three templates ([[Template:Clubs]], [[Template:Diamonds]], and [[Template:Spades]])
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{clubs|A}} {{clubs|8}} {{spades|A}} {{spades|8}} {{diamonds|9}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|style=&quot;width:30%&quot;|{{clubs|A}} {{clubs|8}} {{spades|A}} {{spades|8}} {{diamonds|9}}
|-
|Using ([[Template:BridgeHandInline]]); not quite as pretty, but just one template, with four parameters.
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BridgeHandInline|A8||9|A8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{nowrap|{{BridgeHandInline|A8||9|A8}}}}
|-
|Using ([[Template:BridgeHandInline]]), but with a missing ''pipe'' separator
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BridgeHandInline|A8|9|A8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{nowrap|{{BridgeHandInline|A8|9|A8}}}}
|}

In the second example, the position of the parameter in the template tag determines which suit it belongs to. Thus, the first A8 (first slot) goes to spades, the empty position (second slot) goes to hearts, the 9 (third slot) goes to diamonds, the second A8 (fourth slot) goes to clubs.  Note that the empty parameter position is counted; if the extra pipe is forgotten, as in the third example, the result is that the cards end up in the wrong positions, and a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{4}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; appears, meaning that the template was expecting a value for the fourth positional parameter but none was provided.  See the [[#Parameters|section on parameters and default values]], below.

====Templates with named parameters====
Using named parameters is similar to using unnamed parameters.  For example, [[Template:Payoff matrix]] (which is used in some books on [[w:game theory|game theory]]) gives a simple 2-by-2 grid with adjustable values, using the names UL, UR, DL, and DR to refer to Up Left, Up Right, Down Left and Down Right, and a Name parameter to add a name to the bottom of the matrix.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! Description !! Code !! Result
|-
|Payoff matrix
| class=&quot;&quot; | &lt;nowiki&gt;{{payoff matrix | UL = 5 | UR = 7 | DL = 2 | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{payoff matrix | UL = 5 | UR = 7 | DL = 2 | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage }}
|-
|Payoff matrix showing a default value for a missing parameter, and different ordering for the others
| class=&quot;&quot; | &lt;nowiki&gt;{{payoff matrix | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage | DL = 2 | UR = 7 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{payoff matrix | DR = 9 | Name = Example usage | DL = 2 | UR = 7 }}
|}

In the second case, the order of the parameters has been altered without changing the result - one of the advantages that named parameters have over unnamed parameters - and one of the values (UL) has been removed entirely, allowing the template to insert the default value of &quot;0, 0&quot;.

Parameter names are case sensitive, even in the first character.  for example, using ''&quot;dr = 9&quot;'',''&quot;Dr = 9&quot;'' or ''&quot;dR = 9&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;DR = 9&quot;''  will cause the Down Right cell to display the default &quot;0, 0&quot;.  The alternate case versions are treated as different parameters and ignored by the template.

===Substitution===
{{shortcut|WB:SUBST}}
Generally, templates are processed into readable text when a user browses a page.  This is the normal intention of a template: since the template is reevaluated each time it's used, changes to the template can propagate across many pages quickly and effortlessly.  Occasionally, however, this is not appropriate.  For instance, a user may want a template which returns a date or time that remains fixed, rather than changing each time the page is browsed.  For those cases there is substitution, which is done by adding ''subst:'' before the template name in the template tag.  Substitution does exactly what its name suggests: rather than processing the template each time the page is browsed, substitution processes the template at the time the edit is saved, and replaces the template tag with the processed results.

For example, the template {{tl|tc}} (as shown above) adds the letters ''&quot;in&quot;'' wherever it is placed.  Thus, the wikitext ''&lt;nowiki&gt;bra{{tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' will produce the word ''bra{{tc}}''. The wikitext will always remain as ''&lt;nowiki&gt;bra{{tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', however, so if {{tl|tc}} is changed so that it adds the letters ''&quot;wn&quot;'', the wikitext will produce ''brawn'' instead of ''brain''.  Substituting like so - ''&lt;nowiki&gt;bra{{subst:tc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - will permanently change the wikitext to read ''brain'', and later changes to the template {{tl|tc}} will have no effect on the substituted text.

===Common mistakes===
'''URL problems'''

URLs can contain equals signs (=) e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://some.page.org?key=value&amp;key2=value2&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  However, the first equals sign in a template parameter listing is always treated as though it sets off a named template parameter.  thus &lt;nowiki&gt;{{some template|http://some.page.org?key=value&amp;key2=value2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will act as though ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://some.page.org?key&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is a parameter name, not the start of a URL.  There are two workarounds for this problem:
*Use an explicit positional parameter reference: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{some template|1=http://some.page.org?key=value&amp;key2=value2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  the '1=' refers to the first positional parameter explicitly and will obviate the subsequent equals signs
*Use the special template {{tl|{{=}}}}: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{some template|http://some.page.org?key{{=}}value&amp;key{{=}}value2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This template returns an equals sign that is not parsed or interpreted by the wiki software.

'''Whitespace problems'''

''Named'' parameters will automatically strip whitespace - spaces, tabs, carriage returns and line feeds, or other non-visible characters from a parameter.  ''Unnamed'' parameters will retain all whitespace.  This can cause odd formatting issues where the wrong behavior is expected.

'''Vertical pipe problems'''

The vertical pipe character (|) is used in templates (and parser functions) to separate parameters.  If you need to provide a pipe character to a template parameter, then use the special template '''{{tl|!}}''' which returns an unparsed pipe character, or use the [[w:List of XML and HTML character entity references|HTML entity]] '''&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/tt&gt;''' for the pipe character.

== Creating and editing templates==
Templates are created and edited in much the same way as any other page: choose an appropriate name, navigate to that page, then click the ''Edit'' tab or create a new page as needed.  The only real difference is that templates will normally be placed in the &quot;Template:&quot; namespace rather than the (unprefixed) main namespace.  Anything that can be included on a normal page can be included on a template, including other templates.  Beyond that, templates have access to programming features—[[#Parameters|parameters]], [[#Parser functions|parser functions]], and [[#Variables|variables]]—which allow for context-dependent use, and special tags that help control which information is transcluded and which is not.

When creating templates, it's best to follow a few simple principles:
*Choose a short, descriptive name.  Some people suggest that generic template names be entirely in lowercase letters, and those for a specific book use the form ''Template:Book Name/Template Name'', but there is currently no hard guideline.
*Make a quick [[WB:SEARCH|search]] of template space or [[Wikibooks:Templates|browse templates]] to make sure that the template you're creating hasn't already been done.  It is sometimes easier and better to enhance an already existing template than to create a new template from scratch.
*Make sure your template is properly documented and included in the correct categories. (see below)
*Try to make your template modular: i.e. capable of standing on its own and in a variety of different page contexts, without breaking, producing poor output, or messing up a page's layout.  In general, you want your template to be transparently useful to other editors—the more effort they have to put into understanding how your template is used, the less they will be willing to use it.

===Template documentation===
Categorizing your template and documenting it will make it easier for other editors to find and use.
*To add documentation, put the {{tl|documentation}} template inside '[[#noinclude|noinclude]]' tags on the template page.  This will create a documentation subpage that you can edit
*Categories that apply to the template itself should be added to the template page (inside 'noinclude' tags, with the {{tl|documentation}} template).  Categories that are to be transcluded to the transclusion page should be placed on the template page inside '[[#includeonly|includeonly]]' tags.

===Parameters===
Parameters are special codes that allow wikitext to be fed to a template; the template can be constructed to produce different outcomes depending on the values of the parameters it receives.  Parameters may have names, or may be referenced by the position of values provided in the template tag (the order of the parameters in the template code is irrelevant).  Parameters in a template take the form {{mw-arg|...}}, where the tripled curled-braces surround the name of a named parameter or the number of a positional parameter. Values entered for parameters can be quite long, and if needed the transclusion of an entire page may be used as the value for a parameter.

To see how parameters work, consider this example. Assume there is a template called 'peoplepets' that produces some text about people and their pets.  A template tag for this template might look like the following:

:A. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small | kind = dog }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:B. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | Bill | Susan | age = 7 | Queenie | fat | kind = cat }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The contents of the template itself, on the page [[Template:Peoplepets]], looks as follows:

:{{mw-arg|1}} and {{mw-arg|2}} own a {{mw-arg|4}} {{mw-arg|kind}} named {{mw-arg|3}} who is {{mw-arg|age}} years old.

Thus, the two template tags above will transclude the following text, respectively:

:A. {{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small | kind = dog }}&lt;br/&gt;
:B. {{ peoplepets | Bill | Susan | age = 7 | Queenie | fat | kind = cat }}

Things to note:
*The numbering of positional parameters skips over named parameters (as with 'age' above)
*The leading and trailing spaces around the values of ''named'' parameters in the template tags are stripped by the template.
**This is not true for unnamed parameters, which preserve trailing and leading whitespace.  However, browsers render multiple whitespace characters as a single space, so the extra spaces around 'Fido', 'fat' and the other unnamed parameter values aren't immediately visible.  This can be confusing if unnamed parameters are used for something other than display, such as links.
*The order in which named parameter values are used in the template doesn't matter.
*The number of a positional parameter is treated as though it were a name: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; could have been written &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | 1 =  John | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This is useful when positional parameters need to be entered out of order, or when a position parameter value contains an equals sign.
*Values may be empty.  Here the second positional parameter and the 'age' parameter have empty values:
*:Template tag:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John || age = | Fido | small | kind = dog }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*:Produces (note the missing words):  {{ peoplepets | John || age = | Fido | small | kind = dog }}
*Values can remain unprovided.  Here the 'kind' parameter has been omitted:
*:Template tag: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*:Produces (this displays the missing parameter):  {{ peoplepets | John | Mary | age = 6 | Fido | small }}

====Parameter defaults====
Default values can be specified for parameters using the vertical pipe character: |.   The above example template could be rewritten as follows (in which 'friend' is the default value for positional parameter 2, the 4th positional parameter defaults to emptiness, and the 'kind' of the pet defaults to 'dog'—see [[Template:Peoplepetsd]]):

:{{mw-arg|1}} and {{mw-arg|2{{!}}friend}} own a {{mw-arg|4{{!}}}} {{mw-arg|kind{{!}}dog}} named {{mw-arg|3}} who is {{mw-arg|age}} years old.

A template tag like the following: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepetsd | Bill | age = 7 | 3=Queenie }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will then produce the phrase ''{{peoplepetsd|Bill|age=7|3=Queenie}}''.

Note that the '3=' before the name of the dog is required, since the second positional parameter is not specified.  

An empty value for a parameter will override a default value, producing an empty space.  in other words &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ peoplepetsd | Bill || kind=| age = 7 | 3=Queenie }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will then produce the phrase ''{{ peoplepetsd | Bill || kind=| age = 7 | 3=Queenie }}''

====Dummy parameters and tag layout====
Parameters that are not used in the template are ignored if they are provided by the template tag.  This was intended to prevent transclusions from breaking if a template is changed in a way that removes a parameter; there's no need to go to every page a template is transcluded onto and change the tags.  This has an added benefit, however, of making some template tags more readable, through spacing, or by adding comments.  Using {{Tl|t3d}}:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; style=&quot;width:80%;&quot;
|+ Dummy parameters
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Description
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:40%;&quot; | Text Entered
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Result
|-
| Adding comments using template {{Tl|t3d}}
|&lt;pre&gt;
{{t3d |a|b|c| row 1
      |d|e|f| row 2
      |g|h|i| row 3
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|{{t3d |a|b|c| row 1
      |d|e|f| row 2
      |g|h|i| row 3
}}
|}

Since {{Tl|t3d}} does not use parameters {{mw-arg|4}}, {{mw-arg|8}}, or {{mw-arg|12}} the 'row #' values have no effect on the produced wikitext.  Dummy named parameters can be used in any template tag; simply choose an unused parameter name and add it into the tag as 'unusedname = value'.  One special case of a named dummy parameter is to use an empty string as the parameter name.  

====Restrictions on parameters and parameter values====
*Unnamed parameters cannot be assigned a value containing an equals sign (=); the parser will treat the equals sign as the assignment of a named parameter.  There are several indirect means around this limitation:
**In the template, write the value as the default of an undefined parameter:
***{{mw-arg|...{{!}} a=b }}, where the ellipsis can be number of an unused positional parameter, or can be a blank string (a null parameter).
**In the page, assign the values to the template parameters with one of the following methods:
***&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''templatename''| 1= a=b }}, where the '1=' notation explicitly names the first unnamed parameter.
***Use the special template {{tl|{{=}}}}, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''template name''| &lt;nowiki&gt;a{{=}}b&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}
***Use the [[w:HTML entity|HTML entity]]  for an equals sign: &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;#x3d;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This is only useful for text representation; If the equals sign needs to be processed as an ''actual'' equals sign (as in another template) this approach won't work.
*Parameter values cannot contain vertical pipe (|) characters; the parser will treat the pipe character as a separator rather than as text. Pipes are possible within wikilinks (&lt;nowiki&gt;country=[[United States|USA]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or nested templates (e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;volume= {{convert|30|acre.ft|m3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Indirect means around this limitation are as follows:
**Use the special template {{tl|!}}, which returns a valid pipe character.  Use this method if you need something that will be read as an ''actual'' pipe character (for instance, if you're using the parameter to modify the structure of a wikitext table)
**Use the HTML entity  for a vertical pipe: &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This is only useful for text representation; If the pipe needs to be processed as an ''actual'' pipe this approach won't work.
*Parameter values cannot contain unmatched sequential curled brackets - &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The parser will try to parse them as the beginning or ending of a template tag or parameter, and will throw errors somewhere.  Parameters can, however, contain other parameters, magic words, or template tags.
**again, this can be circumvented using 'nowiki' tags or HTML entities.

===Nesting templates===
Templates may contain other templates – usually called 'nesting'.  As the template is processed, the wikitext produced by any nested templates is transcluded into the nesting template, so that the final product is essentially processed from the most deeply nested template out.  While fairly straight-forward in application, it involves some noteworthy quirks and tricks.

To pass a parameter value to a nested template, place a parameter tag as the value of one of the nested template's parameters.

*Examples:
**Template:A contains &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;the quick brown {{B|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{mw-arg|3}} &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; jumped over...&quot;. This takes the value passed to the third positional parameter of Template:A and passes it as the first positional parameter of Template:B, then returns the wikitext produced by B as part of the phrase.
**Template:A contains &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;the quick brown {{B|waldo=&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{mw-arg|3}} jumped over...&quot;.  As above, except  the third positional parameter of Template:A is passed to the named parameter 'waldo' of Template:B.

A template can call itself, but will stop after one iteration to prevent an infinite loop.

===Noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude===
Several tags are available to control what does and doesn't get transcluded from a template.  The three tags are noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude. 

====noinclude====
The 'noinclude' tag is used to prevent text on the template page from being transcluded onto other pages.  This is often used for:
*documentation
*categories that apply to the template itself
*[[Help:Editing#Interwiki links|interwiki links]] to related templates on other wikis.

Its use is straightforward:
:&lt;tt&gt;If this text were in a template page, this part would be transcluded
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;but this text would not be transcluded&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

====includeonly====
The 'includeonly' tag is the opposite of the 'noinclude' tag. Text within an includeonly block is ''only'' included when the page is transcluded, it does not appear on the template page itself.  This is frequently used for:
*categories that apply to the transcluding page
*hiding messy text or error messages that occur on the template page itself (often because parameters that need a value are undefined)

Its use is straightforward:
:&lt;tt&gt;If this text were in a template page, this part would appear on the template page and on the transclusion page
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;but this text would only appear on the transclusion page&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

====onlyinclude====
The 'onlyinclude' tag literally only includes the material that is between the tags; anything else on the page - even text within 'includeonly' tags, will appear on the template page but will not be included.  This is not frequently used, but might be useful when only a small bit of text in the middle of an otherwise large page is to be transcluded.

It is used like this:
:&lt;tt&gt;If this text were in a template page, this part would be visible there, but would not be transcluded
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;This text would not be visible on the template page, nor would it be transcluded&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;this text is all that would be transcluded&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

===Variables===
{{main|Help:Variables}}
System variables take the format {{mw-var|...}} where the enclosed text is always entirely capitalized.  These provide information directly from the system itself: local dates and times, information about the current page, and even information about the wiki itself.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; width:80%;&quot;
|+Examples of System Variables
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Description 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:40%;&quot; | Text Entered
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Result (for this help page)
|-
| Page names
|{{mw-var|PAGENAME}}&lt;br /&gt;{{mw-var|FULLPAGENAME}}
|{{PAGENAME}}&lt;br /&gt;{{FULLPAGENAME}}
|-
| Name of the current namespace
|{{mw-var|NAMESPACE}}
|{{NAMESPACE}}
|-
| Number of registered users
|{{mw-var|NUMBEROFUSERS}}
|{{NUMBEROFUSERS}}
|-
|Timestamp of last revision
|{{mw-var|REVISIONTIMESTAMP}}
|{{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}}
|}

The PAGENAME and NAMESPACE variables are particularly useful, and frequently used, to change template behavior based on context.  For example, if the template includes a [[Help:Categories|category]] (e.g. cleanup templates, which categorize the page as a page which needs cleanup), it will often check the NAMESPACE variable to make sure that talk pages, user pages, or anywhere else the tag might incidentally be placed do not themselves get categorized as pages needing cleanup.

===Parser functions===
{{further|mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|l1=at the MediaWiki website}}

Parser functions are the tools for performing simple branchings, calculations, text manipulations, and the like.  As a group, they take one or more parameters and return a wikitext value based on the parameters.  There are two basic forms for parser functions (distinguished by whether a pound sign follows the opening brackets):

*Core parser functions, of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;{{functionName: parameter | parameter | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  
*Parser functions from an extension to the software, of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#functionName: parameter | parameter | ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Parser functions are primarily used for the evaluation of [[#Parameters|parameters]] or [[#Variables|variables]], in order to produce different results in different contexts.

Core parser functions generally deal with text manipulation and specific project tasks.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;
|+Examples of core parser functions
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Description

! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Result
|-
| Uppercasing text
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{uc: Heavens to BETSY! }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{uc: Heavens to Betsy! }}
|-
| Lowercasing text
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{lc: Heavens to BETSY! }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{lc: Heavens to BETSY! }}
|-
| Getting a namespace name
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{NS: 1 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{NS: 1 }}
|-
| Getting a Wikibooks URL
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fullurl: pagename }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{fullurl: pagename}}
|}

The extended features provide more programming-oriented parser functions.

|{{#expr: ( 27 * 46 / pi ) round 2 }}
|}

===Other editing information===
*If the first included character of a template is one of the Wiki markup characters '''&lt;tt&gt;:;*#&lt;/tt&gt;''', then it is processed as though it is at the beginning of a line (even when the template tag is not).  This allows the creation of various kinds of lists in templates where the template may not always be in the correct place for a list.  To avoid this effect use &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;#&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or an [[w:HTML entity|HTML entity]] such as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#58;&lt;/tt&gt; for a colon. This is also useful in conjunction with definition [[WB:LIST|lists]].
*When a page called for transclusion is a redirect page, the redirect target is included instead.

== Revision history of pages containing templates ==
Pages in the stored [[WB:PH|page history]] consist of wikitext with possible ''references'' to templates and images. When viewing an old version of a page, these refer to the current versions of the templates and images, if these still exist. Thus the former composite page is not reconstructed.

__NOTOC__
'''Beef Stroganoff''', in its simplest form, is simply tender beef with a mushroom and sour cream sauce served over rice or [[Cookbook:Noodle|noodles]].

The current accepted history of this dish dates back to the 1890s when a chef* working for Count Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov (the famous Russian general) invented the recipe for a cooking competition in St. Petersburg. After the fall of Imperial [[cookbook:cuisine of Russia|Russia]], the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and restaurants of [[cookbook:cuisine of China|China]] before the start of the Second World War. Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as U.S. servicemen stationed in China, brought several variants of the dish to the [[cookbook:cuisine of the United States|United States]], which may account for its popularity during the 1950s.  It is commonly served with noodles or rice.

It is also very popular in [[cookbook:cuisine of Brazil|Brazil]] (where it is better known as &quot;strogonoff&quot; or &quot;estrogonofe&quot;), but the recipe is slightly different there.

Note * Despite the allusion of the name &quot;stroganoff&quot; to Count Paul Stroganoff, a 19th century Russian diplomat, the origins of the dish have never been confirmed. Larousse Gastronomique notes that similar dishes were known since the 18th century but insists the dish by this specific name was the creation of chef '''Charles Briere''' who was working in St. Petersburg when he submitted the recipe to '''L 'Art Culinaire''' in 1891, but the dish seems much older. It did not appear in English cookbooks until 1932, and it was not until the 1940s that beef stroganoff became popular for elegant dinner parties in America.

== Traditional ==

=== Ingredients ===
* 2 pounds (900 g) [[cookbook:beef|beef]] chuck roast
* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) [[cookbook:salt|salt]] 
* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) ground [[cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] 
* 8 Tablespoons (110 g) [[cookbook:butter|butter]] 
* 4 [[cookbook:green onion|green onion]]s, sliced (white parts only) 
* 4 tablespoons (60 mL) [[cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]] 
* 10.5 ounces (300 g) condensed [[cookbook:broth|beef broth]] 
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) prepared [[cookbook:mustard|mustard]] 
* 6 ounce (150 g) sliced canned [[cookbook:mushroom|mushrooms]], drained 
* 1/3 cup (160 mL) [[cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]] 
* 1/3 cup (160 mL) [[cookbook:White Wine|white wine]] 
* [[cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste 
* ground black pepper to taste

=== Procedure ===
#Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper. 
#In a large [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]] over medium heat, melt the butter and [[cookbook:browning|brown]] the beef strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips. 
#Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. 
#Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender. 
#Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste. 

Also very popular as a basic food service dish as it is very easy to produce it in large quantities.

== Quick and Easy ==

=== Ingredients ===
* 2 pkg (around 1.5 - 2.0 pounds) Bit Size [[cookbook:beef|beef]] (I prefer pre-cut stew meat. Left-over steaks cut into pieces works well. Ground beef browned in a skillet can also work if you have it around.)
* 1 can (8 oz) [[cookbook:Mushroom Soup|cream of mushroom soup]]
* 1/2 can (4 oz) [[cookbook:broth|beef broth]]
* 1 Tub (8 oz) [[cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]]
* 1 bag (16 oz) [[cookbook:egg noodles|egg noodles]]
* [[cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

=== Procedure ===
# Cook egg noodles in a large pot according to directions.
# While egg noodles cook, season the beef with salt and pepper and [[cookbook:brown|brown]] the meat in a [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]] unless it is already cooked. Low and slow makes a tender product. If meat is already cooked, heat the meat in the [[cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] or in a skillet.
# Drain egg noodles.
# Mix cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, and sour cream in the pot used for the egg noodles. Season the sauce with salt and pepper keeping in mind that many of the ingredients contain plenty of salt.
# Add noodle mixture with beef and serve.

This meal makes great left-overs.

&lt;h2&gt;Zen in the Art of Stuttering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Eugen_Herrigel|Eugen Herrigel]] taught philosophy at the University of Tokyo in the 1920s and 1930s. To learn the Japanese philosophy of Zen Buddhism he studied archery for six years with a Zen master. In 1953 he wrote [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0375705090&amp;tag=softlogic&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325 Zen in the Art of Archery] about his experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Daisetz_Teitaro_Suzuki|Daisetz T. Suzuki]] wrote in the introduction to Herrigel's book: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zen is the &amp;quot;everyday mind,&amp;quot; as was proclaimed by Baso (died 788); this &amp;quot;everyday mind&amp;quot; is no more than &amp;quot;sleeping when tired, eating when hungry.&amp;quot; As soon as we reflect, deliberate, and conceptualize, the original unconsciousness is lost and a thought interferes. We no longer eat while eating, we no longer sleep while sleeping. The arrow is off the string but does not fly straight to the target&amp;#133;Calculation which is miscalculation sets in&amp;#133;The archer's confused mind betrays itself in every direction and every field of activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Wendell_Johnson|Wendell Johnson]] said, &amp;quot;Stuttering is what you do trying not to stutter again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Fraser (founder of NAPA Auto Parts and the [http://www.stutteringhelp.org/ Stuttering Foundation of America] said, &amp;quot;Stuttering is largely what the stutterer does trying not to stutter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of stuttering therapy is spontaneous fluent speech. The goal of Zen is to do life activities without self-conscious calculating and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-stutterers usually talk without self-conscious calculating and thinking. But sometimes they are self-conscious about their speech. Fear of public speaking is common. And non-stutterers are self-conscious about asking the boss for a raise, or asking someone out on a date, or when discussing a difficult subject. Speech pathologists call this [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Stuttering Reduces Stress#Pragmatic Speech|pragmatics]]&amp;#151;the mental effort of calculating the listener's reaction to your speech. In the Zen framework, pragmatics is the calculation that is miscalculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of stuttering therapy should be to become a &amp;quot;Zen master of speech,&amp;quot; just as other Zen masters are archers or swordsmen or calligraphers. To make an analogy to Baso, you sleep when tired, eat when hungry, and talk when you need to communicate. You don't worry about the listener's reaction. You don't fear embarrassment. If the listener doesn't do what you want or expect, you don't get upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also talk fluently&amp;#151;but let's define fluency as if we're learning a foreign language. You need vocabulary to express your thoughts, grammar so your meaning isn't misconstrued, and accent and articulation to be understood. Mild stuttering may be OK, if your listener understands you, and you don't fear or avoid speaking. Van Riper called this &amp;quot;fluent stuttering,&amp;quot; and a Zen master might call it &amp;quot;fluency which is not fluency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like speech, archery is a combination of motor skills. You tense and relax certain muscles, with split-second timing. Like fluency for a stutterer, these motor skills are not easy or obvious. Like many stutterers working on their speech, Herrigel worked six years before he considered himself an archer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Herrigel study archery to learn Zen philosophy? Most Zen students read books, take classes, and talk with Zen masters. How could learning a set of motor skills teach you a philosophy? Herrigel was told that to learn Zen he must begin &amp;quot;by learning one of the Japanese arts associated with Zen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master Kenzo Awa's first lesson was drawing the bow, letting &amp;quot;only your two hands do the work, while your arm and shoulder muscles remain relaxed, as though they looked on impassively.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is like stuttering therapy, with the goal of speaking while keeping your speech-production muscles relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel couldn't do this first step. He would &amp;quot;start trembling after a few moments, and my breathing became more and more labored.&amp;quot; Sounds like stuttering!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was trying to draw a six-foot bow held above his head, which requires great strength. But somehow the Master did this effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#133;he called out to me to &amp;quot;Relax! Relax!&amp;quot;&amp;#133;the day came when&amp;#133;I lost patience and brought myself to admit that I absolutely could not draw the bow in the manner prescribed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;You cannot do it,&amp;quot; explained the Master, &amp;quot;because you do not breathe right.&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like stuttering therapy! The Master continued,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Press your breath down gently after breathing in, so that the abdominal wall is tightly stretched, and hold it there for a while. Then breathe out as slowly and evenly as possible, and after a short pause, draw a quick breath of air again&amp;#151;out and in continually, in a rhythm, that will gradually settle itself. If it is done properly, you will feel the shooting becoming easier every day. For through this breathing you will not only discover the source of all spiritual strength but will also cause this source to flow more abundantly, and to pour more easily through your limbs the more relaxed you are.&amp;quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And as if to prove it, he drew his strong bow and invited me to step behind him and feel his arm muscles. They were indeed quite relaxed, as though they were doing no work at all.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The new way of breathing was practiced, without bow and arrow at first, until it came naturally. The slight feeling of discomfort noticeable in the beginning was quickly overcome. The Master attached so much importance to breathing out as slowly and steadily as possible to the very end, that, for better practice and control, he made us combine it with a humming note.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First relaxed breathing, and now vocal fold vibration! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I cannot think back to those days without recalling, over and over again, how difficult I found it, in the beginning, to get my breathing to work out right&amp;#133;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When, to excuse myself, I once remarked that I was conscientiously making an effort to keep relaxed, he replied: &amp;quot;That's just the trouble, you make an effort to think about it. Concentrate entirely on your breathing, as if you had nothing else to do!&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard stuttering therapists say the same thing&amp;#133;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It took me considerable time before I succeeded in doing what the Master wanted. But&amp;#151;I succeeded. I learned to lose myself so effortlessly in the breathing that I sometimes had the feeling that I myself was not breathing but&amp;#151;strange as this may sound&amp;#151;being breathed. And even when, in hours of thoughtful reflection, I struggled against this bold idea, I could no longer doubt that the breathing held out all that the Master had promised.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to draw the bow took a year. Perhaps stuttering therapies are unsuccessful because we expect results too quickly. Stuttering therapy could start with a year of breathing exercises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Herrigel learned to loose the arrow. This was even more difficult than drawing the bow. Herrigel kept jerking his hand at the moment of release, resulting in &amp;quot;visible shaking of my whole body and affected the bow and arrow as well.&amp;quot; This caused the arrow to &amp;quot;wobble.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master told Herrigel, &amp;quot;Don't think of what you have to do, don't consider how to carry it out! You mustn't open the right hand on purpose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel told the Master that after drawing the bow, &amp;quot;unless the shot comes at once I shan't be able to endure the tension&amp;#133;I can't wait any longer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master replied that Herrigel's inability to wait was because, &amp;quot;You do not wait for fulfillment, but brace yourself for failure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel spent three years learning to release the arrow. The Master kept saying to release the arrow without tension, like a bamboo leaf holding snow, bending lower and lower until the snow slips off. The bamboo leaf waits without effort until the snow falls off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stuttering therapy, the first word of a phrase should be without effort, rolling off your vocal folds like the snow sliding off the bamboo leaf. You shouldn't intend to say the first word, as the archer doesn't open his hand on purpose. The word should say itself, without your planning or calculating or trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel's three years practice releasing the arrow suggests that learning to release the first word of a phrase may also take three years, and be the hardest part of stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel was dedicated to his practice, but he couldn't release the arrow smoothly. The Master kept telling Herrigel to become &amp;quot;truly egoless.&amp;quot; Herrigel became dejected, and planned to discontinue the archery lessons, concluding that, &amp;quot;all my efforts of the last few years had become meaningless.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then, one day, after a shot, the Master made a deep bow and broke off the lesson. &amp;quot;Just then 'It' shot!&amp;quot; he cried.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;quot; meant that Herrigel had loosed a shot without loosing the shot. &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; had loosed the shot, not Herrigel. The Master could not say anymore what &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; was, just that &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; can only be known through experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only after considerable time did more right shots occasionally come off, which the Master signalized by a deep bow. How it happened that they loosed themselves without my doing anything, how it came about that my tightly closed right hand suddenly flew back wide open, I could not explain then and I cannot explain today&amp;#133;I got to the point of being able to distinguish, on my own, the right shots from the failures. The qualitative difference is so great that it cannot be overlooked once it has been experienced.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stuttering therapy, the difference between your relaxed, fluent voice and your tense, stuttering voice is as obvious as night and day&amp;#151;after you learn relaxed, fluent speech. Until then it seems impossible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master then began training Herrigel to shoot at a target, adding, &amp;quot;He who has a hundred miles to walk should reckon ninety as half the journey.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master refused to teach Herrigel to aim, insisting that the target was not the goal, and the goal cannot be aimed at, and that the goal doesn't have a name, except maybe &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though the Master did not aim, all of his shots lodged in the black center of the target, from sixty feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first Herrigel tried to shoot without caring if the arrows hit the target. But he couldn't do this, and &amp;quot;I confessed to him that I was at the end of my tether.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Master replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You worry yourself unnecessarily. Put the thought of hitting right out of your mind! You can be a Master even if every shot does not hit.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be a Zen master of speech even if you still stutter. Mild disfluencies don't matter, if you communicate well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Master said he sees &amp;quot;the goal as though I don't see it,&amp;quot; Herrigel replied that the Master should then be able to shoot blindfolded. The Master then had Herrigel set up the target in darkness, except for one candle. Herrigel could not see the target at all, but the Master shot two arrows. When Herrigel turned on the lights, he saw that not only had both arrows hit the bulls-eye, but the second arrow had hit the first and splintered it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herrigel describes the following months as the hardest yet, of trying to hit the target yet not trying to hit the target. He gradually came to see the value of this training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It destroyed the last traces of any preoccupation with myself and the fluctuations of my mood.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Master had Herrigel shoot in front of spectators, and awarded him a diploma, &amp;quot;inscribed with the degree of mastery.&amp;quot; Before Herrigel returned to Europe, the Master added, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I must only warn you of one thing. You have become a different person in the course of these years. For this is what the art of archery means: a profound and far-reaching contest of the archer with himself. Perhaps you have hardly noticed it yet, but you will feel it very strongly when you meet your friends and acquaintances again&amp;#133;You will see with other eyes and measure with other measures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is at least one other method of making pipe fittings available on the internet, and the methods posted
there make a wider variety of fittings.  This is another approach.

Okay, we are going to make three different types of pipe fittings with this technique.

A 90% elbow joint.

A pipe &quot;Tee&quot;

And a four way fitting.

The &quot;Tee&quot; is made from the elbow joint, and the four way is made from the &quot;Tee&quot;.


== STEP 1 ==


Start with a basic cylinder.  Select it with the body tool (the all red pyramid in the group of four at the top of the W3D screen), it should all turn red, like the image in Step 2.

[[Image:step001.jpg]]

== STEPs 2 &amp; 3: ROTATE==

Right click to bring up the body menu.  Select '''ROTATE'''.  It will ask you what axis you want to rotate about.  Select the &quot;'''X'''&quot; axis.  BUT DO NOT MOVE YOUR MOUSE.  Instead, hit the '''&lt;tab&gt;''' key.  A menu will pop up asking you for a numeric value for the rotation in degrees.  Input 90.  The cylinder should now be laying on its side.  DON'T hit your space bar to deselect it, instead, right click again and select rotate once more.  This time pick the &quot;Y&quot; axis.  Again, DON'T move the mouse. Hit &lt;tab&gt; and put in the value of '''-45''' ('''minus 45''', not plus)  Make sure you are in orthographic view (that is the rightmost of the two pyramids in the upper left corner of your screen).  The top image is an orthographic view, which means you are looking at it from a 45 degree angle to start, so when you do the second rotation, it appears sideways on to your point of view (POV).

[[Image:step002.jpg]][[Image:step003.jpg]]

== STEP 4 ==

Use your mouse to drag a box around the vertices at the right edge of the cylinder.  (Alternatively, you could also use face select and use flatten in the face menu)  You should now have all the vertices at one end selected.  Leaving them selected, right click to bring up the vertices menu and choose '''FLATTEN &gt; X'''.  This will make all those vertices flatten into a plane perpendicular to the X axis.  If you hit your '''&lt;x&gt;''' key so you are looking down the &quot;X&quot; axis, you should see an oval shape.

[[Image:step004a.jpg]]
[[Image:step004.jpg]][[Image:step005.jpg]]

== STEP 5 ==

Hit the spacebar to deselect the vertices (if you used face select, just leave things as they are) Go into face mode and select the face created by the vertices you just flattened.  Right click to bring up the face menu.  Do '''EXTRACT REGION &gt; X''' to make a copy of just that face.  Drag it away from the cylinder.  Hit your spacebar to deselect everything.

[[Image:step006.jpg]][[Image:step007.jpg]]

== STEP 6 ==

Now go into body mode and select the now deformed cylinder.  Hit '''&lt;backspace&gt;''' to delete it.

[[Image:step008a.jpg]]
[[Image:step009.jpg]]

== STEP 7 ==

Select the region you just extracted.  On the menu across the top of the screen click on '''TOOLS &gt; CENTER &gt; ALL'''.  The oval shape should now be centered at the origin of the workplane.

[[Image:step010.jpg]]

== STEP 8: MORE ROTATION==

With it still selected, right click and select '''ROTATE &gt; X'''.  Don't move the mouse.  Hit '''&lt;tab&gt;''' and enter 90 in the pop up box.  Leave the oval selected.  You will get this:

[[Image:step011.jpg]]

Below is the view looking straight down the &quot;X&quot; axis.

[[Image:step012.jpg]]

== STEP 8 ==

Right click and pick rotate again.  This time choose &quot;Y&quot;.  Don't use the mouse.  Hit '''&lt;tab&gt;''' and enter the value '''45'''.  (we are going a '''POSITIVE 45''' degrees this time...) Your oval will rotate to a 45 degree angle.

TWO VIEWS: ORTHO AND STRAIGHT DOWN THE &quot;X&quot; AXIS AFTER ROTATION.

[[Image:step013.jpg]]
[[Image:step014.jpg]]

== STEP 9 ==

Go into face mode and select '''ONE SIDE ONLY''' of the oval.  Right click.  Do '''EXTRUDE REGION &gt; X'''.  Don't move the mouse.  &lt;tab&gt; and enter the value 3.

== STEP 10 ==

The face you just extruded should still be selected.  Right click.  Select '''FLATTEN &gt; X'''.  Now you have a cylinder that is flat on one face and at 45 degress on the other

[[Image:step016.jpg]]

You now have one half of a 90 degree pipe elbow with one end mitered at a 45 degree angle.

== STEP 11 ==

Hit space to deselect everything.  In face mode, rotate your model and select the '''45''' degree angled face.

Do '''TOOLS &gt; VIRTUAL MIRROR &gt; CREATE'''.

Now do '''TOOLS &gt; VIRTUAL MIRROR &gt; FREEZE'''.  Now you have a 90 degree elbow!  All you have to do is make it hollow, which we do in the next step.

[[Image:step018.jpg]]
[[Image:step018a.jpg]]

== STEP 12 ==

In face mode, select the two &quot;ends&quot; of your elbow and right click.  Select '''INTRUDE''' from the menu.  Move your mouse until you achieve your desired degree of wall thickness and left click.  You will now have a completed 90 degree pipe elbow.  This is the foundation for the pipe &quot;Tee&quot; and the four way connection.

[[Image:90-elbow-pre-intrude.jpg]][[Image:after-intrude.jpg]][[Image:after-intrude2.jpg]]

In the next steps, we will make the pipe &quot;Tee&quot;, which involves cutting away portions of an &quot;un-intruded&quot; 90 degree elbow and then doing another VIRTUAL MIRROR/FREEZE MIRROR.  We will also do a four way connection by cutting up a pipe &quot;Tee&quot; and re-joining it.

{{TOC right}}

Combustion type engines are limited in temperature, and thus gas exhaust velocity, either by the chemical energy of the fuel, or the melting point of the engine materials.  Ion and plasma type engines bypass these limits and reach much higher velocities by one or more of: using external energy sources, lower energy density to limit engine heating, or using non-material containment such as magnetic fields to direct the flow.  These methods also tend to make ion and plasma engines heavy compared to combustion engines, so they are not used for launch from high gravity bodies.  Rather they operate where there is already a low-g environment in orbit or away from gravity wells.

The ion and plasma types both involve high energy particles.  The distinction is one of density.  In the former the particles act individually, while in the latter they are dense enough to require treating them as a flowing medium.


==Ion Engines==

====48 Electrostatic Ion Engine====

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Electrostatic ion thrusters generally work by first ionizing the propellant, then using a voltage gradient to accelerate the ions.  They are capable of high exhaust velocities (30-50 km/s), but relatively low energy density and thrust in order to prevent overheating and erosion of the screens creating the voltage difference.  Since the voltage gradient is uniform between two flat screens, the ion beam is well directed without a nozzle.  Ejecting only positive ions would produce a net charge on the engine, so ion engines also have an electron gun to balance the charges emitted.

All ion engines require an external power source.  A number of variations for the power source have been proposed, but only Solar-Electric has actually been used.  Since ionization merely removes an electron, but does not accelerate the ion, it represents an efficiency loss for the engine.  Therefore ion engines tend to prefer fuels with high atomic weight relative to ionization energy.  Since most high atomic weight elements are solids, Mercury and Xenon have often been chosen, and sometimes Argon if operating in a cold environment or reaching a very high exhaust velocity is desired.

'''Status:''' Ion thrusters have been used in recent years on some communications satellites and interplanetary spacecraft.

'''Variations:''' 
:* '''48a Solar-Electric Ion''' - Sunlight is converted to electricity by a photovoltaic array. The electricity is used to ionize and accelerate the propellant by electrostatic voltage.
:* '''48b Thermoelectric Ion''' - Radioactive isotope decay produces heat. Heat is converted to electricity by semiconductors. Electricity ionizes and accelerates atoms in the engine. 
:* '''48c Laser-Electric Ion''' - A laser tuned to the optimum absorption wavelength of photovoltaic cells supplies power. The cells convert laser light to electricity, which is used to power the ion engine. The ion engine then ionizes and accelerates the propellant. The reason for using a laser is to get higher power levels than natural sunlight provides.
:* '''48d Microwave-Electric Ion''' - A microwave receiving antenna, or '''Rectenna''', on the spacecraft converts microwaves to electricity.  Electricity is used to ionize and accelerate atoms.  Microwave antennas can be low mass, but the operating distance is limited by the ability to focus the long wavelength. 
:* '''48e Nuclear-Electric Ion''' -  A nuclear reactor generates heat, which is converted to electricity in thermoelectric or turbine/generator cycles. Electricity is used to ionize propellant and accelerate it by electrostatic voltage.  This is more suited to high power applications, and outer Solar System locations where sunlight is weak.
:* '''48f Electrospray Thruster''' - An ionic liquid is emitted from a capillary nozzle similar to an inkjet printer.  A high voltage electrode then accelerates the charged droplets.  This is suited to very small thrust levels for small spacecraft, or for steering, since lithography can be used to create microscopic nozzles.
:* '''48g Colloid Thruster''' - Rather than individual ions, this method accelerates relatively massive colloidal charged particles.

==Plasma Engines==

====49 Arc Jet Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Sunlight is converted to electricity by a photovoltaic array. The electricity is arced through a propellant stream, heating it to a plasma. The propellant is then expanded through a nozzle. No specific protection from heating is used in the nozzle.  The arc jet method uses relatively low energy density and thrust levels, and a thick-walled refractory metal for the chamber and nozzle.  Exhaust velocities of about 6-8 km/s are reached with liquid fuels like Hydrazine or Ammonia.

'''Status:''' Arc Jets have been used on spacecraft, and are commonly used on Earth as plasma torches for cutting metals.

'''Variations:''' 
:* '''Pulsed Plasma Thruster''' - operates by ablating Teflon material between two electrodes by means of an electric arc. The Lorentz force accelerates the material out as thrust.
:* '''Vacuum Arc Thruster''' - operates by vaporizing and ionizing cathode material by means of a vacuum arc. The plasma accelerates outward as thrust.
:* '''Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster''' - operates via electric arc between central cathode and shell anode.  Flowing gas between them is ionized and accelerated by the Lorentz force from current and field interactions.

====50 Electron Beam Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A high voltage (hundreds of keV) electron beam is injected axially into a propellant flow. The electron beam heats the flow to plasma temperatures, which produces high specific impulse. Cool gas is injected along the chamber walls to provide film cooling and protect the chamber from the very high temperature plasma. 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 
  
====51 Microwave Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Electron-Cyclotron Absorption Rocket, Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR), Helicon plasma thruster 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Partially ionized gas directly absorbs microwaves, becoming hot, then expands through rocket nozzle.  To keep the hot plasma from damaging the engine, a magnetic field is used for confinement, often using superconductors for efficiency.  Current versions use Argon as propellant, but other gases should function with tuning.  It may be possible to use unprocessed rock as fuel.

'''Status:''' VASIMR is in ground testing

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:'''

* Personal communication from [http://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/VASIMR Ad Astra Rocket Company] in reference to alternate fuels, 27 Mar 2012.  Extensive publications about their thruster are linked to the main description page.

====52 Fusion Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' The exhaust of a pure fusion rocket is a thin, extremely hot plasma which gives very high performance. If higher thrust is needed, Hydrogen can be mixed with the plasma. This increases thrust at the expense of performance.  By varying the mixture ratio, the performance vs thrust can be adjusted as needed during a mission. 

'''Status:''' Fusion engines await practical fusion reactors, which are still in the research stage as of 2012. 

'''Variations:'''

:* '''Reactor Leakage Mixed''' - Some of the fusion reaction plasma leaks past the containment fields.  This may be a mix of reacted particles, and un-reacted fuel.  The leakage can be directly used as engine exhaust, or further mixed with additional material for higher mass flow/thrust at lower performance.
:* '''Plasma Kernel Mixed''' - The fusion core plasma may be intentionally seeded with non-reacting material, which gets heated as part of the reaction.  A certain percentage is directed out of the core for thrust, balanced by new fuel added to the core.  The possible advantage of this method is eliminating the mixing problem of adding mass after the reactor.  Fusion engines produce very high exhaust velocities, so trying to mix more matter into the stream may require very large engine components.  Otherwise the stream may simply be gone before it has a chance to mix.

'''References:''' 


====53 Antimatter-Heated Plasma Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' The exhaust of a pure antimatter rocket is charged particles and gamma rays. This gives an extraordinarily high exhaust velocity, but relatively low thrust.  If higher thrust is needed, hydrogen can be mixed with the plasma, at at the expense of performance. This likely requires a large magnetic bottle to contain the particles and Hydrogen ions (protons) long enough to mix.

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure, but is this a valid user-subpage?

My programming career thus far includes a small list of unfinished example attempts written in GameMaker Language which is a high-level programming language written in Delphi (I think).

A programming career is usually launched in several stages, let me explain them. First a person must either learn a programming language or choose to do something that requires programming knowledge. In this case, I chose to make computer games.

Many people would not say that the decision is part of the process to starting your career because none of them remember how they decided to be what they are. In this I am included since as far as I can remember I have always wanted to make computer games, or some kind of electronic game. In addition, my tastes started out at the top of the computer game technology list as well (3D games).

Secondly, a person will usually either go to school or become a hacker. Of course I put it simply enough, but it is more complicated than that. I am a hacker at heart, but I am also a very moral person, so I influenced myself away from hacking and spent my youth simply playing computer games all day every day.

Of course there is another component to the second step, that is guidance. Most people will tell you a story of their hero or someone who influenced their choices. I however am completely self-guided.

The journey to the third step is a long one. This may not be so long depending on your time spent and your typing speed. This step is usually marked by joining a team of programmers. You are on a nearly direct path to making a program that you can call your own (or at least your group can).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Thermodynamics/Entropy|next=Thermodynamics/The Second Law of Thermodynamics}}

The ''First Law of Thermodynamics'' is simply a restatement of the '''Law of Conservation of Energy'''.  There are a few ways of stating it, but they all mean the same thing:

{{TextBox|1=
* &quot;Energy is neither created nor destroyed.  It can only change form.&quot;
* &quot;The change in the system's thermal energy is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system.&quot;}}

The first definition is self-explanatory.  As an example, a propane grill does not &quot;create&quot; energy when it cooks food.  The energy stored within propane molecules and oxygen atoms is released in the form of heat and light when the propane molecules reassemble themselves into carbon dioxide and water (the combustion reaction).  Energy has not been created or destroyed.  It has simply changed from chemical potential energy into light and thermal energy.

The second explanation comes from a physics point of view.  It means that adding heat to a system increases its internal energy, and a system that does work (like breaking bonds or assembling large molecules from small ones) decreases its internal energy.  Overall, the total amount of heat, work, and energy remains constant.  This should make sense because heat is energy and work is energy being applied, so based on the first definition, all forms of energy must be accounted for.

{{Info|The First Law is much more useful in [[Subject:Physics|Physics]] than it is in General Chemistry.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Rueda de Casino]] ==

I remove the notice. As a book the title is Ok. For me as an administrator it is somtimes difficult to distinquish between small books and chapters of larger books violating the naming convention. In this instance I was hunting down chapters which may or may not belong to the [[Dance]] book which is in a pretty bad shape. I am not even shure if the contributers of [[Dance]] head for a book or a bookshelf - currently there is the [[List of dances]] which is neither fish nor meat.

However [[Rueda de Casino]] seems large enough to be a book of it's own in any case. Please accept my appologies. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:00, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

==Introduction==
All computer programs use up memory, whether that is a variable in memory, opening a file or connecting to a database. The question is how can the runtime environment reclaim any memory when it is not being used? There are three answers to this question:

*If you are using a ''managed'' resource, this is automatically released by the Garbage Collector
*If you are using an ''unmanaged'' resource, you must use the IDisposable interface to assist with the cleanup
*If you are calling the Garbage Collector directly, by using {{C sharp|System.GC.Collect()}} method, it will be forced to tidy up resources immediately.

Before discussing managed and unmanaged resources, it would be interesting to know what the garbage collector actually does.
===Garbage Collector===

The garbage collector is a background process running within your program. It is always present within all .NET applications. Its job is to look for objects (i.e. reference types) which are no longer being used by your program. If the object is assigned to null, or the object goes out of scope, the garbage collector will mark the object be cleaned up at some point in the future, and not necessarily have its resources released immediately! 

Why? The garbage collector will have a hard time keeping up with every de-allocation you make, especially at the speed the program runs and therefore only runs when resources become limited. Therefore, the garbage collector has three &quot;generations&quot;.

* Generation 0 - the most recently created objects
* Generation 1 - the mid-life objects
* Generation 2 - the long term objects.

All reference types will exist in one of these three generations. They will firstly be allocated to Gen 0, then moved to Gen 1 and Gen 2 depending on their lifetime. The garbage collector works by removing only what is needed and so will only scan Gen 0 for a quick-fix solution. This is because most, if not all, local variables are placed in this area.

For more in-depth information, visit the [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f144e03t.aspx MSDN Article] for a better explanation. 

Now you know about the garbage collector, let's discuss the resources that it is managing.

=== Managed Resources ===

Managed resources are objects which run totally within the .NET framework. All memory is reclaimed for you automatically, all resources closed and you are in most cases guaranteed to have all the memory released after the application closes, or when the garbage collector runs.

You do not have to do anything with them with regards to closing connections or anything, it is a self-tidying object.

=== Unmanaged Resources ===

There are circumstances where the .NET framework world will not release resources. This may be because the object references resources outside of the .NET framework, like the operating system, or internally references another unmanaged component, or that the resources accesses a component that uses COM, COM+ or DCOM. 

Whatever the reason, if you are using an object that implements the {{C sharp|IDisposable}} interface at a class level, then you too need to implement the {{C sharp|IDisposable}} interface too. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public interface IDisposable
{
     void Dispose();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface exposes a method called {{C sharp|Dispose()}}. This alone will ''not'' help tidy up resources, as it is only an interface, so the developer must use it correctly in order to ensure the resources are released. The two steps are:

# Always call Dispose() on any object that implements IDisposable as soon as you are finished using it. (This can be made easier with the {{C sharp/kw|using}} keyword)
# Use the finalizer method to call Dispose(), so that if anyone has not closed your resources, your code will do it for them.

==== Dispose pattern ====
Often, what you want to clean up varies depending on whether your object is being finalized. For example, you would not want to clean up managed resources in a finalizer since the managed resources could have been reclaimed by the garbage collector already. The '''dispose pattern''' can help you implement resource management properly in this situation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class MyResource : IDisposable
{
    private IntPtr _someUnmanagedResource;
    private List&lt;long&gt; _someManagedResource = new List&lt;long&gt;();
    
    public MyResource()
    {
        _someUnmanagedResource = AllocateSomeMemory();
        
        for (long i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++)
            _someManagedResource.Add(i);
        ...
    }
    
    // The finalizer will call the internal dispose method, telling it not to free managed resources.
    ~MyResource()
    {
        this.Dispose(false);
    }
    
    // The internal dispose method.
    private void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (disposing)
        {
            // Clean up managed resources
            _someManagedResource.Clear();
        }
        
        // Clean up unmanaged resources
        FreeSomeMemory(_someUnmanagedResource);
    }
    
    // The public dispose method will call the internal dispose method, telling it to free managed resources.
    public void Dispose()
    {
        this.Dispose(true);
        // Tell the garbage collector to not call the finalizer because we have already freed resources.
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Applications ===

If you are coming to C# from [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic|Visual Basic Classic]] you will have seen code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;VB&quot;&gt;
Public Function Read(ByRef FileName) As String
  
    Dim oFSO As FileSystemObject
    Set oFSO = New FileSystemObject
  
    Dim oFile As TextStream
    Set oFile = oFSO.OpenTextFile(FileName, ForReading, False)
    Read = oFile.ReadLine
    
End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that neither ''oFSO'' nor ''oFile'' are explicitly disposed of. In Visual Basic Classic this is not necessary because both objects are declared locally. This means that the reference count goes to zero as soon as the function ends which results in calls to the ''Terminate'' event handlers of both objects. Those event handlers close the file and release the associated resources.

In C# this doesn't happen because the objects are not reference counted. The finalizers will not be called until the garbage collector decides to dispose of the objects. If the program uses very little memory this could be a long time. 

This causes a problem because the file is held open which might prevent other processes from accessing it.

In many languages the solution is to explicitly close the file and dispose of the objects and many C# programmers do just that. However, there is a better way: use the ''using'' statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public read(string fileName)
{
    using (TextReader textReader = new StreamReader(filename))
    {
        return textReader.ReadLine();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
 
Behind the scenes the compiler turns the using statement into
''{{C sharp/kw|try}} ... {{C sharp/kw|finally}}'' and produces this intermediate language (''IL'') code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cil&quot;&gt;
.method public hidebysig static string  Read(string FileName) cil managed
{
    // Code size       39 (0x27)
    .maxstack  5
    .locals init (class [mscorlib]System.IO.TextReader V_0, string V_1)
    IL_0000:  ldarg.0
    IL_0001:  newobj     instance void [mscorlib]System.IO.StreamReader::.ctor(string)
    IL_0006:  stloc.0
    .try
    {
        IL_0007:  ldloc.0
        IL_0008:  callvirt   instance string [mscorlib]System.IO.TextReader::ReadLine()
        IL_000d:  stloc.1
        IL_000e:  leave      IL_0025
        IL_0013:  leave      IL_0025
    }  // end .try
    finally
    {
        IL_0018:  ldloc.0
        IL_0019:  brfalse    IL_0024
        IL_001e:  ldloc.0
        IL_001f:  callvirt   instance void [mscorlib]System.IDisposable::Dispose()
        IL_0024:  endfinally
    }  // end handler
    IL_0025:  ldloc.1
    IL_0026:  ret
} // end of method Using::Read
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the body of the ''Read'' function has been split into
three parts: initialisation, try, and finally. The ''finally'' block
includes code that was never explicitly specified in the original C#
source code, namely a call to the ''destructor'' of the
''Streamreader'' instance.

See [http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/tinguusingstatement.asp Understanding the 'using' statement in C# By TiNgZ aBrAhAm].

See the following sections for more applications of this technique.

===Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation===
The application of the ''using'' statement in the introduction is an example of an idiom called ''Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation'' (RAII).

RAII is a natural technique in languages like Visual Basic Classic and C++ that have deterministic finalization, but usually requires extra work to include in programs written in garbage collected languages like C# and VB.NET. The ''using'' statement makes it just as easy. Of course you could write the ''try..finally'' code out explicitly and in some cases that will still be necessary. For a thorough discussion of the RAII technique see [http://www.hackcraft.net/raii/ HackCraft: The RAII Programming Idiom]. Wikipedia has a brief note on the subject as well: [[w:Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|Resource Acquisition Is Initialization]].

Work in progress:  add C# versions showing incorrect and correct methods with and without using. Add notes on RAII, memoization and cacheing (see OOP wikibook).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Luthinya was born in Xi'an, China in 1993 and currently studies in St Paul's Girls' School of Hammersmith, London. Previously she has lived in China for nine years where she committed most of her primary education. As her parents believed in a preferable and freer education in England she came over the sea to that country in 2003 and plans to remain until when she could matriculate into university. She has a deep interest in modern theoretical physics despite also cherishing a love for famous works of literature and philosophy, the most prominent among which being The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien and Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant. The coming to the West has profoundly influenced her character into a freer form of thought and expression, besides also considerably widening her channels of interests and knowledge into more distant and esoteric fields. Luthinya also personally feels that she owes most of her abilities in creative and 'against- the- tide' thinking to the encouragement of individuality prevailing in Western schools, instead of the reducing of students to a mindless and faceless mass by means of the helplessly lacklustre exams, as is the tide of modern China enforced indirectly by Mao Zedong himself. Certainly her love for modern physics would not have bloomed so bright had it been left to wait and whither in the Chinese classroom Newtonian physics.

A rather profound quotation from Fritjof Capra would ascribe to her current character very well: ''Physicists have no need of Mysticism and Mystics have no need of Physics, but humanity needs both.''

Welcome to Wikibooks.  We are a group of people working together to write textbooks and other useful original non-fiction literature, and we are glad that you have chosen to spend some time here.

There are a few things that you should be aware of here, and most important, please read some of these pages on this project:

*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]
*[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers]]
*[[Help:How to start a book]]
*[[Meta:Help:Editing]] (about how to use the Wiki markup language here)
*[[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] (a collection of useful links to various pages on the project)

I would also ask you to please look at the following discussion pages if you have any questions:

*[[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]] (general Wikibooks discussions)
*[[Wikibooks:Study help desk]] (Q &amp; A list for general help on Wikibooks... especially for new users)

I wanted to add that the new Wikibook that you created, [[Tao te Ching]], is likely to be deleted unless you add some details about what you plan to accomplish here.  If you want to experiment, please consider editing on [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] where you can make a number of changes without worrying about damaging what anybody else may be doing.  The content there is regularly deleted, as it is only supposed to be for experiments for people new to this project.

If you are looking for more specific help and want a more personal touch, please consider cotacting one of the active [[Wikibooks:Administrators|project administrators]] here.  All of them have shown substantial interest in this project, and are familiar enough with how things work around here that they can generally help you out when you just can't figure things out.  Good luck and I hope to be seeing more of you soon.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:33, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks very much for contacting me. I am serious in my plans for the Tao te Ching - which I hope is within the catogories stated- but I would like to state that this book is not 'original' in the normal sense of the word. It is an ancient scripture concerning the 'Tao' as a Way and the virtues and powers for following such a Way, written by the Taoist sage Lao Tzu around two thousand and five hundred years ago. Many translations have been made available in English but I would like to make yet another translation available for the use of Wikibooks, along with several small sections of interpretation aids found within the books for those who did not know Taoism well. Please tell me if this does not fit the general scheme of Wikibooks- I only made sure that it was not fiction but it is still a mystical and religious text, and as I repeat a new translation is probably not conventionally 'original'. Also I am not quite certain I understood you correctly when you said about 'adding some details' about what I plan to accomplish there- to where am I supposed to add such details, or do you mean that the page I created was simply a manifesto for the book I am about to write? This bring me to another question- Where exactly am I meant to be able to creat my book free and proper? So far all the pages I have known were article pages wholly unlike to that of proper books where one may flip at will. Where exactly are the paper, as they were, upon which I can properly write my book? I thought I would use the page I just found for the time being, but as you contacted me I think you might be able to solve my problem. And many thanks for your attention!

---

If you are interested in doing a translation or simply a transcription of an existing manuscript, there is another project that is a much better place for material like this.  You should consider [[s:|Wikisource]], which is a Wikimedia sister project to Wikibooks.  On Wikisource they have more of a collaborative effort to make sure the content is added correctly, and groups in place that can help you out to verify the content you are adding, including a slightly stronger multi-lingual atmosphere than exists here on Wikibooks.  If you are planning to do the translation yourself, that is certainly an admirable task and something I've attempted to do myself for some documents.

As far as adding details about what your plans on a Wikibook or similar Wikimedia page, make sure you are using the discussion pages to let other contributors know where you are going to go with a similar kind of project.  This can be a simple sentance saying &quot;I'm new here and can use some help&quot; to a full manifesto about the book or article.

Once you have the content of the book down and would like some help to turn it into something that is more like a physical paper book like a typical textbook, make a comment on [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]] for more assistance.  This has been done to a few books here already, although for the most part we are busy trying to improve the content first and simply trying to get the thoughts organized.  Adding the written content down in the first place is by far the most difficult part of the whole task, and once that has been added trying to make a physcial book is considerably easier.

As far as making an annotated text or study aids for a classic text, that is something that can be done on either Wikibooks or Wikisource.  If it involves mainly source material, it would be worthwhile to keep most of it on Wikisource, while if the source material is minor compared to the study materials it may be used on Wikibooks.  That is a judgement call you would have to make but I would recommend that the source text itself (even a translation) be kept on Wikisource if possible.  The two projects are easily linked between each other and have similar policies and philosophies.

I hope that this answers some of your questions.  Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:27, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

Thank you very much. I am certainly much indebted to you.

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Luthinya. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Luthinya~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

General info:

RMB = Right Mouse Button (Single click of the...)

MMB = Middle Mouse Button.

LMB = Left Mouse Button.

So, for example, an RMB option refers to that option (of a tool) available by R clicking on it.

Default hotkeys are shown in bold. eg '''C''' for Connect.

Please check the main info line as this contains very useful information about the command / tool you're using.




'''Using Edge | Intersect to create a pipe joint of any angle.'''.....(Advanced Menus required - Edit &gt; Prefs &gt; Adv.)

[[Image:ISbend.gif]]

1.Create cylinder and select all axial edges

2.Edge | '''C'''onnect to form a new edgeloop.

3.Select end face

4.Rotate face around relevant axis – I used X &gt; 23.36 deg..&lt;br&gt;
Use Tab input for entering weird angles that aren't easily obtained by using Shift (15 deg) or Cntrl (1 deg) constraints.&lt;br&gt;
(See 'comments' for how to work out this 'rotate angle')

5.Select edges around lower (undistorted) part of cylinder (select one edge, press '''G''') and apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick plane) – Select the newly angled face.

6.Execute Intersect – the upper ends of the selected axial edges will now alter in length, until they ‘intersect’ the specified plane.

7.Situation at the top of the cylinder – essentially showing the distortion caused by the original rotate op in (4) – we need to make this one face – select large central face.

8.Press '''F''' (or '''+''') to grow the selection. (17 faces selected)

9.Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to get rid of all the separate faces and form a single face.

10.Face | Mirror to get required bend / joint etc.



'''Comments.'''

(2) is done to create axial edges that will stay undistorted during the rotate op. Use any system you prefer to achieve this (reference) geometry (Extruding the end face &gt; -Y is useful if you forget (2) prior to rotate op)
Whilst the above method will work for any angle, you may have to adjust the position (-Y) of the edgeloop formed in (2) to get it out of the way (of the Intersect plane) if rotating the face thro’ a large angle. (Could also move the rotated face +Y).

Select appropriate faces and use Face | Intrude to 'hollow out' this object to create a 'pipe'.




The expression needed to work out the included angle – for precise, non-eyeball stuff is :

Wings rotate angle = [90 – half the (included) angle required].

Eg for a 130 deg bend

Rotate Angle = [90 – 130/2] &gt;&gt; [90 - 65]  &gt;&gt; 25 degrees

So, for a 130 deg bend you’d have to rotate the top face (4) by 25 degrees.










''' Using Edge | Intersect to create a pipe T joint of any angle.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

'''Overview:'''

Change cylinder end face &gt; 2 semicircular faces.

Rotate (vector) one (face) thro’ half the required included angle for the joint.

Rotate the other (face) thro’ [90 – first angle], to form two faces at right angles to each other.

Use Edge | Intersect to correct distortion issues.

Tidy up faces, mirror and extrude to get required object.

[[Image:ISTjointangled1.gif]]

Using Edge | Intersect to create a pipe T joint of any angle.

1.Create default cylinder, select bottom face and Face | Extrude &gt; Y (or normal) a little – amount unimportant (provided you can see it :) )&lt;br&gt;
Select a pair of verts on the ends of a diagonal and apply Vert | Connect ('''C''') to create a diameter edge across the end face (mine’s parallel to the Z axis). Select one of the semicircular faces – either is ok.

2.Apply Face | Rotate &gt; Z &gt; RMB (Pick point for axis to pass thro’) Select either an end vert of this 'diameter edge' (as shown) or the diameter edge itself to specify the origin for the local rotate axis.

3.Execute op, by dragging the appropriate angle – which is half the included angle of the joint.&lt;br&gt;
I wanted a 66 deg joint, so I dragged 33 deg – holding cntrl to constrain to 1 deg steps. Use Tab input and enter the appropriate amount if it’s a nasty figure.

4.Select the other semicircular face and basically repeat what you’ve just done with the first face (press D to repeat last (rotate) op – as it’s using the same axis)

5.This pic is redundant if you use '''D''' to repeat the op – if you repeat the whole op from the start, use the same ‘anchor’ point (as shown). Drag to [90 - first angle] in this case, [90 - 33] = 57 deg (or use Tab as before).

6.With both semicircular end faces now at their correct angles, it’s time to correct the cylinder distortion caused by the rotate ops.&lt;br&gt; 
Select the (7) axial edges shown (some hidden) that are equi-spaced around the X axis.&lt;br&gt; 
(One on X axis, 3 either side, for this setup with a 16 sided default cylinder – eyeball info at top left to check you’ve only got 7 edges selected)

7.Apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick Plane) and select the semicircular end face on the same side as the selected axial edges.

8.Execute Intersect op – and the upper verts of the selected edges will now lie on the plane specified by the end face.

9.Repeat the whole Intersect op. for the other set of edges. Press '''Cntrl D''' to repeat last op – but offering the facility of using different elements. Note that 9 edges are selected this time.

10.Select appropriate end face to specify plane (for Intersect).

11.Execute Intersect – all selected edges now adjusted.



Continued...



[[Image:ISTjointangled2.gif]]


12.Select all end faces as shown on one side (either side is ok) – you should have 9 faces selected (with def. cyl.) – be sure you’ve got the little s**s adjacent to the diameter edge – depending on what angles the end faces have been rotated, these small, thin faces can be quite small and difficult to select.&lt;br&gt; 
Be wary of using certain selection ‘spreading / growing’ techniques as it’s possible to select the similar faces on the other side. Just eyeball info and check you’ve only got 9 :).

13.Apply Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to form a single face – keep this selected.

14.Apply Face | Mirror to form the major part of the joint. (all downhill from here).

15.Select all (18) faces shown and use Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') again to form a single face.

16.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; Y and drag to as required.

17.Apply Face | Flatten &gt; Y to sort out the end face.

18.Finished object – If you want to check the angle, select any pair of relevant edges (say, on a centreline) and eyeball ‘Angle’ info, top left display.










'''Using Edge | Intersect and remote reference to create a pipe T joint of any angle.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

Overview:

Create a cube and rotate it half the required included angle.

Create cylinder and change one end face &gt; 2 semicircular faces.

Use Edge | Intersect to extend cylinder Axial edges to the remote reference faces.

Tidy up faces, mirror and extrude to get required object.


An alternative to the previous method which might be worth considering if joint construction is taking place at the origin – rather than ‘in situ’ – somewhere on the model, away from the origin.

[[Image:ISTjointangledcube.gif]]

1.Create cube and apply Object | Move &gt; X &gt; 1 unit (hold shift to constrain).

2.Apply Object | Rotate &gt; Z &gt; RMB option (Pick point for axis to pass thro’) Select the upper edge immediately above the Z axis or either end vert) &gt; Execute op. by dragging half the required included angle of the joint. I wanted a 66 deg joint, so dragged (holding cntrl for 1 deg steps) thro’ 33 deg.&lt;br&gt;
This image (View '''Z''', '''O'''rtho) shows situation after rotate op – Important – note that upper (pivot / hinge) edge is exactly on the YZ plane, ie above the origin.

3.Create a cylinder (default here), Apply Object | Move &gt; -Y (enough to ‘clear’ the cube) and use Vert | Connect ('''C''') to form the diameter edge across the upper end face (as shown).
Select the 9 axial edges (centre one on X axis and 4 either side) and Apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick plane) &gt; select the cube face above these selected edges (as shown).

4.Execute the Intersect op – upper ends of selected edges extend to the selected reference plane.

5.Select the remaining (7) edges around the cylinder and re-apply the same Intersect op. Use '''Cntrl D''' to repeat this op, but letting you choose a different plane (as shown). (Or repeat the op from scratch – your choice).

6.Situation after the op’s been completed.

7.Cylinder with its 2 end faces formed as needed. Hide / dump cube.

8.Select either angled face and apply Face | Mirror. Select the 2 faces shown and Dissolve ('''Bksp''').

9.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; Y to create the remaining stub and use Face | Flatten &gt; Y to tidy end face.

10.Finished object.

'''
Comments:'''

In the above description, I used a cube and moved &gt; X &gt;1 unit. There’s no doubt many other ways of achieving the same result (eg,select all X edges, connect, loopcut, dump other half – for one) – use whatever approach fits your workflow (and hkeys?) best.

This (cube) move and the consequent vector rotate op isn’t absolutely necessary – you could just Rotate &gt; Z in the cube’s default position. Doing this, however will entail 2 different Intersect ops (first RMB, second MMB) as the planes are at the correct angle but not intersecting at the same point as the main description. (It would also remove the possibility of using '''Cntrl D''' for repeating the RMB option)

  








'''Using Edge | Intersect to create a 90 deg T joint.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

[[Image:ISTjoint.gif]]

Using Edge | Intersect to create a T joint.

1.Create cylinder, Scale Y &gt; (anything positive … I used 200%). Select all axial edges and apply Edge | Connect to form a new edgeloop.

2.Select a vert and move Y &gt; -1 unit (any vert will do, I used the one opposite the +X axis to keep things tidy.

3.Select the 3 edges (if using a def. cyl.) either side of the edge where the vert has just been moved.

4.Apply Edge | Intersect &gt; RMB option (Pick plane) Select the 3 verts shown. The left and right ones in this image both lie on the Z axis. These 3 verts describe a plane at 45 deg to the Y axis.

5.A different view ( View '''Z''', '''O'''rtho), showing the vector (normal) associated with the required plane. 

6.Execute the Intersect op – the lower ends of all the selected edges now lie on the required plane.

7.Select all the faces on the upper part of the object and apply Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to create a single face. (Could also have used LoopCut to chop the thing in half etc.

8.Select the 2 relevant verts and use Vert | Connect ('''C''') to create the new edge shown. This forms the necessary mirror face.

9.Select face shown and apply Face | Mirror.

10.Select both faces shown, apply Face | Dissolve ('''Bksp''') to form a single one.

11.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; X &gt; and drag to suit. Tidy the end by using Face | Flatten &gt; X.



'''Comments:'''

In (1) I only scaled Y to provide ‘room’ for the new pipe diameter – as a def. cyl is also 2 units long – same as the diameter.&lt;br&gt;
In (2) I moved the vert 1 unit. This, of course will only work (for a 90 deg T joint) if you’re using a default cylinder with a radius of 1 unit. If you’re using a different diameter cylinder – measure the radius (diameter) and use the appropriate figure.&lt;br&gt;
In general, you could have connected the verts of a def. cylinder (same verts as used in (8)) and then used a similar intersect procedure on one of the semicircular faces of this ‘block’ – ie no need to dump the upper half as I’ve done here.










'''Using Vector scale op to correct distortion / form a joint.'''.....(Adv. Menus reqd.)

[[Image:VSjoint.gif]]

Using Vector scale for a pipe joint

1.Create cylinder, select end face.

2.Face | Rotate &gt; X &gt; 45 degree (hold shift to constrain to 3 x 15 deg steps).

3.Apply Face | Scale Axis &gt; RMB option (Pick axis to scale along) select the 2 verts shown – this is to correct the projected view of the end face when viewed along the Y and Z axes.

4.Start dragging, press Tab, enter 141.42% in the data entry box. (141.42 = square root 2 x 100% - a figure that (together with its derivatives [70.71, 29.29] etc) is extremely useful and well worth remembering – imo.

5.Use Face | Mirror to get required object.


'''Comments:'''

In (3) – for a general situation,  it should be fairly clear (hopefully) which 2 verts you have to select to re-size (rmb axial scale) the end face, as the face essentially needs to be ‘stretched’ along one axis only.
 
Use 115.47% scaling factor if you rotate thro’ 30 deg.

Use 200% scaling factor if you rotate thro’ 60 deg.


To get a 90 deg T joint.&lt;br&gt; 
Vector flatten the outer (semicircular) edges of the joint.&lt;br&gt;
Use Edge | loopcut to remove unwanted geometry.&lt;br&gt;
Mirror

Similar for a 4 way joint – after connecting relevant verticies for a centre line.










'''Making a 90 deg  corner joint from a sphere.'''

[[Image:Spherejoint.gif]]

1.Create default sphere and select whole object.

2.Object | Scale Radial &gt; Y &gt; 141.42% (drag slightly, press '''Tab''' to get data entry box, enter 141.42 and accept)

3.All (8) cross-sectional edgeloops of the sphere are now ellipses of the correct ratio (major / minor axes) for the purpose in hand.&lt;br&gt;Whilst a 90deg joint could be made from any of these loops, selecting either the one shown, or the one at right angles to it make the job easier (no vector extrude op required).

4.View '''X''' '''O'''rtho, showing the projected shape of the ellipse as a circle – exactly what’s needed. (View '''Z''' would be similar)

5.Apply Edge | LoopCut to selected edgeloop and delete unwanted half – select elliptical face.

6.Apply Face | Extrude &gt; Z (or X), drag to suit.

7.Apply Face | Flatten &gt; Z (or X, if extrude X used)

8.Apply Face | Mirror to get required object.










'''Making a 90 deg  corner joint from a torus.'''

[[Image:Torusjoint.gif]]

1.Get primitives menu and open data entry box for the Torus (click on small box or RMB on listing if using Advanced Menus)  Enter the data shown. Three fields need changing from the default settings:

Sections &gt; 4

Slices &gt; 16

Minor Radius &gt; 0.7071 

(can enter 0.707107 – half the figure above in Major Radius field – if you’re really keen and after even more precision – but it’s hardly worth it imo :) ) 
You’ll get the figure shown – 4 joints, in essence.

2.To get rid of unwanted junk, create the 2 new edgeloops shown. Select an axial edge on each portion, press '''G''' (edge rin'''G''') to get the rest, '''C''' (Edge | '''C'''onnect) to connect them.

3.Apply Edge | LoopCut and delete the unwanted portion. This looks ok – but it’s not – because it needs to be scaled (Y).

4.Shows why it needs scaling – unless you want elliptical pipes.

5.Select whole object and apply Object | Scale &gt; Y &gt; 70.71% (use Tab entry box as described earlier).

6.Finished item.



'''Comments:'''

The figures I’ve used above will produce an object with 16 sides, having a (pipe) diameter of 1 unit (or very nearly so, anyway) – if you want other sizes you’ll have to use other figures.&lt;br&gt;
If you want to change the absolute minimum number of fields – then don’t bother with the last (min Rad) – the absolute essential one to change is the Sections &gt; 4 (assuming you want a 90 deg joint – other figs will produce joints with different included angles)

====New EPD Procedures====

In January, 2006, the [[Georgia Environmental Protection Division|Georgia EPD]] published new procedures regarding role of EPD and the local issuing authorities:
* Recognizing that the Georgia Environmental Protection Division does not have staff or funds to replace local erosion control programs, the agency will try to support local programs through education and guidance. 
* Local governments are the first line of authority, and EPD will serve as a &quot;backstop.&quot; 
* However, if EPD investigates a site and finds violations, it must seek enforcement actions that could include penalties. 
* EPD can issue stop-work orders even in areas where a local government program is in effect. 
* Complaints to EPD in areas with local programs will be referred to local authorities, who must respond to EPD in writing as to how the complaint was resolved. 
* Failure to respond can trigger EPD enforcement actions against the violator and could result in suspension of the local government program.
* In situations where a local government issues permits for activities EPD deems inappropriate, EPD will not punish the developer but will require the local government to correct its procedures for future permits.
* Local governments can be decertified to issue development permits if their programs are inadequate, but they will be given time to correct their problems.

==Setup Instructions==
#Install subversion client software from:&lt;br&gt; http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/
#Download the m-file [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/files/DownloadPsychtoolbox.m DownloadPsychtoolbox.m]
#This file is the Psychtoolbox-Installer.
## Save the installer into your Psychtoolbox path.
## Change Matlab working directory to a folder were you want to download the latest release of PTB.
## Enter either DownloadPsychtoolbox('beta') or DownloadPsychtoolbox('stable') , depending which flavor of Psychtoolbox you want to use.

==Description of Stable and Beta==
'beta' gives you the equivalent of my past pre-releases: Early access to
bug-fixes, enhancements and new features. Tested and found to be
working properly on our own machines, but not yet sufficiently tested
by real users in real applications.

'stable' consists of former 'beta' releases that have received additional real-
world testing by end-users, so it is considered final code that will be
released in the next upcoming official release.

Obviously, 'stable' releases will have a much longer delay, until
features are added or bugs are fixed -- it's your choice.

As of today, 'beta' contains an improved DrawText function and
experimental support for Quicktime movie playback, as well as
new functions for transformations like scaling, translation
and rotation. MacOS-X 10.3.9 or later + Quicktime-7 is required for
'beta' to work. MacOS-X 10.2 and earlier are not supported anymore.

'stable' is identical to the 1.0.6 release and will stay that
way for a while, until all the new features in beta have received
sufficient testing by real users and more refinements and polishing by us.

What else? You need to perform this procedure only once. After
that, you can simply use the new command 'UpdatePsychtoolbox'
to keep your copy of PTB up to date with the latest changes in the
'beta' or 'stable' release whenever you want.

'''Hoisin''' or '''Hoi Sin''' sauce is a sweet bean sauce made from fermented soy beans. It can be found in most Asian supermarkets. It is one of the most widely known of the sauces, liked for its balance of sweetness, saltiness, garlic and five-spice powder. It is a staple of many Asian cuisines such as Chinese, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese.</text>

This would allow for a nice-looking one-page version. I will do that anyways with the exising modules (of course, I'll wait on the -/- -/- modules), but I'd like to have it in here for future authors --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:20, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Web Link Policy ===

Try to add relevant WEB links to the text in a way that it facilitates the transformation of the book into &lt;code&gt;.TXT&lt;/code&gt; (ASCII) format without the loss of that &quot;relevant&quot; information, also enabling copy-paste operations from the readers.

Proposed: 18 Sept 2005

=== Authors Section ===

Every person making non-trivial changes may add themselves to the [[C++ Programming/Authors|Authors]] section. Please add your full name. You may add zero or one of each: 
* link to your wikimedia page
* link to your web-page
* email address

Proposed: 19 Sept 2005

Humm should, couldn't it  be changed to -may- or -if the author wishes to...- as no one is obliged to do it, as for the information we should limit what is acceptable but not ask for particular info to be added (as for other works for what I understand of the GFDL)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:10, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

changed should to may. As for the info: I did not mean to ask the people for it, but rather to allow them to add that info, but not more. Maybe i need to re-word that? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:25, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

I we are going the way of moving contents to different books (e.g. a whole book on STl, a whole book on boost, etc.) then we should definitely link these from the main page. Otherwiese people will be asking: Where is such-and-such content? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 20:19, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Navigation ===

To support a good navigational scheme, the actual content should be on a page with the name Pagename_Content and included from the actual pagename. This allows including the same content from the one-page version and from a chapter version of this book.

Proposed: 18 Sept 2005

Replaced by:

To support navigation, each page should link to the previous and next page, using the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. A navigational template will follow

Proposed: 21 Sept 2005

:Given this idea I've tried &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the Algorithms book to great effect. The (marginal) nav bar I had no longer shows up in the full text view (and thus I've included I link to it now). I suppose the only reason I missed using it before was because it wasn't an option before. :-) As for generating the &quot;next&quot; and &quot;prevous&quot; arguments for each use of the template it could either be done by hand, or by a bot that reads in the order of the all chapters view. I haven't tried out bots yet, but it could save time and avoid errors. Until then, prev and next could be done manually, unless there's another trick I don't know about. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]]

:One other note: I don't have much time available lately, so if there are any high-level issues, like renaming a locked page, just leave a note on my user page. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]]

=== Navigation ===

Pro:
 
* Chapter-to-chapter naviagtion makes it easier --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Con:

* TOC would have to be maintaned in 3 places --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

* Selecting &quot;edit&quot; on a content does not open the right page (is this true? please verify) --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
*:If you select &quot;edit&quot; on a h2, h3, etc heading you get the right page. That includes if you click on the first h2, which should be the chapter name, effectively giving you the whole page. For the [[Computer Science:Data Structures]] chapters there is also a link at the bottom that says &quot;edit this chapter.&quot; I assume that for most editors they will either make minor modifcations and use the heading edit buttons, or they will contribute a lot and already have the _content pages on their watch lists.

Replaced by: I just found out that MediaWiki supports the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. Put in a page things inside will not show up when the page is included (such as from the all_chapters page). So here's the idea:
* Create a navigational template with forward and back
* have a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;{{:Template|prev chapter name|next chapter name}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; on every page. Either on the top, the bottom or both.

==== Common Programming Errors ====

Comments:

[[user:Paddu|Paddu]] said &quot;&lt;code&gt;It would be nice to point out some common programming errors, pitfalls and the like by highlighting it.&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, proposed to look into [[w:infobox|Infoboxes]]
; NOTE : [[user:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] agreed but proposed a different book ( Programming:Improving programming skills ), didn't start one and doesn't seem to be a &quot;major&quot; contributor to CPP and never replied if she misunderstood the proposal.
:[[user:Paddu|Paddu]] did not advance the idea further.
'''P1 - Last action -&gt; 17 Oct 2004'''
:[[user:Panic2k4|Panic]] implemented a limited reference note on possible errors/styles.
* There are now some limited references on errors/styles so the proposal is dead (will add this to the conventions and remove proposal as adopted, I do think that it can be improved maybe [[user:Paddu|Paddu]] takes on the idea again)

belongs into every book. There should be a template with a nice icon :). Right now the template should just be panics old one, since it worked. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:36, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Hy Dionyziz...

Herr, There is already a C plus plus book (I have forked it to build this one) with another filosofy on its order and content, so a rename/merge isn't workable at least at this time... 
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]]
----
Perhaps calling it &quot;CPP&quot; (as in Programming:CPP) then, since that's technically a correct way to name C++? &quot;C -/- -/-&quot; just seems funny/weird.&amp;hellip; &amp;mdash;[[User:Qrc|qrc]] July 9, 2005 17:41 (UTC)
----
You are free to try to centralize the C++ books with a front page and link and try to merge every work (into a new) structure. (that would/should be done in the future)... 
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:58, 27 July 2005 (UTC)
----
Prehaps you should read the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. The current name is running under [[WB:NP#Historical_conventions]]. So if at all a new name should be somthing like:

* Cpp Programming
* How-To programm in C plus plus
* Programming in C -/- -/-

Otherwise you end up being not a book but only chapter in a very very big [[Programming]] book. 

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 17:57, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

PS: with a good browser/internet connection you can rename about a 100 pages per hour.
----
Grummbll, it's hard to fallow all the policies as they get changed / created all the time (even if you really don't care about it, my main problem is content not reformatting the books every 4 months because some new order of the bookshelf was adopted, that is real annoying, it's the 3rd time I have to pass that ordeal first in C Plus Plus) I will comply with:

 '''The hyphen convention''': &lt;tt&gt;Bookname - Chaptername&lt;/tt&gt;

if no one objects, I'll do the renames as I go along editing stuff (if n1 helps that would be great, but check the dependencies and remember that templates  seem to notice page name changes), as for the name I do like the -/- -/- it's the closes to ++ one can get... the problem is with wikimedia not the name in itself, as for CPP (I really don't like it, not even as a file extension for C++ source files) and C Plus Plus only sounds better because it's the name adopted by Wikipedia... so the best option available seems Programming in C -/- -/-

Since I read the page I've noticed '''The colon convention''' I'll use that on the Index also...
----

Finished ... not 100 pages but it took some time... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:20, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

This page even if it relates to the C plus plus book is only Wikibooks related and should not be in the same namespace of the book, it should be on the talk: --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:14, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
:Really? Could you list that policy? I think you're mistaken. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 08:58, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Hm. I would have liked one page in the main namespace (with the adopted and proposed issues) and one in the talk: namespace with the discussion. I guess we'll have to find the right policy on this one (could you please link it). --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 03:12, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

I think I saw it, I've looked again and couldn't, but ok let's look at it logically.

What is the difference in the normal namespace or root if you prefer and the Talk: ?

If contributing to the Talk: does it make you an author of the book (and benefit from the rights and obligations of the GFDL ?)

Why are pages that only deal with the structure and local framework of a given work included on an that same book?
They can be easily considered off topic, and do not contribute content to the book in itself.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:33, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

:Contributing to the talk does not make you an author, nor would I say would making minor spelling or grammatical fixes make you an author. But that's beside the point. Wikimedia projects are free form, there are no hard and fast rules that claim any page under a given name ''must'' be part of the book. This free form nature gives great freedom to contributors. For example, the whole vote for deletion process on wikipedia is just people editing a file, there's no formal voting buttons or things like that. Life changes too much to encode things in the software like that. But even if there ''were'' a policy like that, the need for a style-guide would be enough evidence that the policy should change. But this is all moot, considering that (1) style guides are entirely appropriate, (2) it does not matter in any sense if they are or are not part of the book, and (3) many other books do this already. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:45, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

I think this discussion belongs into the main wikibooks discussions, until some common policy, ideally for all wikibooks, is reaching.  Just the fact that everyone of us three has a different option on what is meant &quot;unspokenly&quot; means that it'll finally have to be spoken. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 20:32, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Done, please check if I've missed any of the related points--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:24, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

The discussion is in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]
----
First, the Programming namespace should be dropped as it is unnecessary and not a real namespace. We don’t have '''Games:Chess''' or '''Languages:Japanese''' so why '''Programming:C plus plus'''?

Second, the + character is now valid for names and should be used for the title of this book.

----
C++ is a reference to the language object, it's like calling a C++ compiler &quot;C++ &quot; and justify it's name with a similar logic that you are applying to a book name, a variation of the name should be fine, like &quot;Programming C++&quot; or &quot;C++ Programming&quot; a simple addition to the language name would not only clarify immediately that we are not referring to the C++ Language in itself but to something related (an action or a view point) for example;&lt;br&gt;
I'm also contributing to the wikibook &quot;The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)&quot; I could have named it &quot;P2P&quot; or &quot;Peer-to-Peer&quot; but I was limiting the usefulness of the book name, adding something to the subject matter will provide a simple extension to the object/objective of the book and give a reader some more info...&lt;br&gt;
That said, I don't object to the &quot;C++&quot; name but find it to be limited in itself, and can generate some confusion in the reader...
You could check the book covers already submitted for this book for example, the change of the plus for the &quot;+&quot; is a battle I have been having for some time, heck, I have already moved the book 2 or 3 times the last one I was using &quot;-/-&quot; :)... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:14, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

Looks great, I think you can do it with no need for a vote on the subject, just add the link to the new display/order on the top next to the single page version of the book or make a selection/entry point menu to the dif. ways a user can access the content and substitute the &quot;cover&quot; page with it. As of using a single finished &quot;look&quot; as the main entry to the book that is another thing (and will probably be voted on as soon as the book &quot;seems&quot; complete, still, we have to remember that this is an ever evolving framework), every reader is a potential contributor to the book, &quot;hiding&quot; the structure/modules and working pages may do more harm than good, the final objective is to have the GFDL content, the visualization or order can have many implementations as we make the content more modular.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:15, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Humm looks great here the problem could be users with a low resolution have you tried it with the basic 800x600 ?--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:08, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
---- I think it is possible to have a readable version at each resolution perhaps with small modifications. [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 09:47, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
----
An other possibility is '''Programming:C plus plus/V3'''. I prefere this one (still under construction)! [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 08:26, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
----
&lt;center&gt;'''A template for C++ Programming'''&lt;/center&gt;
Hello I propose to use this kind of template '''Programming:C plus plus/V3''' with a link to the text version. I don't know if you like this.

It looks nice but it isn't finished, is it ?
There are some duplication of links and visual information, I can see C++ Programming in 3+ places at the same time with no benefit to a reader (only a bit confusing). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:26, 15 March 2006 (UTC)
----
It is not finish. I will reorganise the plan and correcte the errors. Verify my work please [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 07:32, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
----
Any update on this... if not I will move discussion and update links so future contribution to the design can be made...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:20, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
----
I notice pages still in the old namespace. I've moved them and fixed links accordingly. Everything should now reside under '''C++ Programming/V2''' and '''C++ Programming/V3''' including the templates that were specific to this book and there should be no pages that refer to the old page names. I've also managed to reduce the number of templates needed for '''C++ Programming/V3''' to just one for the header and chapter listing sidebar. I've also requested speedy deletion of all the old pages since none are needed. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 12:19, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
----
Is this dead... ?--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
----
It would appear so. As you know I just fixed them up some. I only did it in case they were being used still. I wouldn't have any objections to them being removed. Merrheim hasn't contributed any changes since March 20th from the looks of things, so I think its safe to say that Merrheim is probably not going to be contributing any more work to them. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 14:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

'''There is a proposal to add a new look for this book :''' see [[C++ Programming/V2|V2]] or this one [[C++ Programming/V3|V3]]

I've removed this from the main page as the statement that this would auto-update is not correct and I don't intend on maintaining more that one TOC, it's sad as some users liked the setup. If no one takes charge of it, I'm moving for a deletion.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:27, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
-----
I don't intend on maintaining it either. I'm game for requesting its deletion if you are. If nobody wants to maintain it there really is no need to keep it. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Lets give it more 7 days if no one speaks up we can proceed with the deletion. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Almost time. There is also a [[Special:Prefixindex/C++_Programming/GUI|GUI]] one that was being worked on, I think by the same person, that seems to have not been mentioned and is in the same boat as V2 and V3. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 18:32, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Ok [[User:Darklama|darklama]] will you do it or do you want me to clear them out (there are a set of templates also), the marking for deletion list will include v2, v3 and GUI frameworks, and will include removing references from other pages. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:20, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
----
I think they are only self referencing so it should only be a matter of marking the templates for deletion to have them all be so. I'm just wondering if we should mark them for speedy deletion due to general agreement or for Votes for Deletion to give people one last chance to offer to maintain it. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
----
Ops, to late, just removed tagged them all for {{tl|delete}}...
Propose a policy to only accept auto maintainable visualizations of the book, or dictate that the maintaining user must be reached within a limited time frame or the view/bookframework will be marked to speedy deletion. Comments.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
----
I don't think its compleatly possible to have auto maintainable visualizations. I think the best we can do is try to limit complexity of different views to ones that are more easly maintained. Such as the two table of contents and print views we got now, but I don't think this is currently going to be a problem since there aren't that many people contributing to this book right now to make this worth having some book convention on. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
----
v2, v3 and GUI have all been deleted along with most of what was left of '''Programming:C plus plus''', '''Programming: C plus plus''', '''Programming:C -/- -/-''' and '''Programming in C plus plus''' after merging in edit histories for pages that had been copy-pasted. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When I render my objects, I'm getting the colors okay, but there is no texture being used.  The preview display shows color and texture, but the view window, and the render window do not show texture.

== Yafray and Yafaray ==

This tutorial is out of date because Ya''fr''ay has been replaced with Ya'''far'''ay (note additional 'a' after the 'f').  Unfortunately whilst Ya'''fr'''ay could be integrated with Blender as an alternative rendering engine, the only way I have found to get Ya'''far'''ay working with Blender 2.48a on Windows Vista was:

1. to download Ya'''far'''ay and the QT libs from the Ya'''far'''ay site,

2. ensuring Python 2.5.2 (and no other version) and MSVC++ 2005 SP1 were installed (as per instructions on Ya'''far'''ay page),

3. load the Ya'''far'''ay render script using the menu: Scripts-&gt;Render-&gt;YafaRay 0.0.3 Export (also installed in the Render menu according to instructions), and clicking on the big render button in the scripts window,

Unfortunately to render with Ya'''far'''ay the scene materials need to be modified using the YafaRay 0.0.3 Export script settings - it will not use Blender materials.  This puts the use of Ya'''far'''ay outside the scope of tutorials at this level.

In short - use the Extra Practice tutorial at the bottom of the page instead.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ITunes 7 diagram.png|center|thumb|700px|This diagram shows the location of the interface elements of iTunes.]]
The best way to start learning a new application is to take a quick look at its interface. This sub-chapter tells you what's what in the iTunes window.

==Toolbar==
Like almost every other Mac program, iTunes has a toolbar right under its title bar. It includes some of the most important controls you'll use.

*'''Playback Controls''' - The three circular buttons on the left-hand side of the toolbar control the playback of music and video files.  Directly to their right is a volume slider for adjusting the sound volume. 

*'''Display''' - iTunes has a pale yellow &quot;display&quot; smack in the middle of the toolbar. This display can show the currently playing song, a level meter, or the status of ongoing tasks such as updating an iPod. To cycle through the availible things to display, click the small right-arrow button on the left side of the display. More information about this display

*'''View Controls''' - These three conjoined buttons let you select a view for your media. You'll learn about views later on.

*'''Search Field''' - This Spotlight search field lets you find your media fast.

==Status Bar==
iTunes has a status bar running along the bottom of its window. In the middle, iTunes puts a bit of text telling you just what you're viewing: how many files, how long it would take to listen or watch them all, and how much space they're taking up on your hard drive. Buttons appear at either end of the status bar. The ones on the left side are always there, and the ones on the right come and go depending on what you're doing. We'll tell you about the buttons here as we go.

==Source list==
The source list is to the left of the screen, right under the playback controls. The source list is divided into several sections that keep the various sources organized. The headings disappear if there are no sources of that type, so you might not see all of them. The following sections are organized to mimic iTunes' organization.

==Library==
Every media file on your computer that iTunes knows abou shows up in the library. Depending on what type of media it is, it will show up in different sources. These include: movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Audiobooks, iPod Games, Radio, and Party Shuffle. You can use the iTunes Preferences (under the &quot;General&quot; tab) to hide sources you aren't using. The libraries for each media type have all of that type of file in them.

==Store==
The icons in this section are all green for easy identification. The first icon is a link to the iTunes Store, just like it says. The second icon is a playlist of all the files purchased from the iTunes Store, though it can be rearranged just like any other playlist. The third icon is the download menu, which appears only if your computer is downloading a file from the the iTunes Store. It can be used to stop, restart, and organize downloads.

==Devices==
This section holds the controls for all of the devices currently hooked up to your computer that iTunes recognizes. This includes iPods, and also [[w:Apple TV|Apple TV]] and [[w:iPhone|iPhone]], two upcoming Apple products. Each device can be managed individually.

==Shared==
Your computer can connect to other computers connect to yours on a wired or wireless network and listen to music from their library. This music is ''streamed'' from their hard drive to yours. It is not permanently stored on your computer. Each shared library appears as a different icon.

==Playlists==
While most of the other sources are generated automatically, Playlists are customizable lists of media that will play sequentially. You can have as many or as few Playlists as you like; iTunes gives you a starter set. You can even put different Playlists into folder trees (folders can be created in the File menu), and these folders transfer to iPods they are synced to.

Smart Playlists are special Playlists that you cannot edit directly. They are similar to the Finder's Smart Folders, in both function and icon. They contain all songs that meet one (or all) of criterion set by you. Smart Playlists can also be based on albums, genre, ratings, play count, or utter randomness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you can organize and listen to your digital music, you'll need to get it into your iTunes library. The steps you  must follow vary depending on where your music is currently stored.

==From Music CDs==
If you're like most people, you've already accumulated a large collection of music on CDs. It would be a real shame if a new way to store music came along, rendering your CDs useless. The next way to store music has arrived...but keep your CDs! iTunes lets you take existing CD collection and copy the songs right to your computer with the push of a button. Follow the two steps below and you'll be up-to-date in no time.

===Step 1: Setting Up===
Before you &quot;import&quot; (copy) your collection into your Mac, you should take a moment to set up. Choose iTunes &gt; Preferences, click the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab (labeled with a gear), and then choose the &quot;Importing&quot; tab underneath.

====Picking an Encoder====
First of all, you must choose which encoder iTunes should use when importing a CD. An encoder is a set of instructions the computer uses to make a certain type of file out of a song on a CD. We recommend that you use the AAC encoder, which generates a kind of music file called... an AAC file! These files take up very little hard drive space, but have impressive sound quality. You may also prefer the more popular but less high-tech MP3 encoder, which generates MP3 files. MP3 files take up more room than similar AAC files, but you'll find that more programs support them.

{{Mac Note Box|You may think of an iPod as an &quot;MP3 Player&quot;... but it can also play all of the other file types listed here.}}

====Picking a Quality Setting====
Next you must set the quality you wish to use to import your music. The AIFF, Apple Lossless, and WAV encoders do not let you choose a quality setting, but the MP3 and AAC encoders discussed above do. It is strongly reccomended that you keep quality at or above the &quot;High Quality&quot; setting. Below this, flaws in the sound quality become apparent even without close inspection.

The &quot;Custom&quot; option is for audiophiles only, and lets you mess with variable bit rate settings, frequency filtering, etc.

===Step 2: Importing the Music===
{{Mac Trick Box|If you're about to go on an importing binge (where you will import '''all''' songs on '''every''' CD you put in your Mac's drive), there's a setting in Importing Preferences that will come in handy. It lets you choose what iTunes does when you put in a CD. The one you want to pick is &quot;Import and Eject&quot;. Now you don't have to worry about any of the instructions in the section below; simply insert a disc, and iTunes will import it and spit it right out!}}

{{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' ''Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet when you import music!'' iTunes will connect to a special website called the Gracenote CD Database, find out all of the information about your CD, and input it automatically. If you aren't connected, songs will have generic names such as &quot;Track 1&quot;, &quot;Track 2&quot;, etc, and you will have to input every title, artist, album, etc. manually.}}

Now that you have your encoder set up to your liking, it's time to do the actual importing. Insert a CD, and it will appear in the &quot;Devices&quot; section of the source list. Select it, and you should see a list of songs. If you see generic &quot;Track 1, Track 2...&quot; names, read the warning above.

You can preview any song simply by double-clicking its title. Check the little boxes next to the songs you wish to import, and make sure the songs you ''don't'' want to import ''aren't'' checked. Now press the button labeled &quot;import&quot; in the lower-righthand corner and iTunes will go through and copy the songs to your computer. This might take a few minutes.

When all the songs you picked are done importing, your CD has been successfully imported! The songs are now in your library. Please refer to the next chapter to find out what to do next!

==From your Hard Drive==
If you already have digital music files lying around your hard drive, you can add them to iTunes very easily. Simply select &quot;Music&quot;  in the Library section of the Source List. Then drag and drop files into the contents pane. Done! The file is now in your library. Note that you ''will'' have to enter the information for the file manually, because the Gracenote CD Database, as the name implies, works only for CDs.

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' You can learn how to name groups of items quickly at [[../iTunes Tricks/]].}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organizing your Media==
iTunes was the first application to introduce Apple's famous &quot;Library/Collections&quot; method for organizing items. All music you add to iTunes is stored in a central storage area called your &quot;Library&quot;. You can then create lists of music called playlists, which include only ''links'' to songs that live in your library.

===Playlists===
To create a new blank playlist, press the + button below the sidebar.

===Smart Playlists===

==Folders==
Folders are a convenient way of keeping playlists organized. They also act like playlists themselves, becoming a sort of playlist of playlists. Selecting a folder in the sidebar will display every song in every playlist contained within it in the contents pane. With a little imagination this can prove to be a powerful feature.

You probably know that the iPod is Apple's uber-Popular portable digital music player. These days, you can spot the signature white earbuds everywhere you go, and you've probably know that the latest models can play movies and photos in addition to music. But can you handle using an iPod, or should you let the technically inclined have all the fun? One of the reasons the iPod is so succesful is that it's very easy to use. If you ever feel uncertain, just use this chapter.

==Determining your iPod's model==
There are six different models of Apple's flagship iPod. While their branding refers to them all simply as &quot;iPod&quot;, Apple's support team refers to them by most important new trait in each new model:

*iPod with Scroll Wheel - This iPod's wheel actually moves under your finger. It is white.
*iPod with Touch Wheel - This iPod's wheel is white and touch sensitive, but its buttons are not. It is white.
*iPod with Dock Connector - This iPod has four touch-sensitive buttons lined up above the wheel. It is white.
*iPod with Click Wheel - This iPod has its buttons ''inside'' the wheel, which is grey. It has a black and white screen. It is white (except U2 edition, see below).
*iPod with Color Display - This iPod is identical to the iPod with Click Wheel, but has a color screen. It is white (except U2 edition, see below)
*iPod with Video Playback (current) - This iPod supports video playback, and has a large color screen. It comes in black or white (plus U2 edition, see below),

{{Mac Note Box|The iPod with Video Playback, iPod with Click Wheel, and iPod with Color Display have all had special &quot;iPod U2 Special Edition&quot; models produced. These special iPods are black with a red wheel, and have the signatures of U2's members on the back, but are otherwise identical to their standard counterparts. The iPod with Video Playback also comes in black with a black wheel, but this is a standard color, and not a U2 iPod. Also note that the iPod with Color Display was at one point sold as the &quot;iPod photo&quot;.}}

In addition, Apple has produced three spin-off iPods:

*iPod mini - This iPod is made of silver, blue, pink, green, or gold-colored aluminum. It has a black-and white screen.
*iPod shuffle (current) - This iPod does not have a screen.
**First Generation - White, and about the size of a stick of gum.
**Second Generation (current) - Made of silver, blue, pink, green, or orange-colored aluminum. It has a built-in clip.
*iPod nano (current) - This iPod is as thin as a pencil and has a color screen.
**First Generation - White or black front with a mirror-like back.
**Second Generation (current) - Made of silver, blue, pink, green, or black-colored aluminum.

It is important to know your iPod's model when setting it up or using it with iTunes.

==iPods with a Screen==
The iPods With A Screen Are The iPod, iPod Video And The iPod Nano
The Very First iPod Was Released In 2003
You NEED A Computer To Use An iPod
(if you have an ipod but no software you can download iTunes Now At http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/

The 30g iPod Video Holds 7,500 Songs &amp; 40 Videos , 
The 80g iPod Video Holds 15,500 Songs &amp; 60 Videos ,
The 1g iPod Nano Holds 100 Songs &amp; 1 12min Video and
The 2g iPod Nano Hols 180 Songs &amp; 2 12min Videos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==
I suggest renaming like this:
* [[Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD)]] -&gt; &quot;Microsoft Certified Professional Developer&quot;
* [[Exam 70-536]] -&gt; &quot;Microsoft Certified Professional Developer/Exam 70-536&quot;
* [[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist/Exam 70-536/Value types]] -&gt; &quot;Microsoft Certified Professional Developer/Exam 70-536/Value types&quot;

See '''[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]'''. The problem with [[Exam 70-536]] is that the module name does not start with the name of its book. Modules like [[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist/Exam 70-536/Value types]] have a different problem: now the module starts with the name of a nonexistant book, &quot;Study Guides&quot;, further it mixes colons with backslashes.

Using '''forward slashes''' like/these/will allow easier linking, for example you will be able to write &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Value types/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the Exam 70-536 page to link to the Value types page, if the names are as I suggested above.

I think that the &quot;(MCPD)&quot; is redundant, so my suggestions removed it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

The instructions for renaming pages are at '''[[Help:Pages#Moving]]'''. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:48, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

Changes the links because the renaming were done --[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]] ([[User talk:Jacques Bergeron|talk]]) 20:23, 6 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Language compilers are adept at pointing out most of the erroneous code in a program, however there are some errors that only become apparent when the program is executed. Consider the [[#code-listing-1|code listing 6.1]]; here, the program defines a method '''divide''' that does a simple division operation taking two integers as parameter arguments and returning the result of their division. It can safely be assumed that when the '''divide(4, 2)''' statement is called, it would return the number '''2'''. However, consider the next statement, where the program relies upon the provided command line arguments to generate a division operation. What if the user provides the number zero ('''0''') as the second argument? We all know that division  by zero is impossible, but the compiler couldn't possibly have anticipated the user providing zero as an argument.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 6.1: SimpleDivisionOperation.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
public class SimpleDivisionOperation {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(divide(4, 2));
    if (args.length &gt; 1) {
      int arg0 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
      int arg1 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
      System.out.println(divide(arg0, arg1));
    }
  }

  public static int divide(int a, int b) {
    return a / b;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code listing 6.1'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:black; color:white;&quot;&gt;
$ java SimpleDivisionOperation 1 0
2
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
     at SimpleDivisionOperation.divide(SimpleDivisionOperation.java:12)
     at SimpleDivisionOperation.main(SimpleDivisionOperation.java:7)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Such ''exceptional code'' that results in erroneous interpretations at program runtime usually results in errors that are called ''exceptions'' in Java. When the Java interpreter encounters an exceptional code, it halts execution and displays information about the error that occurs. This information is known as a ''stack trace''. The [[Java Programming/Stack trace|stack trace]] in the above example tells us more about the error, such as the thread &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; where the exception occurred, the type of exception &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt;, a comprehensible display message &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;/ by zero&lt;/code&gt;, and the exact methods and the line numbers where the exception may have occurred.

==Exception object==
The preceding exception could have been created explicitly by the developer as it is the case in the following code:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-2&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 6.2: SimpleDivisionOperation.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
public class SimpleDivisionOperation {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(divide(4, 2));
    if (args.length &gt; 1) {
      // Convert a string to an integer
      int arg0 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
      int arg1 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
      System.out.println(divide(arg0, arg1));
    }
  }

  public static int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
      throw new ArithmeticException(&quot;You can\'t divide by zero!&quot;);       
    } else {
      return a / b;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code listing 6.2'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:black; color:white;&quot;&gt;
$ java SimpleDivisionOperation 1 0
2
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArithmeticException: You can't divide by zero!
at SimpleDivisionOperation.divide(SimpleDivisionOperation.java:14)
at SimpleDivisionOperation.main(SimpleDivisionOperation.java:7)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Note that when &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; equals zero, there is no return value. Instead of a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArithmeticException&lt;/code&gt; generated by the Java interpreter itself, it is an exception created by the coder. The result is the same. It shows you that an exception is an object. Its main particularity is that it can be thrown. An exception object must inherit from &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/code&gt;. Standard exceptions have two constructors:
# The default constructor; and,
# A constructor taking a string argument so that you can place pertinent information in the exception.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-1&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.1: Instance of an exception object with the default constructor.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
new Exception();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-2&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.2: Instance of an &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; object by passing string in constructor.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
new Exception(&quot;Something unexpected happened&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
This string can later be extracted using various methods, as you can see in the [[#code-listing-2|code listing 6.2]].

You can throw any type of '''Throwable''' object using the keyword {{Java:throw}}. It interrupts the method. Anything after the '''throw''' statement would not be executed, unless the ''thrown'' exception is [[#Exception handlers|handled]]. The exception object is not ''returned'' from the method, it is ''thrown'' from the method. That means that the exception object is not the return value of the method and the calling method can be interrupted too and so on and so on...

Typically, you'll throw a different class of exception for each different type of error. The information about the error is represented both inside the exception object and implicitly in the name of the exception class, so someone in the bigger context can figure out what to do with your exception. Often, the only information is the type of exception, and nothing meaningful is stored within the exception object.

The box 6.1 below talks about the various exception classes within the &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt; package.

'''Box 6.1: The Java exception classes'''

; Throwable : The Throwable class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this class (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or can be thrown by the Java throw statement.
: A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message string that gives more information about the error. Finally, it can contain a cause: another throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown. The cause facility was added in release 1.4. It is also known as the chained exception facility, as the cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a &quot;chain&quot; of exceptions, each caused by another.
; Error : An Error indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to handle. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
; Exception : The class Exception and its subclasses are a form of Throwable that indicates conditions that a reasonable application might want to handle. Also this is the class that a programmer may want to extend when adding business logic exceptions.
; RuntimeException : RuntimeException is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine. A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of RuntimeException that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught.

== &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement ==
By default, when an exception is thrown, the current method is interrupted, the calling method is interrupted too and so on till the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method. A thrown exception can also be caught using a
&lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement. Below is how a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement works:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-3&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.3: Division into a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5-6, 10&quot;&gt;
int a = 4;
int b = 2;
int result = 0;
try {
  int c = a / b;
  result = c;
} catch(ArithmeticException ex) {
  result = 0;
}
return result;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The executed code lines have been highlighted. When no exception is thrown, the method flow executes the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; statement and not the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-4&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.4: Catching 'division by zero' errors.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5, 8, 10&quot;&gt;
int a = 4;
int b = 0;
int result = 0;
try {
  int c = a / b;
  result = c;
} catch(ArithmeticException ex) {
  result = 0;
}
return result;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

As there is a thrown exception at line 5, the line 6 is not executed, but the exception is caught by the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement so the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block is executed. The following code is also executed. Note that the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement takes an exception as parameter. There is a third case: when the exception is not from the same class as the parameter:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-5&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.5: Uncaught exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5&quot;&gt;
int a = 4;
int b = 0;
int result = 0;
try {
  int c = a / b;
  result = c;
} catch(NullPointerException ex) {
  result = 0;
}
return result;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It is as if there is no &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement. The exception is thrown to the calling method.

== &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks ==
A &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; statement can contain several &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks, to handle different exceptions in different ways. Each &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block must take a parameter of a different throwable class. A thrown object may match several &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block but only the first &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block that matches the object will be executed. A catch-block will catch a thrown exception if and only if:
* the thrown exception object is the same as the exception object specified by the catch-block.
* the thrown exception object is the subtype of the exception object specified by the catch-block.
This means that the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block order is important. As a consequence, you can't put a &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block that catches all the exception (which take a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Exception&lt;/code&gt; as parameter) before a &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block that catches a more specific exception as the second block could never be executed.

|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-6&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.6: Exception handling with catch blocks.'''&lt;/span&gt;

    + &quot; or IndexOutOfBoundsException.&quot;);
} catch(Exception ex) {
  System.out.println(&quot;Exception handling code for any other Exception.&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}
At line 14, we use a '''multi-catch''' clause. It is available since the JDK 7. This is a combination of several '''catch''' clauses and let's you handle exceptions in a single handler while also maintaining their types. So, instead of being boxed into a parent Exception super-class, they retain their individual types.

You can also use the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Throwable&lt;/code&gt; class here, since '''Throwable''' is the parent class for the ''application-specific'' '''Exception''' classes. However, this is discouraged in Java programming circles. This is because '''Throwable''' happens to also be the parent class for the ''non-application specific'' '''Error''' classes which are not meant to be handled explicitly as they are catered for by the JVM itself.

== &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block ==

A {{Java:finally}} block can be added after the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks. A &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block is always executed, even when no exception is thrown, an exception is thrown and caught, or an exception is thrown and not caught. It's a place to put code that should always be executed after an unsafe operation like a file close or a database disconnection. You can define a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block without &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block, however, in this case, it must be followed by a &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block.

== Example of handling exceptions==
Let's examine the following code:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-7&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.7: Handling exceptions.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;10, 11&quot;&gt;
public void methodA() throws SomeException {
    // Method body
}

public void methodB() throws CustomException, AnotherException {
    // Method body
}

public void methodC() {
    methodB();
    methodA();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-section-7|code section 6.7]], &lt;code&gt;methodC&lt;/code&gt; is invalid.  Because &lt;code&gt;methodA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;methodB&lt;/code&gt; pass (or throw) exceptions, &lt;code&gt;methodC&lt;/code&gt; must be prepared to handle them.  This can be handled in two ways: a {{java:try}}-{{java:catch}} block, which will handle the exception within the method and a {{java:throws}} clause which would in turn throw the exception to the caller to handle.  The above example will cause a compilation error, as Java is very strict about exception handling. So the programmer is forced to handle any possible error condition at some point.

A method can do two things with an exception: ask the calling method to handle it by the {{java:throws}} declaration or handle the exception inside the method by the {{java:try}}-{{java:catch}} block.

To work correctly, the original code can be modified in multiple ways.  For example, the following:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-8&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.8: Catching and throwing exceptions.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 2, 4-6&quot;&gt;
public void methodC() throws CustomException, SomeException {
  try {
    methodB();
  } catch(AnotherException e) {
    // Handle caught exceptions.
  }
  methodA();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
 
The &lt;code&gt;AnotherException&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;methodB&lt;/code&gt; will be handled locally, while &lt;code&gt;CustomException&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SomeException&lt;/code&gt; will be thrown to the caller to handle it. Most of the developers are embarrassed when they have to choose between the two options. This type of decision should not be taken at development time. If you are a development team, it should be discussed between all the developers in order to have a common exception handling policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Random PHP Code at Bottom of Page==
There was a random non-formatted line of PHP at the bottom of the page within the more info section. I deleted it. 



== Using AND and OR in examples ==

In my years of doing PHP programming, I have not seen anyone using the long forms 'and' and 'or'; rather, developers seem to prefer using &amp;&amp; and || (I know I do).  I think the short forms should be substituted, though both work.  Thoughts? --[[User:Spoom|Spoom]] 04:23, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

== Discussion on logic ==
Does this belong here or elsewhere? I don't think a discussion on logic pertains only to if statements; it's more of a discussion on boolean logic, which also relates to whiles, do whiles, and the boolean type. [[User:63.194.85.39|63.194.85.39]] 02:45, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

== Printing alphabet example ==
I removed the following example, since it demonstrates an example of how to use while(), not if(). [[User:217.211.181.209|217.211.181.209]] 22:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

 printing  alphabet in php
 
 Example
 
  &lt;?php
  function alphabet()
  {
   $count=0;
     while($count&lt;=26)
       {
         print(chr(ord('A')+$count);
         $count++;
       }
   }
  alphabet();

You're welcome to add one or more section on caster wheels. I'm not sure what you mean with being too specific. IMO the page covers only the concepts and doesn't contain much detail at all. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 19:40, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Naming Ions and Ionic Compounds */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GeneralChemTOC}}
== Naming Ions and Ionic Compounds==
&lt;br&gt;Ionic compounds consist of cations (positive ions) and anions (negative ions).
&lt;br&gt;The nomenclature, or naming, of ionic compounds is based on the names of the component ions. &lt;br&gt;Here are the principal naming conventions for ionic compounds, along with examples to show how they are used: 

&lt;br&gt;'''Roman Numerals'''
&lt;br&gt;A Roman numeral in parentheses, followed by the name of the element, is used for elements that can form more than one positive ion.

This is usually seen with metals.
&lt;br&gt;Fe 2+ Iron (II)
&lt;br&gt;Fe 3+ Iron (III)
&lt;br&gt;Cu + Copper (I)
&lt;br&gt;Cu 2+ Copper (II)

&lt;br&gt;'''-ous and -ic'''
&lt;br&gt;Although Roman numerals are used to denote the ionic charge of cations, it is still common to see and use the endings -ous or -ic. These endings are added to the Latin name of the element (e.g., stannous/stannic for tin) to represent the ions with lesser or greater charge, respectively.&lt;br&gt;The Roman numeral naming convention has wider appeal because many ions have more than two valences.
&lt;br&gt;Fe 2+ Ferrous
&lt;br&gt;Fe 3+ Ferric
&lt;br&gt;Cu + Cuprous
&lt;br&gt;Cu 2+ Cupric

&lt;br&gt;'''-ide'''
&lt;br&gt;The -ide ending is added to the name of a monoatomic anion of an element.
&lt;br&gt;H - Hydride
&lt;br&gt;F - Fluoride
&lt;br&gt;O 2- Oxide
&lt;br&gt;S 2- Sulphide
&lt;br&gt;N 3- Nitride
&lt;br&gt;P 3- Phosphide

&lt;br&gt;'''-ite and -ate'''
&lt;br&gt;Some polyatomic anions contain oxygen. These anions are called oxyanions. When an element forms two oxyanions, the one with less oxygen is given a name ending in -ite and the one with more oxgyen is given a name that ends in -ate.
&lt;br&gt;NO2 - Nitrite
&lt;br&gt;NO3 - Nitrate
&lt;br&gt;SO3 2- Sulphite
&lt;br&gt;SO4 2- Sulphate

&lt;br&gt;'''hypo- and per-'''
&lt;br&gt;In the case where there is a series of four oxyanions, the hypo- and per- prefixes are used in conjunction with the -ite and -ate suffixes. The hypo- and per- prefixes indicate less oxygen and more oxygen, respectively.
&lt;br&gt;ClO - Hypochlorite
&lt;br&gt;ClO2 - Chlorite
&lt;br&gt;ClO3 - Chlorate
&lt;br&gt;ClO4 - Perchlorate

&lt;br&gt;'''bi- and di- hydrogen'''
&lt;br&gt;Polyatomic anions sometimes gain one or more H+ ions to form anions of a lower charge. These ions are named by adding the word hydrogen or dihydrogen in front of the name of the anion. It is still common to see and use the older naming convention in which the prefix bi- is used to indicate the addition of a single hydrogen ion.
&lt;br&gt;HCO3 - Hydrogen carbonate or bicarbonate
&lt;br&gt;HSO4 - Hydrogen sulfate or bisulfate
&lt;br&gt;H2PO4 - Dihydrogen phosphate

== Naming Binary Acids ==
Binary acids are compounds containing Hydrogen and an anion (non-metal ion). 
&lt;p&gt;When these compounds are in solution in water, oxonium ions (H3O+) are formed giving rise to the properties that we associate with 'acids'.
&lt;p&gt;In general, when the binary acid is not in solution the name is as follows:
'Hydrogen' followed by the anion name ending in '-ide'.
&lt;p&gt;e.g. Hydrogen chloride

&lt;p&gt;When the binary acid is in solution (aq) the name is as follows:
'Hydro-' followed by the anion name ending in '-ic' then add the word 'acid' to the end.
&lt;p&gt;e.g. Hydrochloric acid

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
An '''array''' is similar to a table of objects or primitive types, keyed by index. You may have noticed the strange parameter of the default &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method (&lt;code&gt;String[] args&lt;/code&gt;) since the beginning of the book. It is an array. Let's handle this parameter:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-15&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.15: The default array parameter.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
public class ArrayExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; ++i) {
      System.out.println(&quot;Argument #&quot; + (i + 1) + &quot;: &quot; + args[i]);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Console for Code listing 3.15'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java ArrayExample This is a test
Argument #1 This
Argument #2 is
Argument #3 a
Argument #4 test
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

In the [[#code-listing-15|code listing 3.15]], the array is &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;. It is an array of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; objects (here those objects are the words that have been typed by the user at the program launching). At line 4, One contained object is accessed using its index in the array. You can see that its value is printed on the standard output. Note that the strings have been put in the array with the right order.

== Fundamentals ==

In Java, an array is an object. This object has a given type for the contained primitive types or objects (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, ...). An array can be declared in several ways:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-52&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.52: Array declarations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int[] array1 = null;
int array2[] = null;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Those syntaxes are identical but the first one is recommended. It can also be instantiated in several ways:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-53&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.53: Array instantiations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
array1 = new int[10];
array1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
At line 1, we instantiate an array of 10 items with non-initialized items. At line 2, we instantiate an array of 10 given items. It will each be given an index according to its order. We can know the size of the array using the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; attribute:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-54&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.54: The array size.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
int nbItems = 10;
Object[] array3 = new Object[nbItems];
System.out.println(array3.length);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for Code section 3.54'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
10
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Arrays are allocated at runtime, so the specified size in an array creation expression may be a variable (rather than a constant expression as in C). However, the size of an instantiated array never changes. If you need to change the size, you have to create a new instance. Items can be accessed by their index. Beware! The first index is 0:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-55&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.55: The array indexes.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-4&quot;&gt;
char[] array4 = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
System.out.println(array4[2]);
array4[4] = 'z';
System.out.println(array4[4]);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Output for Code section 3.55'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
c
z
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

If you attempt to access to a too high index or negative index, you will get an &lt;code&gt;ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Question 3.20''': Consider the following code:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-20&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.20: Question20.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class Question20 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[] listOfWord = {&quot;beggars&quot;, &quot;can't&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;choosers&quot;};
    System.out.println(listOfWord[1]);
    System.out.println(listOfWord[listOfWord.length-1]);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

What will be printed in the standard output?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XCode|1='''Output for Question 3.20'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
can't
choosers
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
Indexes start at 0. So the index 1 point at the second string (&lt;code&gt;can't&lt;/code&gt;). There are 4 items so the size of the array is 4. Hence the item pointed by the index 3 is the last one (&lt;code&gt;choosers&lt;/code&gt;).

==Two-Dimensional Arrays==
Actually, there are no two-dimensional arrays in Java. However, an array can contain any class of object, including an array:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-56&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.56: Two-dimensional arrays.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[][] twoDimArray = {{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;},
                          {&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;},
                          {&quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;o&quot;}};

int[][] twoDimIntArray = {{ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4},
                          {10, 11, 12, 13, 14},
                          {20, 21, 22, 23, 24}};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
It's not exactly equivalent to two-dimensional arrays because the size of the sub-arrays may vary. The sub-array reference can even be null. Consider:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-57&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.57: Weird two-dimensional array.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[][] weirdTwoDimArray = {{&quot;10&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;},
                               null,
                               {&quot;20&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;24&quot;}};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Note that the length of a two-dimensional array is the number of one-dimensional arrays it contains. In the above example, &lt;code&gt;weirdTwoDimArray.length&lt;/code&gt; is 3, whereas &lt;code&gt;weirdTwoDimArray[2].length&lt;/code&gt; is 5.

In the [[#code-section-58|code section 3.58]], we defined an array that has three elements, each element contains an array having 5 elements. We could create the array having the 5 elements first and use that one in the initialize block.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-58&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.58: Included array.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[] oneDimArray = {&quot;00&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;02&quot;, &quot;03&quot;, &quot;04&quot;};
String[][] twoDimArray = {oneDimArray,
                          {&quot;10&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, &quot;14&quot;},
                          {&quot;20&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;24&quot;}};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

'''Question 3.21''': Consider the following code:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[][] alphabet = {{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;},
                          {&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;},
                          {&quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;o&quot;},
                          {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;},
                          {&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;},
                          {&quot;z&quot;}};

      <text xml:space="preserve">if you push a muscle past its limit, it breaks.  Typically during a workout, a person keeps the muscle within its limits, possibly only pushing it to its limit, where it would fail.  It would then not be possible to push the muscle any more.  It is possible to push a muscle past its limit.  This occurs when an ankle is sprained, or any other muscle is pulled.[[User:CatastrophicToad|CatastrophicToad]] 23:11, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

&lt;h1&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/h1&gt;
::''For so greatly did God love the world that He gave His only born Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not be subject to death but have eternal Life''.

==Life==
'''Jesus Christ''', the founder of Christianity and prophet of Islam, was born in Bethlehem, Judea, according to the generally accepted chronology in the year of Rome 750, that is, 4 BC. This apparent discrepancy in date is due to an error that was made when the Christian calendar originated with Dionysius in 556 AD. He fixed upon the year of Rome 754 as that in which Christ was born. Later information proved beyond a doubt that this date should have been 750, which gives the birth of Christ four years before the beginning of the Christian era according to the calendar of Dionysius. The mother of Jesus was Mary, who was probably a descendant of David. Her husband, Joseph, was also a descendant of the same family. The birth of the holy child occurred in a manger at a public inn in Bethlehem, where Joseph had gone to be registered in his place of origin in accordance with the Roman census and Jewish law relating to taxation. The miraculous conditions connected with his birth to the Virgin Mary prove to the satisfaction of most followers of Christianity that Jesus was of divine origin. His parents remained at Bethlehem for some time. The infant Savior was circumcised on the eighth day, and at the end of the fortieth day he was presented in the Temple, and his mother, according to the Jewish law, made the customary offers for her purification. Soon after this he was visited by wise men, or Magi, from the East, who claimed to have been guided to the spot where he was by the miraculous appearance of a star. Inquiries of these men as to where the child who was to be king of the Jews was born, led Herod (at that time ruler of Judea under Rome) to cause all the male children in Bethlehem under three years of age to be put to death. Joseph, however, was warned by an angel, and he fled with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, where he remained an uncertain length of time, until after Herod's death, when the holy family returned and took up their residence at Nazareth. There, Jesus lived and grew to maturity, and because of that connection he is frequently called the Nazarene.

Of the boyhood and youth of Jesus almost nothing is known. The only authentic account given is that of his appearance in the Temple when twelve years of age (Luke 2: 46-50). All legends concerning his life previous to his public ministry are without foundation, but it is probable that he remained with the family at Nazareth and engaged in the same work as his father, who was a carpenter. The public ministry of Jesus was preceded by the preaching of John the Baptist, his cousin, who proclaimed the coming of the kingdom of God and called men to repentance. Jesus was pointed out by John as the Son of God, and two of John's disciples from that time became his followers. He was baptized by John, when his divine nature was manifested by the miraculous appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove and by a voice from heaven saying, &quot;This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot; After the initial meeting, his new followers declared Jesus, the Christ, or the expected Jewish Messiah. Following the baptism, Jesus retired into the wilderness of Judea, where he was subjected to various temptations. His first public appearance was at the marriage in Cana of Galilee, where he performed the miracle of turning water into wine. He then visited Capernaum, affirmed the apostles Andrew, Peter, James and John nearby and later appeared in Jerusalem at the time of the Passover to reveal his majesty and power by cleansing the Temple of those who were changing money and selling animals for sacrifice. He received an inquisitive teacher of Israel at night by the name of Nicodemus and pointed out the way to everlasting life. His works and teachings immediately aroused the opposition of the leaders of the Jews because the news was spreading over Judea that Jesus' disciples were baptizing even more new adherents than John the Baptist and, finding that this work in Judea was to be rejected, he departed into Galilee. During the remainder of the first year of his ministry he preached at Nazareth, where his own townspeople attempted to cast him over a precipice because of his teachings; then at Capernaum again. After the calling of his disciples he began his first circuit through Galilee. During this time occurred the Sermon on the Mount; also the Sermon in the Boat, which was followed by the miraculous draught of fishes. Near the close of this year he called Levi, or Matthew, who became one of his most devoted followers.

The second year's ministry began with the attendance upon the Passover at Jerusalem and the healing of the lame man at the Pool of Bethesda. Following this were several other miracles, followed by discussions with the Pharisees and other leaders of the Jews, in which Jesus continued (Matthew 9: 12-13) to set forth his gospel, or good news, calling for repentance and the forgiveness of sins, and showed clearly the difference between this new dispensation and the underlying principles of the Jewish law and the ceremonials largely practiced at that time. This increased the already growing opposition and was followed by the sending out of the twelve disciples to promulgate his teaching concerning entry into the kingdom of heaven. After the visit to Jerusalem, Jesus began his second general circuit through Galilee. This circuit was characterized by the performing of a number of miracles and the relating of some of the most important parables in the Gospels, among them those of the sower, of the tares, of the mustard seed, of the leaven and of the hid treasure. This was followed by the third general circuit, during which occurred the death of John the Baptist, the feeding of the five thousand and the walking on water.
[[Image:Upper_room.jpg|right|350px|thumb|&lt;span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Upper room in first century Palestine&lt;/span&gt;]]
The third and last year of Jesus' ministry was by far the most important with many discourses, parables, and miracles recorded, the year which saw the Transfiguration, curing of an epileptic boy, his appearance at the Feast of Tabernacles, sending out the seventy to prepare the way with all power over demons and disease, his calling the fallen Prince of this world to account, and the raising of Lazarus which so aroused the envy of the Jews that they resolved upon putting him to death, while just before the events of the last week leading up to the crucifixion, generally known as the Passion Week, he stopped everything to welcome the little children into his presence, for such is the kingdom of God. After which he warned about the dangers of the accumulation of wealth, and then gave a prediction of his own death and resurrection for the third time. As his passion drew near, Jesus prepared to eat the last Passover with his disciples. On the first day of the week, which is still remembered as Palm Sunday, he made his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem as the long awaited but unique Son of David. During the next two days he spent his time in and around the city, cursing a barren fig-tree, cleansing the Temple, predicting the destruction of Jerusalem and the nation, sealing the judgment to come with separation of the sheep from the goats and delivering discourses in which he used a number of parables, in particular, those conveyed in private to his disciples to answer the ultimate questions concerning his mission. These things accomplished, he retired to Bethany. On Wednesday he gave a warning of the betrayal by one of his own, and on the following day in a specially prepared upper room in the holy city he ate the last Passover with his disciples assuring them that after his departure he would come again to usher in his kingdom and during the discourse proclaimed the wine and the bread a lasting remembrance of the new covenant established that evening, additionally, a new commandment was directed to his disciples: that you love one another as I have loved you, for greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. After the Passover meal, having been betrayed by Judas, he was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, brought before the high priest Caiaphas, condemned by the Jewish Sanhedrin for claims of divinity (Mark 14: 62) and early on Friday morning sent before Pilate, the Roman governor of Jerusalem, in order that the sentence of death might be legally confirmed, which led to the requisite punishment of flagellation and further humiliation. By Pilate he was released to the Jews, by whose compliance he was crucified on that day. Late in the afternoon, Jesus cried out, “It is finished,” and yielded up the spirit. The Sabbath approached demanding his body be taken down from the cross and prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. The tomb was one belonging to this same Joseph, a member of the Sanhedrin, a man of considerable means, and there the body of Jesus was buried that same day in a garden close to Golgotha, the place of the skull, the site of the crucifixion.

==Resurrection==
On the morning of the first day of the week, or the third day after his death, Mary Magdalene and other women in charge of the spices hastened to the tomb in order to complete the work of embalming the body, but they found the stone rolled away from the door of the tomb and the place where Jesus had lain occupied by an angel, who told them that Jesus had risen. After his resurrection on that Sunday which would later be celebrated as Easter Sunday, Jesus remained on earth for forty days, during which time he appeared eleven times to his disciples and followers, the instance (John 20: 27-28) of a doubting Thomas tempered all unbelief. Jesus commissioned his disciples to continue his earthly ministry and at the last gathering on the Mount of Olives he ascended into heaven and was received by a cloud out of their sight. The disciples stood there  awe-strucken with eyes skyward after the ascension, even as, heavenly messengers in attendance (Acts 1: 11) announce his return would be in like manner, evidently, at the end of the age. They returned to the upper room in Jerusalem as instructed and devoted themselves to worship and fellowship together in the common calling while planning for the future, with earnest [[../Prayer|prayer]], blessing God continually. Their numbers increased to 120 believers as they awaited the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, or Advocate, as promised by the risen Savior. 

Various attempts have been made to explain away the resurrection of Christ. There is the supposition, (1) of fraud; that, according to the statement of the Jews, the disciples stole the body and then published the story that their Lord was risen; (2) that Jesus had not really died on the cross; that His apparent death was only a swoon, from which He afterward recovered; (3) that there had been no real resurrection, but that the disciples had been deceived by visionary appearances or hallucinations; (4) that the assertion of the resurrection was originally allegorical. In Acts, chapter 5, the words of one of the most learned Jews of the time, Gamaliel, are more to the point, “put forth [the apostles] a little space... for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught: but if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it.” Thus, with regard to the significance of Christ's resurrection, to Christians it is the crowning event, evidence of the divine character of His mission and His atonement for the sins of the world.


===Christianity===
The great commandment according to the gospel was love the Lord your God with all your heart and the second, similar to it, love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus reinforced his teaching by miracles and by parables. His miracles were evidently for the purpose of convincing the people of his divine origin and power. They were thirty-five in number and ranged in importance from the turning of water into wine to the raising of the dead to life. Most of them were connected with the healing of disease and a majority of those contained a demonstration of the petitioner's faith, and with few exceptions all of them were for the welfare of those upon whom or in whose favor they were wrought. The parables, forceful maxims of a metaphorical nature such as the Pearl of Great Price, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan, were thirty-three in number and contain the best illustrations of moral and religious truth to be found anywhere in literature. So broad is their application that the truths which they teach are accepted by the non-Christian as well as by the Christian world.

&lt;big&gt; '''Athuga''' &lt;/big&gt;
** When talking to or about someone, gender is an important part of Icelandic conversation and speech. For example, when greeting a man, you must say '''Komdu sæll, blessaður''' or '''sæll'''. To a woman, you would say '''Komdu sæl, blessuð,''' or '''sæl'''
** If the situation is informal, you can just say '''Hæ''' or '''Bæ''' regardless of gender
** When there is a group of people of mixed gender, you could say '''Komið þið sæl og blessuð'''
** When you want to welcome someone, you also must take into account the gender of the listener. If you are welcoming a man, you say '''Velkominn''', if a woman, you say '''Velkomin'''. If you are welcoming a group of people, you also would say '''Velkomin'''
** Although '''Allt í lagi''' means ''okay'' (Ok!), you will of course also hear '''ókei''', said the same as the English ''okay''
** As you may have noticed, '''Góða daginn''' (or '''Góðan dag''') means both ''good morning'' and ''good afternoon''. Icelanders use this greeting from the early morning hours (after midnight) until slightly before dinner time. In Iceland, since there is sunlight almost 24 hours in the summer months and about 4 hours in the winter months, using these greetings based on how it looks outside is not a good reference
** Remember that the letter &lt;big&gt;Æ&lt;/big&gt; is pronounced like the English ''i'' in ''m'''i'''ne''. Refer back to the '''[[Icelandic/Alphabet and Pronunciation|Alphabet and Pronunciation]]''' page if you are struggling with reading words in Icelandic. The phonetic pronunciation will go away after this lesson, since Icelandic words are pronounced as they are read. Therefore, it is essential that by the end of this lesson, you are comfortable with the Icelandic alphabet and how it is pronounced

== Málfræði (Grammar) ==

=== Nafnorð (Nouns) ===
A noun is a person, place, or thing. It has the same function in Icelandic. Nouns in Icelandic, unlike English, are reflected by their case, gender, and number. There are 4 grammatical cases in Icelandic (Nominative, Accusative, Dative, and Genitive) which we will talk about individually.

==== Kyn (Gender) ====
This might seem odd for an English speaker, a word in a language having gender? There are many languages that do indeed give their nouns gender. In Icelandic, we have three genders, masculine, feminine, and neutral nouns. When learning new vocabulary, it is important that you establish its gender whilst you memorise it. This will come in great importance when declining the noun and using it. There are some simple rules to determine if a noun is masculine, feminine, or neutral:

==== Greinir (Articles) ====
An article is a word that combines with a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun. In English, articles are ''the, a,'' and ''an''. In Icelandic, there is no indefinite article, meaning there is no way to say ''a'' or ''an'' in Icelandic. Therefore, the word '''maður''' could mean ''man'' or ''a man''. You determine the proper translation by the context, which isn't as difficult as it might seem at first. 

There is however a definite article (''the''). Unlike English though, Icelandic has postfixed definite articles, meaning the article attaches itself to the end of a word to make it definite. For example, in English, you would say ''the man'', whilst in Icelandic we say ''manthe''. This might be confusing at first, but in time you will get used to this. Let's take a look how we form the definite article in Icelandic.

* &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt; Karlkyn (Masculine) &lt;big&gt;'''-inn, -nn'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span style=&quot;color:pink&quot;&gt; Kvenkyn (Feminine) &lt;big&gt;'''-in, -n'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt; Hvorukyn (Neuter) &lt;big&gt;'''-ið, -ð'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;


''Examples:'' &lt;p&gt;
'''Maður → Maðurinn''' - Man → The man &lt;/br&gt;
'''Kona → Konan''' - Woman → The woman &lt;/br&gt;
'''Barn → Barnið''' - Child → The child &lt;/br&gt;
'''Barnið er strákur''' - The child is a boy &lt;p&gt;

Allt í lagi? Skilurðu? (Do you understand?). Pretty soon we will be able to construct simple sentences.

==== Nefnifall (Nominative Case) ====
The Nominative case, or '''Nefnifall''', is the first case we will talk about. This case also exists in English, though we do not think about it when we use it. This case represents a noun that acts as the subject of the sentence. It is also used in equivelent sentences, such as sentences which use the copula verb ''to be''. (For example: I am a man). The nominative form of the noun is also the dictionary form. The words you have just learnt in this chapter are all in the nominative ('''strákur, stelpa, maður, kona'''). Examine this chart and examples below:

&lt;center&gt; [[Image:Nominative case explanation.PNG]] &lt;/center&gt;



=== Fornöfn (Pronouns) ===
Pronouns are nouns which substitute other nouns in a certain phrase or sentence. For example, in English pronouns are ''I, you, he, she, it''. In Icelandic they are:

&lt;center&gt;
{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Icelandic !!width=&quot;20px&quot;| !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Icelandic 
|-
| I || Ég || || We || Við
|-
| You || Þú || || You (plural) || Þið
|-
| He ||  Hann || || They (masculine) || Þeir
|-
| She || Hún || || They (feminine) || Þær
|-
| It || Það || || They (neuter) || Þau
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

* Note that when you have a group of males, you use '''Þeir''' and if you have a group of females then you would use '''Þær'''. If the group is of mixed gender, then use '''Þau'''.

=== Tengisögnin &quot;að vera&quot; (The copula &quot;to be&quot;) ===
The most important verb in any language is the verb &quot;to be&quot;. It is important to know how to say things like ''I am, you are, he is, she is'' and so on. The following table is a verb conjugation. Conjugating verbs is an important part of learning a language. We can't just say ''I to be, you to be, he to be''. We have to conjugate a verb in order to find the appropriate form for the adjective. First we will show you how it is done in English, than the Icelandic equivelent. Remember your pronouns?

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|20px]] '''TO BE''' [[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|20px]]
{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Pronoun !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Conjugation !!width=&quot;20px&quot;| !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Pronoun !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Conjugation
|-
| I || am || || We || are
|-
| You || are || || You all || are
|-
| He, She, It ||  is || || They || are
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Flag of Iceland.svg|20px]] '''AÐ VERA''' [[Image:Flag of Iceland.svg|20px]]
{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Fornafn !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Sagnbeyging !!width=&quot;20px&quot;| !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Fornafn !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Sagnbeyging
|-
| Ég || er || || Við || erum
|-
| Þú || ert || || Þið || eruð
|-
| Hann, Hún, Það ||  er || || Þeir, Þær, Þau|| eru
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

To make a question, you do the same as you would do in English, flip the verb and subject around. ('''Er ég?''' = ''Am I?'', '''Er hann?''' = ''Is he?''). You will also commonly see '''Ert þú''' combined into '''Ertu'''. Don't be put off by this, '''ertu''' simply means ''are you'', although '''ert þú''' is also correct and a bit more formal. 

Now that we know the simple structure to construct an Icelandic sentence, try to figure out the translations of the following. Highlight the space next to it to see if you are correct.

* '''Ég er strákur''' [ &lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt; I am a boy &lt;/span&gt; ]
* '''Hann er maður''' [ &lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt; He is a man &lt;/span&gt; ]
* '''Er hún konan?''' [ &lt;span style=&quot;color:white&quot;&gt; Is she the woman? &lt;/span&gt; ]

== Menning (Culture) ==
=== Siðir (Customs) ===
[[Image:Politeness - Punch cartoon - Project Gutenberg eText 16619.png|right|200px]]
In most European languages, there are two forms of ''you'', a polite form and a familiar form. In Icelandic, '''þú''' is used for informal and formal situations. Formality is more or less similar to how English speakers use formality. It tends to be in your voice and the type of language you use when addressing someone in a formal situation. Though whilst English has words such as ''Mister, Misses,'' and ''Miss'', Icelandic tends to address people by their first names. The Icelandic equivalents are '''Herra, Frú,''' and '''Ungfrú''', but these are seldom used. If you ask someone '''Hvað heitir þú?''' (''What is your name?''), they will tell you their first name, first name and middle name, or even their full name. It is perfectly all right to call them by their first name, even if the situation is formal. Icelandic schoolchildren, believe it or not, would call their teachers by their first name without including '''Herra''' or '''Frú'''. 

When meeting someone for the first time in Iceland, it is proper to shake their hand. When two women meet for the first time, they might exchange a kiss on the cheek. When meeting for the first time, it is polite to use the greeting '''Blessaður''' or '''Komdu sæll''' for a male, and '''Blessuð''' or '''Komdu sæl''' for a woman. The younger generation would tend to ignore formalities upon meeting, and might even say '''Hæ''' or '''Halló''' for an introductory meeting.

== Æfingar (Exercises) == 
=== Þýðing (Translation) ===
'''Leiðbeiningar:''' Translate the following into English.
&lt;p&gt;
1. góðan daginn &lt;br /&gt;
2. velkomin &lt;br /&gt;
3. já &lt;br /&gt;

7. við &lt;br /&gt;
8. hún er &lt;br /&gt;
9. og &lt;br /&gt;
10. góða nótt &lt;br /&gt;

=== Hvaða kyn? (Which gender?) ===
'''Leiðbeiningar:''' Determine the gender of the following nouns (masculine, feminine, or neuter). You might not know the meanings of the words yet, but see if you can figure it out by the way the word looks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==In the Beginning==

There are many theories about the beginning of the Universe as we know it. Although these theories differ in a variety of ways, but they all have some underlying fundamental truths, at least for the realm of understanding.

Each religion has its own beliefs, most of which are essentially the same. That is that some Entity created the Universe, for the Christian's it is God but there is also Buddha, Mohammad etc. Science also has had several theories on the beginning of the Universe. There are many beliefs and theories ranging from simple stories related to children, to more sophisticated theories related by philosophers and scholars. So where did the Universe come from?

&quot;In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.&quot; According to the King James Bible, the Earth was created by a supreme being known as God. This idea is present in most of the other religions of the world as well, the name is different from religion to religion, but the concept is the same. In every religion, the Universe is created, spoken, molded, sculpted, breathed etc into existence by some supreme being. It is a common theme, as all religions need a starting point, a place which man can begin to understand their surroundings. Because man has a limited capacity for thought and an even more limited capacity for understanding, it becomes quite hard for them to understand the overwhelming concepts of the Universe.

For most people to believe that the Universe has existed forever and will exit forever is a concept that they can not grasp. Science is a little easier to understand because it is based on facts and not merely beliefs. Though in many cases the facts are nothing more than beliefs that have not been proven or not proven. For example it was once thought that the Earth was flat and that if you sailed too far in any direction you would simply fall off. It was a theory that was proven incorrect. It was once thought that the Earth was the center of the Solar System, and in fact the Universe. That too was proven to be incorrect, until now. Science is no different than any religion of the world in this regard, because just as all religions are given words from the supreme being to guide them, these words are always unclear and subject to interpretation. Science too is subject to interpretations. 

With every religion in the world, the Words of God can and many times do have different meanings to different people. They are words written a long time ago to help guide the people of that day to become the people of today, and to guide the people of today into becoming the people of tomorrow. With that in mind, you must take a look at how society changes over the ages. All aspects of life change over the course of time, either because our morality has changed, or our morality has changed because of the changes in the way we dress, the way we maintain our appearance, even the way we work and play. Even our language changes as words are added through slang, and colloquial phrases are removed because they are outdated. The religious writings of long ago have all but been redefined through various translations and editing. To make the writings easier for the current reader to understand man has found it necessary to change certain aspects with respect to the beliefs of that day. As society changes so too changes what society believes is moral. With each revision and with each translation new morality is inserted into the writings to coincide with the moral beliefs of the day.

== '''What is the Universe''' ==

By definition, the Universe is Space and everything within that space. All matter, all energy, all life, and all consciousness make up the Universe as we know it. Most scientific minds see the whole of space as a series of Universe's know as a Multiverse. This is actually a logical way of thinking of the Universe, since Einstein's theory of relativity states that the laws of Physics are the same for everybody in the Universe, but that the perception of those laws are different based upon the observers relation to the Universe itself.


== '''Are there more than one Universe''' ==

Through modern technology we have been able to photograph with an electron microscope the essence of the atom. The image is not truly a photo of the atom, merely the energy emitted by the atom. Using this technology it is possible to 'photograph' the fluctuating states of the atoms and witness their relationship to other atoms and space in general. We now have proof that atoms exist simultaneously in several locations at the same instance. This startling discovery leads to the conclusion that there are an unlimited number of Universe's, known as the Multiverse. It is this theory that every atom exists in every Universe simultaneously, and more that the same atom can exist in different states in each Universe.

== '''How are Time and Space Linked''' ==

It has been said that time and space are linked. Time is difficult to describe, but is required for space to even exist. Space is a little easier to describe because we see space with our own eyes, but space can not be described properly without the use of time in the description. Everything in space occupies a specific place at a specific time. Simply put, we travel through space and time, and space and time travel through us. It is a dance that has been going on in the Universe since time and space began, and will continue for eternity. So then how are time and space linked? Can one exist without the other? Is there some other cosmic force that links time and space? Are the stars random? Does life exist because we imagine it? Are the rules of the Universe such as the speed of light, gravity, sound, etc. constant or varied by perspective.

The great minds of the past have asked these questions and many more, for centuries. The answers are not clear cut however; many times there seem to be multiple answers for the same question, seemingly contradictory answers to the questions. The biggest controversy in understanding is religion verses science. The very existence of life is apparently in controversy.

== '''Why am I the Center of the Universe?''' ==

Space is vast, very very vast. Space it is said goes on forever. That simply means that there is no boundary between space and something on the other side. This is a hard concept for most people to understand, since they are used to being in something such as a room or a building which has walls as a boundary. When we are in something there is a boundary that holds the &quot;in&quot; part, and there is always something on the other side of this boundary. Yet we are in space and there is no boundary. There can be no boundary, just by the very essence of what the Universe is. If you are in this room for example and the boundaries are the walls, ceiling and floor, then if you made a hole in them and went through the boundary, you would still be in 3 dimensional space. You would just be changing the boundary you are in, because now you are in a different room with different walls.

By definition a boundary holds something in, and separates that which is in from that which is out. To say that the Universe has a boundary is to say that something exists out side of this boundary. If that were the case, then this area outside its boundary would have its own boundary. This would continue to infinity. It is true that there are boundaries in space such as the afore mentioned rooms, but there are boundaries on other scales as well. A drop of water for example has a boundary between the water inside and the air outside. A diamond has a boundary between the compressed carbon and the silver or gold holding it, which also has a boundary between the ring and the finger that the ring is on. Even on a molecular scale, the atoms have boundaries between the nucleus and the electrons. As you increase the macroscopic view of the universe, the boundaries become fewer, but the Universe can ultimately never be contained. 

That said space continues on forever in all directions. If you could see far enough when you looked you would see infinity on your right, and infinity on your left. Since infinity equals infinity, you are directly in the center no matter where in the Universe you are standing. You are the center of the Universe, and similarly time will exist for eternity, as it already has so we are at the center of time.

It is all a matter of perspective. As Einstein developed the theory of relativity, the key to the matter (if you will pardon the pun), all matter, is perception or perspective. All of the laws of the Universe follow the same guidelines for every viewer in the Universe. To rephrase for clarity, just as we are at the center of the Universe and the center of Time, we could also say that we are on top of the world. The reason this is true is simply that we are on the surface of a sphere which by definition (of a sphere) is an object that all lines perpendicular to all of the tangent planes travel through the center of the object. Much like a circle is described as a two dimensional object whereby all of the lines perpendicular to all tangent lines travel through the center of the object. If therefore you are standing on one of these tangent planes, up would be everything on your side of the plane and down would be everything on the other, or you would be on the top side of the plane on which you are standing. Simply put, in Space there is no up or down, no left or right, and no front or back. There is only the direction you chose to call up, down, left, right, front or back. Your up could just as well be someone else’s left or right, front or back. It is merely a matter of perspective.</text>

        &lt;inventory&gt;35&lt;/inventory&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;This 2003 Zinfandel has huge, jammy, inky, slightly porty aromas
        infused with black pepper, vanilla and hints of tar, smoke and coffee blend. 
        A very broad, intense wine with huge fruit, lots of those luscious 
        Dry Creek bing cherry and sweet plum characters.&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;/wine&gt;

        &lt;description&gt;The palate reveals velvety, ripe fine-grained tannins, 
        harmonising well with the oak and seductively spicy fruit. 
        The finish is rich and long, with cinnamon, cloves and brambly wild fruit note.&lt;/description&gt;

        &lt;description&gt;This wine shows ripe passionfruit and delicate tropical fruit aromas 
        and hints of gooseberry. Delicious fresh wine with a lovely balance of acid and 
        fruit sweetness. The finish is lively and lingering.&lt;/description&gt;

        &lt;description&gt;Concentrated aromas of ripe black berry and dark cherry fruit are offset by

== Experiments ==
In a experiment the experimenter applies 'treatments' to groups of subjects.  For example the experimenter may give one drug to group 1 and a different drug or a placebo to group 2, to determine the effectiveness of the drug.  This is what differentiates an 'experiment' from an 'observational study'.

Scientists try to identify cause-and-effect relationships because this kind of knowledge is especially powerful, for example, drug A cures disease B.  Various methods exist for detecting cause-and-effect relationships.  An experiment is a method that most clearly shows cause-and-effect because it isolates and manipulates a single variable, in order to clearly show its effect.  Experiments almost always have two distinct variables: First, an independent variable (IV) is manipulated by an experimenter to exist in at least two levels (usually &quot;none&quot; and &quot;some&quot;). Then the experimenter measures the second variable, the dependent variable (DV).

{{robox|theme=2|title=Example: Experimentation}}
Suppose the experimental hypothesis that concerns the scientist is that reading a wiki will enhance knowledge. Notice that the hypothesis is really an attempt to state a causal relationship like, &quot;if you read a qiki, then you will have enhanced knowledge.&quot; The antecedent condition (reading a wiki) causes the consequent condition (enhanced knowledge).  Antecedent conditions are always IVs and consequent conditions are always DVs in experiments. So the experimenter would produce two levels of Wiki reading (none and some, for example) and record knowledge. If the subjects who got no Wiki exposure had less knowledge than those who were exposed to wikis, it follows that the difference is caused by the IV.
{{Robox/Close}}

So, the reason scientists utilize experiments is that it is the only way to determine causal relationships between variables. Experiments tend to be artificial because they try to make both groups identical with the single exception of the levels of the independent variable.

The most primitive method of understanding the laws of nature utilizes observational studies. Basically, a researcher goes out into the world and looks for variables that are associated with one another. Notice that, unlike experiments, in an observational study the Independent Variables are not manipulated by the experimenter. The independent variable could be something like &quot;smoking&quot;.  It would be unethical and probably impossible to do an experiment where one randomly selected group is assigned to smoke and another group is assigned to the non-smoking group.  Therefore, in order do determine the health effects of smoking on humans, an observational study is more appropriate than an experiment.  The health of smokers and non-smokers would be compared without the experimenter assigning treatment.

Some of the foundations of modern scientific thought are based on observational research. Charles Darwin, for example, based his explanation of evolution entirely on observations he made. Case studies, where individuals are observed and questioned to determine possible causes of problems, are a form of observational research that continues to be popular today. In fact, every time you see a physician he or she is performing observational science.

There is a problem in observational science though — it cannot ever identify causal relationships because even though two variables are related both might be caused by a third, unseen, variable. Since the underlying laws of nature are assumed to be causal laws, observational findings are generally regarded as less compelling than experimental findings.

The key way to identify experimental studies is that they involve an intervention such as the administration of a drug to one group of patients and a placebo to another group.  Observational studies only collect data and make comparisons. 

Medicine is an intensively studied discipline, and not all phenomenon can be studied by experimentation due to obvious ethical or logistical restrictions. 
 
*'''Case series''': These are purely observational, consisting of reports of a series of similar medical cases. For example, a series of patients might be reported to suffer from bone abnormalities as well as immunodeficiencies.  This association may not be significant, occurring purely by chance.  On the other hand, the association may point to a mutation in common pathway affecting both the skeletal system and the immune system.   
*'''Case-Control''':  This involves an observation of a disease state, compared to normal healthy controls. For example, patients with lung cancer could be compared with their otherwise healthy neighbors.  Using neighbors limits bias introduced by demographic variation.  The cancer patients and their neighbors (the control) might be asked about their exposure history (did they work in an industrial setting), or other risk factors such as smoking.  Another example of a case-control study is the testing of a diagnostic procedure against the gold standard.  The gold standard represents the control, while the new diagnostic procedure is the &quot;case.&quot;  This might seem to qualify as an &quot;intervention&quot; and thus an experiment.    
*'''Cross-sectional''':  Involves many variables collected all at the same time. Used in epidemiology to estimate prevalence, or conduct other surveys.  
*'''Cohort''': A group of subjects followed over time, prospectively.  Framingham study is classic example.  By observing exposure and then tracking outcomes, cause and effect can be better isolated. However this type of study cannot conclusively isolate a cause and effect relationship.  
*'''Historic Cohort''': This is the same as a cohort except that researchers use an historic medical record to track patients and outcomes.

=Using an XML Editor: NetBeans : Single - Entity=
&lt;center&gt;
Return to the Single Entity Chapter =&gt; [[../A single entity/]
&lt;/center&gt;

===XML document:===

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XML Document.  
#Save your file as ‘city’ 
#Select XML Schema-Constrained Document as the document type. 
#Next, specify your schema location (Go to Browse, then select the schema just created) and root element name (tourGuide).  
#Copy and paste the above code into the NetBeans editor and save.
#Check the XML document to make sure it is well-formed (ALT-F9).  
To validate an XML document: 
#Right-click the document's node and choose Validate XML. 
If the XML file, city.xml, conforms to the XML schema provided, city.xsd, your Output Window should look like the following:

[[Image:WellForm.JPG|Output Window - Validity check]] 

Open this file, city.xml, in NetBeans.
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ffffff&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 '''Summary: Being a file which contains XML code and syntax, the XML document is an entity of neatly organized elements and subelements.'''
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Netbeans Tips ====
The prefix &quot;xsi&quot; for attribute &quot;xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation&quot; associated with an element type &quot;Listing&quot; is not bound. 
      -Caused because line
       &quot;xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'&quot; is 
       missing from the top of the document.

cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'Listing'.
      -Caused due to lack of extension(.xsd) at the end of the schema
       name.

cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'MuseumName'. One of '{&quot;&quot;:Museum}' is expected. [5] 
      -Caused due to lack of naming at the beginning and end of the
       variable naming section.

The element type &quot;MuseumName&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/MuseumName&gt;&quot;. 
      -Could be caused by a missing &quot;/&quot; in the end tag of one of the
       variables

===XML Schema===


Any XML document, including XML schema and XML stylesheet documents, can be checked to make sure they are “well-formed”. An XML document is said to be well-formed if it adheres to the XML syntax rules, as outlined in the Chapter 1, such as there must be exactly one root element, every start tag must have an end tag.  The well-formedness of an XML documents can be checked using an XML editor software, in this case, the NetBeans.
If any errors are detected, they are listed along with the line number in the Output window.  This location is not necessarily the line where the error occurred.  By double-clicking on any error message, you can go to the line in the XML document where the error was detected. 

Use NetBeans to create a new project:
#Go to File -&gt; New Project
Use NetBeans to create the above XML schema:

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XML Schema.  
#Save your file as ‘city’ (this gives the file an extension of .xsd). 
#Copy and Paste the above schema into city.xsd and save
To check an XML document to see if it is well-formed:
#Right-click the document's node (under files, city.xsd) and choose Check XML schema or press Alt-F9.  

If the XML schema, city.xsd, is well-formed, your Output Window should look like this:
[[Image:WellForm.JPG|Well Form XML Document]]

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ffffff&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 '''Summary: The XML schema shows the structure and elements of an XML document.'''
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== ''' Netbeans Tips ''' ====
Element type &quot;xsd:element&quot; must be followed by either attribute specifications, &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;/&gt;&quot;.
      -Caused by lack of &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;/&gt;&quot; symbol at the end of either the 
       specified line or the line there after.
The value of attribute &quot;name&quot; associated with an element type &quot;xsd:complexType&quot; must not contain the '&lt;' character. 
      -Often caused by lack of closing quotation around the variable 
       name on either the specified line or the line there after.
src-resolve.4.2: Error resolving component 'xsd:strin'...
      -Caused by invalid &quot;type&quot;, most likely misspelled.  Can be for 
       any &quot;type&quot;, not just &quot;string.&quot;
The element type &quot;xsd:sequence&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused because &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt; is not found in order to close 
       the statement.  
      -Also caused because the closing statements are out of order as
       they at the beginning of the Schema.

===XML Stylesheet===

Use NetBeans to create the above XML stylesheet: 

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XSL Stylesheet  
#Save your file as ‘city’ 
#Copy and paste the above code into the NetBeans editor and save.
#Check the stylesheet to make sure it is well-formed (ALT-F9).

Note: The city example files (city.xsd, city.xml and city.xsl) can
be created using a text editor, and the results are displayed correctly
in a compatible web browser such as Mozilla 1.6. You will need to store
all of the files in the same directory and insert the following line
after line 1 of city.xml:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;city.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This associates the XSL Stylesheet with the XML file containing the
city data. Also, If you are using Netbeans, be sure to take off the xmlns line in the beginning which looks like xmlns='http://xml.netbeans.org/examples/targetNS', otherwise it will not display all data.


==== ''' Netbeans Tips ''' ====

The element type &quot;xsl:text&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused by either lack of end-tag or misspelling of the end-
       tag.

The element type &quot;xsl:for-each&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused due to either lack of end-tag for the specified tag or 
       end-tags placed in the wrong order.

----
I recommend a macro structure that begins by examining the Constitution Article by Article up through Article 6, a special section on the Bill of Rights, and then individual sections on the later amendments. 

Much attention must be paid to the 14th Amendment: some care must be taken to ensure lay readers get that the 14th Amendment is possibly the most important Amendment in American history, at least from the perspective of how much it has shaped American life. It is the 14th, after all, that made most of the Bill of Rights operable against the states.

If no one objects, I am going to begin editing the content of this book, shaping it into the form of a modern casebook.  This is a rough outline of what I want to add over the next several months.

Actually, I think its a standaloneand should stay separate and should stay here. Ross Woods

''This certainly does seem relevant to many (most?) teachers, not just teachers involved in Fire and Emergency Management. I notice that there are few free-floating stand-alone paper pages in a brick-and-mortar library. Instead, pages are bound into books. Is there a better wikibook for this information?''

I wrote this around the fire and emergency services as this is the industry I deal with. David is right, in that, it could easily be adapted to most any academic setting. I could reword some stuff and generalize it to such. Waht are your thoughts? --[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 19:59, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Working with the Navigation Side Bar==

One of the more esoteric features of MediaWiki software that is under the control of an administrator is the maintenance of the navigation side bar that appears (usually) to the left of the content on all MediaWiki pages.

==Accessing the Side Bar Template==

The main sidebar template is kept in the collection of standard MediaWiki messages that may be edited by or protected from ordinary users just like any other template.  These pages are always protected from editing, however, unless you have administrator rights.

The typical page for this in the MediaWiki software is found at [[:MediaWiki:Sidebar]], and can be found on all MediaWiki projects.

==Default Settings==

The default sidebar information for most MediaWiki installations is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
* navigation 
** mainpage|main 
** portal-url|portal 
** ict-url|ict 
** currentevents-url|currentevents 
** recentchanges-url|recentchanges 
** randompage-url|randompage 
** helppage|help 
** sitesupport-url|sitesupport
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Explaining features==

There are two sorts of links that can be added through this interface:

*Predefined project variables
*Direct project links

Both of these have advantages and disadvantages which will be explained below.

===Predefined Project Variables===

The default setup of the navigation bar is only the predefined variables, so a common misconception is that this is the only sort of item that can appear on the navigation bar.  Indeed prior to MediaWiki 1.5 this was the only way that you could make changes to the navigation bar, so it is common for people to still use this approach.

The values for these project variables must be changed from the list of [[Special:Allmessages|System messages]] directly.  For example from the default example above regarding the current events link, currentevents-url can be changed at [[:MediaWiki:Currentevents-url]] and currentevents at [[:MediaWiki:Currentevents]].  Note that if you want to change the page links or even the text of the navigation bar for this one item, you don't even need to edit the navigation bar itself directly but simply need to edit the variable link instead.

An additional description is available if you edit [[:MediaWiki:Monobook.js]] that is related to each project variable that appears as a &quot;hint text&quot; for each project variable.

====Advantages====

*Displays hint text (not available for direct project links)
*Standard translations are available for default multi-lingual configurations which include these variables

====Disadvantages====

*Additional step of trying to hunt down variable pages if you want to make changes
*Often the actual content in the variable has absolutely nothing to do with the name of the variable.  For example, portal-url may in fact be a link to a self-referential parody group of pages or to the main project discussion pages.
*Adding additional variables requires developer access/root access to the computer that is hosting the content.

===Direct Project Links===

This is a more recent feature for adding in the navigation bar, but is much easier to work with.  Specific syntax issues will be addressed in the next major section.

====Advantages====

*No need to create variables or edit outside of the main side bar template
*Context of the content is obvious
*Can be performed by somebody with sysop privileges
*Less likely to mess up whole project (such as might happen if [[:MediaWiki:Monobook.js]] is edited with the wrong syntax)

====Disadvantages====

*Lack of hint text (is it really that important?)  Note that even this may be fixed in a later version of MediaWiki software.

==Sidebar Syntax==

It is important to note that either naming convention can be used to help rearrange the order of the links on the sidebar, and both may be used simultaneously.  You are not restricted to sticking to one naming convention.

MediaWiki software uses the unordered list syntax for keeping track of items in the sidebar.  Major sections are delimited by a single asterisk (*) and individual links by two asterisks (**).  Additional levels may be added depending on the nature of the link, but only affect indentation of links on the sidebar and should be used very sparingly.

Following the asterisk, the link is added by using the format of URL (or page link) followed by the public description of that link.  There is no need to use the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[ or ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; brackets to form these links as the MediaWiki software will do this automatically.

Here is an example of a modified sidebar from the default:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
* navigation 
** mainpage|mainpage 
** portal-url|portal 
** currentevents-url|currentevents 
** helppage|help 
** sitesupport-url|sitesupport
** Project:Village Pump|Village Pump

* tools
** recentchanges-url|recentchanges 
** randompage-url|randompage 
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note here that Recent Changes and the Random Page links have been moved to a completely separate section.  As an example, a link to the main project discussion page has been added.

Other text or even images can be added to this sidebar, but you should be careful as it is used on every project page and has a major draw on server resources as a result.  This is something that should be kept very simple and neat as a guideline.

*'''Note:''' Keep in mind that these changes will be very visible to all participants of the project, and that experimentation with this feature is likely to confuse new users to the project.  On larger projects with many users, you should try to get a general feel for what changes need to be made from the users rather than arbitrarily make changes on a whim.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes it is necessary to hide a page rather than just fix it or redirect it elsewhere. Although this function is described as &quot;deletion&quot; it doesn't physically remove it from the underlying database. Instead the page is marked as delete and is hidden from view for normal users (that is, those without administrator privileges).

Once you have become an administrator one of the first things you will notice is a brand-new &quot;delete&quot; tab at the top of most pages in addition to the normal ones. This will take you to a deletion prompt.

Once there, fill in the explanation and click &quot;Delete page&quot;. Some versions of MediaWiki have a &quot;Yes, I really want to delete this&quot; checkbox, so tick that before clicking delete otherwise it will not work.

What should be deleted depends on the project's inclusion rules, but generally:

*Test pages
*Vandal pages
*[[A Wikimedia Administrator's Handbook/Spam and Spammers|Spam pages]]
*[[A Wikimedia Administrator's Handbook/How to Handle Copyright Violations|Copyright violations]]
*Duplicates
*Project-incompatible pages

==Deleting specific revisions==
If you wish to delete only some revisions of a page - for example someone's private contact details or a copyright violation -this can be done using the &quot;revision deletion&quot; functionality from the page history display. Select the revision you wish to delete then click the '''''show / hide selected revisions''''' button. You will be given the option of hiding the content of the revision, the account name that made the revision or the edit summary. One or more options can be selected. Enter a reason for hiding the revision then click '''''apply to selected revision''''' to complete the action.

Hidden revisions remain visible to other administrators. In some cases the revision may need to be hidden from administrators as well. This is achieved using the ''suppression'' function (called ''oversight'' in earlier versions of MediaWiki). On all Wikimedia projects the ''suppression'' function is only available to Oversighters and Stewards.

==Restoring some or all deleted revisions==
Once a page has been deleted it is invisible to normal users, but admins visiting that same &quot;no such article&quot; page will also see a line at the top saying &quot;&lt;small&gt;View or restore [[Special:Undelete|## deleted edits]]?&lt;/small&gt;&quot;. This line also appears on the revision history page if the page still exists but has had some past revisions deleted.

Regardless of its location, clicking on the link will display the revision history. MediaWiki builds from before February 16, 2006 will show the last revision before deletion above the revision history. Each of these can be viewed on its own by choosing the appropriate date and time entry. MediaWiki builds from after February 16, 2006 will display the raw wiki source for the page (with a button below which can render it as it appeared), while those before this date will show the rendered page. Regardless of what version you are using the diff view function is currently not supported for deleted pages.

If you want to restore all deleted revisions merely click &quot;Restore!&quot;, but if you want to exclude specific revisions you will need to check the boxes of every revision ''other'' than those ones before clicking Restore, at the moment there is no &quot;restore all but selected&quot; option. For pages that have had a lot of edits this can be a laborious process.

Revision restoration does not have to happen all at once however, and even multiple admins can simultaneously restore edits of the same page (although they will encounter some errors if they both select a matching revision).

==Merging page histories==
Sometimes when merging pages it is desirable to merge their edit histories together rather than simply using redirects. In this case you will need to delete the page in question, move one of the source pages over top of it, delete the page again, move the next over top, etc. etc. etc. Once completed simply restore ''all'' the revisions by clicking the history tab and going through the procedure described above.

Depending on the version of MediaWiki running the newest revision may become the current revision, so you may need to revert to an earlier revision where all the source pages had already been merged.

A step-by-step explanation is found in [[MediaWiki_Administrator's_Handbook/Edit_History|Edit History]].

==Mass page deletion==
The mass deletion function (also known as ''nuke'') can be used to remove a large number of pages quickly and easily. It is useful when combating page creation vandalism. The mass deletion function is accessed from [[Special:Nuke]]. Three options to filter the pages to be deleted are available:

* All users or by username or IP address
* All pages or by page name (using a pattern)
* Maximum number of pages 

Selecting '''''go''''' will bring up a list of pages based on your selection criteria. By default all pages are &quot;checked&quot; and will be deleted. Enter a reason in the description field then select '''''delete selected''''' to complete the mass deletion. Be careful with this function as there is no mass undelete!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes it is necessary to protect a page against vandalism or other unwanted edits.

First of all visit the page in question and click the protect tab. You will be presented with one of two boxes, depending on the version of MediaWiki your wiki is running. Both methods are presented below. For the record, Wikicities is currently running MediaWiki 1.4 while Wikimedia projects are running 1.5.
 
==Page Protection in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier==
[[Image:Page protection in MediaWiki 1.4.png|frame|left|The protection screen in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier (some very early 1.5 builds also have this style)]]&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

At this screen simply check &quot;Confirm protection&quot;. If you only want to prevent people moving the page check that box (by default the page will be protected from both). In this version of MediaWiki you cannot choose to protect solely against page moves while leaving editing access open.
&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

==Page Protection in MediaWiki 1.5 and later==
[[Image:Page protection in MediaWiki 1.5.png|frame|left|The protection screen in MediaWiki 1.5 and later]]&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

By default the left and right options both move to the same place when you change the left-hand one. If you check &quot;Unlock move permissions&quot; each may be adjusted independently. You can for example decide to allow only sysops to edit the page, but for non-sysops--the &quot;(default)&quot; category--to move the page if they choose to do so. In most cases you will want to protect against both, which is why this is the default. Some wikis also have a &quot;new users&quot; option (not shown).

If the page has been protected in the past, a &quot;Protection log&quot; will be displayed beneath the prompt.
{{-}}

==Unprotecting in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier==
[[Image:Page unprotection in MediaWiki 1.4.png|frame|left|The unprotection screen in MediaWiki 1.4 and earlier (also some early 1.5 builds)]]&lt;BR clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

Simply give a reason and tick &quot;Confirm unprotection&quot;, then click &quot;Confirm&quot;. When using MediaWiki 1.4 this results in all protection restrictions being removed from the page.

==Unprotecting in MediaWiki 1.5 and later==
For this just [[#Page Protection in MediaWiki 1.5 and later|see above]] and set the access type you're re-enabling to &quot;(default)&quot;. You can also subjectively turn the two different permissions on and off at will.

If the page has been protected in the past, a &quot;Protection log&quot; will be displayed beneath the prompt.

==Things to note==
Note that the talk page of the page you are protecting will NOT be protected along with its sibling, and vice versa. If this is necessary you will need to do it separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pangaea.png|right|250px|thumb|Map of Pangaea]]
Pangaea was a big super-continent of Earth. A super-continent means a very large area of land made up of several continents we know today. Pangea formed during the [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|Mesozoic era]] three hundred million years ago.  Nearly all the countries we have today were part of Pangaea. Many mountains today were made in this supercontinent. Pangaea was surrounded by one big ocean called Panthalassa.

Pangaea broke up during the Jurassic period 180 million years ago and it split into two continents: Gondwana in the South and Laurasia in the North. After this they split again into the continents we have today.

== Other super-continents ==

Scientists think that there were two super-continents before Pangea, one called Rodinia which was made 1,100 million years ago, then split 750 million years ago and one called Pannotia which was made 600 million years ago, then split 540 million years ago.

The Tethys Ocean has been around for millions of years; it probably was around when these super continents existed.  During the Triassic period, the Tethys Ocean was located to the east of Pangaea and Laurasia. During the Jurassic, when the supercontinent split into Gondwanaland and Laurasia, the south-eastern opening to the Tethys Ocean became tighter, thus making the Tethys Ocean more contained.  During the Cretaceous, Gondwanaland split into the continents of Africa, Australia and India. India was drifting through the Tethys Ocean; but now the Tethys Ocean is probably part of the Indian Ocean. Laurasia wasn't always part of the two Jurassic cotinents; it was also part of Pangaea. Laurasia was the northern part of Pangea. Laurasia stayed Laurasia for millions of years while Pangea split and shaped into a different continent called Gondwanaland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Extinction is the process which happens when a type of animals or plants dies out. This means that all of them die and none survive. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to get what they need to live such as food, water, or shelter. This can also happen when the weather is too hot or too cold for a long time.

As long as there has been life, extinction has happened. 99.9% of all species that ever lived on earth have become extinct! Extinction still happens today, a group of animals which scientists are afraid will become extinct are called endangered.

All the big dinosaurs became extinct at the end of Cretaceous period about 65 million years ago, but no-one knows for sure why. To find out more see [[Wikijunior Dinosaurs/K-T Event]].

Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds. Many people don't think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly. But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur. They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">65 million years ago, half of all the different kinds of animals on Earth died out. Large land creatures suffered the most.  All animals larger than a big dog had disappeared completely, including all the dinosaurs!

Something extraordinary must have happened to destroy so much life.  Scientists call this event the Cretaceous-Tertiary event (K-T for short).  Nobody is sure what the K-T event was, but scientists have some ideas about what might have happened. 

===Asteroid explanation===

[[Image:KT_Impact2.jpg|right|thumb|An asteroid could have hit the Earth.]]
An asteroid is a giant piece of rock moving through space.  Very rarely, these asteroids fall on Earth.  Some scientists think that an asteroid 10 kilometres wide fell on Earth 65 million years ago.  A large asteroid hitting the Earth would cause a huge fire storm, and cause a lot of dust to fly into the air. This dust would block out the sun for several months, or even for several years.

With most sunlight blocked by dust, the ground would get colder, and a long winter would come.  To make things worse, the large amount of dust in the air would cause acid rain, rain so poisonous that it can harm or even kill plants.

The combination of the cold, little sun and poisonous rain would kill many plants.  [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|Herbivore]] dinosaurs would not have enough left to eat, and would starve and without herbivores to eat, the [[Wikijunior_Dinosaurs/Glossary_of_Basic_Terms|carnivores]] would starve too.

When scientists examine layers of very old rocks from 65 million years ago, they find a lot of one type of rare metal called iridium.  Because iridium is so rare on earth, it must have come from somewhere else, like an asteroid.  More evidence of this is an enormous 180 kilometre (111 miles) wide crater in Mexico, called the Chicxulub Crater.  An asteroid impact could have made such a crater.

A few scientists disagree with this explanation.  They say that all this would cause dinosaurs to die much faster than they did. There are similar big craters around the world that affected ancient life.

===Other explanations===

[[Image:Galunggung.jpg|left|thumb|There could have been many large volcano eruptions.]]
Some scientists think that volcano eruptions could have caused the K-T event.  These volcanoes would release huge amounts of ash and poisonous gases into the air.  Like the dust in the asteroid explanation, this ash would stay in the air for a long time and cause a winter and acid rain.

These gases would also destroy the protective ozone layer in the sky.  The ozone layer protects us from the Sun's harmful rays.

Scientists have found out that there have been some huge eruptions. These eruptions could have covered both the states Alaska and Texas in one kilometre of ash and lava!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Libraries Reference}}

Haskell has a rich and growing set of libraries. They fall into several groups:

* The Standard Prelude (often referred to as just &quot;the Prelude&quot;) is defined in the [https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/ Haskell 2010 standard] and imported automatically to every module you write. It defines standard types such as strings, lists, numbers, and the basic functions on those, such as arithmetic, &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;foldr&lt;/tt&gt;.

* The Standard Libraries are also defined in the language standard, but you have to import them when you need them. The specification of these libraries can also be found in the Haskell 2010 standard.

* Since 1998, the Standard Libraries have been gradually extended, and the resulting ''de facto'' standard is known as the Base Libraries. The same set is available for both Hugs and GHC.

* Other libraries may be bundled with the various compilers. In particular, GHC includes a handful of commonly used libraries, including important packages such as &lt;code&gt;containers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;bytestring&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Packages'' are the units of distribution of libraries. They consist of a set modules, packaged for ease of distribution and installation.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Many other libraries are available from [http://hackage.haskell.org/ Hackage], and can be installed using the &lt;code&gt;cabal&lt;/code&gt; utility.

When Haskell 98 was standardized, modules were given a flat namespace.  That turned out to be inadequate, and a hierarchical namespace has been added by allowing dots in module names. For backward compatibility the standard libraries can still be accessed by their non-hierarchical names, so the modules &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Data.List&lt;/tt&gt; both refer to the standard list library.

For details of how to import libraries into your program, see the [[Haskell/Modules|Modules]] chapter. For an explanation of the Cabal system for packaging Haskell software see [[Haskell/Packaging]].

== Haddock Documentation ==

Library reference documentation is generally produced using the Haddock tool. The libraries shipped with GHC are documented in this way. You can view the documentation [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html online], and if you have installed GHC then there should also be a local copy.

Haddock produces hyperlinked documentation, so every time you see a function, type, or class name you can click on it to get to the definition.  The sheer wealth of libraries available can be intimidating, so this tutorial will point out the highlights.

Note that Haddock cross-references types and classes by instance. For example, in the &lt;tt&gt;[http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Maybe.html Data.Maybe]&lt;/tt&gt; library the &lt;tt&gt;Maybe&lt;/tt&gt; data type is listed as an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Ord a =&gt; Ord (Maybe a)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you declare a type &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; then the type &lt;tt&gt;Maybe Foo&lt;/tt&gt; will automatically be an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; as well.  If you click on the word &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; in the document then you will be taken to the definition of the &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; class and its (very long) list of instances. The instance for &lt;tt&gt;Maybe&lt;/tt&gt; will be down there as well.

Even though I it has been a while since I have worked on the social deviance wikibook, I am still currently working on the project. I understand that the module might look like a candidate for deletion, but I have recently gotten back to work in order to fill in useful information for the power conflict theories of deviation. I have filled out information for Foucault and I think the module is no longer a candidate for deletion. [[User:Boneheadmx|Boneheadmx]] 18:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

Monads are very useful in Haskell, but the concept is often difficult at first. Since they have so many applications, people often explain them from a particular point of view, and that can confuse your understanding of monads in their full glory.

Historically, monads were introduced into Haskell to perform input/output. A predetermined execution order is crucial for things like reading and writing files, and monadic operations follow an inherent sequence. We discussed sequencing and IO back in [[../Simple input and output/]] using the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation. Well, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; is actually just syntactic sugar over monads.

Monads are by no means limited to input and output. Monads support a whole range of things like exceptions, state, non-determinism, continuations, coroutines, and more. In fact, thanks to the versatility of monads, none of these constructs needed to be built into Haskell as a language; instead, they are defined by the standard libraries.


== Definition ==

A ''monad'' is defined by three things:
*a [[Haskell/More on datatypes#Parameterized Types | type constructor]] &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;;
*a function &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;This &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function has nothing to do with the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; keyword found in imperative languages like C or Java; don't conflate these two.&lt;/ref&gt;
*an operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; which is pronounced &quot;bind&quot;. 
The function and operator are methods of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; type class and have types

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    return :: a -&gt; m a
    (&gt;&gt;=)  :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
&lt;/source&gt;

and are required to obey [[#Monad Laws|three laws]] that will be explained later on.

For a concrete example, take the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad. The type constructor is &lt;code&gt;m = Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; are defined like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    return :: a -&gt; Maybe a
    return x  = Just x

    (&gt;&gt;=)  :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
    m &gt;&gt;= g = case m of
                 Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                 Just x  -&gt; g x
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; is the monad, and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; brings a value into it by wrapping it with &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;. As for &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, it takes a &lt;code&gt;m :: Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; value and a &lt;code&gt;g :: a -&gt; Maybe b&lt;/code&gt; function. If &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, there is nothing to do and the result is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, in the &lt;code&gt;Just x&lt;/code&gt; case, &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is applied to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, the underlying value wrapped in &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;, to give a &lt;code&gt;Maybe b&lt;/code&gt; result, which might be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, depending on what &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; does to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. To sum it all up, if there is an underlying value in &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, we apply &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; to it, which brings the underlying value back into the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad.

The key first step to understand how &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; work is tracking which values and arguments are monadic and which ones aren't. As in so many other cases, type signatures are our guide to the process.

=== Motivation: Maybe ===

To see the usefulness of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad, consider the following example: Imagine a family database that provides two functions

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    father :: Person -&gt; Maybe Person
    mother :: Person -&gt; Maybe Person
&lt;/source&gt;

These look up the name of someone's father or mother. In case our database is missing some information, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; allows us to return a &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; value instead of crashing the program.

Let's combine our functions to query various grandparents. For instance, the following function looks up the maternal grandfather:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
maternalGrandfather :: Person -&gt; Maybe Person
maternalGrandfather p =
    case mother p of
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just mom -&gt; father mom
&lt;/source&gt;

Or consider a function that checks whether both grandfathers are in the database:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers :: Person -&gt; Maybe (Person, Person)
    bothGrandfathers p =
        case father p of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just dad -&gt;
                case father dad of
                    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                    Just gf1 -&gt;                          -- found first grandfather
                        case mother p of
                            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                            Just mom -&gt;
                                case father mom of
                                    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                                    Just gf2 -&gt;          -- found second grandfather
                                        Just (gf1, gf2) 
&lt;/source&gt;

What a mouthful! Every single query might fail by returning &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; and the whole function must fail with &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; if that happens.

Clearly there has to be a better way to write that instead of repeating the case of &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; again and again! Indeed, that's what the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad is set out to do. For instance, the function retrieving the maternal grandfather has exactly the same structure as the &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; operator, so we can rewrite it as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    maternalGrandfather p = mother p &gt;&gt;= father
&lt;/source&gt;

With the help of lambda expressions and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, we can rewrite the two grandfathers function as well:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers p =
       father p &gt;&gt;=
           (\dad -&gt; father dad &gt;&gt;=
               (\gf1 -&gt; mother p &gt;&gt;=   -- this line works as &quot;\_ -&gt; mother p&quot;, but naming gf1 allows later return
                   (\mom -&gt; father mom &gt;&gt;=
                       (\gf2 -&gt; return (gf1,gf2) ))))
&lt;/source&gt;

While these nested lambda expressions may look confusing to you, the thing to take away here is that &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; releases us from listing all the &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;s, shifting the focus back to the interesting part of the code.

To be a little more precise: The result of &lt;code&gt;father p&lt;/code&gt; is a monadic value (in this case, either &lt;code&gt;Just dad&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, depending on whether &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;'s dad is in the database). As the &lt;code&gt;father&lt;/code&gt; function takes a regular (non-monadic value), the &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; feeds &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;dad&lt;/code&gt; to it as a ''non-monadic'' value. The result of &lt;code&gt;father dad&lt;/code&gt; is then monadic again, and the process continues.

So, &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; helps us pass non-monadic values to functions without leaving a monad. In the case of the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad, the monadic aspect is the qualifier that we don't know with certainty whether the value will be found.

=== Type class ===

In Haskell, the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; type class is used to implement monads. It is provided by the {{Haskell lib|v=latest|Control|Monad}} module and included in the Prelude. The class has the following methods:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    class Monad m where
        return :: a -&gt; m a
        (&gt;&gt;=)  :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
     
        (&gt;&gt;)   :: m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
        fail   :: String -&gt; m a
&lt;/source&gt;

Aside from return and bind, notice the two additional functions &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt;.

The operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; called &quot;then&quot; is a mere convenience and commonly implemented as
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    m &gt;&gt; n = m &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; n
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; sequences two monadic actions when the second action does not involve the result of the first, which is common for monads like &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    printSomethingTwice :: String -&gt; IO ()
    printSomethingTwice str = putStrLn str &gt;&gt; putStrLn str
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; handles pattern match failures in [[Haskell/do Notation|&lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation]]. It's an unfortunate technical necessity and doesn't really have anything to do with monads. You are advised not to call &lt;code&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt; directly in your code.

== Notions of Computation ==

We've seen how &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; are very handy for removing boilerplate code that crops up when using &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;. That, however, is not enough to justify why monads matter so much. We will continue our monad studies by rewriting the two-grandfathers function using &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation with [[Haskell/Indentation#Explicit characters in place of indentation|explicit braces and semicolons]]. Depending on your experience with other programming languages, you may find this very suggestive:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers p = do {
        dad &lt;- father p;
        gf1 &lt;- father dad;
        mom &lt;- mother p;
        gf2 &lt;- father mom;
        return (gf1, gf2);
      }
&lt;/source&gt;

If this looks like a code snippet of an imperative programming language to you, that's because it is. In particular, this imperative language supports ''exceptions'' : &lt;code&gt;father&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mother&lt;/code&gt; are functions that might fail to produce results, i.e. raise an exception, and when that happens, the whole &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-block will fail, i.e. terminate with an exception.

In other words, the expression &lt;code&gt;father p&lt;/code&gt;, which has type &lt;code&gt;Maybe Person&lt;/code&gt;, is interpreted as a statement of an imperative language that returns a &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; as result. This is true for all monads: a value of type &lt;code&gt;M a&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as a statement of an imperative language that returns a value of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as result; and the semantics of this language are determined by the monad &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;By &quot;semantics&quot;, we mean what the language allows you to say. In the case of &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, the semantics allow us to express failure, as statements may fail to produce a result, leading to the statements that follow it being skipped.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under this interpretation, the bind operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; is simply a function version of the semicolon. Just like a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; expression can be written as a function application,

    let x = foo in x + 3          corresponds to      (\x -&gt; x + 3) foo

an assignment and semicolon can be written as the bind operator:

    x &lt;- foo; return (x + 3)      corresponds to      foo &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return (x + 3))

The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function lifts a value &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;M a&lt;/code&gt;, a full-fledged statement of the imperative language corresponding to the monad &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;.

Different semantics of the imperative language correspond to different monads. The following table shows the classic selection that every Haskell programmer should know. If the idea behind monads is still unclear to you, studying each of the examples in the following chapters will not only give you a well-rounded toolbox but also help you understand the common abstraction behind them.

|}

Furthermore, these different semantics need not occur in isolation. As we will see in a few chapters, it is possible to mix and match them by using [[Haskell/Monad transformers|monad transformers]] to combine the semantics of multiple monads in a single monad.

== Monad Laws ==
In Haskell, every instance of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; type class (and thus all implementations of bind &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;) must obey the following three laws:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    m &gt;&gt;= return     =  m                        -- right unit
    return x &gt;&gt;= f   =  f x                      -- left unit

    (m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g  =  m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)  -- associativity
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Return as neutral element ===
The behavior of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is specified by the left and right unit laws. They state that &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; doesn't perform any computation, it just collects values. For instance,

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    maternalGrandfather p = do
            mom &lt;- mother p
            gf  &lt;- father mom
            return gf
&lt;/source&gt;

is exactly the same as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    maternalGrandfather p = do
            mom  &lt;- mother p
            father mom
&lt;/source&gt;

by virtue of the right unit law.

=== Associativity of bind ===
The law of associativity makes sure that (like the semicolon) the bind operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; only cares about the order of computations, not about their nesting; e.g. we could have written &lt;code&gt;bothGrandfathers&lt;/code&gt; like this (compare with our earliest version without &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    bothGrandfathers p =
       (father p &gt;&gt;= father) &gt;&gt;=
           (\gf1 -&gt; (mother p &gt;&gt;= father) &gt;&gt;=
               (\gf2 -&gt; return (gf1,gf2) ))
&lt;/source&gt;

The associativity of the ''then'' operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is a special case:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
   (m &gt;&gt; n) &gt;&gt; o  =  m &gt;&gt; (n &gt;&gt; o)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Monadic composition ====

It is easier to picture the associativity of bind by recasting the law as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
   (f &gt;=&gt; g) &gt;=&gt; h  =  f &gt;=&gt; (g &gt;=&gt; h)
&lt;/source&gt;

where '''&lt;code&gt;(&gt;=&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is the monad composition operator''', a close analogue of the function composition operator &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;, only with flipped arguments. It is defined as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
   (&gt;=&gt;) :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; a -&gt; m c
   f &gt;=&gt; g = \x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also flip monad composition to go the other direction using &lt;code&gt;(&lt;=&lt;)&lt;/code&gt;. The operation order of &lt;code&gt;(f . g)&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;(f' &lt;=&lt; g')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the functions in regular function composition are non-monadic functions whereas monadic composition takes only monadic functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monads and Category Theory ==
Monads originally come from a branch of mathematics called [[wikipedia:Category_theory|Category Theory]]. Fortunately, it is entirely unnecessary to understand category theory in order to understand and use monads in Haskell. The definition of monads in Category Theory actually uses a slightly different presentation. Translated into Haskell, this presentation gives an alternative yet equivalent definition of a monad which can give us some additional insight.&lt;ref&gt;Deep into the Advanced Track, we will cover the theoretical side of the story in the [[Haskell/Category theory#Monads|chapter on Category Theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, we have defined monads in terms of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;. The alternative definition, instead, starts with monads as functors with two additional combinators:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    fmap   :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; M a -&gt; M b  -- functor

    return :: a -&gt; M a
    join   :: M (M a) -&gt; M a
&lt;/source&gt;

(Reminder: as discussed in the [[Haskell/The Functor class|chapter on the functor class]], a functor &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as container, so that &lt;code&gt;M a&lt;/code&gt; &quot;contains&quot; values of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, with a corresponding mapping function, i.e. &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, that allows functions to be applied to values inside it.)

Under this interpretation, the functions behave as follows:
* &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; applies a given function to every element in a container
* &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; packages an element into a container,
* &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; takes a container of containers and flattens it into a single container.

With these functions, the bind combinator can be defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    m &gt;&gt;= g = join (fmap g m)
&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise, we could give a definition of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; in terms of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    fmap f x = x &gt;&gt;= (return . f)
    join x   = x &gt;&gt;= id
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Is my Monad a Functor? ===

At this point we might, with good reason, conclude that all monads are by definition functors as well. That is indeed the case, both according to category theory and when programming in Haskell. When we presented the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; methods just above, we omitted the following class constraint:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    class Applicative m =&gt; Monad m where
        -- etc.
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; is an important class on its own merits, and we will study it at length soon. For now, all you need to know about it is that it inherits from &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;, and therefore so does &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; &lt;ref&gt;This important superclass relation was, thanks to historic accidents, only implemented quite recently (early 2015) in GHC (version 7.10). If you are using an older GHC version you might find the class constraint isn't there.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A final observation is that &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/code&gt; defines &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt;, a function with a strangely familiar type signature...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
    liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a1 -&gt; r) -&gt; m a1 -&gt; m r
&lt;/source&gt;

As you might suspect, &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; is merely &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; implemented with &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, just as we have done above. For a properly implemented monad with a matching &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; (that is, any ''sensible'' monad) &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; are interchangeable.

{{body note|1=
While following the next few chapters, you will likely want to write instances of &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; and try them out, be it to run the examples in the book or to do other experiments you might think of. However, &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; being a superclass of &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; means that implementing &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; requires providing &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; instances as well. At this point of the book, that would be somewhat of an annoyance, especially given that we have not discussed &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; yet! As a workaround, once you have written the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; instance you can use the functions in &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/code&gt; to fill in the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; implementations, as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Functor Foo where
    fmap = liftM

instance Applicative Foo where
    pure = return
    (&lt;*&gt;) = ap
&lt;/source&gt;

We will find out what &lt;code&gt;pure&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(&lt;*&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; are in due course.

There is no need to do so right now, but if you are curious about what &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; is you might want to have a brief look at the [[Haskell/Applicative functors|chapter about it]]. For the moment, stick to the first few sections (&quot;Functor recap&quot;, &quot;Application in functors&quot; and &quot;The Applicative class&quot;), as what follows builds on the chapters about monads we are going to go through now.

* [[/Nuclear waste/]] - archives from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell/Understanding_monads&amp;oldid=933545 before the great rewrite] (see especially the last thread) 2007-08-03

== Rewrite of the page? ==
A complete rewrite of the page seems to have been initiated today. I think it's a shame, since the original version with the nuclear waste metaphor was by far the best tutorial I've ever seen.
Since I couldn't find any discussion of this huge change anywhere, I've reverted [[User:Apfelmus|Apfelmus]]'s changes. --[[User:Nattfodd|Nattfodd]] 14:00, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks, Natt.  The discussion (confusingly) took place on [[/Nuclear waste/#Unhappy customers]].  The problem with the original version is that it gives only a superficial understanding of monads and doesn't help the reader to really &quot;get&quot; the point (I say this because I am guilty for most of it).  Reverting your revert.  Apfelmus is a well trusted member of this community.  He understands the strengths of the original version and will likely find a way to preserve them whilst overcoming the major shortcomings :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:07, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

::No the metaphor is great! I watched the WIP page, like, &quot;monad is a triplet of (M, return, &gt;==) where they satisfy ''laws'' 1, 2 and 3&quot; etc etc. I couldn't get it after staring at it for ten seconds. I'm generally opposed to the &quot;Yankee textbook&quot; style where everything is explained thrice really down-bowing like to a retard monkey, but the other extreme '''only''' works if you've got a live instructor. This book's value as a self-study material benefits hugely from such witty and well-written metaphors as in this article! --[[User:Sigmundur|Sigmundur]] ([[User talk:Sigmundur|talk]]) 18:01, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

:::Well, staring at a definition usually doesn't work, the intention was that the reader reads on :-).
:::The dilemma is the following: if there's no clear definition, some people complain that &quot;monad&quot; is just a buzzword (like &quot;cloud computing&quot; etc.). If there's a metaphor, some people complain that don't see the wood for the metaphorical trees anymore, especially if the metaphor is stretched beyond its limits. If it starts with explaining that &lt;code&gt;IO a&lt;/code&gt; is an &quot;action that calculates a value &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (that's how the SPJ's &quot;awkward squad&quot; paper does it and which worked for me), some people complain that this is too abstract either. Hm, now what to do? :-)

== Section &quot;Motivation&quot; ==
Thanks for taking up on this somewhat stalled text.

A motivating example is a good idea, but it can easily become a demotivating example if it's too complicated/confusing. I think the core idea of &lt;code&gt;safeSqrt&lt;/code&gt; is reasonably clear, but the cursory remarks, for instance about &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &quot;openness&quot; are too much.

Moreover, I'd certainly avoid saying that monads are &quot;relatively difficult&quot;, for they are not, or rather, should not be by virtue of this text.

== Chapter notes and TODOs ==
=== Topics TODO ===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Explain monadic parser combinators! But in another chapter.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
The basic triad &quot;rock, scissors, paper&quot; err, &quot;reader, writer, state&quot; is best introduced in another chapter, maybe entitled &quot;A Zoo of Monads&quot;. Reader must include the famous function &lt;code&gt;[(a-&gt;b)] -&gt; a -&gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt; also known as &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt;!
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;Random a&lt;/code&gt; is too cute to not elaborate it further to probabilistic functional programming. The Monty Hall problem can be solved with that. Key: the implementation can be changed, it effectively becomes the Set-Monad then. Extension: &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; and backtracking.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Exceptions are a nice way to explain monads, too. See also [http://programming.reddit.com/info/64th1/comments/c02u9mb].
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The assertion is that everyone has to discover the abstraction and a suitable metaphor himself, by working through examples. Presenting a metaphor upfront is no use.

=== Obsolete notes ===
Move the italic inline notes here when no longer necessary.
==== What is a monad? ====
&lt;i&gt;We're bold and present the exact definition of &quot;monad&quot;. This should (hopefully) prevent common confusion about the definition and remove the buzzword status. Of course, this paragraph has to be really short since it doesn't explain why I should care about monads at all or what the intuition behind bind and return is.&lt;/i&gt;
==== Stateful Computations ====
&lt;i&gt;Example state monads, i.e. particular state types. One of them is to be treated before/in parallel to &lt;code&gt;IO a&lt;/code&gt;. The others may be useful for exercises!
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;random numbers. Drawbacks: &lt;math&gt;\gg&lt;/math&gt; is meaningless, using an infinite list of random numbers is a better abstraction. Highlights: the state is more an implementation detail than of individual importance, this makes explanation easier!
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;name-supply. Task: label all leaves in a tree from 1 to n.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data.Map for depth first search in a graph.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SOE, chapter 19: interactive robot language. Nice example monad to program in. But not a good example for implementation.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Of course, the problem with an example is that we need to explain the example use case before plunging into &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;. But it's probably worth it. Huh, it turns out that we even have to explain the &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; (a,s)&lt;/code&gt; pattern for threading state. Seems that random numbers are easiest to explain.
&lt;/i&gt;

== Materials ==
=== Monad zoo ===
Just to point out that shapr's girlfriend had some amusing illustrations of monads... might be useful for an eventual Monad Zoo chapter -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:07, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

: Marvelous, there more amusement, the better ;-) I intend the &quot;Monad Zoo&quot; chapter to take the role of [[Haskell/Advanced monads]]. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 17:11, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

=== Need Images? ===
I could draw up some preliminary figures/images if you'd like.  I'm not familiar with Haskell, but if I can contribute while I learn... why not? :)

[[Image:monad_state_random1.jpg]]

[[Image:monad_state_random2.jpg]]

These images correspond to the first monad example, a random number generator.

:Oh, thank you! I had something along the lines of the diagrams in the [http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/ awkward squad paper] in mind, though, i.e. something like [[Image:MonadState sumTwoDice.png]]. This demonstrates how &lt;code&gt;sumTwoDice&lt;/code&gt; is composed of two successive &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt;. [[:Image:monad_state_random2.jpg]] somehow misses this point :-) I'm not sure wether rectangular boxes are the way to go though, your colorful circles make me thinking.

=== Changes from 20 April 2010 ===
A helpful contributor has made some changes, recorded here: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell%2FUnderstanding_monads&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1761620&amp;oldid=1733846 Revision 1761620 compared to 1733846].

Unfortunately, I think they tend to confuse matters more than they enlighten and I chose to undo them. They are modeled on the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monads_as_Containers Monads as Containers] tutorial, but this approach is very different from the one taken here and they don't mix very well. How about putting them in an extra section?

I do agree that &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; viewpoint should be explained somewhere as well.

== Questions and Suggestions ==
=== Prelude and &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ===
We should show a way to hide &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and the other monad functions while importing the Prelude.

-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 06:55, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

=== How to combine Actions with a function? ===
For example,I write a function to get the nth fibonacci number.
&lt;pre&gt;
fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + (fib (n-2))
&lt;/pre&gt;
And it takes long time to get the 1000th number.So I want to show the progress.When it get the 100th,200th,300th,... number,the console print 1,2,3,....How to do this? Must I modify my function or I can make a wrapper of it.

: For debugging, you can use {{Haskell lib|Debug|Trace}} to show intermediate results.
:In general, you have to change your function to &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; something.
 fib n = print n &gt;&gt; case n of
   0 -&gt; return 1
   1 -&gt; return 1
   n -&gt; liftM2 (+) (fib (n-1)) (fib (n-2))  
: Note that your algorithm needs exponential time! I estimate that &lt;code&gt;fib 1000&lt;/code&gt; will take  around &lt;math&gt;10^{190}&lt;/math&gt; years. For better algorithms, see also [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Fibonacci_sequence The Fibonacci sequence] on the Haskell Wiki.
: The [http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe Haskell Cafe Mailinglist] is probably better for asking Haskell questions than the wikibook.

=== Nomenclature: use of f as a monadic value ===
In the introductory set of three equations, and throughout, you use x for a value, and f,g,h for either monadic values, or functions. I would use either x, m or a for a monadic variable. i.e.

f &gt;&gt;= return == f

becomes:

a &gt;&gt;= return == a

f is strongly associated with function names.
-- Neil Mitchell/ndm

: Good point! How do others do it? SPJ in &quot;Tackling the awkwards squad&quot; says 

 return x &gt;&gt;= f = f x
 m &gt;&gt;= return = m
 m1 &gt;&gt;= (λx.m2 &gt;&gt;= (λy.m3)) = (m1 &gt;&gt;= (λx.m2)) &gt;&gt;= (λy.m3)

with the condition that x is not free in m3. Wadler in &quot;Monads for functional programming&quot; essentially says

 return a &gt;&gt;= λb.n = n[a/b]
 m &gt;&gt;= λa.return a = m
 m &gt;&gt;= (λa.n &gt;&gt;= λb.o)) = (m &gt;&gt;= λa.n) &gt;&gt;= λb.o

but uses &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;return&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;.

In my own Haskell code, I always use m for monadic values and g,h for functions that return monadic values. That means

 return x &gt;&gt;= g = g x
 m &gt;&gt;= return = m
 (m &gt;&gt;= g) &gt;&gt;= h = m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; g x &gt;&gt;= h)

Hm, do I really do that? Oh, dear. I guess just using m for monadic values and f,g for the functions is probably best. Hm, but the other versions of the associative law are more associative.

=== Trouble with currying ===
I'm not confident enough in my Haskell knowledge to outright correct this, but something looks wrong to me.  In the section [[Haskell/Understanding monads#Threading_the_State_with_bind|Threading the State with bind]], the definition of &gt;&gt; is:

&lt;pre&gt;
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Seed -&gt; (a,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed))
(&gt;&gt;) f g seed0 = 
  let (result1, seed1) = f seed0
      (result2, seed2) = g seed1
  in (result2, seed2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It looks like the type signature and definition disagree.  In particular, the signature indicates that &gt;&gt; produces a function.  However, the definition seems to produce a pair (b, Seed).  On the other hand, this might just be Haskell magic.  --[[User:Bytecrafter|Bytecrafter]] 22:00, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

:Even more strangely, &gt;&gt; takes three parameters instead of two... Don't worry, this is just [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Currying Currying] :-) For instance, we may say that (+) is a function that takes one parameter and returns a function, i.e. &lt;code&gt;(+) :: Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Int)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(3 +) :: Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt; but we may also think of (+) as taking two parameters.
:The definition of &gt;&gt; is similar. Hm, maybe it's better to write
:&lt;code&gt; f &gt;&gt; g = \seed0 -&gt; let ... in (result2,seed2)&lt;/code&gt;,
:but the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; spans multiple lines, so I'm not sure whether this helps. 
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 12:00, 12 November 2007 (UTC)

::OK, I wasn't sure if that was going on or not.  I've only ever seen currying in the invocation of functions, not the definition.  Does that imply that the following type signatures are equivalent?
::
&lt;pre&gt;
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Seed -&gt; (a,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed))
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Seed -&gt; (a,Seed)) -&gt; (Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)) -&gt; Seed -&gt; (b,Seed)
&lt;/pre&gt;
::: Yes, exactly. -&gt; is ''right-associative'', i.e. &lt;code&gt;A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D&lt;/code&gt; is parsed as &lt;code&gt;A -&gt; (B -&gt; (C -&gt; D))&lt;/code&gt;.
::I'm sorry to spam up this discussion page (clearly these questions belong on the currying page), but let me share my impressions.  As a reader, I came to this page out of order.  I know a bit about functional programming, but I only know enough Haskell to be able to read it.  I can't really write it.  However, I was very interested to learn more about Monads, since the little that I did know led me to believe that they were magical and cool.
::: No problem, I mean, &quot;out of order&quot; is to the default on the Internet :-) so the/any article should facilitate that. Hm, having an explicit dependency graph for the chapters would be ideal.
::  I had expected to see that (&gt;&gt;) would return a function, and was a bit surprised to see that the definition didn't seem to match the type signature.  There are probably other readers in similar situations.  It might make sense to get the type signature and the function definition to agree.
::: I changed some definitions, better that way?
::To counterbalance my criticism, let me also say that this is the single best Monad discussion that I have seen so far.  I appreciate the work that people have put into it, and my comments are only intended to help make the article even better!  --[[User:Bytecrafter|Bytecrafter]] 01:28, 13 November 2007 (UTC)
::: Yes, thanks for your comments! Moreover, there doesn't seem to be an explanation of currying in the wikibook (!? I suppose it's intended to be in [[Haskell/Higher-order_functions_and_Currying]], hm even a bit late for my taste), your remarks brought to light that it's rather absent.

=== &quot;What is a monad&quot; missing something? ===
&lt;i&gt;A ''monad'' is a &quot;thing&quot; that can plug into the monadic plumbing system.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Think of an internet enabled appliance.  What does that mean?  It means a &quot;thing&quot; that can plug into the internet.  But the internet is basically just a giant router.  The functionality all depends on what's plugged in.  If no one ever showed you a web browser or a chat client, then you would probably have no idea what the internet is.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Nevertheless, we can ''define'' what a monad is, without giving even the slightest hint of what a monad is good for.&lt;/i&gt;

:Moved Oddron's addition here because IMHO they don't fit. But they're not without point, what do you want to express, Oddron? What bugs you about the current version?
:The section intentionally does not give an explananation of what monads are good for in order to avoid making it sound like a buzzword.
:Strictly speaking, there is no &quot;monadic pumbling system&quot;. I don't like the internet example, though it does have the good point that there are many very different monads, i.e. that &quot;monad&quot; itself is a rather bare-bones concept.

=== Confused by type definition given for Map?===
&lt;pre&gt;map :: a -&gt; b -&gt; M a -&gt; M b&lt;/pre&gt;
I'm new to Wikibooks, and haven't the foggiest about monads yet. Appologies if my understanding is wrong but if it's intuitively like map then shouldn't the only difference should be in what the function operates on and what's returned. ie more like
&lt;pre&gt;map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; M a -&gt; M b&lt;/pre&gt;

::Thanks for clearing that up. Wasn't sure if it were a deliberate error or not. It's quite reassuraning that I have learnt something from previous sections of this wikibook.

=== Recent expansion of section &quot;Definition&quot; ===
Blaisorblade, I don't agree that your elaboration on the definition is a good idea. My intention was to keep it extremely short and jump right into the example. I think that someone who doesn't know what a monad is yet won't understand the additional remarks, but still waste a lot of time trying to understand them. He is better served by doing the example first and inferring his own intuition from that.

:I'm in total agreement with Apfelmus: the &quot;cut to the chase&quot; approach of the older versions of this chapter was a key factor in its effectiveness (not that my subjective POV counts much, but I speak as someone who actually learnt monads as a complete newbie starting from this article).

== Category Theory ==

Hey, I changed the intro to the Category Theory section so as not to imply that the join/map/return presentation of monads is exactly the categorical definition.  It's not. For one, Haskell is not Category Theory; it just has some operations based on concepts from C.T.  For another, Haskell monads actually correspond to so-called &quot;strong monads&quot; in C.T.  The difference is that, in a strong monad's version of bind, extra information is passed into the function passed to bind.  This corresponds exactly to the existing scope in Haskell.  In Haskell, a function passed to bind is closed over the existing scope, and so has access to all variables already in scope, as well as the bound variable.  In a categorical strong monad, this is done with a product; in Haskell, it is done with closures and scope.  (I am mkehrt on WP; I don't exist on WB).

== Broken Link ==

Link to Haskell/Understanding monads/Error is broken as it seems that section no longer exists. This should be replaced with an appropriate link, or removed.

== imperative stuff is confusing me ==

This section:

:Under this interpretation, the bind operator &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; is simply a function version of the semicolon. Just like a :&lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; expression can be written as a function application,
:
:    let x  = foo in bar     corresponds to      (\x -&gt; bar) foo
:
:an assignment and semicolon can be written as the bind operator:
:
:        x &lt;- foo;   bar     corresponds to      foo &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; bar)
:
:The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function lifts a value &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to a full-fledged statement &lt;code&gt;M a&lt;/code&gt; of the imperative language.
:
… this isn't making sense to me. let x  = foo in bar ? This is too abstract. Is the x being used? Is it ever usable in the future? Or is this just a throwaway thing? And the last part &quot;of the imperative language&quot; is baffling. What is this imperative language we are referring to? Should it be &quot;of *an* imperative language&quot; ?? None of this is very clear or helpful in my case.
[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 18:22, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:The let examples were, in a precise sense, pseudo-Haskell. &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; wasn't actually a Haskell expression, but a placeholder for an expression which might use &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (or not, though if it didn't the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; would be superfluous). It could be &lt;code&gt;x + 3&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;&quot;Pineapple&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. I agree it was unnecessarily abstract, so I made the example concrete.

:As for the passage about &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, it is really &quot;''the'' imperative language&quot;; that is, the imperative language implemented by the monad &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; you happen to choose. I changed the sentence to make that explicit. Does it help?--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 02:33, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

== Add amazing link? ==

[https://mvanier.livejournal.com/3917.html Yet Another Monad Tutorial] is by ''far'' the best thorough explanation out there, skipping all the nonsense. I think we should either provide a &quot;more reading&quot; link to it or otherwise use it as a model for improving the Wikibook.

:It is a good tutorial indeed. The approach is also quite close to what we are trying to do here, except that the pace is much slower, and the exposition more meticulous. Do you think the link would fit better here or with the broader set of tutorials linked from the front page?--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 03:19, 10 June 2014 (UTC)

== Handling the Applicative-Monad proposal ==

I have just made the absolute minimal changes needed for this chapter to comply with GHC 7.10 and the AMP. No attempt is made to discuss &lt;code&gt;Applicative&lt;/code&gt; here, or even to link to the (freshly updated) [[../Applicative functors]] chapter. I see that as possibly more than a temporary solution - IMO it is not necessary to discuss applicatives before monads, and that there are pros and cons with either approach. In any case, a curious reader at this point of the book should be able to do a quick visit to the chapter about applicatives and understand at least the first three sections, so that she sees what the passing mention was about.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Object is the base class of all other classes created in Ruby.  It provides the basic set of functions available to all classes, and each function can be explicitly overridden by the user.

This class provides a number of useful methods for all of the classes in Ruby.

Object inherits from [[BasicObject]] which allows creating alternate object hierarchies. Methods on object are available to all classes unless explicitly overridden.

In Ruby, everything is an Object including classes and modules. Object and BasicObject are the most low-level [[class]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Pure Abstract Classes ====
An abstract class is one in which there is a declaration but no definition for a member function. The way this concept is expressed in C++ is to have the member function declaration assigned to zero.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class PureAbstractClass 
{
public:
  virtual void AbstractMemberFunction() = 0;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

A pure Abstract class has only abstract member functions and no data or concrete member functions. In general, a pure abstract class is used to define an interface and is intended to be inherited by concrete classes. It's a way of forcing a contract between the class designer and the users of that class. The users of this class must declare a matching member function for the class to compile.

; Example of usage for a pure Abstract Class:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class DrawableObject 
 {
  public:
    virtual void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const = 0; //draw to GraphicalDrawingBoard
 };

 class Triangle : public DrawableObject
 {
 public:
   void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const; //draw a triangle
 };

 class Rectangle : public DrawableObject
 {
 public:
   void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const; //draw a rectangle
 };

 class Circle : public DrawableObject
 {
 public:
   void Draw(GraphicalDrawingBoard&amp;) const; //draw a circle
 };

 typedef std::list&lt;DrawableObject*&gt; DrawableList;

 DrawableList drawableList;
 GraphicalDrawingBoard drawingBoard;

 drawableList.pushback(new Triangle());
 drawableList.pushback(new Rectangle());
 drawableList.pushback(new Circle());

 for(DrawableList::const_iterator iter = drawableList.begin(), 
    endIter = drawableList.end();
    iter != endIter;
    ++iter)
 { 
   DrawableObject *object = *iter;
   object-&gt;Draw(drawingBoard);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that this is a bit of a contrived example and that the drawable objects are not fully defined (no constructors or data) but it should give you the general idea of the power of defining an interface. Once the objects are constructed, the code that calls the interface does not know any of the implementation details of the called objects, only that of the interface. The object ''GraphicalDrawingBoard'' is a placeholder meant to represent the thing onto which the object will be drawn, i.e. the video memory, drawing buffer, printer.

Note that there is a great temptation to add concrete member functions and data to pure abstract base classes. This must be resisted, in general it is a sign that the interface is not well factored. Data and concrete member functions tend to imply a particular implementation and as such can inherit from the interface but should not be that interface. Instead if there is some commonality between concrete classes, creation of abstract class which inherits its interface from the pure abstract class and defines the common data and member functions of the concrete classes works well. Some care should be taken to decide whether inheritance or aggregation should be used. Too many layers of inheritance can make the maintenance and usage of a class difficult. Generally, the maximum accepted layers of inheritance is about 3, above that and refactoring of the classes is generally called for. A general test is the &quot;is a&quot; vs &quot;has a&quot;, as in a Square is a Rectangle, but a Square has a set of sides.

We've noticed your [[School of Magic:Optional Subjects|optional subjects]]. Maybe you would like to write something about yourself on your user page: [[User:Tommy Irianto]]. Thank you for joining the Wikiversity's School of Magic. Welcome again! --[[User:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|George D. Bozovic]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Ђорђе Д.

Hi there, Tommy! You know, I must admit, you've asked a really good question at the Classroom. :) In deed, how come there's no lessons?! Well, I must tell you, our School is at the very beginning of its existence. The Wikiversity's School of Magic was founded just a couple of months ago. However, by every day it's becoming bigger and more developed. Because we, its users, help it, of course. ;) This is [[w:wiki|a wiki]] school, which means that anyone is free to edit pages. You can edit all of the pages by yourself. If you wish, you can even make a lesson by yourself! However, I don't recommend that to you yet, since there should be at least some primar lessons made by [[School of Magic:School Board|the official professors]], before the others could make theirs. But don't be worry! We are writing the lessons every day, and very, very soon the lessons will be available. At this moment we have provided only the Lesson 1, which is the most important lesson, don't you think? You can see it [[School of Magic:About the Magic|here]]. And while you're taking your Lesson 1, the Lesson 2 will be ready for you. ;) I shall inform you by myself on this page if that's all right with you. (By the way, hope seeing you at my class soon! ;)) --[[User:Twinkling Wizard|Twinkling Wizard]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Twinkling Wizard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:52, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
:Hello, Tommy. When you take your Lesson 1, you may take the Lesson 2 - [[School of Magic:Magic in the Prehistory|here]] it is. I shall also inform you about the Lesson 3. --[[User:Twinkling Wizard|Twinkling Wizard]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Twinkling Wizard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:25, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Tommy Irianto. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Tommy Irianto~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Particle engines generally have very good performance because of the high velocity of the particles.  The high velocity also requires a lot of energy, since particle kinetic energy goes as the square of the velocity.

{{TOC right}}

===A. Particle Rockets=== 

Particle rockets are distinguished by emitting particles from an internal source, while the next section, External Particle Interactions, covers methods that employ particles in the environment, either natural or man-made.


====54 Pulsed Fission Nuclear Thruster==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Orion 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Nuclear Detonation

'''Description:''' A series of small atomic bombs yield debris/particles which push against a plate/shock absorber arrangement. The shock absorber evens out the explosion pulses to a steady acceleration for the vehicle.  Issues with this method are not so much technical feasibility as risks of using it near Earth and having a shipload of nuclear weapons, not to mention the radiation levels for crew and cargo.  Benefits are the enormous potential payload and high acceleration.  A possible application is moving dangerous asteroids.  That would not take very many bombs, and the pusher plate/shock absorber could be made from asteroidal metals, even from the asteroid you are moving.  

Other applications might involve moving large amounts of material in the outer Solar System, or starting interstellar trips.  Far away from Earth the issue of radiation added to the environment is not as significant, since solar and cosmic radiation are already present in large amounts.

'''Status:'''  Atomic bombs are well tested (unfortunately).  A demonstration of the pusher plate technology was done in small scale with conventional explosives.

'''Variations:'''
:'''54a Antimatter Catalyzed Pulsed Nuclear''' - This speculative method uses antimatter triggered implosion of plutonium targets.  In theory this would lower the critical mass to ~ 2 grams significantly lowering the size threshold for pulsed nuclear.
:'''54b Implosion Driver Pulsed Nuclear''' - Standard fission bombs are triggered by a chemical implosion.  This method substitutes a laser, ion beam, or other external driver to collapse the fuel load.  It potentially reduces the critical mass with a stronger collapse than chemicals can achieve, or by using a different isotope.

'''References:'''


====55 Inertial Confinement Nuclear Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Microfusion Engine

'''Type:''' Atomic particles by Fission or Fusion Reactor

'''Description:''' There are two major methods being pursued for fusion power.  Magnetic confinement holds a hot plasma in a more or less steady state long enough for fusion reactions to produce net power.  Inertial methods use lasers or particle beams to compress a fuel pellet to high pressure and temperature such that the fusion reaction happens very fast, after which it rapidly expands.  Both methods can be applied to space propulsion.  Magnetic confinement was addressed at '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Ion_and_Plasma_Engines#52_Fusion_Heated_Plasma_Engine Fusion Heated Plasma Engine]''', and this method addresses Inertial confinement.

A fuel pellet consists of a fusion core material, such as a Deuterium/Tritium mix, surrounded by a liner to optimally absorb the laser or particle beam energy.  Optionally a fission shell surrounds the fusion core. This is similar to the arrangement of a fusion atomic bomb. Alternately particle beams can consist of fissionable heavy ions or fusible light element ions, or even highly accelerated solid pellets of inert or reactive fuels.  The end result in all cases is a rapidly expanding cloud of highly energetic particles.  These are directed by a shaped magnetic field or pusher plate to produce thrust.  Thrust can be varied by how often you generate the explosions.

'''Status:''' Inertial confinement fusion is being researched for power generation.  A chemical implosion is also the method by which most nuclear bombs are set off. 

'''Variations:''' Multiple variations are possible by combining:

* Compression sources: laser, particle/ion beams, or solid pellets, 
* Type of central target: none in the case of colliding pellets, fission and/or fusion fuel ingredients, 
* Type of pellet liner: none or what material, and 
* Thrust method: physical or magnetic nozzle 

'''References:''' 


====56 Alpha Particle Emitter==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Radioactive Decay

'''Description:''' A radioactive element coats one side of a thin sheet which is capable of absorbing alpha particles. The particles emitted into the sheet are absorbed, while the particles emitted in the opposite direction escape, providing net thrust. Advantages are this is a simple device, and heating of the sheet can produce power as a side effect via thermoelectric or heat engine.  Disadvantages are low thrust, and you cannot turn off radioactivity.  You would have to close two plates so they face each other to neutralize thrust, and open them like a book to turn the thrust on.

'''Status:''' Alpha emitters are well known.  Using them for propulsion is theoretical so far. 

'''Variations:''' Choice of radioactive material allows a wide range thrust levels.

'''References:''' 


====57 Fission Fragment Engine====

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Fission Reactor

'''Description:''' Thin wires containing fissionable material are arranged to allow the nuclear fragments from the fission to escape. They are allowed to decay naturally for low thrust devices, or arranged in a nuclear critical arrangement for high thrust.  The fragments are aimed by electrostatic or electromagnetic fields to mostly go out the back end of the thruster. The performance is very high because of the high speed of the fragments.  The fission decay tends to damage whatever the wires are made of, so provision for replacing or reforming the wires would be needed for long term use. 

'''Status:''' Currently theoretical only.

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:'''

====58 Pure Fusion Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Atomic Particles by Fusion Reactor

'''Description:''' Various thermonuclear fusion reactors have been proposed.  The results of a fusion reaction are high energy particles which can, in principle, be harnessed for propulsion.  This differs from 52 Fusion Heated Plasma Engine in that no additional fuel is added beyond the fusion reactants. Instead the high temperature plasma or escaping charged particles are used directly as rocket exhaust. Since a break even fusion reaction has not been achieved as of yet, this remains a theoretical concept. 

The actual method of containing the fusion plasma will influence the design of the rocket and its feasibility, in particular the mass of the device. A tokamak or stellarator plasma containment device would present the largest problems in siphoning off plasma for propulsion and their large weight would lead to an uninspiring thrust to mass ratio. Inertial confinement fusion using high power lasers or x-rays on small targets would probably be easier to build into a propulsion device, however the enormous size of the lasers and x-ray generators of current internal fusion projects would lead to the same problem with the thrust to mass ratio.

'''Status:''' Significant research is in progress for fusion in general.  Applications to space propulsion are theoretical. Besides the large funding for magnetic and inertial confinement fusion, there are several alternate approaches that have lower funding levels.

'''Variations:''' 

:* '''58a Magnetic Confinement''' - Plasma in a chamber similar to a tokamak fusion power reactor is intentionally leaked to a magnetic nozzle. 
:* '''58b Inertial Confinement''' - The fuel pellet is heated and compressed by lasers, electron beam, or ion beam. After fusing, the resulting plasma is directed by a magnetic nozzle.
:* '''58c Electrostatic Confinement''' - The fusion fuel is confined by a spherical potential well of order 100 kV. When the fuel reacts, the particles are ejected with energy of order 2 MeV, so escape the potential well. The potential well is at the focus of a paraboloidal shell, which reflects the fusion particles to the rear in a narrow beam (20-30 degree width).
:* '''58d Plasma Mantle Confinement''' - The fusion fuel is contained in a toroidal/poloidal current pattern, similar to a Tokamak except all the currents are in the plasma. The current pattern is surrounded by a plasma sheath which isolates the fuel from a surrounding working fluid. The fluid provides mechanical compression, which heats the fuel to fusion ignition. After the fuel burn is completed, the energy generated heats the working fluid to high temperature, which then goes out a nozzle producing thrust.
:* '''58e Dense Plasma Focus''' - A high current discharge in a radial arrangement causes the plasma to collapse to high temperature and pressure.  This is being developed by '''[http://www.lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/ Lawrenceville Plasma Physics]''' in Middlesex, New Jersey.  This device has a reported fusion energy of 0.044 Joules vs capacitor energy of 50 kJoules.  The output vs input energy ratio is a measure of how close the device is to practical operation.

'''''Abstract:''''' Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion systems, with propulsion thrust- power-input-power ratio (the thrust-power &quot;gain&quot; G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are always quite small (e.g., G(t)&lt;0.8). With these, &quot;high-thrust&quot; interplanetary flight is not possible, because system acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer &quot;high-thrust&quot; flight capability. One performance example shows a 53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in Earth/moon space.)

'''''This note is 20 years old and needs updating:''''' Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKª innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. (I strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently declared Koloc's PLASMAKª precursor, the spheromak, to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the PLASMAKª looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery)

====59 Neutral Particle Beam Thruster==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A high energy (order 50 MeV) particle accelerator generates a proton beam. This beam is neutralized (combined with electrons to make neutral atoms), then ejected. The exhaust is moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, so performance is very high. This type of machine was explored under the US missile defense program as a way of destroying missiles (with the beam). The energy required for space propulsion with this method exceeds the energy available from nuclear fusion, so it only makes sense with antimatter or external power sources such as a laser.

'''Status:'''  Particle accelerators of this energy have existed since the mid-20th century.  What limits this method is lack of a power supply, so it remains untested. 

'''Variations:'''

* '''59a Near Lightspeed Probe''' - If the particle accelerator produces very high energy protons, such that relativistic mass increase is significant, and the power source is a very powerful laser located at the origin star, and focused using the star as a gravitational lens, the rocket equation no longer constrains the final velocity.  Velocities close to the speed of light would be possible, and stopping would be possible by pointing the accelerator in the opposite direction.  Acceleration in this case is limited by the power to mass ratio of the power conversion and particle accelerator hardware.

====60 Antimatter Annihilation==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' Atoms and anti-atoms (or their constituent particles) annihilate, producing pions, then muons, then gamma rays. The charged particles can be acted upon by a magnetic nozzle. The gamma rays can be absorbed by a container, and the resulting heat used to supply power. Antimatter provides the highest theoretical energy fuel (100% matter to energy conversion), although the overhead involved with storing antimatter may reduce the practical efficiency to a level comparable to other propulsion methods. 

'''Status:''' Small amounts of antimatter have been created and temporarily stored at particle accelerator labs.  At present, antimatter is not thought to exist naturally in large quantities.

===B. External Particle Interactions=== 


====61 Magsail==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' The magsail operates by placing a large superconducting loop in the solar wind or planetary ion stream. The current loop produces a magnetic field that deflects the ions, producing a reaction force.  Because of the large area covered by the loop, which is mostly empty, it can develop a relatively large force for a given mass.  It is limited in direction and strength by the local solar wind or ion flow. 

'''Status:''' Magnetic field interaction with an ion stream is well understood.  Practicality of this method depends on an efficient enough design.  Has not been tested as of 2012.

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 

 
====62 External Particle Beam==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A remote particle beam source aims it at a target vehicle. The particles are either absorbed or reflected to generate thrust directly, or their kinetic energy is used as a power source for some other type of propulsion.  The major issue is keeping the beam narrow enough to be a useful energy transfer method. 

'''Status:''' Untested as of 2012 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 


====63 Interstellar Ramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Bussard Ramjet 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A large funnel or inlet is used to compress interstellar gas, which is then fed to a fusion reactor for propulsion. Because of the low density of the interstellar medium, an extraordinarily large scoop is required to get any useful thrust. Performance is limited by the exhaust velocity of the fusion reaction to a few percent of the speed of light.  In other words, collecting the gas causes drag, and at the exhaust velocity of the reactor there will be no net thrust.  This makes the system an efficient decelerator by pointing the exhaust forward.  In that case the drag and reverse thrust both act to slow the vehicle.  Variable density of interstellar gas affects the viability of this method.  By running the reactor partly off of internal fuel, this type of vehicle can be brought to high enough velocity for the collector to start to function, and then to go to higher velocities.  By having the reactor use less fuel than collected, it can be self-refueling.

'''Status:''' Although the concept dates back to 1960, it is untested due to a lack of practical fusion reactors.

====64 Interstellar Scramjet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description''': Similar to the interstellar ramjet, the interstellar medium is compressed to fusion density and temperature. In this concept it is only compressed laterally, then re-expanded against a nozzle. Incredible vehicle sizes and lengths are required to reach fusion conditions, but since lateral compression does not cause as much drag as full compression, it is not limited by the exhaust velocity.  Thus speed may reach a substantial fraction of the speed of light. 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:'''


====65 External Fuel Supply====

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description''': Any propulsion system which stores all it's fuel at the start has an exponential fuel requirement as a function of velocity.  If added fuel is delivered by a particle or pellet stream, either from behind or positioned ahead, that exponential requirement is turned into a linear one.  This is because at each point the vehicle is only accelerating itself (plus a small amount of fuel), instead of the vehicle plus all the fuel for the entire mission.  In the latter case you are using fuel early to accelerate fuel for later, which causes the exponential overhead.

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' Lots of variations are possible in terms of what fuel is delivered, and if it is formed into a particle stream, discrete pellets, or container tanks of fuel.  Incidentally this can also be used for other types of supplies than fuel, but that belongs in the Engineering Methods section.

===Previous US Nuclear Rocket Program===

====Solid Core NTR Development====

McDonnell Douglas has a long association with nuclear propulsion, beginning with nuclear aircraft propulsion studies in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Haloulakos, V.E., et al|title=Nuclear Propulsion: Past, Present, and Future, Fifth Symposium on Space Nuclear Power Systems, Albuquerque 11-14 January 1988|pages=329-332}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Additional work includes NERVA nuclear vehicle interplanetary flight studies, and solid core vehicle integration studies under contract to NASA in the 1960s. In 1971 studies were conducted on a Shuttle-launched Nuclear Shuttle System, which used the PEEWEE reactor. 

In 1972 LANL undertook a study of a small nuclear engine using NERVA technology and based on the PEEWEE reactor design, that could be used in the newly designed NASA Space Shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bohl, R.J., and Boudreau, J.E.|title=Direct Nuclear Propulsion: A White Paper|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|date=January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This engine would have weighed 2,555 Kg, using composite UC-ZrC-C fuel, with other parameters including the following: 

* Total Operating Period hours 2 1 
* Operating Cycles 20 3 
* Specific Impulse seconds 860 875 
* Thrust kN 71.6 73.0 
* Hydrogen Flow kg/sec 8.5 8.5 
* Thermal Power MWt 354 367 

Various other NERVA-derived propulsion concepts were considered, and LANL evaluated a range of mission applications. For instance, it was concluded that a nuclear-propelled orbital transfer vehicle could significantly reduce propellant launch requirements, based on mission models that envisioned from 145 to 872 Orbital Transfer Vehicle flights. The authors concluded that developments in non-nuclear nozzle and turbo-pump technology in the Space Shuttle Main Engine program have enhanced the viability of NERVA derived engines. 

LANL mission analyses have identified significant reductions in Initial Mass in Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO) through the use of NERVA technology:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howe, Steven|title=Assessment of the Advantages and Feasibility of a Nuclear Rocket for a Manned Mars Mission, Manned Mars Mission Workshop|publisher=Marshall Space Flight Center|location=Huntsville, AL|date= 10-14 June 1985|id=Preprint LA-UR-85-2442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs of developing a flight-ready nuclear rocket was estimated to be $4-5 billion, which included the cost of rebuilding the 1960s NERVA capability, which was estimated to include:

This analysis also considered issues associated with testing, noting that: 

&quot;The major obstacle to testing at NTS will be the reduced levels of radioactive debris which are allowed to transport into the public domain. The levels are more stringent than those present during the NERVA program. The current exposure limits of 150 m Rem to civilian personnel may restrict the tests of the NTR to low power levels and mass flows in the reactor... A simple solution to this problem may be to utilize one of the Pacific Ocean Islands owned by the United States -- namely Johnston Island... (an) ecological desert of ocean surrounds the area due to the stagnation of the return of the Japanese current...&quot; 


'''ANL Cermet Program'''

From 1961 through 1967 Argonne National Laboratory conducted a development program for nuclear rocket fuel elements independently of the Rover/NERVA program.&lt;ref name=Horman&gt;{{cite book|author=Horman, F.J., et al|title=Particle Fuels Technology for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion, AIAA/NASA/OAI Conference on Advanced SEI Technologies|location=Cleveland, Ohio|date=4-6 September 1991|id=Paper AIAA 91-3457}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although no engines were fabricated or tested, extensive work was conducted on testing ceramic fuel configurations. Thermal shock tests suggested that these cermet fuels could have substantial tolerance to the effects of nuclear excursions. This program was terminated in 1967, prior to its completion.

'''Evaluation'''

Two major problems were identified during the Rover/NERVA program: 

Core disassembly due to vibration, accompanied by cracking of the fuel matrix and loss of material into the propellant flow; 

Loss of fuel matrix uranium and carbon due to coating erosion and cracking, and through diffusion through the coating. 


The first problem was resolved by changed designs which reduced vibration and matrix cracking. 

However, the second problem, of fuel element corrosion, proved less tractable:&lt;ref name=Horman/&gt;

&quot;Corrosion was most pronounced in the mid-range region, about a third of the distance from the cold end of the fuel element. Fuel operating temperatures were lower here than the fabrication temperatures, hence thermal stresses were higher than at the hot end. Also, the neutron flux was highest in this region...&quot; 

&quot;No fuel element geometry or fuel material ever totally solved the NERVA fuel element degradation problem. Mass loss of both uranium and carbon continued to limit service life by causing significant perturbation to core neutronics during the tests. Crack development in the fuel element coating was never completely eliminated.... Non-nuclear testing of coated fuel elements revealed an Arrhenius relationship between diffusion and temperature. For every 205 K increase in temperature (in the range 2400 to 2700 K), the mass loss increased by a factor of ten... resulting in loss of 20% of total uranium in approximately 5 hours of testing at 2870 K.&quot; 

A number of other program management lessons emerged from this period. One analysis notes that:&lt;ref name=Horman/&gt;

&quot;One overriding lesson from the NERVA program is that fuel and core development should not be tied simply to a series of engine tests which require expensive nuclear operation. Definitive techniques for fuel evaluation in loops or in non-nuclear heated devices should be developed early and used throughout the program...&quot;

====Solid Core NTR Tests====

The initial series of nuclear rocket tests was conducted by Los Alamos National Laboratory, under the KIWI program, which eventually cost $177 million (in then year dollars). 

Graphite was chosen as the internal structural material for these nuclear reactors for several reasons. It has excellent strength at high temperatures and its strength actually increases at higher temperatures. In addition, in contrast to metals which are strong neutron absorbers, graphite acts as a moderator, reducing the amount of enriched uranium required in the core. The great disadvantage of graphite, however, is that it quickly erodes in the presence of hot hydrogen. While this erosion cannot be eliminated, techniques are available to reduce erosion to acceptable levels over the operating lifetime of the reactor, which is measured in minutes to hours. 

Westinghouse was the prime contractor for the reactor component of the NERVA program, while Aerojet was the contractor for engine elements such as pumps and nozzles. The NERVA program resulted in an investment of $662 million (then-year dollars) for development and testing of flight engine prototypes.&lt;ref name=Horman&gt;{{cite book|author=Horman, F.J., et al|title=Particle Fuels Technology for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion, AIAA/NASA/OAI Conference on Advanced SEI Technologies|location=Cleveland, Ohio|date=4-6 September 1991|id=Paper AIAA 91-3457}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first nuclear rocket test, conducted in July 1959, used uncoated UO2 plates as fuel elements. This test reached a maximum temperature of 2683 K and a power level of 70 MWt. Vibrations during operations produced significant structural damage in the reactor core. 

The first nuclear reactor tested, KIWI-A, successfully demonstrated the principle of nuclear rockets, but it used unclad fuel plates that were not representative of later tests. 

;KIWI A test :  This test, conducted in July 1959, incorporated significant modifications in the core design used in KIWI A. The fuel consisted of short cylindrical Uranium Oxide elements in graphite modules, with four axial channels coated with Niobium Carbide using chemical vapor deposition. The reactor ran for 6 minutes at power levels as high as 85 MWt. 

; KIWI-A prime : tested in 1960, replaced the fuel plates with NbC plated graphite modules with 4 micron diameter UO2 particles embedded in the graphite matrix. However, some structural damage occurred in this improved design during its 6 minute test. 

; KIWI A3 : The subsequent KIWI-A3 reactor used a higher temperature Chemical Vapor Deposition process, resulting in a thicker NbC coat with improved adherence. Some core damage occurred during the 5 minute test in October 1959, which reached power levels of 100 MWt, with some fuel elements showing blistering and corrosion. Generally this reactor test was considered successful. 

; KIWI B1A : Using the same UO2 fuel as KIWI A3, the fuel element design was changed to a 7 channel configuration 66 cm long, with niobium carbide coatings. The December 1961 test, which was intended to reach 1100 MWt, only reached 300 MWt, and was terminated after 30 seconds due to a fire caused by a hydrogen leak in the reactor exhaust nozzle. 

; KIWI B1B : This September 1962 test, which was essentially a repeat of the KIWI B1A test, achieved a power level of 900 MWT, but was terminated within a few seconds when several fuel elements were ejected from the reactor exhaust nozzle. 

; KIWI B2 : Design configuration not tested. 

;  KIWI B3 :Design configuration not tested. 

; KIWI B4A : This reactor incorporated substantial redesigns based on the failure of the KIWI B1B configuration. The fuel elements were fully extruded hexagonal graphite blocks 1.32 meters long and 19 millimetres in diameter, with 19 cooling channels, each 2.3 millimetres in diameter. However, the test run in November 1962 was terminated when bright flashes in the exhaust stream indicated vibration induced damage to the core was leading to its disintegration. 

; KIWI B4B : Design configuration not tested. 

; KIWI B4C : Design configuration not tested. 

; KIWI B4D : Although modifications in the design of this reactor eliminated the vibration which had marred previous tests, the May 1964 test was terminated after about 60 seconds at full power due to the rupture of a nozzle cooling tube. 

; KIWI B4E : This reactor was the first to use coated Uranium Carbide (UC2) fuel, in place of the Uranium Oxide (UO2) fuel previously used. To avoid oxidation of the Carbide fuel, it the uranium fuel particles were coated with a 25 micron layer of pyrolytic graphite which exuded water vapor. This pyrolytic carbon layer subsequently was also used to enhance fission product retention, though this was not initially its purpose. This reactor was operated for 12 minutes, including 8 at full power. The duration of the test was limited by the available liquid hydrogen storage capability. 

; KIWI TNT : This KIWI-B type reactor was deliberately destroyed on January 1965 by subjecting it to a fast excursion. This test was intended to confirm theoretical models of transient behaviour. 

; Phoebus 1A : This first test of a new class of reactors on June 1965 included over 10 minutes of operations at 1090 MWt, with an exhaust temperature of 2370 K. 

; Phoebus 1B : This February 1967 test built on the previous Phoebus 1A test, reaching power levels of 1500 MWt for 30 minutes, with an additional 15 minutes at lower power levels. 

; Phoebus 2A : The most powerful nuclear reactor of any type ever constructed, with a design power level of 5,000 MWt. Operations in June 1968 were limited to 4,000 MWt dur to premature overheating of of aluminium segments of pressure vessel clamps. At total of 12.5 minutes of operations at temperatures of up to 2310 K included intermediate power level operations and reactor restart. 

; PEWEE : This small reactor was intended to be a reactor testbed, incorporating Zirconium Carbide coatings on some fuel elements, instead of the Niobium Carbide used on Phoebus. With a peak operating power of 503 MWt at 2550 K, it achieved new levels of core power density (2340 MWt/m3 average and 5200 MWt/m3 peak), demonstrating a specific impulse of 845 seconds. 

; Nuclear Furnace 1 : The final phase of NERVA fuel development was the Nuclear Furnace (NF-1) reactor, a heterogeneous water-moderated beryllium-reflected reactor for high-temperature nuclear testing of fuel elements and other components. 47 of the 49 fuel elements used Uranium Carbide and Zirconium Carbide Carbon composite fuel, while the remaining 2 fuel elements used Uranium-Zirconium Carbide. Tests in 1972 of composite fuel elements with various carbide contents, thermal expansion coefficients, and thermal stress resistance demonstrated that minimizing the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient between the fuel and coating would reduce coating cracking and carbon erosion. With a peak operating power of 44 MWt at 2500 K, it achieved new levels of core power density (4500 to 5000 MWt/m3). 

The Nuclear Furnace test facility included provisions for remote controlled replacement of core elements, as well as a reactor effluent scrubber system to remove radioactive contaminants from the propellant exhaust. 

; Nuclear Furnace 2 : This reactor was built but not tested, due to the cancellation of all work in this area in 1972. The goals of this experiment included testing of a novel coated particle fuel, using a graphite fuel matrix with a coefficient of thermal expansion closely matched to that of the coating, to reduce thermal stress and cracking. 

; NRX-A1 

; NRX-A2 : This September 1964 engine test included 5 minutes of operation at half to full power levels. Duration of the test was limited by available hydrogen storage capacity. At full power of 1100 MWt the engine demonstrated a specific impulse of 760 seconds. 

; NRX-A3 : This April 1965 test operated for 8 minutes, including 3.5 minutes at full power. The first test was terminated by a spurious trip from the turbine overspeed circuit. The reactor was restarted on May 1965, and operated at full power for 13 minutes, and subsequently restarted for low to medium power operations for an additional 45 minutes. In total, 66 minutes of operations were accumulated, including 16.5 minutes at full power. 

; NRX-EST : This engine operated for a total of 110 minutes, including 28 minutes at full power of 1100-1200 MWt, on five different days in February 1966. 

; NRX-A5 : This 1100 MWt engine was operated in June 1966 for 30 minutes at full power, with the test duration limited by available hydrogen storage capacity. 

; NRX-A6 : This 1100 MWt engine was operated in December 1967 for 60 minutes at full power, exceeding the NERVA design goal. 

; XECF 

; XE' : This 1100 MWt engine was a prototype engine, the first to operated in a downward firing position. It accumulated a total of 28 start cycles in March 1968 for a total of 115 minutes of operations. Test stand coolant water storage capacity limited each full power test to about 10 minutes.

Thank you for making the [[Java Programming]] wikibook so much better.
An even bigger thank you for making Java itself better.

Often I find a &quot;module&quot; here on wikibooks that could use a better title.
The best and easiest way to change the title is to use the (oddly named) &quot;move&quot; tab,
at the top between the &quot;edit&quot; tab and the &quot;watch&quot; tab.
(Unfortunately, too many people create a new page with the better title,
then try to cut-and-paste into the new page. That's more difficult to do correctly).
See [[Help:Pages#Moving]] for details.
(I suspect you didn't know this trick when you created [[Java Programming/Overview]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rename Project ==

The project Basic Dog Training, which seems quite stalled, should be renamed to Positive Only Basic Dog Training.
It advocates a specific point of view, that of Positive Trainers.
Wiki guidelines specify a NEUTRAL, unbiased POV.
For a title such as BASIC dog training, it clearly contradicts the guidelines.

== Move and NPOV ==

I have merged this article into the main dog care book. However, it was previously a separate book advocating positive dog training, so a section on punishing dogs needs to be introduced. [[wikipedia:user:pcu123456789|PCU123456789]] ([[wikipedia:user_talk:pcu123456789|talk]]) 20:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

:Modern Behaviorists and behavior based trainers greatly dispute the meaning and need for punishment. Recent studies indicate that for basic family pets, Positive Reinforcement training is superior to other kinds of punishment based training, due to the fewer negative side effects.
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Renodogmom|Renodogmom]] ([[User talk:Renodogmom|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Renodogmom|contribs]]) 05:46, July 6, 2007.&lt;/small&gt;

::That is fine, but unless Positive Only Training is a consensus, Punishment should be covered for the sake of NPOV. The reader should then be provided with information to decide for himself/herself which approach to take. Anyway, I'd feel better if people are punishing animals in a &quot;proper&quot; way instead of deciding for themselves how to do it.

Hi. I'm new to the cookbooks area, so please forgive me if Spelt Yellow Cake does not belong in this cookbook. I obviously copied it from [[Cookbook:1-2-3-4 Cake]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What's the connection between Blender and Wings 3D ? ==

David - What particular aspect of reading about Blender is going to help a Wings user (esp. a noob) better get to grips with using Wings?

Whilst it's acknowledged that Blender is a darned good app. (I know of quite a few Wings users that also use it) - I doubt that even they would suggest there's a lot of similarity with GUI / workflow etc.

Rather than being on the front page, I'd have thought this was better located in a more general 'Useful links' type of place - or apps to try / use for features that wings doesn't have eg Animation / rendering etc?

pp

(I realise you've cross-referenced these 2 apps - and I'd suggest the same comments are valid the other way round?)

btw - if this seems a negative comment, ie what not to have here, under 'Further reading' - I'd have thought pointers to material about aspects of modelling / edgeloops / techniques etc would be more appropriate - ie stuff that might answer queries / help someone getting to grips with what it's all about ...

''If you want to rename that section &quot;useful links&quot;, that's fine with me. (Or is there another one I overlooked?)''
''As you know, the table of contents of a wikibooks links &quot;deeper&quot; to pages with more detail. But sometimes search engines send people to a page deep in the middle of a wikibook. Imagine that I stumble upon a page in the middle of the Wings 3D book and I think it's great. Do you think I would like to know about the existence of the rest of the book? Of course I would, so I find the link &quot;up&quot; to the table of contents useful.''

''I feel it is very important that every page link &quot;up&quot;.''

''Some books have heavily nested content, so I have to go &quot;up&quot; a few times to get from a page, to a section summary, to the title page. I think it's useful to keep going &quot;up&quot;, so I can find out not just about closely-related pages, but also closely related books.''
''Is there any wikibook more closely related to this Wings 3D book than the Blender book? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:03, 16 January 2006 (UTC)''

== edit link ==
#2 - What's the purpose of the link bringing the reader back to the page that they're reading the link on? (or at least the edit box for same)

''You're talking about the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[edit]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; link on the right side?''
''It's a &quot;feature&quot; of the software used by wikibooks.org .''
''It looks pretty silly on this page.''
''It's more useful on really long pages like [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge]]. Those links helps people add a comment to just the one section they are interested in, without having to scroll through the whole thing in the edit window, or worrying about accidentally messing up some other section. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:03, 16 January 2006 (UTC)''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==RE: General points==
Hey TP again here!

First of all, a sincere and absolute thanks to all the people who has contributed to this book.

I know it might seem arrogant to show up out of nowhere and critisize the structure, and please take it for what it is. Just another opinion! Believe it or not, im just trying to be helpful in the spirit of the wikipeople. 

Just a short comment to your points.

1 &amp; 2 # I agree. I will time stamp this one, and future comments.

3 # I Agree.

4 # You are right about information being duplicated. But I was thinking of a set of crossreferences. I.ex: a pitching article, would apply to producers, screenwriters and directors. One could simply have the same article linked to several places. And add links under the article to whatever other areas it touches on. I believe this can be achieved using categories.

4b # Changing the structure of the book, you are right it would be a huge job. And it would'nt look very good while it was implemented and experimented forth.

What about starting with making categories for the different work fields? And inserting the appropriate articles there? It would not interfere with the rest of the book.

Kind regards

- TP

==General points==

Hi, I'm Jack - one of the people who set up the MMM.  I'd like to make some general points to the comments below:

# It's great that this book is gaining momentum - thanks loads to everyone getting involved!
# Please PLEASE sign and date-stamp your comments!
# I agree that this book should be readable by noobs.  But I also feel very strongly that this book should aim to satisfy the needs of both the noob and the practicing professional.  And I believe that _is_ possible - we just need good introductory chapters to help frame the more complex stuff.  And, to be honest, the web is already full of material that caters for noob filmmakers.
# The structure of the book aims to reflect the structure of a film production.  The problem with having &quot;for directors&quot; or &quot;for producers&quot; section is that lots of material would end up getting duplicated.  For example, pretty much everyone on a film production needs to know the basics of cinematography, for example.  Also, changing the structure of the book would be a big, BIG job - you'd have to change every single page title, every category name, every link etc.

[[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 11:46, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

== Structure of the whole book ==
I find the whole structure of this book somewhat confusing. And as I see it, the better the structure, it will be more useful and one would also get more input, and the better the book! So from my point of view this is very important. One has to think of the users. Probably many are beginning filmmakers like me, and it is called the '''Movie Making Manual'''.

I would like to suggest a break down of the articles along the following lines:

1. '''For directors'''. Here I would put all material concerning the artistic choices while making a film, as well as a description of the directors usual role in the process. Actors, film techiques, film theory, film language, locations etc. Ofcourse bordering subjects like stories and scriptwriting must also be here, in addition to the other categories.

2. '''For producers'''.  Description of the producers role, budgeting, organizing etc etc.

3. '''Cinematographers'''. Techiques, looks, light and cameras, etc. 

4. '''Scriptwriters'''. Scriptwriting, survinging, selling, pitching, copyrighting, organizations etc.

5. '''Sound and sound design'''. Techical and artistic information

6. '''Editing'''. Theory and practicalities.

7.''' Other functions''': need its own submenu. Lights, set design, props, AD'ing! and so forth.

8. '''Film theory''': The basis

This is the approach most film schools work from, and I personally think they might be right.
It would also be good to have colored blocks with this on the front page. I honestly think this would increase the readability and usefulness of the book. My only question is whether there is enough content yet for such a structure.

So whats your opinions?

Regards

TP.

(And what are the rules about linking to wikipedias many good articles regarding film and filmmaking? Can we simply steal them?)
(I would also wish upon a stronger emphasis on making short films, as in reality, most people who make features, or are making their first, know most of the stuff here. Through making short films!)

==Movie Making Manual Formatting==
Hi, I've got a few suggestions how to make the Movie Making Manual easier to read:
* Make the colorful banners half their current size to streamline the layout, they will still stand out enough, but currently they overwhelm the page
* Categories like [[:Category:Writing_movies]] are difficult to read because all articles start with &quot;Movie Making Manual-&quot; or &quot;MMM/&quot;. How about naming each article so that it can stand on its own (no more &quot;MMM&quot; and &quot;Movie Making Manual-&quot; in article titles), and use the top navigation and categorization features to bind them all together?
Feedback, Suggestions? [[User:Cramer|Cramer]] 10:38, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

: Hi Cramer.  Thanks loads for your feedback.  You're right, the MMM is in a bit of a mess.  To answer your two suggestions:
:* Banners: I certainly don't mind if you modify them, sounds like a good idea.  Cauri is the guy who designed the banners but I'm not sure whether or not he's got the time to contribute to the MMM at the moment.
:* Page Naming.  Yes, it's in a bit of a mess. First off, category names of the form [[:Category:Writing_movies]] are depreciated because they violate the WikiBooks naming convention... instead we're slowly switching over to category names of the form [[:Category:MMM:writing]] (i.e. prefixing the category names with MMM).  I'd love to find a way to strip away all the uglyness from the page names but I'm not sure it's allowed (unless you know of some cool new MediaWiki feature I don't know about?).  The page names of the form MMM-Page Name are now depreciated and we're slowly moving over to MMM/Chapter/Page Name.  I'm a big fan of the forward-slash system because it puts breadcrumb trails at the top of each page which helps navigation.  I'm pretty sure we're obliged by the WikiBooks naming convention to include the book name in every page title.  As far as I'm aware, the only way to have an entire book that has &quot;clean&quot; page titles like &quot;Page Title&quot; would be to install and run our own wiki.  Take a look at [[MMM/Preface/How You Can Help]] for more detailed info about our existing naming system.

::I would like to see (all of?) the modules for the Movie Making Manual be subpages of said book. We currently have several different ways of doing page naming with this book. [[User:Midnightcomm|Midnightcomm]] 19:51, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
::: Yes, I appologise for the mess.  If you have some time it would be great if you could help migrate the book naming from the old &quot;Movie Making Manual-Page Name&quot; form to the new &quot;MMM/Chapter Name/Page Name&quot; form. [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 15:16, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

== Module merge to use ==

This is a suggestion from the people who are working on this book.

The following module may be useful to merge into this Wikibook somehow:  [[VideoCodecs]]

If you choose not to use this Wikibook module, please add the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|orphaned module not needed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to that page, so we can get rid of it.  Otherwise rename the module to conform to the naming conventions here. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

: OK, thanks.  We'll adopt it.  Looks very useful.  Thanks. [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 14:39, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Superlatives! ==

Hi there - can i just say, what a find this wikibook is! It's really great - it looks good, it's exciting - great work! It's been my burning desire for well over ten years to make a film, and I might just be dipping in to get some tips or add my own if I can. I haven't looked at everything, but I think it would be good to have a bit more on storyboarding, ie images that actually show an extreme close-up, wide angle etc. Also, has anyone heard of the [[m:Wikimentary|Wikimentary]] idea? Basically, it is an idea for video files to be available to edit together collaboratively - how it will actually work is anyone's guess, but I thought you might be interested. And the films you mention as being in pre-production - are you developing them here as an idea/script/process, or just writing up about the experience after it's done? Anyway, keep up the good work! [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 19:13, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

== The Basic Basics ==

Hi. 

This movie making manual seems really promising. The only thing I'm wondering about is that seems a bit in-depth for people who are thinking about making their very first short movie. I mean, you don't really need to go through all the steps mentioned in the basic basics bit, if all you want to do is experiment with making a short story with a couple of actors, and editing it together on your computer. That said, I really like the idea of a movie making wiki like this, and hey, maybe I'll contribute some stuff myself in the future, if you'll allow, because I've made a few short movies myself. 

Cheers![[User:Doom jester|Doom jester]] 16:17, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== Formatting / Audience ==

In my opinion, the main target audience for this Wikibook should be people who are interested in low-budget indie filmmaking.  Most of the people who read this book will likely fall in this camp.  I don't think this site should be geared as much towards professionals, since the information is very specific (i.e. funding a feature in Canada is different than in the US, and features are different than music videos or corporate) and it's unlikely that there'd be enough knowledgeable contributors to get something going.

For people who want to get their feet wet in making films, I think the Wiki should be structured into two main areas:&lt;br&gt;
*There are course/guides which explains the general concepts.  It should provide just enough detail to produce a film, and not overwhelm the user with too much information!  There would be a bunch of modules or courses like:  My First Film 101, Lighting 101, Audio 101, etc.&lt;br&gt;
And then there could be another layer that goes more in depth... i.e. Lighting 201, Audio 201, Color Enhancement / Film Look 202, etc.

A &quot;My first film&quot; module would be the introduction for people like Doom jester, who don't want to wade through the entire wikibook and want to get their feet wet.

*A reference section, with in-depth information.  For example, there could be a section on grip equipment which lists all the various pieces of equipment, how to use it, and the applications.

==All The Steps are Necessary==

Anyone can make a motion picture.  All you have to do is learn '''all''' the steps. 

Learning only a few of the steps does NOT work.  Having a &quot;My First Film&quot; section would skip steps.  And when you skip steps, you will wonder why your movie does not look right.

It is like making a clock.  If you an eliminate some of the gears and wheels then you don't see the minutes, just the hours.

The steps of making a motion picture were developed in the mid 1930s after sound was added.  Since then, little has changed.  New technology such as digital video still requires the same steps.  The steps might be done differently now but they steps still need to be done.

'''Alternative #1''': If you do not want to learn all the steps, simply grab a camcorder and a Macintosh computer with Final Cut Express and begin.  Slowly, you will learn what filmmakers have learned 70 years ago.  Of all the ways of learning how motion pictures are made, this is the most fun way to learn.

'''Alternative #2''':  Become a PA.  Anyone can work on a motion picture by becoming a '''Production Assistant'''.  Today, you can go to the [http://www.troma.com Troma] website and look the section about volunteering to work on a movie.  Other studios are not as open about getting a job as a Production Assistant and in Hollywood, there is competition to become an unpaid Production Assistant.  Still, you can have an interesting experience and work on real motion pictures.

'''Alternative #3''': Become experienced with one step and do that for other filmmakers.  If you are extremely observant and take excellent notes, become '''script supervisor'''.   No degree is required to be a script supervisor.  One really good book and perhaps a one day class is all you need.  The job of script supervisor is the best possible vantage point for seeing everything that goes on during production of a motion picture.

'''Alternative #4''':  Learn film editing.  This is best training for anyone who wants to be a movie producer, a movie director, a film composer, a sound effects person and of course a motion picture editor.  In film editing, you control how the entire movie comes together.   In the past, this was very difficult since the only place you can edit real motion picture or television drama is inside the film studios or the post production houses of Hollywood.  However, now that every personal computer comes with an editing program, more and more companies are releasing film dailies from real motion pictures for you to edit at home.  If you cannot find any other source of unedited scenes, try the [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop].  In a few years, I think that even Apple computer will have unedited scenes from hot, new television dramas on the iTunes website for you to edit.

==Missing Steps==

There are lots of sections still missing in the book.  How do you add sections to the Table of Content for MMM?

'''Example #1''':  Animation is described as a way of creating visual effects.  The animation section of MMM does not explain that animation can be used to make entire motion pictures.   To be complete, this book should show all the steps of making an animated movie... which is in a different order than the steps for making a motion picture with a camera.

Anyone who can draw can buy a simple 2D animation program such as  [http://www.toonboom.com Toon Boom] and make their own feature film.  None of that in explained anywhere in this book so far.

Also, 3D character animation is not explained in the book.  Neither is the theory of using digital puppets which are 3D characters that you purchase off the shelf from companies such as [http://www.daz3d.com DAZ] and [http://www.e-frontier.com Poser].

All the steps of making an animated motion picture need to be explained.

'''Example #2''': The '''telecine''' section is listed last in post production.  It should also be listed first before editing.  Most telecine is done to prepare dailies for editing on personal computers.  Therefore, a new catagory should be added for '''Prep of film dailies''' or '''telecine of the dailies'''.  This seems like a trivial task but you will see that it is not once you read all that must be done to prepare a movie for editing.

==Theory==

What exactly is intended to go in the theory chapter? I mean, isn't that sort of what all the other chapters cover?
[[User:Athox|Athox]] 23 September, 2006

:I think this section should be about critical theory and how film is interpreted (psychoanalytic, deconstruction, etc). If this seems appropriate, I'd love to start the page. However, I too am not 100% sure of the page's purpose. If this seems correct to everybody I could do a rough outline of the different approaches. Let me know if this approach to the page seems appropriate here or on the theory talk page.

I would be nice to see this Wikibook cover both film and filmless movie making. The two are very different in many ways-[[User:Miketm|Miketm]] 00:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Deletion Request ==

Someone marked [[Movie Making Manual/Film_Academy Training]] for speedy deletion, which I changed to a votes for deletion due to my uncertainity of the situation. The reason given was it was an &quot;advertisement&quot;. Are the authors/editors aware of this and in agreement that it should be deleted? You can find the votes for deletion discussion [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Movie Making Manual-Film_Academy Training|here]].

== US Resources ==

I've noticed that a lot of the content in the MMM is directed towards the UK or applies to those only in the UK. I, for one, would like to see a lot more content that applies to the US, and other countries. Just a suggestion.

== Lets Bring MMM Back to LIFE! ==

Hi, I've recently found this wikibook, and I think it's feeling a little outdated and unorganized, (no offence) so I'm hoping we can bring this wikibook back to life with updated information and be an much more efficient read for people on the fly.
So, I have a few things I would like to add, first of all, Chapters? I saw it mentioned in the introduction, and I think it could be awesome. I like the Pre, Pro, and Post production, but in that, there are so many areas, Cinematography, being my more favoured area, there are like 4 pages, The perfect camera I have rewritten, but I think it is an orphan currently, so I'm going to try and structure what I can using the current system, but if anyone would like to help, PLEASE do.

== /R/ or /r/? ==

This page lists /R/ instead of /r/. Is this correct? I was under the impression Quenya r was /r/. --[[User:86.135.217.213|86.135.217.213]] 14:04, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

:It's normally pronunced [r], but before a vowel [R].--[[User:Elistir|Elistir]] 21:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

::The IPA symbol [R] is used to indicate the voiced uvular trill, a sound used for r in spoken French. Tolkien found this sound to be distasteful, and noted the Elves did as well. In fact, he went so far as to say that the Orks used this sound in their various languages. It is most decidedly NOT used in Quenya.[[User:Corsair Caruso|Corsair Caruso]] ([[User talk:Corsair Caruso|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Corsair Caruso|contribs]]) 16:28, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

What about rv cluster in neo-quenya Yarvaxea from the LOTR movie? Is it a valid combination of consonants?  [[Special:Contributions/195.16.44.178|195.16.44.178]] ([[User talk:195.16.44.178|talk]]) 07:12, 26 February 2009 (UTC)Boris

Anyway, if someone didn't understand the stress patterns, here is a simple [http://www.lothlorien.ru/quenyaparser.aspx?q=Nai%20yarvaxea%20rasselya%20taltuva%20notto-carinnar!&amp;wrd=1 quenya stress validator], made in accordance with this article.

Adjusted the IPA.  Several phonemes were posited which AFAIK do not occur.  Can't be sure about the syllable breaks between C clusters, but C.C seems the best bet for now, even in cases such as ''x'' and ''qu'' where it's easier to divide them .CC in orthography.  ''Ty'' is supposedly between a [k] and a [t] w a notable offglide.

== Change of vowel quality with length ==

Tolkien indicates that, as in German, the quality of vowels change with their length. The vowel chart here does not reflect this.  Tolkien makes note on page 71 of The Road Goes Ever On (3rd edition) that the short vowels &quot;may be rendered as in [English] sick, bed, hot, foot (for ŭ), though ŏ is intended to be rounder than in modern [English].&quot;  These vowels, respectively, would be rendered [ɪ], [ɛ], [ɔ], and [ʊ].[[User:Corsair Caruso|Corsair Caruso]] ([[User talk:Corsair Caruso|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Corsair Caruso|contribs]]) 16:28, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

I've changed the vowel qualities, as per &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot; and Helge Fauskanger's &quot;Quenya Course,&quot; which can be found at his website &quot;Ardalambion.&quot;  I'm happy to discuss the changes and further sources if anyone feels inclined to do so.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Icelight. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Icelight~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Hello, Magicfly. I've noticed your post on [[School of Magic:List of Participants]]. Could you tell me what's your reason to sign yourself in that list?

== Image licensing problem ==

* [[:Image:Standard.png]]
* [[:Image:Edgepalm1.png]]
* [[:Image:Hand.png]]
* [[:Image:Hand1.png]]

Recently you uploaded these four images without licensing information. (I suppose that you used the &quot;None selected (add license manually)&quot; menu item on [[Special:Upload]].) This means that other users do not know where these images are from, nor whether these images are under a free license, nor whether these images violate copyright by being at Wikibooks. Your images will be '''deleted''' if you do not provide suitable license information.

Could you please ''edit'' each image page (click the &quot;edit this page&quot; button on the image page) and provide:

Hello.  Thanks for adding some stuff to the &quot;Magic&quot; Wikibook!  Good stuff over all.  I do have one comment.  I found the &quot;What is a Magician&quot; section a bit breathless.  For example, the phrase, &quot;inspire people that may have no other realm of hope to continue clinging to.&quot; seems a bit over the top.

What do you think?

Also, from a style point of view, I'm not sure that it is necessary or appropriate to sign your contributions.  The page history will show what you added.

Thanks again,

Grüß Gott,

ich schreibe hier, weil deine Seite auf de:b für IPs gesperrt ist. Man sitzt mir gewissermaßen im Nacken, weil in den WP-Artikeln zu Algorithmen tausend Implementierungen angegeben sind, die dem Artikel im Prinzip nicht nützen, aber einen eigenen Wert haben. wo stelle ich sie am besten hin? Ich möchte sie eigentlich nicht radikal umkrämpeln, ich denke, das hübsch an den listen ist, dass sie zeigen, wie versch. programmiersprachen mit standardaufgaben umgehen. ich möchte das ungern kommentierne, das schadet mehr als es nützt, denke ich. wäre so etwas auf wikibooks gut aufgehoben?

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Geoking66. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Geoking66~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This is a guide to becoming a good student. No matter who you are, if you try hard enough you can succeed!

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Preface|Preface]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 18, 2006}}  ==

This book is intended for those who are looking for some tips on improving their abilities, as a student and as a person. Implementing some of these ideas into academic life will surely help a student perform better in the classroom.

Hopefully everyone reading this work will learn something that they can do to become a better student and be more successful.

'''Qualities of a good student'''&lt;br&gt;
Today’s students are tomorrow’s leaders. The qualities of the student are of great impact to determine the student's bright future and career. So, who is a good student? What are the qualities of a good student? Historically, the term ‘student’ refers to anyone who learns something. However, the recent definition of a “student” is mostly used to refer to anyone who attends school, college, or university.

What are the qualities of a good student?
# Attitude: Basically, a good student possesses the ability and willingness to learn new subjects even if the subjects are not interesting.
# Academic skills: Acquiring academic skills is the most important quality of a good student. Ability to read comprehensively, to write effectively, to speak fluently, and to communicate clearly are the key areas in which a student must be proficient. Having a good command in all these areas will make a student to shine in the class.
# Ability: A good student has the ability to apply the results of his or her learning into a creative way and achieve the goals.
# Perceptiveness: How well a student can interpret and perceive meanings from a conversation greatly determines the quality of a student. A good student always perceives right meaning from conversations, but an average student often misunderstands the original thoughts of a speaker or writer and derives a wrong conclusion.
# Self-Discipline: Discipline in managing the time is an important factor that every good student must possess. Often delaying the tasks, such as writing assignments, reading text books, etc, may negatively impact the ability of a student to achieve the goals.
# Understanding rather than memorizing concepts: Resolving any doubts by asking about them on the spot is always a good thing. Several surveys suggest students must understand the concepts rather than just memorize them. The memorized facts and theories will stay in student's memory until they leave school, college, or university. Once out of school, the students will totally forget the core concepts that they had learnt. Therefore, it is essential for a good student to understand the concepts.

{{TODO|Comparison: Student should have to compare with all students and read.&lt;br&gt;
Behavior: Student should have to know how to behave with his or her mates, teachers, parents and elders.}}

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 1 - Motivation|Chapter 1 - Motivation]]  {{stage short|25%|Jan 29, 2006}} ==

To become a good student, you need to get motivated! Motivation can come from seeing the situation of many poor children around the world who are not lucky enough to get a proper education. This is a good thing to keep in mind when you find yourself not wanting to attend class or study at home. Another reason to get motivated to study is that you will enjoy a better quality of life as an educated person. Possibly another reason is to look at people who are famous today, and looking into there education, degrees, grades, school records, etc.

All you need is confidence! For that, you need to feel that we are enjoying and bettering themselves, study can be looked as a competition and divided as a team task. You &lt;u&gt;should&lt;/u&gt; avoid forcing yourself to study, as this will make learning a chore and you will not feel like even opening your books, and possibly make you loose your interest in studying. You may have many academically good students in your courses, try becoming friends with them (or encourage your fellow students to be better), and you'll be immersed in an academic environment which will help you feel motivated! But be careful not to make them think you're &quot;using&quot; them, just to get good grades, maybe try being actual friends with them!

{{NOTE|It must be pointed out that methods of evaluation may at times foster individualism and negative competition, preventing others to succeed will guarantee a greater recognition to those who do, sad but true. Life in most places is setup as a competition for scarcer opportunities. Especially in higher education, keeping the numbers and grades of competitors down has drastic implication for future opportunities. 

This is also one reason why some governments limit the availability of courses (how demographics and national interests influence specific fields of study) and interest groups lobby hard to increase requirements in the courses and to new entries in the job market.}}

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 2 - Concentration On Studies|Chapter 2 - Concentration On Studies]] {{stage short|50%|Jan 21, 2006}} ==

Concentration follows eagerness. This section provides you with the basics of &quot;Concentration&quot; and also provides you with advice as to how to get aroused with concentration.

You need to pay attention in a class. Don't start chatting with your peers/friends when the teacher turns their back to you. Even better, don't associate with distracting people. You should realize that the people in your class play an important role in how everybody progresses. However, if you are a good student you will do better and achieve your goals. If you decide to associate with distracting people, or goof of in class, you'll regret it later and receive punishments from the school. 

Your friends will be there for you at that time, if they are trustful and of a good reputation. At home, study and do your homework in a place that doesn't make you sleepy. It is advisable to have a dedicated study table or desk. Don't do your study work in front of the TV, radio, stereo, etc. That would be pointless because you are meant to be thinking about your studies. 

If you feel distracted, take a short break of 15 minutes or less; maybe try to read an unrelated story book. But don't start sticking to the book if the time limit is over. Bookmark the page and then you can read it later on. You should also have a daily routine/timetable to guide you, but you must follow it through. It might be difficult to begin with, but hard beginnings make good endings.

Avoid conflicts; this will move your attention from listening to what your teacher says! &quot;Honored zeros are better than copied hundreds&quot;. Avoid cheating. Be honest with yourself and others about what you have learned; if you don't know the answer leave it. Use it as a way to improve your knowledge of the subject. Remember, study well now, and you will have the chance to have fun after you achieve your goals!

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 3 - Behavior|Chapter 3 - Behavior (Hard style Behavior)]]  {{stage short|50%|Jan 21, 2006}} ==

One of the main things that decides a person's or child's future is their behavior. Learning textbooks and achieving 100% is not enough. People should think that you are the only all-rounder that has good manners. Obey your elders, don't bully your classmates at school. Remember, try imagining yourself in the other person's situation, and you'll know how much you hurt them with your actions. Say hello to your teachers and schoolmates when you see them, people will appreciate your friendliness and be friendly in return. Use good manners in class.  Raise your hand, don't interrupt if someone is speaking, and if you don't have a nice thing to say, then don't say anything at all.

Above all, try helping your friends in any situation and you'll be remembered as one of the best friends at school! Don't just do it for a good reputation, but for a good future and for yourself. You should also know that words from your mouth are enough to break relationships (or worse) so don't utter foul, discouraging, or insulting words.  If someone is being rude, don't encourage them by laughing because that only makes them continue in their bad behavior.  

Don't take this as a lecture, but as a guideline! Behavior should be first and then comes academics. Even if you aren't good at school, you'll be famous for your behavior, and good friends are truly worth more than gold.

Your behavior should be such in a way that it should impress others.

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 4 - Management|Chapter 4 - Management]] {{stage short|75%|Jan 22, 2006}} ==

This is one of the many questions that children ask their teachers, &quot;Ma'am/Sir, I can't study!&quot;. Let's ponder on these things: Are you devoted to studying? Are you just studying for your parents? Are you just cheating in exams for getting good grades and marks? The list goes on.

First of all, as mentioned above, study somewhere that has a basic study table. Don't study or read in dim light. If you become bored on learning one subject, study something else that interests you a lot. You must always find alternatives as you go!

We all know the saying,&quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot;. Yes, studying all night and not playing just stresses you on work and you'll forget everything the next morning. Play out for about 2 hours or so. It will be pleasant if you go out to play around in the evening, say 5 pm in the evening. This energizes you and gives you extra strength for everything you do.

Make a timetable. And that is all what this section is about. Arrange the time-table with the subjects that are tough for you in the first column. Then put a break column after every 2 subjects so you don't get strained.

Study on each subject for about 1 hour. Make small pauses of 10-15 minutes in between. You'll get refreshed. Use the time for something that takes your mind on the effort done, have a snack.

Try coming up with a schedule for studying, it helps to be organized and make yourself more motivated to studying with an organized schedule. This can balance your studying time, and free time. Make sure that you are being honest, and not putting &quot;3 hours free time, 30 minutes study, 1 hour TV, sleep&quot; into your schedule, especially when you are in higher classes, since the studying/homework increases in time as you move on through elementary/middle school/high school/college. 

Try getting a good sleep. Humans are supposed to get 7 - 10 hours sleep (it goes down with age). If you don't get enough sleep, that will result in sluggishness, memory deficiency and your mind will be filled with the crave for the missing rest.

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Chapter 5 - Helping Others And Advising|Chapter 5 - Helping Others And Advising]]  {{stage short|25%|Jan 22, 2006}} ==

Apart from improving yourself, try spreading your skills among others. This is the section that provides you with all the things necessary in sharing your skills. Co-operation is helping each other out so everyone benefits, it's the opposite of competing, where everyone wants to win for themselves. Most learning is done with the help of others, so learning to cooperate is a valuable skill for anyone.

Study partners are a wonderful tool. They save time and they help reinforce what you have learned. Divide a reading assignment in half. Study your section using any and all note taking strategies you have (e.g., Venn diagrams, outlines, note cards, coloured highlighters). When you both have an understanding of your readings, take turns 'teaching/explaining' it to the other person. 

As you adjust your explanation to your partner, you will reinforce the concept for yourself. It works because as you think about how to explain the topic, you must understand it first! Teachers are like students who have a bit extra knowledge. To gain this knowledge visit libraries to read extra books.  If you are confused by a book you are reading, ask your teacher. It really helps.

==[[How To Become A Good Student/Conclusion|Conclusion]]  {{stage short|25%|Jan 22, 2006}} ==
You need to be successful in all classes and not mess about talking to friends and keep to the school rules.  You can achieve things by setting targets for yourself and working towards them.
Nobody is perfect in every subject. You have strengths and weaknesses that you have to accept. As long as you try hard every day, you will be successful. Sometimes success is just going to bed at night knowing you did the very best you could do. That's all anyone can ask of you.

Study Partners are brilliant because people all have different strengths and weaknesses. So if you are brilliant at Math but terrible at English then you can find a friend who is the opposite. And remember asking them and teachers questions doesn't make you dumb, it just means that you are keen to know the right things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&quot;Study? Sooooo boring!&quot;''' 

I am a very good student (seriously). I have seen many students in my life who do not even care about themselves or their career. They act like ''wild animals''. If I were them, I would rather change. So, let's come together and guide them to their correct path—a brighter and a happier future! 

Each one of us has loved to hate studies, and still managed to get through. We've always envied the so called &quot;scholars&quot; of our class, who could score twice the marks with half the study. And who will like something that he's not successful at? But as is true with every game, there are certain rules to study better. When one plays the game of study with these rules—it becomes beautifully simplified and extremely easy.


So the question is... '''''Are you with me?'''''

* This chapter needs an introduction to explain the data modeling driven approach to the first few chapters.

==post revision comments==

'''viji'''

so, I did not do the explanation of the data model driven approach, YET.  I will, I might ask you for direction.  Do you think it should go more in the introduction than in this chapter?

== It appears spaces ARE allowed in attribute values... ==

In the '''Rules to follow''' the book states:
 
&lt;pre&gt;attribute values should have quotation marks around them and no spaces&lt;/pre&gt;

Yet in the section on default and fixed values for schemas which are supposedly a well-formed XML documents, we see:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; 
    default=&quot;really cool place to visit!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

and 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; 
    fixed=&quot;you must visit this place - it is awesome!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Are not '''default''' and '''fixed''' attributes?  Do their values not contain spaces?

[[User:Kjcole|KJC]] 02:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== Exhibit 2 - No &quot;standalone&quot; element ==

In Exhibits 2 and 3 the prologue (XML declaration) does not appear to have the standalone=&quot;yes&quot; element which the text description under exhibit 3 suggests should be present.

But the text does indicate that this is an optional element so perhaps that is fine.

== Formatting... ==

The formatting of this page is vary confusing at times.  For example, under DTD section, subheading &quot;Grouping Attributes for an Element&quot;...

Shouldn't this line:
&lt;!ATTLIST car horn CDATA #REQUIRED

Be grouped in the box with these lines:
                     seats CDATA #REQUIRED
                     steeringwheel CDATA #REQUIRED
                     price CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;

This sort of thing seems to be all over the page, which makes it hard to read.  Unfortunately, I don't know anything about XML (why I'm here) so I'm worried if I try to fix it up I will make a mistake.

== DTD (Document Type Definition) Validation - Simple Example ==

This section makes NO SENSE. There is no coherent description of what DTD is or why it's useful or when it should be used. Just throwing out an example like that is practically useless.

I agree that this section seems to come out of nowhere. This topic should at least have an introduction to DTD, explaining what it is, why it's useful, etc. I am new to XML and this is just confusing me. Should this content not be moved to chapter [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/DTD]]?

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Decstuff. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Decstuff~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

You left some red links here - be careful to always link to cookbook: namespace in cookbook articles. You can use &quot;pipe trick&quot; for convenient link creating: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[cookbook:salt|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will produce [[cookbook:salt|salt]].

'''Cinnamon croûtons''' are a sweet variation on the classic salad croûton, which can be used to enhance a fruit salad.  Alternately, these croûtons make a good addition to pumpkin, sweet potato or carrot soups.

==Ingredients==
*4 slices day-old [[cookbook:Baguette|French bread]], cubed
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnut]] [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|ground cinnamon]]

Makes enough croûtons for 4 to 6 servings of fruit salad.

==Procedure==
# Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, and set aside.
# Preheat the oven to 350°F (~180°C).
# Pour the walnut oil into a pan and fry the bread cubes in it, tossing to coat with oil.
# Spread the bread cubes on a baking sheet and garnish with cinnamon sugar.  Bake for 8 minutes or until crispy and dry.  Allow to cool well before handling, as the sugar will make these croûtons easier to brown, and thus hotter to handle initially.

==Four vectors==
A four vector represents a displacement in spacetime.

[[Image:relfourvector.gif]]

If the spacetime has a metric given by:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2&lt;/math&gt;

and if the space-time is flat the magnitude of the four vector is calculated from:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}^2 = A^2 - B^2 - C^2 - D^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where A, B, C, D are the projections of the vector on the corresponding coordinate axes (t,x,y,z). The magnitude of a four vector is given by:

&lt;math&gt;S = | \mathbf{S}^2 |^{1/2} = \sqrt{A^2 - B^2 - C^2 - D^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product of a four vector (also known as the &quot;dot product&quot; or &quot;inner product&quot;) can be derived in the same way as the scalar product for an ordinary vector (a three vector, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special_Relativity:_mathematical_approach#Scalar_Product  scalar product]). So the scalar product of two four vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B}&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B} = A_tB_t - A_xB_x - A_yB_y - A_zB_z&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be derived easily from the metric tensor of Minkowski spacetime. The scalar product of two four-vectors ''x'' and ''y'' is defined (using indicial notation) as:

:&lt;math&gt;
x \cdot y
= x^a \eta_{ab} y^b
= \left( \begin{matrix}x^0 &amp; x^1 &amp; x^2 &amp; x^3 \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}y^0 \\ y^1 \\ y^2 \\ y^3 \end{matrix} \right)
= - x^0 y^0 + x^1 y^1 + x^2 y^2 + x^3 y^3
&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product of four vectors is independent of the coordinate system:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
A'_x &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( A_x - \frac{v}{c} A_t \right) 
\\ A'_y &amp; = &amp; A_y \\ A'_z &amp; = &amp; A_z \\
A'_t &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( -\frac{v}{c} A_x + A_t \right)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar product in this frame is:

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A'} \cdot \underline{B'} =
 A'_x B'_x + A'_y B'_y + A'_z B'_z - A'_t B'_t &lt;/math&gt; 

Simplifying, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\underline{A'} \cdot \underline{B'} &amp; = &amp; 
\gamma^2 \left( A_x B_x -\frac{v}{c} (A_x B_t + A_t B_x) + \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; &amp; +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z &amp;\\
 &amp; &amp; - \gamma^2 \left( \frac{v^2}{c^2}A_x B_x -\frac{v}{c} (A_x B_t + A_t B_x) + A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; \left(1- \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{-1} \left( A_x B_x  + \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_t B_t \right) \\
&amp; &amp; +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z \\  
&amp; &amp; - \left(1- \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_x B_x  - A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; A_x B_x  +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z   - A_t B_t 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is the same as the scalar product in the original frame of reference.

Properties:

1. Distributivity for vector addition &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}.(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt;

2. Symmetry &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B} = \mathbf{B.A}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Leibniz rule of differentiation applies ie: &lt;math&gt;d (\mathbf{A.B}) = d\mathbf{A}.\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A}.d\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

4. Orthogonality &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.B} = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

5. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A.A} = \mathbf{A}^2&lt;/math&gt;

We now know that the dot product of two four-vectors is a &lt;i&gt;scalar&lt;/i&gt; result, i. e., its value is independent of coordinate system.  This can be used to advantage on occasion.

In the odd geometry of spacetime it is not obvious what ''perpendicular'' means.  We therefore &lt;i&gt;define&lt;/i&gt; two four-vectors &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\underline{B}&lt;/math&gt; to be perpendicular if their dot product is zero, in the same way as with three-vectors.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} \cdot \underline{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Because the dot product is a scalar, if vectors are perpendicular in one frame, they will be perpendicular in all frames.

We can also consider the dot product of a four-vector &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; which resolves into &lt;math&gt;(A_x , A_t )&lt;/math&gt; in the unprimed frame.  Let us further suppose that the spacelike component is zero in some primed frame, so that the components in this frame are (0, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;t'&lt;/sub&gt; ) The fact that the dot product is independent of coordinate system means that 

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} \cdot \underline{A} = A_x^2 - A_t^2 = - A_t'^2&lt;/math&gt;

This constitutes an extension of the spacetime Pythagorean theorem to four-vectors other then the position four-vector. Thus, for instance, the wavenumber for some wave may be zero in the primed frame, which means that the wavenumber and frequency in the unprimed frame are related to the frequency in the primed frame by &lt;math&gt;k^2 - \omega^2 / c^2 = - \omega'^2 / c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

We indicate a four-vector by underlining and write the components in the following way: &lt;math&gt;\underline{k} = (k , \omega /c )&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\underline{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave four-vector, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is its spacelike component, and &lt;math&gt;\omega /c&lt;/math&gt; is its timelike component. For three space dimensions, where we have a wave vector rather than just a wavenumber, we write &lt;math&gt;\underline{k} = (k , \omega /c )&lt;/math&gt;.

Another example of a four-vector is simply the position vector in spacetime, &lt;math&gt;\underline{x} = ( x, ct )&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\underline{x} = ( \mathbf{x}, ct )&lt;/math&gt; in three space dimensions. The &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; ''multiplies'' the timelike component in this case, because that is what is needed to give it the same dimensions as the spacelike component.



===Proper time===

Classically, the temporal derivative, ''d''/''dt'' acts like a scalar so we can multiply a vector by it, and get another vector.

In relativity ''t'' is part of a four-vector, which means ''d''/''dt'' also is, so we can't simply differentiate vectors with respect to ''t'' and expect to get vectors.

For example, the position of a stationary particle is (0, ''ct'').

Viewed from a frame moving at ''v'' to the right, its position becomes (-''v''&amp;tau;, ''c''&amp;tau;), where &amp;tau;=&amp;gamma;''t'' is the time as measured in the moving frame.

If we differentiate with respect to &amp;tau; the velocity would be (-''v'', ''c'')

If we differentiate with respect to ''t'', we get (0, ''c'') in the stationary frame, which would be (using the Lorentz transform) (-&amp;gamma;''v'', -&amp;gamma;''c'') in the moving frame, if this were a four vector.

These two expressions differ by a factor of &amp;gamma;, when measured in the same frame, so this can not be a four vector.

However, if the moving observer divides by &amp;gamma;, which is the time dilation, they will get the same vector as the stationary observer.

Doing this is equivalent to differentiating by the time ''in the particles own rest frame''. Since this works for the position vector, we can expect it to work for all vectors.

The time measured in a particle's rest frame is called its ''proper time''.

Differentiating a vector with respect to proper time gives another vector, which is the relativistic equivalent of the temporal derivative.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is written from a Visual Basic 6.0 perspective although much of what is said is also valid for Visual Basic 5.0 and Visual Basic 4.0. It does not cover [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.NET]], a rather different language. It covers many different techniques and topics including object oriented programming, optimization of programs and coding guidelines.

; [[/Introduction/]]: This book's sole purpose is to help people better understand Visual Basic.
; [[/History/]]: A timeline of Visual Basic's history.
; [[/Getting Started/]]: VB6 IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is highly useful for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications.
; [[/Simple Arithmetic/]]: Introduction to calculating and operands with Visual Basic.
; [[/Branching|Branching]]: Branching occurs when the program makes a decision.  The flow of execution follows a particular branch like a fork in the road.
; [[/Loops/]]: Loops are control structures used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met.
; [[/Strings/]]: Strings hold printable characters. They are very useful for communicating with human beings and for transferring data between programs and machines in text files and web pages.
; [[/Built In String Functions/]] : Strings can be manipulated using simple string functions.
; [[/Regular Expressions/]] : Complex string matching and manipulation can be achieved using a fairly sophisticated technique of regular expressions.
; [[/Arrays/]]: Arrays are used to group data items of the same type together, to make it easier to search and sort through this data.
; [[/Collections/]]: Array-like containers.
; [[/Dictionaries/]]: Sets of key, value pairs.
; [[/Data Types/]]: A datatype is a specification of the kind of information that a variable can hold, for example, a number or a piece of text.
; [[/Procedures and Functions/]]: A function is a calling procedure or small part of a program that performs some specific task and returns a result; for example the cosine function.
; [[/Error Handling/]]: Errors can be caught, handled and raised.
; [[/Files/]]: While programming, you may want to at some point save data so they may be accessible for further use. This is where file I/O comes in. Visual Basic allows us to perform most operations available in Windows Explorer and DOS command line.
; [[/User Interfaces/]]: Visual Basic supports creation of Graphical User Interfaces, which generally consists of one or more Forms that contain text boxes, labels, buttons, picture boxes, etc.
; [[/Simple Graphics/]]: Visual Basic can easily be used to draw simple graphics such as line drawings and diagrams.
; [[/Windows Dialogs/]]: Windows dialogs are useful when one requires standard interfaces, including opening files, saving files, choosing color and/or font, specifying printer settings.
; [[/Databases/]]: Visual Basic can connect to databases in many different ways.
; [[/Windows API/]]: APIs, short for &quot;application programming interface&quot;, allows you to access a wide array of functions and methods exposed by the operating system or other applications (DLLs), performing operations not normally implemented by the standard virtual machine that Visual Basic provides.
; [[/Subclassing/]]: Visual Basic hides the details of all the messages that Windows sends to an application but you can get at them if you really need to.  Then you can do things that plain Visual Basic cannot.
; [[/External Processes/]]: Sometimes you want to call another program from Visual Basic.
; [[/Object Oriented Programming/]]: There is a lot of complicated talk about Object Oriented Programming but in essence it is quite simple.
; [[/Effective Programming/]]: It isn't enough that the program work, you must be able to maintain it as well.  Effective programmers can read their code as well as write it.
; [[/Idioms/]]: An idiom is a sort of template or generic method of expressing an idea.  In the same way that idioms in a human language make life easier for the both speaker and listener good idioms in computer programming make life easier for the programmer.  Naturally what is idiomatic in one language might not be in another.
; [[/Optimizing Visual Basic/]]: It is often desirable that your program not only does what you want it to do, but it also does it fast and with low memory footprint. Optimizing aims to improve the latter two requirements.
; [[/Examples/]]: This section contains a number of ready made code examples for your use.  They vary from short snippets to complete modules and short demo applications.
:* [[/Snippets/]]
; [[/Case Studies/]]
:* [[/Regular Expression Tester/]]: A small, almost throwaway application that demonstrates that useful application do not need to be either large or complicated.
:* [[/JArithmetic/]]
; [[/The Language/]]: This section summarizes the syntax of Visual Basic and describes all the key concepts that of Visual Basic.  It also notes some features that exist in other languages but do not exist in Visual basic.
; [[/Coding Standards/]]: Consistent style in coding helps everyone to maintain a program whether the maintainer is the original author or not.
; [[/VB6 Command Reference/]]: This section serves as guide to the commands that can be used in Visual Basic.
; [[/Glossary/]]: Brief explanations of various important, difficult or otherwise interesting words and phrases with links to longer explanations in the body of the text.
; [[/Work in Progress/]]: Various unfinished pages.  Please look here for anything obscure or difficult.
; [[/Links/]]
; [[/Contributors/]]

==Related Books==
; [[Data Structures]]: Programs operate on data so knowledge of effective data structures is very important.
; [[Algorithms]]: Many algorithms were described long before computers were available and many have both naive inefficient forms and sophisticated efficient forms.  In many cases this is independent of the implementation language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to use this book==
The first page of the book is an annotated [[../|contents]] list, click the headings with the mouse to go to the page you want to read.

*You will need a copy of Visual Basic. You can see the [http://www.microsoft.com Microsoft US] or [http://www.microsoft.co.uk Microsoft UK] sites for information but [[w:Visual Basic#Legacy development and support|the language has been retired and is now unsupported by Microsoft]]. Visual studio 2005 is also available free of charge on the Microsoft website but only supports VB.net.

*You will often see Visual Basic abbreviated to '''VB''', and for the purpose of conciseness, this guide will use VB from this point onwards.

*VB code is written in US English. There are some key differences you should note, as misspelling code can cause hours of problems. Below is a list of the differences- '''when writing in VB, you should use the right-hand column's spellings''':

'''Many of these words you will not need until you progress into more complex VB'''
&lt;table border= &quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''Commonwealth English'''&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;'''US English (VB)'''&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Analyse&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Analyze&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Millimetres&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Millimeters&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Words which can be spelled with an 'ise' and 'ize' suffix should be spelled with 'ize' in VB.

This book will guide you step-by-step through Visual Basic. Some chapters of this book contain exercises.  The exercises are an integral part of the text and at least some should be tried or you will not get the full benefit of the book.  There are no answers to the exercises because most do not have a single ''correct'' answer.  Physical exercises are done to build muscle and stamina, intellectual exercises are the same thing for the brain.  In almost every case you should be able to think of at least two 'solutions'.  Some exercises require you to write code, please write it and execute it, others expect you to think about or describe something, please write it down even if only on a piece of scrap paper, it helps fix it in your mind.  

If you try an exercise and fail to find a solution please ask for help by adding a comment to the relevant discussion page.  It is of course entirely possible that the exercise is faulty so reports of problems will help the authors too.

Please add comments to the discussion page (click the ''discussion'' button at the top of this page).  If there are specific topics that you want covered please say so in as much detail as you can.

==Terminology==
Please refer to the [[../Glossary/]] for definitions of any unfamiliar words or any words that appear to be used in an unusual sense.

==VB Integrated Development Environment==
Visual Basic has several key components you will need to get acquainted with. The first is the tool box, usually located on the left of the screen. This is used for creating objects on your form. A form is the basic window a user will see upon running your program. What is on the form is what the user sees. Make some picture boxes and command buttons on your screen by clicking the button, then clicking and dragging where you want the object to be placed. The next key feature is the properties of objects. Captions, names, and other properties of objects may be edited here. Now, click an object, and a white window will appear. This is where your code goes. Toward the top of your screen you should see a &quot;play&quot; button, but in Visual Basic it is referred to as the &quot;Run&quot; button. This will run any programs you make. Next to it are the pause, and stop buttons, which are pretty self explanatory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Watering down the bank card admonishments ==

Please '''don't'''. These were written harshly for good reason: you are much better off losing money through an American bank card than a French one. If you don't agree, perhaps you haven't had to protest transactions with cards from each country, as I have. American laws are very generous to bank card holders, for whatever reason, so we have a relaxed attitude towards the cards. It is essential that assistants from the U.S. change that attitude when they obtain a ''carte bancaire''.

For example, I know first-hand that this contributed sentence is false: &quot;Card holders cannot be held responsible for transactions done with their card number or card without the PIN or correct signature.&quot; If it were true, then three different Banque Populaire employees broke the law and should be in prison, since they told me that my not having signed a credit card receipt meant nothing.

I understand your desire to defend all things French, but in this case you are doing more harm than good. The more people who discover a French bank's indifference to bank card fraud '''through their own experience''', the worse it is for France. Let them be warned here, in advance.

[[User:Nathan Hamblen|Nathan]] 18:52, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

To the best of my knowledge it is the case that you are not held liable if the signature is missing.
This does not mean that the bank will not try and cheat you, _especially_ if you are a foreigner.
[[User:83.76.11.222|83.76.11.222]] 16:42, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

Dear Nathan,
I invite you to read [http://www.bnpparibas.net/banque/portail/particulier/Fiche?type=fiche&amp;identifiant=opposition_carte_20020926103601 this page from BNP/Paribas] and [http://www.rivesparis.banquepopulaire.fr/tsd/commun/index.asp?ID=secuCB this page from Banque Populaire]. Banque Populaire says that, outside of cases of use by a family member or of gross negligence, your responsibility for uses before asking for the card being blocked, without the PIN, is limited to 150€.
This 150€ limit is also given by the [ttp://www.minefi.gouv.fr/DGCCRF/04_dossiers/consommation/ficonso/b25.htm?ru=04 Ministry of Finances]' repression of frauds services (DGCCRF), which also states that no responsibility is incurred for fraudulent use of the card number without the card. They are probably a much better authority on this than you and I.

That said, it is well possible that there was a misunderstanding with the bank employees, that they would have preferred not to refund you money, etc. Note also that, even if the bank is legally bound to refund you, it may choose to &quot;drag its heels&quot;.

By the way, not every salesperson telling bullshit goes to prison. Remember, this is France, with a low carceral population. If you think that the bank has acted illegally, you should have probably contacted a  DGCCRF branch or a consumer's association such as UFC-Que choisir.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Multi-tasking ===
[[w:Computer multitasking|Multi-tasking]] is a process by which multiple tasks (also known as [[#Processes|processes]]), share common processing resources such as a [[w:Central processing unit|CPU]].

A computer with a single CPU, will only run one process at a time. By ''running'' it means that in a specific point in time, the CPU is actively executing instructions for that process. With a single CPU, systems using [[w:Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] can achieve multi-tasking, by which the time of the processor is time-shared by several processes, permitting each to advance their computations, seemingly in parallel. A process runs for some time and another waiting gets a turn.

The act of reassigning a CPU from one task to another one is called a [[w:context switch|context switch]]. When context switches occur frequently enough, the illusion of [[w:Parallel computing|parallelism]] is achieved.

{{NOTE|Context switching has a cost; when deciding to use multi-tasks, a programmer must be aware of trade-offs in performance.}}

Even on computers with more than one CPU, [[w:multiprocessor|multiprocessor]] machines, multi-tasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are CPUs. 

Operating systems may adopt one of many different [[w:Scheduling (computing)|scheduling strategies]], which generally fall into the following categories:
* In ''[[w:multiprogramming|multiprogramming]]'' systems, the running task keeps running until it performs an operation that requires waiting for an external event (e.g. reading from a tape) or until the computer's scheduler forcibly swaps the running task out of the CPU. Multiprogramming systems are designed to maximize CPU usage.
* In ''[[w:time-sharing|time-sharing]]'' systems, the running task is required to relinquish the CPU, either voluntarily or by an external event such as a [[w:hardware interrupt|hardware interrupt]]. Time sharing systems are designed to allow several programs to execute apparently simultaneously.  The term ''time-sharing'' used to define this behavior is no longer in use, having been replaced by the term ''multi-tasking''.
* In ''[[w:Real-time computing|real-time]]'' systems, some waiting tasks are guaranteed to be given the CPU when an external event occurs. Real time systems are designed to control mechanical devices such as industrial robots, which require timely processing.

Multi-tasking has already been successfully integrated into current Operating Systems. Most computers in use today supports running several processes at a time. This is required for systems using [[w:Symmetric multiprocessing|symmetric multiprocessor (SMP)]] in ''distributed computing'' and [[w:Multi-core processor|multi-core or chip multiprocessors (CMPs)]] computing, where processors have gone from dual-core to quad-core and core number will continue to increase. Each technology has its specific limitations and applicability, but all these technologies share the common objective of performing concurrent processing.

{{NOTE|Due to the general adoption of the new paradigm it becomes extremely important to prepare your code for it (plan for scalability), understand guarantees regarding parallelization, and select external libraries that provide the required support.}}

=== Processes ===
[[w:process (computing)|Process]]es are independent execution units that contain their own state information, use their own address spaces, and only interact with each other via [[w:Inter-process_communication|inter-process communication]] ''(IPC)'' mechanisms . A process can be said to at least contain one thread of execution (not to be confused to a complete thread construct). Processes are managed by the hosting OS in a process data structure. The maximum number of processes that can run concurrently, depend on the OS and on the available resources of that system.

==== Child Process ====
A '''child process''' (also [[w:spawn process|spawn process]]), is a process that was created by another process (the [[w:parent process|parent process]]), inheriting most of the parent attributes, such as opened files. Each process may create many child processes but will have at most one parent process; if a process does not have a parent this usually indicates that it was created directly by the [[w:kernel (computer science)|kernel]].

In [[w:Unix|UNIX]], a child process is in fact created (using [[w:fork (operating system)|fork]]) as a copy of the parent. The child process can then [[w:overlay (operating system)|overlay]] itself with a different program (using &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Exec (operating system)|exec]]&lt;/tt&gt;) as required. The very first process, called [[w:init|init]], is started by the kernel at booting time and never terminates; other parentless processes may be launched to carry out various [[w:daemon (computing)|daemon]] tasks in [[w:userspace|userspace]]. Another way for a process to end up without a parent is, if its parent dies leaving an [[w:orphan process|orphan process]]; but in this case it will shortly be adopted by init.

==== Inter-Process Communication (IPC) ====
IPC is generally managed by the operating system.

===== Shared Memory =====
Most of more recent OSs provide some sort of memory protection. In a Unix system, each process is given its own virtual address space, and the system, in turn, guarantees that no process can access the memory area of another. If an error occurs on a process, only that process memory's contents can be corrupted. 

With shared memory, the need of enabling random-access to shared data between different processes is addressed. But declaring a given section of memory as simultaneously accessible by several processes raises the need for control and synchronization, since several processes might try to alter this memory area at the same time.

=== Multi-Threading ===
Until recently, the C++ standard did not include any specification or built-in support for multi-threading. Therefore, [[w:Thread (computer science)|Threading]] had to be implemented using special threading libraries, which are often platform dependent, as an extension to the C++ standard.

{{NOTE|The new C++0x standard supports multi-threading, reducing the need to know multiple APIs and increasing the portability of code.}} 

Some popular C++ threads libraries include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(This list is not intended to be complete.)&lt;/small&gt;

* [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost|Boost]] - This package includes several libraries, one of which is threads (concurrent programming). the boost threads library is not very full featured, but is complete, portable, robust and in the flavor of the C++ standard. Uses the boost license that is similar to the BSD license.
* [[w:Intel_Threading_Building_Blocks|Intel® Threading Building Blocks]]  [http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org ''(TBB)''] offers a rich approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. The library helps you take advantage of multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading expert. Threading Building Blocks is not just a threads-replacement library. It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanism for performance and scalability and performance. It is an open source project under the GNU General Public License version two (GPLv2) with the runtime exception.
* [[w:Intel_Cilk_Plus|Intel® Cilk™ Plus]]  [http://www.cilkplus.org ''(Intel® Cilk™ Plus)''] adds simple language extensions to the C and C++languages to express task and data parallelism. These language extensions are powerful, yet easy to apply and use in a wide range of applications.
* [[w:Adaptive Communication Environment|Adaptive Communication Environment]] (often referred to as ''ACE'') - Another toolkit which includes a portable threads abstraction along with many many other facilities, all rolled into one library. Open source released under a nonstandard but nonrestrictive license.
* [[w:ZThreads|Zthreads]] - A portable thread abstraction library. This library is feature rich, deals only with concurrency and is open source licensed under the MIT license. 

Of course, you can access the full POSIX and the C language threads interface from C++ and on Windows the API. So why bother with a library on top of that?

The reason is that things like locks are resources that are allocated, and C++ provides abstractions to make managing these things easier. For instance, &lt;code&gt;boost::scoped_lock&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses object construction/destruction to insure that a mutex is unlocked when leaving the lexical scope of the object. Classes like this can be very helpful in preventing deadlock, race conditions, and other problems unique to threaded programs. Also, these libraries enable you to write cross-platform multi-threading code, while using platform-specific function cannot.

In any case when using ''threading methodology'', dictates that you must identify '''hotspots''', the segments of code that take the most execution time. To determine the best chance at achieving the maximum performance possible, the task can be approached from ''bottom-up'' and ''top-down'' to determine those code segments that can run in parallel.

In the ''bottom-up'' approach, one focus solely on the hotspots in the code. This requires a deep analysis of the call stack of the application to determine the sections of code that can be run in parallel and reduce hotspots. In hotspot sections that employ concurrency, it is still required to move that concurrency at a point higher up in the call stack as to increase the [[#Computation_granularity|granularity]] of each thread execution.

Using the ''top-down'' approach, the focus is on all the parts of the application, in determining what computations can be coded to run in parallel, at a higher level of abstraction. Reducing the level of abstraction until the overall performance gains are sufficient to reach the necessary goals, the benefit being speed of implementation and code re-usability. This is also the best method for archiving a optimal level of [[#Computation_granularity|granularity]] for all computations.

;'''Threads vs. Processes'''
Both threads and processes are methods of parallelizing an application, its implementation may differ from one [[w:operating system|operating system]] to another. A process has always one thread of execution, also known as the '''primary thread'''. In general, a thread is contained inside a process (in the address space of the process) and different threads of the same process share some resources while different processes do not.

==== Atomicity ====
Atomicity refers to '''atomic''' operations that are '''indivisible''' and/or '''uninterruptible'''. Even on a single core, you cannot assume that an operation will be atomic. In that regard only when using assembler can one guarantee the atomicity of an operation. Therefore, the C++ standard provides some guarantees as do operating systems and external libraries.

An '''atomic operation''' can also be seen as any given set of [[w:Instruction (computer science)|operation]]s that can be combined so that they appear to the rest of the system to be a single operation with only two possible outcomes: success or failure. This all depends on the level of abstraction and underlying guarantees.

All modern processors provide basic '''atomic primitives''' which are then used to build more complex atomic objects. In addition to atomic read and write operations, most platforms provide an atomic read-and-update operation like [[w:test-and-set|test-and-set]] or [[w:compare-and-swap|compare-and-swap]], or a pair of operations like [[w:Load-Link/Store-Conditional|load-link/store-conditional]] that only have an effect if they occur atomically (that is, with no intervening, conflicting update). These can be used to implement [[w:Lock (software engineering)|locks]], a vital mechanism for multi-threaded programming, allowing invariants and atomicity to be enforced across groups of operations.

Many [[w:central processing unit|processors]], especially [[w:32-bit|32-bit]] ones with [[w:64-bit|64-bit]] [[w:floating point|floating point]] support, provide some read and write operations that are not atomic: one [[w:Thread (computer science)|thread]] reading a 64-bit register while another thread is writing to it may see a combination of both &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; values, a combination that may never actually have been written to the register. Further, only single operations are guaranteed to be atomic; threads arbitrarily performing groups of reads and writes will also observe a mixture of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; values. Clearly, invariants cannot be relied on when such effects are possible.

If not dealing with known guaranteed atomic operations, one should rely on the synchronization primitives at the level of abstraction that one is coding to.

;'''Example''' - One process
For example, imagine a single process is running on a computer incrementing a value in a given [[w:memory location|memory location]]. To increment the value in that memory location:
:# the process reads the value in the memory location;
:# the process adds one to the value;
:# the process writes the new value back into the memory location.

;'''Example''' - Two processes
Now, imagine two processes are running incrementing a single, shared memory location:
# the first process reads the value in memory location;
# the first process adds one to the value;
but before it can write the new value back to the memory location it is suspended, and the second process is allowed to run:
# the second process reads the value in memory location, the ''same'' value that the first process read;
# the second process adds one to the value;
# the second process writes the new value into the memory location.
The second process is suspended and the first process allowed to run again:
# the first process writes a now-wrong value into the memory location, unaware that the other process has already updated the value in the memory location.

This is a trivial example. In a real system, the operations can be more complex and the errors introduced extremely subtle. For example, reading a 64-bit value from memory may actually be implemented as two [[w:sequence|sequential]] reads of two 32-bit memory locations. If a process has only read the first 32-bits, and before it reads the second 32-bits the value in memory gets changed, it will have neither the original value nor the new value but a mixed-up [[w:garbage (computer science)|garbage]] value.

Furthermore, the specific order in which the processes run can change the results, making such an error difficult to detect and debug.

;'''OS and portability'''
Considerations are not only necessary with regard to the underling hardware but also in dealing with the different OS APIs. When porting code across different OSs one should consider what guarantees are provided. Similar considerations are necessary when dealing with external libraries. 

{{NOTE|For instance on the Macintosh, the set file position call is atomic, whereas on Windows, it's a pair of calls.}}

==== Race condition ====
A '''[[w:Race_condition#Computing|race condition]]''' (''data race'', or simply ''race''), occurs when data is accessed concurrently from multiple execution paths. It happens for instance when multiple threads have shared access to the same resource such as a file or a block of memory, and at least one of the accesses is a write. This can lead to interference with one another.

Threaded programming is built around predicates and shared data. It is necessary to identify all possible execution paths and identify truly independent computations. To avoid problems it is best to implement concurrency at the highest level possible.

Most ''race conditions'' occur due to an erroneous assumption about the order in which threads will run. When dealing with shared variables, never assume that a threaded write operation will precede a threaded read operation. If you need guarantees you should see if synchronization primitives are available, and if not, you should implement your own. 

===== Locking =====
[[w:Lock_(computer_science)|Locking]] temporarily prevents un-shareable resources from being used simultaneously. Locking can be achieved by using a synchronization object.

One of the biggest problems with threading is that locking requires analysis and understanding of the data and code relationships. This complicates software development--especially when targeting multiple operating systems. This makes multi-threaded programming more like art than science.

The number of locks (depending on the synchronization object) may be limited by the OS. A lock can be set to protect more than one resource, if always accessed in the same critical region.

===== Critical section =====
A [[w:Critical_section|critical section]] is a region defined as critical to the parallelization of code execution. The term is used to define code  sections that need to be executed in isolation with respect to other code in the program.

This is a common fundamental concept. These sections of code need to be protected by a synchronization technique as they can create  ''race conditions''.

===== Deadlock =====
A [[w:Deadlock|deadlock]] is said to happen whenever there is a lock operation that results in a never-ending waiting cycle among concurrent threads.

==== Synchronization ====
Except when used to guarantee the correct execution of a parallel computation, synchronization is an overhead. Attempt to keep it to a minimum by taking advantage of the [[#Thread local storage (TLS)|thread's local storage]] or by using exclusive memory locations.

===== Computation granularity =====
''Computation granularity'' is loosely defined as the amount of computation performed before any synchronization is needed. The longer the time between synchronizations, the less granularity the computation will have. When dealing with the requirements for parallelism, it will mean being easier to scale to an increased number of threads and having lower overhead costs. A high level of granularity can mean that any benefit from using threads will be lost due to the requirements of synchronization and general thread overhead.

===== Mutex =====
[[w:Mutual exclusion|Mutex]] is an abbreviation for ''mutual exclusion''. It relies on a synchronization facility supplied by the operating system (not the CPU). Since this system objects can only be owned by a single thread at any given time, the mutex object facilitates protection against data races and allows for thread-safe synchronization of data between threads. By calling one of the lock functions, the thread obtains ownership of a mutex object, it then relinquishes ownership by calling the corresponding unlock function. Mutexes can be either recursive or non-recursive, and may grant simultaneous ownership to one or many threads.

===== Semaphore =====
A [[w:Semaphore_(programming)|semaphore]] is a ''yielding'' synchronization object that can be used to synchronize several threads. This is the most commonly used method for synchronization

===== Spinlock =====
[[w:Spinlock|Spinlocks]] are ''busy-wait'' synchronization objects, used as a substitute for Mutexes. They are an implementation of inter-thread locking using machine dependent assembly instructions (such as test-and-set) where a thread simply waits (''spins'') in a loop that repeatedly checks if the lock becomes available (''busy wait''). This is why spinlocks perform better if locked for a short period of time. They are never used on single-CPU machines.

==== Threads ====
Threads are by definition a coding construct and part of a [[w:computer program|program]] that enable it to [[w:Fork_(operating_system)|fork]] (or split) itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running [[w:task (computers)|task]]s. Threads use [[w:pre-emptive multitasking|pre-emptive multi-tasking]]. 

The thread is the basic unit (the smallest piece of code) to which the operating system can allocate a distinct processor time (schedule) for execution. This means that, threads in reality, don't run concurrently but in sequence on any single core system.  Threads often depend on the OS thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and resume another thread.

The thread today is not only a key concurrency model supported by most if not all modern computers, programming languages, and operating systems but is itself at the core of hardware evolution, such as symmetric multi-processors, understanding threads is now a necessity to all programmers.

The order of execution of the threads is controlled by the process scheduler of the OS, it is non-deterministic. The only control available to the programmer is in attributing a priority to the thread but never assume a particular order of execution.

{{TODO|Thread quantum}}

===== User Interface Thread =====
This type of distinction is reserved to indicate that the particular thread implements a message map to respond to events and messages generated by user inputs as he interacts with the application. This is especially common when working with the Windows platform (Win32 API) because of the way it implements message pumps.

===== Worker Thread =====
This distinction serves to specify threads that do not directly depend or are part of the graphical user interface of the application, and run concurrently with the main execution thread.

===== Thread local storage (TLS) =====
The residence of thread local variables, a thread dedicated section of the global [[w:Computer storage|memory]]. Each thread (or fiber) will receive its own stack space, residing in a different memory location. This will consist of both reserved and initially committed memory. That is freed when the thread exits but will not be freed if the thread is terminated by other means.

Since all threads in a [[w:Process (computing)|process]] share the same [[w:address space|address space]], it makes data in a static or [[w:global variable|global variable]] to be normally located at the same memory location, when referred to by threads from the same process. It is important for software to take in consideration hardware cache coherence. For instance in multiprocessor environments, each processor has a local cache. If threads on different processors modify variables residing on the same cache line, this will invalidate that cache line, forcing a cache update, hurting performance. This is referred to as '''false sharing'''.

This type of storage is indicated for variables that store temporary or even partial results, since condensing the needed synchronization of the partial results in as fewer and infrequent instances possible will contribute to the reduction of synchronization overhead.

===== Thread Synchronization =====
The synchronization can be defined in several steps the first is the process lock, where a process is made to halt execution due to find a protected resource locked, there is a cost for locking especially if the lock lasts for too long.

Obviously there is a performance hit if any synchronization mechanism is heavily used. Because they are an expensive operation, in certain cases, increasing the use of TLSs instead of relying only on shared data structures will reduce the need for synchronization.

The completed task then &quot;leaves&quot; the thread pool and joins the completed tasks list (yellow circles)..]]
{{clear}}

==== Fibers ====
A [[w:Fiber_(computer_science)|fiber]] is a particularly lightweight [[w:thread of execution|thread of execution]]. Like threads, fibers share [[w:address space|address space]]. However, fibers use [[w:Computer multitasking#Cooperative multitasking/time-sharing|co-operative multi-tasking]], fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing.

;Operating system support
Less support from the [[w:operating system|operating system]] is needed for fibers than for threads. They can be implemented in modern [[w:Unix|Unix]] systems using the library functions [[w:setcontext|&lt;code&gt;''getcontext''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;''setcontext''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''swapcontext''&lt;/code&gt;]] in &lt;code&gt;ucontext.h&lt;/code&gt;, as in [[w:GNU Portable Threads|GNU Portable Threads]].

On [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]], fibers are created using the &lt;code&gt;''ConvertThreadToFiber''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''CreateFiber''&lt;/code&gt; calls; a fiber that is currently suspended may be resumed in any thread. Fiber-local storage, analogous to [[w:thread-local storage|thread-local storage]], may be used to create unique copies of variables.

[[w:Symbian OS|Symbian OS]] uses a similar concept to fibers in its Active Scheduler. An [[w:Active object (Symbian OS)|Active object (Symbian OS)]] contains one fiber to be executed by the Active Scheduler when one of several outstanding asynchronous calls complete. Several Active objects can be waiting to execute (based on priority) and each one must restrict is own execution time.

=== Exploiting parallelism ===
Most of the parallel architecture research was done in the 1960s and 1970s, providing solutions for problems that only today are reaching general awareness. As the need of concurrent programming increases, mostly due to today's hardware evolution, we as programmers are pressed to implement programming models that ease the complicated process of dealing with the old thread model in a way it preserves development time by abstracting the problem.

Believe it or not, global warming is not a modern event. Throughout the Earth's history, climate graphs have shown that the temperature has increased and decreased continuously, the difference today being the speed at which the warming is happening. However, what we need to focus on for the GCSE is the rapid global warming that is happening today (often incorrectly referred to as '''Climate Change'''), its causes, consequences and ways in which it can be minimised.

==Causes==

Okay, so you've heard about in the news millions of times. But what is actually causing global warming? 

Well, global warming is caused by an increasing amount of '''Greenhouse gases''' in the atmosphere - which are Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrogen Dioxide (Nitrous Oxide) and Water Vapour are greenhouse gases which cause the '''Greenhouse effect'''. Be careful when mentioning these gases, as you may be tricked into using the names of other gases. 

Sulphur Dioxide is '''not''' a greenhouse gas as it does not absorb the sun's heat, but it causes acid rain. Aerosols cause depletion of the Ozone layer, and, whilst contributing to Global Warming, are of no relation to the Greenhouse Effect.

You will not need to explain why the greenhouse gases absorb the sun's heat. However you WILL need to explain that human activity is responsible for adding extra quantities of these gases to the atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapour are the most common greenhouse gases, as they are released from car exhausts, power stations and pretty much every other combustion reaction there is. Methane is released from rice paddies and, of course, from passing wind.

==Consequences==

The consequences of global warming are not fully understood, however there is significant scientific evidence that it is causing '''Climatic Change'''. Be careful here, as Global Warming is the increase in the Earth's average temperature, whereas Climatic Change is when the weather changes in a certain place, so try to avoid mixing the two phrases. 

In the Sahel region in Sub-Saharan Africa, over the past decade, there has been a significant decrease in rainfall and droughts are becoming commonplace. The decrease in rainfall here causes an increase elsewhere, which can increase the problem of flooding in other areas.

Another effect of global warming is the melting of the polar ice caps - the North and South Pole. A hotter termperature obviously causes the ice to melt, which will add to the level of water in the oceans - and a higher level of water means a greater risk of flooding. Throughout the world, there are many flat and low-lying countries and cities that are at considerable risk from flooding. Bangladesh is one of the most flood prone countries in the world and there will be a higher chance of floods striking the country, causing death and damage to thousands of people.

A '''filet knife''' is a thin, flexible knife, usually around 6 inches (150 mm) in length.  The blade is is usually much more shallow than the tang.  These characteristics give the filet knife excellent mobility when being used to filet cuts of meat or fish, allowing it to manoeuvre around bones. This also aids in removing the skin from fish by allowing the user to flex the blade along the countertop.  Filet knives are typically kept very sharp in order to minimize the amount of damage the edge does.

It is important that any knives are kept sharp, as blunt knives require more force to use, actually increasing the likelihood of injury (cuts from a sharp knife heal more quickly than those from a blunt one). A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|knife sharpener]] can be used to sharpen knives.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the majority of these suggestions are fairly worthless.  
*Sometimes it is necessary to create an object outside of a block and it must be initilaized.  The most efficient way is to use a null.
*Making all fields final does nothing.  A final field means it cannot be changed and an object often needs to be mutable.  A good programmer will always check if something is null if he is unsure
*Using the {...} constructor for arrays is only useful if you are filling it as it is defined.  Again, the new Object[...] syntax is fine if the programmer is smart enough not to check for null data before using it.

----

I think you mean to declare a variable outside a block, e.g., in the following code I want to find a String that starts with a b.

 String[] strings={&quot;banana&quot;,&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;pear&quot;};
 String found=null;
 
 for (int a=0;a&lt;strings.length &amp;&amp; found==null;a++)
    if (strings[a].startsWith(&quot;b&quot;))
       found=strings[a];
 
 System.out.println(found);

This would be simpler without null:

 String[] strings={&quot;banana&quot;,&quot;apple&quot;,&quot;pear&quot;};
 
 for (int a=0;a&lt;strings.length;a++)
    if (strings[a].startsWith(&quot;b&quot;))
       System.out.println(found);

If this doesn't clarify things, please provide a code example where null is preferable.

Yes, an object often needs to be mutable.  But often an object doesn't need to be mutable, and where that is true, final may be useful.  Note that the rules are not intended to be applied to ALL code.

Using {...} for arrays is only useful if you are filling it as it is defined.  I absolutely agree.  If you are not filling it as it is defined, then you should be using a Collection, which will grow as you fill it.  Again, provide a code example.

I think assuming that programmers are smart is a bad idea.  Even good programmers have bad days.

Most of the case you want to initialize object references to null, when you have try block, you want to create the object in the try block, and also you need the object in the catch block for logging porposes.  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 23:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

== Make all fields final ==

The final keyword will convert the variables to constants, but what if I need a variable.
I'd like to delete that whole section 'Make all fields final', is nothing to do with preventing NullPointerExceptions. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 03:19, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Do not use reflection (thus cheating to create an array full of null pointers) ==

I'd like to delete this one also, because usually we would use reflection only when that is needed. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 03:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
:I agree with you. It should not appear here. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 18:46, 9 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
An XHTML DTD describes the allowed syntax and grammar of XHTML markup. Every XHTML document ''must start'' with a DTD declaration and a line of code that declares that you are starting to write XHTML code.

This is the mandatory minimum way to start an XHTML document:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org
/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;

&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


== The Three Document Type Definitions ==
There are currently three XHTML 1.0 document types:
*Strict
*Transitional
*Frameset

== XHTML 1.0 Strict ==
This is used when the user wants a clean markup, free of presentational clutter. Use this in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org
/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 1.0 Transitional ==
Use this when taking advantage of XHTML's presentational features and when you want to support browsers that do not understand Cascading Style Sheets. This is the one that is favoured to use amongst developers and is used commonly.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org
/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 1.0 Frameset ==
Use this when you want to use XHTML Frames to partition the browser window into two or more frames.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org /TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 1.1 ==
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== XHTML 2.0 ==
XHTML was a working draft, but its development was halted in favour of HTML 5.0.  Even though the specification will not be completed, its doctype is: 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 2.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml2.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several kinds of functions that use or create lists. These functions are found in the LIST menus. The LIST menus are accessed by the 2nd function of the STAT key. It is just below the DEL key. There are a variety of mathematical operations that can be done on lists.  These are found in the LIST MATH menu.  These functions result in a single number answer.

=== min( and max( ===

The minimum function ('''2nd LIST MATH 1''') results in the smallest number in the list.  The maximum function ('''2nd LIST MATH 2''') gives the largest number in the list.

:{4,7,2,5} STO&gt; L1
::::{4 7 2 5}
:min(L1)
::::2
:max(L1)
::::7
:min({-3,-8,-1,-4})
::::-8
:max({-3,-8,-1,-4})
::::-1

=== mean( ===

The averaging function ('''2nd LIST MATH 3''') calculates the arithmetic mean of the numbers in the list by adding them up and dividing by the number of items added.

:{2,3,5,6,14} STO&gt; L1
::::{2 3 5 6 14}
:mean(L1)
::::6
:mean({40,23,64,14,51})
::::38.4


=== median( ===

The median function ('''2nd LIST MATH 4''') finds an average in a different way from the mean.  If the list of numbers were listed in order from smallest to largest, the median is the middle number.

:{2,3,5,6,14} STO&gt; L1 
::::{2 3 5 6 14} 
:median(L1) 
::::5 
:median({40,23,64,14,51}) 
::::40 

If there are an even number of numbers, there is no single middle number.  The median in this case if the mean of the two middle numbers.  (Add them and divide by 2.)

:median({1.3,1.8,1.1,1.6})
::::1.45

The result, 1.45, is half way between 1.3 and 1.6.

=== sum( and prod( ===

The sum function ('''2nd LIST MATH 5''') adds up all the items in a list.  The product function ('''2nd LIST MATH 6''') multiplies all the items in a list together.  

:sum({3,5,6})
::::14
:prod({3,5,6})
::::90
:sum({-4,-2,5,10})
::::9
:prod({-4,-2,5,10})
::::400
:prod({4,3,2,1,0,-1})
::::0


=== stdDev( and variance( ===

The standard deviation function ('''2nd LIST MATH 7''') and the variance function ('''2nd LIST MATH 8''') give the results of their statistical calulations.

:stdDev({4,5,6,8,11})
::::2.77
:variance({4,5,6,8,11})
::::7.7

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is to identify and detail the differences between the TI-83 and the TI-86 graphing calculators.  The sections below will detail the differences in keyboard layout, differences in keystrokes, and differences in functionality.

== Menus ==

=== List menu ===
The LIST menu is the 2nd function on the subtraction key.

=== Stat menu ===
The Stat menu is the 2nd function on the addition key.

=== List Edit menu ===
The List Edit menu can be accessed by two different routes.  From the [[#List menu|List menu]] it is at F4.  From the [[#Stat menu|Stat menu]] it is at F2.  The lists originally displayed are the ones that are used for the statistical calculations:  xStat, yStat, and fStat.

== Key locations ==

=== Curly Brackets ===
The curly brackets are in the [[#LIST menu|LIST menu]].

=== Comma ===
The comma key is left of the 4 key.

== Functionality ==

=== Saving values in a variable ===
Pressing the STO&gt; key on the TI-86 puts the calculator into Caps Lock mode.  Since most variable names are made up of letters, this is considered handy by most TI-86 users.

=== List variable names ===
Any variable name can be used for a list.  Most people avoid single letter names, for they are mostly used for numeric varables.  Press the STO&gt; key and type in the list name.

}}

Everyone who starts a new career or hobby in 3D Modeling also seems to look around their immediate environment for things to model.  Things like your computer monitor, your keyboard, and even the desktop which they are resting are all common &quot;first models.&quot;  Developing an eye for geometry takes time and this is a great chance to practice.

For this tips and techniques discussion, I'll start with the concepts of furniture and walls, but the ideas really extend to anything and everything you can model in Blender, from spaceships to fantasy demon-women, from your barbecue deck blueprints to biologically accurate squids.

== Assemble Things, Don't Chisel Them ==

Let's start with the furniture around you.

You may think it's easy to model your desk using a couple of boolean operations on cubes.  But it rarely comes out looking quite right.  It seems like such a good idea at first.  Then you find that the drawers won't open realistically.  The corners are all amazingly sharp and crisp.  The writing surface seems to be at the wrong scale for thickness.  The woodgrain goes in the same direction everywhere.  You then realize it will be hard to bevel just the few edges that need beveling.  The more you look at it, even with good render settings, the more it looks like dollhouse furniture instead of a real life, full size desk.

Real furniture is not chiseled out of a half-ton cube of mahogany, because trees don't grow that thick, and it's a real waste to chip out the spaces for drawers.  Instead, cabinetmakers tend to assemble a piece of furniture from many component parts.  Think of those &quot;self-assembly&quot; kits from the local superstore, or even the showroom examples from a nearby unfinished knotty pine store.

Model several kinds of boards and fittings, then copy and assemble them appropriately.  You don't need to model every nail and dowel, and you don't even need to know what a [[w:dovetail joint|dovetail joint]] is.  But you can make realistic furniture when you build things from their natural components.

* Cut lumber in a variety of sizes and thicknesses.
* Measure real example furniture and take note of the construction details.
* Choose varying woodgrains by duplicating materials and adjusting them to be more individual.
* Align those woodgrains or other materials in an appropriate direction and scale for the model.
* Bevel just the parts or edges which are naturally worn or intentionally beveled.
* Any cloth, glass or metal fittings are separate components using their own materials.
* Create an &quot;Empty&quot; type object, give it a descriptive name, and parent all of the pieces to it.

There are a couple more benefits to this form of component modeling:

* Working with things made from multiple real materials is easier:  one object, one material.
* The model is more flexible, because they can be reconfigured to other styles more easily.
* Components come in handy for other models:  adapt a desk's drawers in kitchen cabinets and bedroom furniture.

== Separate Objects for each Material ==

[[image:skateboard-example.jpg|right|thumb|300px|skateboards, modeled in parts]]

A common question for new modelers is how to make one mesh that uses more than one material.  For example, a skateboard with metal trucks, rubber tires, and a wooden deck.  While Blender does provide an interface to allow such a combination, it is not usually the best approach for modeling realistically.

If you model the skateboard as separate parts, based on the way different real parts are assembled, then you have a lot more control over the final model.  You can replace the wheels or use trucks of different styles later.  You can adjust the mesh that defines the shape of the deck, without having to re-assign the areas that should be one material or the other.  And lastly, you can choose to use subsurface tricks on the various parts, while avoiding them on other parts.  Even if the whole model needs subsurfaces, it becomes a bit hard to control where one material starts, and another material ends.

== Removing the Fourth Wall ==

Just as with furniture, you may model your first building interior as a hollowed-out cube.  It seems straightforward to make a big cube, turn it inside out, and call it a living room.  There are a lot of drawbacks to working with a room that was carved out of a single chunk of solid rock.

Buildings and rooms are assembled from parts.  Just like the furniture modeling tip, design your rooms as a collection of separate pieces.

* You don't need to measure out the internal beams and joists, but remember they're there.
* Each interior or exterior wall should be its own object or assembly.
* Take care to note the correct dimensions and placement of doorways, windows, ceiling.

The benefits of a component-modeled interior include:

* Easier to see inside, just hide some walls on a different layer.
* Walls are much easier to move around to reconfigure the room layout.
* The same modeling work on one area can be copied to other rooms more easily.
* A more realistic architecture with consistent scaling is achieved quickly.

== Proportions and Measurements ==

For realism, it's vitally important to get the right proportions for familiar objects.  If your audience sees a bookshelf with 5&quot; thick shelves, or a human hand which has a 5&quot; long thumb, their brain is going to tell them that something is wrong.  They might not be able to decide why, but they'll tell you it looks fake.

Even when you're animating fantasy characters, you should develop an understanding for proportion.  Many cartoon characters have very large heads when compared to their bodies;  this allows room for greater expression and makes the characters seem younger.  Deciding how many &quot;heads high&quot; each character should appear will ensure that your figures all maintain proper proportions to each other and to their environment.

[[image:soda-can-example.jpg|right|thumb|300px|soda cans and glass, modeled in parts]]

To get good proportions, you need to think about measurements.

* Grab a ruler or find some existing blueprints.
* Think in terms of those measurements for the duration of the project.
* Choose a base scale that will let you work comfortably within a 500x500x500 unit volume.
* Blender limits cameras to 1000 unit distances, for better numerical accuracy.

You can mix and match base units, by using Empty objects as parents.  For example, you can model your furniture in inches or centimeters, and model your house in feet or meters.  Then when you append your bed.blend's objects, just parent that bed to a new Empty object, and scale the Empty.  This will conveniently scale all of the separate component pieces of the object together.

There's only one big wrinkle with working with multiple scales:  materials should be designed with a certain base scale in mind.  Many material surface properties are scaled according to the units you choose for a given object, or the world units.  Just consider this as you design, and check your work critically.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called WCFrancis. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name WCFrancis~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Picture scrubbing a floor on your knees. This &lt;i&gt;chore&lt;/i&gt; will make your &lt;i&gt;knees&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;black&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;In Russia, caffeinated soft drinks always come in yellow cans, and they have  twice the caffeine of American soft drinks, so anything you drink out of a yellow can will make you &lt;i&gt;jolty&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

==Rooms and Furniture==

Russian rooms usually end in ''ная''. Think of the 1994 movie &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; as if it were a room on 42nd Street.

&lt;table cols=4 border=0&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; 
	&lt;td&gt;крыша&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Roof&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Krýsha&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;In Russia they make roof shingles by krishing aluminum cans.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;!-- end entry --&gt;

&lt;!-- start entry --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; 
	&lt;td&gt;чердак&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;noun&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Attic&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Chyerdák&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russians put their old chairs in the attic, and a dock is where ships are tied up when not in use, so a Russian attic is a &lt;i&gt;chair dock&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;Russian bedrooms have a below-ground hot tub or spa. Also, waking up is &quot;la juice spot,&quot; so &quot;spat&quot; and &quot;spal&quot; go together.&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;Léstnitsa&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;American stairways are hard on your knees. Russian stairways are designed to demand &lt;i&gt;less knee&lt;/i&gt; effort.  Also &quot;forest&quot; is лесно́й so a staircase is a forest of stairs.&lt;/td&gt;

These memory aids aren't true! They're nonsense made up to help you remember the meanings of Russian words.

==Days of the Week==
 
Russians don't capitalize days of the week.

	&lt;td&gt;sevódnya&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td colspan=4&gt;The г here is pronounced as a в. It sounds like &quot;с его дня&quot;, which would mean &quot;from his day&quot;, if день were an animate noun. But it's not.  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

Why don't you put your name on the Wikijunior book you contributed to?
Thanks for helping us get the Stegosaurus right. They are formidable creatures!
I'm glad you're doing such good writing at such an early age, and for kids not much younger than you. You will be able to give us a perspective.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Snowcatben. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Snowcatben~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page explains the concept of gender in language. If you have studied another language that has gender, such as French or Spanish, and so are familiar with grammatical gender, feel free to skip this section.

== What gender is ==
'Gender' is a way of categorising nouns in a language. In most languages, words are described as being 'masculine' or 'feminine', and a lot of languages, including Russian, also have words described as 'neuter' (i.e., neutral, or no gender). In languages like French, the gender of a particular word is mostly arbitrary: there's nothing in the word ''peau'' ('skin') that tells us it's a ''feminine'' word, and so a word's gender is largely just something you have to learn. Fortunately, in Russian, gender ''can'' be predicted. Like most other things in Russian, the gender of a noun is denoted by what letters are on the end of the word:
: Masculine nouns end in a consonant: '''б, в, г, д, ж, з, й к, л, м, н, п, р, с, т, ф, х, ч, ц, ш''', or '''щ'''. Notice that '''й''' is a consonant. For example, '''кролик''' (''&lt;small&gt;KRO&lt;/small&gt;-leek'', 'rabbit') ends in a consonant, '''-к''', so it is a ''masculine'' word.
: Feminine nouns end in '''а''' or '''я'''. For example, '''собака''' (''so-&lt;small&gt;BA&lt;/small&gt;-ka'', 'dog') ends in an '''-a''', so it is a ''feminine'' word.
: Neuter nouns end in '''о''' or '''е'''. For example, '''письмо''' (''pees-&lt;small&gt;MO&lt;/small&gt;'', 'letter') ends in an '''-o''', so it is grammatically ''neuter''.
: Nouns ending in '''-ь''' can be either masculine or feminine. These just have to be memorised.
So, in Russian, nouns have an intrinsic property called 'gender', which comes in three types: masculine, feminine, and neuter. But why is this important?

== What gender is for ==
To learn Russian, you have to be able to know the gender of a noun when you use it. When you modify a noun with an [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives|adjective]] ('nice dog', 'Red Square', 'old door'), the adjective changes its ending to match the gender of the word its modifying. So although adjectives don't have an intrinsic gender, they have a number of different endings they can use to match the gender of their noun. The same is true for [[Russian/Possessive_Pronouns|possessive pronouns]]: the 'my' in 'my dog' ('''моя собака''') and 'my table' ('''мой стол''') are different, as the gender of 'dog' ('''собака''', ''f'') and 'table' ('''стол''', ''m'') are different. [[Russian/Personal Pronouns|Personal pronouns]] (I, we, they, etc) don't usually have any inherent gender, instead taking on the gender of the thing they're referring to - though third-person singular pronouns ''do'' have specific genders: '''он''' ('he'), '''она''' ('she'), and '''оно''' ('it'). Gender also influences how you form the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|past tense]] of [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs|verbs]]: The 'wrote' in 'He wrote' ('''он написал''') and 'she wrote' ('''она написала''') are different, as the genders of the subject of the verb, 'he' and 'she', are different.

So, gender affects a lot of different parts of Russian grammar, and so is an important part of learning Russian. Fortunately, it's easy to learn, and easy to use.

== Plurals ==
Russian uses plurals in much the same way as English. The rules for forming the plural depend on which [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|grammatical case]] the word is in. However, the important thing here is that the rules are largely the same for all nouns, regardless of gender. This carries over into adjectives too: the endings they take on when their noun is plural, are independent  of gender. There's no 'masculine plural' and 'feminine plural' - there's just, 'plural'.

As such, it is perhaps easiest to think of plurals as a 'fourth gender', and this is the way summary tables in this Wikibook will be presented.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adjectives in Russian are simply words that modify nouns. The endings of adjectives change according to the gender, number, and case of the nouns they modify. The rules for changing adjectives is often a lot easier than the rules for changing nouns themselves. There are six cases, and so six main ways of conjugating adjectives to fit the noun they modify. Finally, there are the ''short adjectives'', detailed at the end.

[[File:Red_Square_Security.jpg|thumb|Red Square - Красная Площадь - &lt;br&gt;''&lt;small&gt;KRA&lt;/small&gt;-sna-ya &lt;small&gt;PLO&lt;/small&gt;-chshad'' ]]

== Nominative adjectives ==
The default form of an adjective is its nominative, masculine, singular form, and this is the form given in dictionaries. All Russian adjectives in their default form end in either '''-ый''', '''-ий''', or '''-ой''', and conjugating them is as simple as removing this default ending and adding the new one.

=== Hard endings ===
Most Russian adjectives have a hard ending. In fact, all three endings ('''-ый''', '''-ий''', and '''-ой''') are 'hard'. The only exception is those adjectives ending in '''-ний''', which we'll discuss in a moment. For now, we only need to know that an adjective can have four different endings in the nominative case: masculine, feminine, neuter, and plural.

# When adjectives modify a masculine noun, they use their default ending. Most adjectives have the '''-ый''' ending, pronounced 'ee', less common is '''-ий''', also pronounced 'ee', and less common still is '''-ой''', pronounced 'oy'. For example, &quot;new pencil&quot; is '''новый карандаш''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vee ka-ran-&lt;small&gt;DASH&lt;/small&gt;''). As a memory aid, remember that masculine nouns end in a consonant or й, and the masculine ending for adjectives end in й.
#With feminine nouns, the adjective ends in '''-ая'''. An easy way to remember this is to remember that '''a''' and '''я''' are what go on the end of feminine nouns. For example, &quot;new car&quot; is '''новая машина''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vah-yah ma-&lt;small&gt;SHEE&lt;/small&gt;-na''&quot;).
#With neuter nouns, the adjective ends in '''-ое'''. Like with feminine nouns, you can remember this as the two letters that go on the end of neuter nouns, '''o''' and '''e'''. For example, &quot;new dress&quot; is '''новое платье''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vo-yeh &lt;small&gt;PLAT&lt;/small&gt;-ye'').
#With plural nouns, regardless of gender, the adjective replaces '''-ый''' or '''-ой''' with '''-ые''' ('ee-ye'), or it replaces '''-ий''' with '''-ие''' ('ee-ye'). For example, &quot;these good new students&quot; is '''эти хорошие новые студенты''' (pronounced ''&lt;small&gt;EH&lt;/small&gt;-tee kha-&lt;small&gt;RO&lt;/small&gt;-shee-ye &lt;small&gt;NO&lt;/small&gt;-vih-yeh stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;-ee''). As a memory aid, think of plural as one masculine and one neuter object. Take the first letter from the masculine ending ('''ы''') and the second letter from the neuter ending ('''e''') and you get '''ые'''.

===Soft endings===
One rather rare exception to the above rules is if the adjective ends in the so-called 'soft' ending, '''-ний''', such as '''синий''' (dark blue). This doesn't conjugate like usual '''-ий''' endings, and instead has the following rules:
# The ending is '''-ний''' when modifying a masculine noun. For example, the dark blue table - '''синий стол.'''
# The ending is '''-няя''' ('nya-ah') when modifying feminine nouns. For example, the dark blue book - '''синяя книга'''
# The ending is '''-нee''' ('nye-eh') when modifying neuter nouns. For example, the dark blue letter - '''синее письмо'''
# The plural ending is '''-ние''' ('nee-ye'), as per usual. For example, the dark blue books - '''синие книги'''

===5- and 7-letter spelling rules===
When forming the nominative plural of nouns, recall that if the stem ends in '''г, ж, к, х, ч, ш''', or '''щ''', you add '''и''', not '''ы'''. This 7-letter spelling rule also applies to adjectives. As a memory aid, these letters include the non-English-looking 'hushes' ('''ч, ш, щ, ж''') and three letters pronounced at the back of the throat ('''г, к, х'''). This is why adjectives whose stem ends in one of these seven letters have the '''-ий''' ending instead of '''-ый'''.

Four of these letters are also in the 5-letter spelling rule. This states that, if the stem ends in '''ж, ц, ч, ш''', or '''щ''', any unstressed '''o''' in an ending is instead written as '''e'''. For example, 'the good letter' is written '''хорошее письмо''' (and ''not'' '''хорошое письмо''').

== Accusative adjectives ==
Adjectival endings in the accusative case are similar to noun endings, in that they all use endings from other cases, with the exception of feminine nouns.

Masculine adjectives take the nominative form if their noun is inanimate, and neuter adjectives always take their nominative form. For example, I want a new chair and a new letter - '''Я хочу новый стул и новое письмо'''. However, if the modified masculine noun is a person or animal, then both it and its adjectives take the genitive form. For example, I want a new rabbit - '''Я хочу нового кролика.'''

Feminine adjectives simply have '''-ую''' in the accusative. As a memory aid, this is the two letters that feminine nouns take on in the accusative case. For example, My Russian cat likes my new dog - '''Моя русская кошка любит мою новую собаку'''. One exception is adjectives with the soft ending: they take '''-юю''' in the accusative instead.

Plural adjectives, regardless of gender, are also split according to animation: inanimate plural adjectives take their nominative form, while animate ones take their genitive form.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
| Masculine || Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ый/ий/ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ого/его''' || '''ое''' || '''ую''' || '''ые/ие'''&lt;br&gt;'''ых/их'''
|}

== Genitive adjectives ==
The genitive case is relatively easy, especially compared with how nouns decline in this case. Adjectives use the same ending for both masculine and neuter nouns: '''-ого'''. If the adjective has the soft ending or ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''), it ends in '''-его'''. Note that with these genitive endings there's a new pronunciation rule: '''-ого''' is pronounced 'oh-vo', not 'oh-goh', and '''-его''' is pronounced 'ye-vo', not 'ye-goh'. This unusual pronunciation is only on genitive (and accusative) endings; '''мно́го''', 'much/many', is pronounced 'mno-ga'.

Like masculine and neuter adjectives, the feminine form has two endings: '''-ой''' ('oy'), or '''-ей''' ('yay') for soft adjectives and those ending in the 5-letter rule.

The plural form also has two endings: '''-ых''', or '''-их''', if the adjective's stem ends in one of the ''7-letter-rule'' letters ('''х, г, к, ш, щ, ч, ж''').

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ого'''&lt;br&gt;'''его''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ых'''&lt;br&gt;'''их'''
|}

Examples:
:My new husband has many friends - '''У моего нового мужа есть много друзе́й'''
:Three kilograms of fresh new cheeses - '''Три килогра́мма свежих новых сыров'''
:A kilogram of beautiful American apples - '''Килогра́мм краси́вых америка́нских я́блок'''
:I arrived from my old house - '''Я пришёл из моего старого дома'''

== Instrumental adjectives ==
The instrumental case is used to denote nouns which are the means by which a verb is carried out, such as, &quot;I am writing ''with a pen''&quot; ('''Я пишу́ ''ру́чкой''''').

To form masculine and neuter adjectives, the ending is '''-ым'''. If the adjective ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц''') or the soft ending ('''-ний'''), then the instrumental ending is '''-им'''. For example, 'I wrote with a good new pencil' - '''Я написал хорошим новым карандашом'''.

Feminine adjectives end in '''-ой'''. For adjectives ending in the 5-letter rule or soft ending, the instrumental ending is '''ей'''. These are the same as the feminine singular endings for the genitive, dative, and prepositional cases. For example, 'I want a meeting with an interesting Russian woman' - '''Я хочу встречу с интересной русской женщиной'''.

To form the instrumental plural, all adjectives have '''-ыми'''. Those which end in '''-ий''' have '''-ими'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ым'''&lt;br&gt;'''им''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ыми'''&lt;br&gt;'''ими'''
|}

Examples:
:I live between two new houses - '''Я живу́ ме́жду двумя но́выми дома́ми'''
:It's under the good books - '''Оно́ под хоро́шими кни́гами'''
:I am studying Russian - '''Я занима́юсь ру́сским языко́м'''

== Dative adjectives ==
The dative case denotes the secondary object of a verb. For example, 'I wrote a letter to him' would place 'letter' in the accusative case as it's the direct object of the verb, while 'to him' would be the word 'him' placed in the dative case. Thus, it translates to '''Я написал письмо ему'''. Adjectives in the dative case conjugate as follows:

Masculine and neuter adjectives end in '''-ому'''. If the adjective ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц''') or the soft ending ('''-ний'''), they end in '''-ему'''. If you already know the prepositional form, you will see this is prepositional form, with an '''у''' attached. This can be a useful memory aid, as most dative masculine and neuter nouns end in '''-у'''.

Similarly, feminine adjectives in the dative actually ''are'' identical to their prepositional form (and their instrumental and genitive forms as well): '''-ой''', unless the stem ends in the 5-letter rule, or the adjective ends in the soft ending, in which case '''-ей'''.

Plural adjectives are like plural nouns in the dative form, in that they're the same as their instrumental cousins, only without the end '''и'''. This also means that they're the same as their instrumental singular forms. In other words, dative plural adjectives end in '''-ым''', unless they end in the 7-letter rule ('''г, к, х, ш, щ, ж, ч'''), in which case the ending is '''-им'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ому'''&lt;br&gt;'''ему''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ым'''&lt;br&gt;'''им'''
|}

Examples:
:She wants to speak to your young cousin - '''Она́ хо́чет поговори́ть с ва́шей молодо́й двою́родной сестро́й'''
:He walked along the new street - '''Он шёл по но́вой у́лице'''
:I gave five pounds to the nice old lady - '''Я дал пять фу́нтов симпати́чной ста́рой же́нщине'''

==Prepositional adjectives==
The final case is the [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional case]]. This is only used after four prepositions ('''в, на, о(б)''', and '''при'''), as discussed more thoroughly on it's dedicated page. As you may guess by now, there is an ending for masculine and neuter adjectives, an ending for feminine adjectives, and an ending for plural adjectives, and they all have alternatives if the adjectival stem ends in the 5- or 7- letter rule.

The ending for masculine and neuter endings is the same as that for dative adjectives, minus the end vowel: '''-ом'''. If the stem ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''), or the adjective has the soft ending '''-ний''', the ending is '''-ем'''. For example, 'They were talking about a good new cinema' - '''Они говорили о хорошем новом кино''' (note that '''кино''', 'cinema', is indeclinable).

Feminine adjectives have the same ending as in the genitive, dative, and instrumental cases: '''-ой''', or, if the adjective ends in the 5-letter rule or the soft ending, '''-ей'''. For example, 'They were in the old Russian school' - '''Они были в старой русской школе'''.

Plural adjectives in the prepositional end in '''-ых'''. If the stem ends in the 7-letter rule ('''г, к, х, ш, щ, ж, ч''') or the adjective has the soft ending, the plural prepositional ending is '''-их'''. For example, 'They like to live in big red houses' - '''Они любят жить в больших красных домах'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-
| Masculine/Neuter || Feminine || Plural
|-
| '''ом'''&lt;br&gt;'''ем''' || '''ой'''&lt;br&gt;'''ей''' || '''ых'''&lt;br&gt;'''их'''
|}

Examples:
:I want to live in a clean new city - '''Я хочу́ жить в чи́стом но́вом го́роде'''
:She's in the blue apartment, not the white apartment - '''Она́ в си́ней кварти́ре, не в бе́лой кварти́ре''' - ''note the soft ending of '''си́ний/си́ней'''''
:Let's talk about my beautiful young Russian wife! - '''Давайте говорить о мое́й краси́вой молодо́й ру́сской жене́!'''

The masculine and plural accusative endings are split between inanimate endings on the left, and animate endings on the right. Most other endings come in pairs. For singular endings, only use the right-hand one (with an '''e''' in it) after adjectival stems that end in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''). For plural endings, only use the right-hand one (with an '''и''')  after the 7-letter rule ('''г, к, х, ш, щ, ж, ч'''; that is, any adjective whose default ending is '''-ий'''). For adjectives that have the soft ending ('''-ний'''), always use the right-hand ending. Finally, notice that for the latter four cases, the neuter ending is the same as the masculine, and the feminine endings are all the same.

== Short adjectives ==
=== Usage ===
When an adjective describes something permanent, fixed, or unchanging, we use the 'long-form', which is given in the above sections. By contrast, short adjectives describe something transient, fleeting, or temporary. For instance, 'I'm happy!' could be written in Russian using the usual, 'long-form' adjecitve: '''Я счастли́вый!''' (for a boy) or '''Я счастли́вая!''' (for a girl). However, since the quality of 'being happy' might be a temporary one (compare &quot;I'm always happy&quot; with &quot;I was happy yesterday morning&quot;), we can describe this state using the short form of the adjective to emphasise its temporary nature.  Conversational Russian prefers constructions that use long-form adjectives, though the short form is still used for this important distinction.

Every adjective has both long and short forms; which you use depends on the finer details of what you're trying to say. If in doubt, use the long form. The short form is used in sentences like 'The house is clean', rather than 'The clean house'; though both are broadly conveying the same idea, the temporary nature of the adjective is emphasised by being in the short form, ''and'' by being at the end of the sentence, just like in English.

=== Formation ===
To make the short form of any adjective, just remove the ending. The feminine then has the suffix '''-а''', the neuter has '''-о''', and all plurals have '''-ы'''. The short form doesn't change according to the case of the noun it modifies, only gender and number, making it very easy to remeber. The masculine form is usually just the bare stem, but if it ends in awkward consonant clusters, we add an '''o''' or '''e''' to smooth things out. Specifically, we add '''-o-''' before a final '''-к''', and '''-e-''' before a final '''-н'''. For example, '''ни́зкий''' ('low') would have the short form '''низк''', but since this is hard to pronounce, the masculine short form is instead '''ни́зок'''.

If you have a good grasp of gender and number, you'll find these suffixes very easy to remember. So, the short forms of '''счастли́вый''' is '''сча́стлив, сча́стливa, сча́стливo''', and '''сча́стливы''', and to say &quot;I'm happy&quot; with emphasis on the temporary nature of this happiness, we would say '''Я сча́стлив!'''.

=== Exceptions ===
There are two adjectives with exceptional short forms, '''большо́й''' ('big') and '''маленький''' ('small'), as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Gender !! '''Большой''' !! '''Маленький'''
|-
! Masculine
| вели́к || мал
|-
! Feminine
| велика́ || мала́
|-
! Neuter
| велико́ || мало́
|-
! Plural
| велики́ || малы́
|}

Some adjectives have no short form, and tend to be those that are derived from nouns. These have endings like '''-ский''', '''-овой''', and '''-ной''' (e.g., '''братский'''). There is also a short-form adjective, '''рад''' ('glad'), which has no long form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''[[w:Grammatical_case|case]]''' is a grammatical concept that tells you what a word is doing in a sentence. For example, the thing performing a verb is denoted as such with a case, while something being counted or enumerated has a different case. This page gives brief overviews of what each of the six cases are used for, with a table summarising how to put a word in that case.

== What is a case? ==
Russian has six cases, and the case of a word is denoted by suffixes (word endings) that tell you the context of the word. English has few cases, favouring grammatical constructions over implicit case endings: compare the sentences, &quot;I like apples&quot; and &quot;apples like me&quot;; the first-person pronoun is 'I' when it's the subject of the verb, but it's 'me' when it's the object of the verb. These cases in English are called ''subjective'' and ''objective'', and convey the same information as the Russian [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|''nominative'']] and [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|''accusative'']] cases. Russian sentences are more heavily based on cases than English, so they make up the bulk of mastering basic Russian.

Cases in Russian affect nouns, [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives|adjectives]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Pronouns|pronouns]] ('I', 'me', 'my', 'your', etc). Adjectives modify a noun, and take the case ending that corresponds with whatever case the noun is in. This is true of possessive pronouns as well. So, in the phrase &quot;My cute dog licked your big hands&quot;, 'hands' is the object of the verb, so is in the ''accusative'' case - and therefore 'your' and 'big' would also be in the accusative. Nouns and adjectives also change according to [[Russian/Grammar/Gender|gender]] (masculine/feminine/neuter) and number (singular/plural), but more on that later.

Cases are 'called' in two main ways: when you want to use a noun in the main function of the case, or when a preposition specifically calls it. For instance, if you wanted to say, &quot;Under the rug&quot;, Russians say '''под''' (pod) and then the word 'rug' in its ''instrumental'' form, since the preposition '''под''' calls the instrumental case when it means 'under'. In Russian this is, &quot;'''Под ковриком'''&quot; (''pod &lt;small&gt;KOV&lt;/small&gt;-ree-kom''), where '''ковриком''' is the instrumental form of '''коврик''' (''&lt;small&gt;KOV&lt;/small&gt;-reek''), 'rug'.

The following subsections give an overview of what each case does, with summary tables of conjugation The format for these will be &quot;X,Y --&gt; Z&quot;, meaning if the word ends in X or Y, you remove the X or Y and replace it with Z. &quot;+X&quot; means you append X to the end of the word. Generally speaking, these tables should be used for revision of rules already learned, not learning cases themselves. For that, see the pages on each case, where declination is explained more thoroughly, and exceptions and caveats to these general rules will be given.

===[[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|Nominative case]]===
'''Имени́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''eem-een-&lt;small&gt;EET&lt;/small&gt;-eel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The nominative case is the default case of a word, as found in dictionaries and when no other case is specifically used. It is also used for the subject of a sentence: in &quot;Bob eats lunch&quot;, Bob is the subject of the sentence, so would be in its default nominative form. The gender of a word can be deduced by its nominative form. As you don't need to decline a noun in the nominative singular (you just use its default, undeclined form), for the nominative singular cells in the following declination tables, the letters that define gender will be used instead.

=== [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|Genitive case]] ===
'''Роди́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''ruh-&lt;small&gt;DEE&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The genitive case has four main uses:

*'''Counting''' - When counting objects (&quot;I have six sheep&quot;), the thing being enumerated is usually put in the genitive case.
*'''Possession''' - If something is owned by something else, the owner is in the genitive case. This is similar to the 's in English: &quot;my brother's car&quot;. &quot;Brother's&quot;, in Russian, would be the singular word &quot;brother&quot;, '''брат''', in its genitive form, '''брата'''. This also corresponds with the English 'of', as in 'car of my brother'.
*'''Negation''' - To say something is there, we generally use the nominative case. If it isn't there, we use '''нет''' followed by the genitive.
*'''Prepositions''' - A number of common prepositions call the genitive case. The most common is '''у''', which means 'by' or 'near'. It's also used to say &quot;I have...&quot;: '''У''' + ''gen'' '''есть''' + ''nom''.

===[[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|Dative case]]===
'''Да́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''&lt;small&gt;DA&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The dative case is used to denote indirect objects, which are objects that indicate &quot;to whom&quot;, or &quot;to what&quot; an action is done. So in the sentence, &quot;I am writing a letter to you&quot;, &quot;(a) letter&quot; is the direct object of the verb, while '(to) you' is the indirect object. In Russian, direct objects go in the accusative case, and indirect objects go in the dative case. As in English, sentences do not always have indirect objects.

|}

=== [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|Accusative case]] ===
'''Вини́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''vee-&lt;small&gt;NEE&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The accusative case is used for the direct object of a verb. In &quot;Bob eats lunch,&quot; &quot;lunch&quot; is the direct object. In English, the object of a sentence is indicated by context and word order, with a strict subject-verb-object (SVO) system. In English, &quot;Bob eats lunch&quot; and &quot;Lunch eats Bob&quot; have different meanings. But in Russian, since the two cases are distinguished by suffixes, we can change the order of words and still know who's the object and who's the subject. If English indicated the direct object by adding &quot;oo&quot;, we could say &quot;Bob eats lunchoo&quot; or &quot;Lunchoo eats Bob&quot;, and either way it would clear that Bob was doing the eating.

One nuance of the accusative case is that it makes a distinction of animacy. That is, masculine nouns denoting people or animals (i.e., ''animate'' nouns) take their genitive form, while neuter nouns and inanimate masculine nouns take their nominative form. Plural nouns of any gender take their nominative plural form if inanimate, or their genitive plural form if animate.

=== [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|Instrumental case]]===
'''Твори́тельный паде́ж''' - '''''tvuh-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-teel-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The instrumental case is used to denote the object by which something is done. In the sentence, &quot;I am writing with a pencil&quot;, the phrase 'with a pencil' in Russian is simply the word 'pencil' ('''карандаш''') put into its instrumental form ('''карандашом''').  In this way, it corresponds to one of the two meanings of the word 'with' in English: 'with', as in 'by means of'. The other meaning, 'in the company of', such as &quot;I rode with Jane&quot;, is also commanded by the instrumental case, though this requires a preposition: '''с''' + ''inst''.

There are five other common prepositions that command the instrumental: '''под''' (pod, 'under') '''над''' (nad, 'above'/'on top of') '''за''' (za, 'behind') '''между''' (mezh-doo, 'between'), and '''перед''' (pye-red, 'before'/'in front of').

'''Предло́жный паде́ж''' - '''''preed-&lt;small&gt;LOZH&lt;/small&gt;-nyy puhd-&lt;small&gt;YEZH&lt;/small&gt;'''''

The prepositional case is also called the ''locative'' case, as it was commonly used to denote a sentence's object's location or an activity. Nowadays, however, it's only ever called after a few prepositions, hence its name. It's not rare, though, and the prepositions that call it are the most common of all Russian prepositions. They are '''в''' (in), '''на''' (on), and '''о/обо''' (about; it's '''обо''' in the phrase &quot;about me&quot; or &quot;about my&quot;). However, these prepositions can also call other cases, in which case their meaning changes. For instance, '''в''' + ''prep'' means 'in', as in, &quot;I live in England&quot;. '''в''' + ''acc'', however, means 'into' or 'to', as in, &quot;I'm flying to New York&quot;.

Note that entries for the nominative singular don't describe declination rules, but rather describe gender. So the feminine entry, 'а or я', says that feminine nouns are those that end in either '''-а''' or '''-я''' in the nominative singular. For a more complete description of gender in Russian, see [[Russian/Grammar/Gender]].

Unlike nouns, adjectives have no intrinsic gender, instead taking on the gender of the noun they modify. However, by default, they end in either '''ый''', '''ий''', or '''ой''', and they keep these forms when modifying masculine singular nouns in the nominative case.

{{recipesummary|Dessert recipes|1 full 12-ounce jar |15 - 20 minutes|2}}


Lemon curd is a custard-like dessert sauce made with eggs, lemon juice and zest, sugar, and butter.

This recipe will produce one full 12-ounce (330g) jar of lemon curd (similar to but not the same as lemon pie filling), plus a little left over so you can lick the bowl.  Lemon curd keeps for up to a week in the refrigerator.  It is excellent on short bread, biscuits, scones, and English muffins. 

This dish goes well with scones, short breads, and muffins.

==Equipment==

* 1-quart saucepan
* whisk
* measuring cup
* grater or zester
* medium to large strainer of fine-to-medium mesh
* rubber spatula
* 1-quart kitchen bowl
* 12-ounce (about 330g) jar with sealable lid

==Ingredients==

* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120ml) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] freshly grated lemon zest
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1\4 cup unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (60 ml)
* Pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional, to bring out sweetness and flavor of finished product)

==Procedure==
# Grate the lemon rinds to produce two tablespoons of zest.  Grate only the yellow zest, avoid the inner white pith which is bitter.
# Extract the juice from the lemons to produce 1/2 cup (120ml) of juice.
# Cut the butter into small chunks.
# Put eggs, zest, sugar, and salt into cooled sauce pan.
# Whisk ingredients in pan till frothy and light in color (a minute or two).
# Add lemon juice and whisk 30 seconds.
# Add butter chunks.
# Set pan on stove burner, turn on heat to medium-to-low, and start whisking contents so they don't coagulate or stick to bottom of pan.
# Whisk constantly till butter melts and mixture thickens, then whisk another two minutes, but do not let mixture boil - it should be quite steamy (185°F, 85°C).
# Optional: Remove zest with the strainer over a mixing bowl and pouring the mixture through.  Then work the mixture through the strainer with the spatula to strain out the zest and any egg lumps; rake mixture off bottom of strainer into bowl.
# Pour mixture from bowl into jar to within 1/4 inch (0.75cm) from top, taking care not to get mixture on rim, then seal jar with lid.
# Refrigerate to thicken the product further.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Hopeless. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Hopeless~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book aims to provide beginners with an introduction to programming Mac OS X Apps with [[w:Cocoa_(API)|Cocoa]], using [[w:Xcode|XCode]], the free developer tools provided by Apple, Inc. Some knowledge of another programming language, preferably [[Objective-C_Programming|Objective C Programming]] is assumed.

This wikibook was written for users of Mac OS X 10.3 or 10.4, it should also work for newer versions of Mac OS X such as 10.5 and 10.6.  For programming Mac OS X with Cocoa for Beginners using Mac OS X versions 10.7 &quot;Lion&quot;, or 10.8 &quot;Mountain Lion&quot; or later, use the following wikibook instead:  [[Programming Mac OS X with Cocoa for Beginners 2nd Edition]]  It is suggested that you upgrade to 10.8, &quot;Mountain Lion&quot; because it is better supported by Apple.

In general, this text is written to be followed in order from start to finish. As each topic develops, it builds on the code written previously to add complexity and functionality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The below decks may be moved around between the tiers as new cards, trends, discoveries and interactions make certain strategies more or less competitive than they were previously. Please add to these primers any information or strategies that you have to offer.
=Tier One Strategies=

==Threshold Primer==
Threshold is an evolution of Extended Miracle Gro/Super Gro lists. With the low amount of lands and high density of control, it uses Cantrips to find land early game and more cantrips and control midgame-lategame. This deck wins by using Threshold creatures, such as Nimble Mongoose and Werebear. More recently, Tarmogoyf has also been adopted due to its efficiency. This deck has many variations. ÐIt ranges from 3-4 colors, and each of those colors give it a different form of control or win conditions. White which happens to the most popular, is splashed for Swords to Plowshares, Meddling Mage, and Mystic Enforcer. As for the Sideboard, it is splashed for Tivadar's Crusade, Armageddon, Jotun Grunt, Worship, and at times, Nantuko Monastery. Red is splashed for maindeck Burn (Lightning Bolt, Fire // Ice, and/or Magma Jet/Chain Lightning) and Fledgling Dragon, and Pyroclasm for the Sideboard. Black is splashed for Dark Confidant and Ghastly Demise, and Pernicious Deed, Duress, Darkblast, and Diabolic Edict for the Sideboard.

==Goblins Primer==

Goblins is a pure aggro build that usually uses Aether Vial and Goblin Lackey to speed large numbers of goblins into play to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Goblin Piledriver, Goblin Warchief, Goblin Matron, and Goblin Ringleader are staple cards used towards this effect with many maindecked or toolbox goblins for specific removals and damage sources. Some common cards are Gempalm Incinerators, Mogg Fanatic, Goblin Sharpshooter, Siege-Gang Commander, and Kiki-Jiki Mirror Breaker.  Goblins usually runs a touch of direct damage aside from these in the form of Lightning Bolt or Tarfire, and some land based land destruction in the form of Dust Bowl or Wasteland. Goblins is generally mono-red but has been known to spash white for sideboarded disenchants or black for Patriarch's Bidding.

=Tier Two Strategies=
==Survival Primer==
Survival decks involve using Survival of the fittest combined with early mana acceleration to search through a toolbox deck of well chosen creatures such as Anger, Genesis, Squee Goblin Nabob, Rofellos. There are several sub-versions of this deck that all play very different. 

ATS (Angry Tradewind Survival) splashes blue in for Tradewind Rider and more control oriented cards (counterspell, force of will, mystic snake) and plays a slower paced game that involves using survival to find answers in creature form and Tradewind riders to lock the board. This build usually performs poorly against heavy aggro, such as goblins. 

Survival combo. The original incarnations of this deck involved using recurring nightmare to reanimate fatties that were tossed in the graveyard with survival. The main creature focus of this deck were ones with come in to play effects such as Nekrataal, Uktabi Orangutan, Cloudchaser Eagle, Avalanche Riders etc.  This deck is more aggressive than ATS, and in its time was THE survival deck. Also popular for quite some time now is to have a Volrath's Shapeshifter in play then toss multiple fatties or utility creatures with survival (such as morphling and krosan cloudscraper).These deck styles do not do well against decks with any type of disruption or control so they are currently not seeing much play.

Currently many players are working with R/G survival which focuses on using aggressive, efficient creatures to maintain board position, while survival guarantees finding answers in the early game and a finisher in the mid to late game. This has an advantage over previous builds which fall apart if the player can't resolve and keep a survival on the table. most versions agree on using burning wish to pull in key cards in poor match ups, namely against combo decks.

While this is a very fun deck to play; it can be rather expensive to build, and every incarnation seems to perform poorly against one of the main 3 archetypes(being combo, control/disruption , aggro).

==Pikula &amp; Variants Primer==
Bw Pikula is a deck created by Chris Pikula, which happens to be a spin-off of Pikula's favorite decks from 96; Necropotence.

By replacing the Necropotence with Dark Confidant, and splashing White in for Vindicate, Swords to Plowshares, and Gerrald's Verdict, it created a perfect monster for the format. By mana screwing the opponent, and heavy discard, as well as Dark Confidants to keep the engine going, disruption and threats come constant.

Some other versions replace Red for Terminate and Blazing Specter, and Green for Pernicious Deed.

==Faerie Stompy Primer==
Faerie Stompy is a monoblue aggressive deck. This deck uses blue flying creatures such as Cloud of Faeries, Mulldrifter, Sea Drake, Serendib Efreet, and Sower of Temptation. This deck also uses Trinket Mage to search for Relic of Progenitus, Sigil of Distinction, Engineered Explosives, and Seat of the Synod. If a player controls a Chrome Mox and Ancient Tomb or City of Traitors but no other lands in play, Sea Drake's &quot;comes into play effect&quot; will not trigger. 

Mana Sources:
* 4 Chrome Mox
* 4 City of Traitors
* 4 Ancient Tomb
* 9 Island
* 1 Seat of the Synod

Creatures:
* 4 Sea Drake
* 4 Serendib Efreet
* 3-4 Mulldrifter
* 3-4 Cloud of Faeries

Instants:
*4 Force of Will

Artifacts:
* 4 Chalice of the Void
* 0-2 Umezawa's Jitte
* Sword of Fire and Ice
* Sword of Light and Shadow

=Tier Three Strategies=
==Angel Stompy Primer==
Angel Stompy is an accelerated White Weenie evolution that uses Turbo Accelerants, such as Ancient Tomb, Chrome Mox, and/or City of Traitors. The deck uses Equipment as Draw Engines and Removal such as Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte, while using utility creatures and beaters to abuse the Equipment. The deck was created by Zilla from the Source.

It's most famous moves are...

Turn 1: Ancient Tomb, Chrome Mox, and Facedown Exalted Angel.
Turn 2: Play Plains, Tap Plains, Chrome Mox, and Ancient Tomb, Flip Exalted Angel, and attack.

Some versions of Angel Stompy splash Blue and/or Black for Spectral Lynx, Meddling Mage, Duress, Srendib Efreet, and Brainstorm.

==Stax Primer==
Stax is a Prison deck ported from Type 1.

It uses Trinisphere, Crucible of Worlds, Tangle Wire, Uba Mask, Chalice of the Void, Sphere of Resistance, and Smokestack to create a board lock, and restrict the number of spells being played.

This deck uses a mana base of Ancient Tomb, Crystal Vein, and City of Traitors with Mox Diamond for extra speed.  These land are very synergistic with Crucible of World because discarded land to Mox Dimonds can be replayed as well as replaying sacrificed Crystal Vein or City of Traitors. Crucible also allows the Stax player to replay sacrificed lands from Smokestack.  Although the deck is much less powerful than the flame vault stax deck it is still a strong rogue deck seen with a top 16 place at worlds by Brandon Adams.

Flame Vault Stax is a Stax deck utilizing Flame Fusillade and Time Vault to inflict infinite damage.  Also Time Vault could combo with Stasis and Smokestacks skipping infinite turns winning by decking. Time Vault was errataed to fix the combo and any power Time Vault had to create a prison lock.


Newer versions of the deck are designed by Chris Coppola and Brandon Adams.

==Red Burn Primer==
===List &amp; Explanation===
The best burn decks runs a base with only the fastest most efficient burn spells available and very few if any nonland permanents. Thus these decks make up for their inability to draw cards by making all of the removal and bounce in your opponents hand worthless. Magma Jet also serves a similar goal in making sure that the cards you draw are indeed cards that help you win.
Spells:
* 4 Lava Spike
* 4 Chain Lightning
* 4 Lightning Bolt
* 4 Mogg Fanatic or Thunderbolt
* 4 Rift Bolt
* 4 Magma Jet
* 4 Incinerate
* 4 Flame Rift
* 4 Flamebreak
* 4 Fireblast

Lands:
* 4 Mountain
* 4 Snow Covered Mountain
* 4 Plateau or Mountain
* 4 Bloodstained Mire or Barbarian Ring
* 4 Wooded Foothills

'''Explanation of the Alternatives'''

Lighning Helix/Plateau - There are two types of metagames, those where nonbasics and Wastelands run rampant, and those where nonbasics are few and far between. In the former, while the life gain and the ability to sideboard Disenchant are great reasons to splash white, the added versatility of Disenchant is offset by the added vulnerability to Wasteland. And the life gained by running Lightning Helix is offset by the life lost from Plateau since running a playset of Price of Progress is a must in such metagames. Thus, Lightning Helix is best thought off as an alternative to Price of Progress in those precisely those metagames where nonbasic lands and Wastelands are few and far between. In such metagames, Lightning Helix compensates for the life loss associated with the incredibly effective Flame Rift and Flamebreak.

Price of Progress - This card can be an absolute bomb against those decks that run multiple nonbasic lands. While many of the current decks fit this mold, a few decks run no such nonbasic lands and thus it is debatable if this card should be maindecked or sideboarded. If you choose not to run it, splash white and run Lightning Helix.

Barbarian Ring - This land has the slight disadvantage of not being saccable to Fireblast. It's a tough call. On one hand, it is very effective against Blue based control strategies and thus warrants consideration in decks running Lightning Helix. But on the same token, in mono Red builds running Price of Progress, the added vulnerability to both Wastelands and your own Price of Progress is just not worthwhile.

Mogg Fanatic - This is an excellent one drop creature that finds its way into most burn decks. Though it violates the no nonland permanent rule that burn decks live by, the fact that it can be sacrificed to deal damage compensates for this. The only reason not to run this would be in an almost entirely creature dominated environment where it will never get through to deal even as much damage as a Shock. But even then, it still warrants consideration.

Thunderbolt - This is an excellent alternative burn spells that replaces Mogg Fanatic in high toughness creature dominated metagames. It can also be used in burn decks that can't afford the Plateaus for the white splash though they play in areas where running Price of Progress is not worthwhile. It can even replace Flame Rift in environments where such life loss unacceptable.

Flame Rift - The main reason that Flame Rift is used is because that one extra damage lets you win the game a full turn faster a third of the matches you play. But it can replaced in metagames where you often find yourself being outraced.

Chain of Plasma - This serves the same purpose as Thunderbolt, as an alternative burn spell. But Thunderbolt is almost certainly the superior option. Chain of Plasma has the small but still relevant liability of being bounced back in situations where you don't have any cards to discard or simply don't want to discard (when you are holding a Fireblast for example). A good opponent would never bounce back Chain of Plasma unless it is advantageous to them. Thunderbolt on the other hand has no real drawback since there are so many other burn spells in the deck that can deal with creatures when necessary. In addition, the ability of Thunderbolt to destroy four toughness flying creatures when necessary is actually a positive.

Flamebreak - Burn wants to aim everything for the dome without caring about the creatures that your opponent is casting. This card lets it do that by clearing the board of opposing creatures while still dealing damage to the dome. Leaving this card out of the deck is not an option.

'''Popular Cards That Shouldn't Be Run'''

Volcanic Hammer - This is yet another alternative to Thunderbolt and Chain of Plasma. It shouldn't be run, simply because the sorcery speed is a bigger drawback than the drawbacks of either of the other cards. Playing your cards at the end of your opponents turn is a critical component of playing burn decks, and this interferes with that plan. Incinerate in just a much better card.

Grim Lavamancer - While a few people feel that this card is ultimately too efficient not to run, it clearly violates the no nonland permanent rule and also is a bit too slow. These are the same reason that a number of other nonland permanants such as Ankh of Mishra, Sulfuric Vortex and Cursed Scroll are not utilized in this deck.

Ball Lightning - While the main reason this card fell into disuse, Mana Drain, no longer exists in Legacy, it's high casting cost makes it only usable as a finisher. And the fact that this a creature that can be targeted by removal or blocked makes it an unreliable finisher at that.

Please add to this page but do not modify existing decklists without making note of the changes.


=Tier One Strategies=
These are the cream of the crop, these strategies are the ones that are consistently winning tournaments and have no significant weaknesses or matchups that can't be won.
==Oath Primer==
This deck wins by playing and activating Oath of Druids, often taking advantage of Forbidden Orchard to ensure that the opponent has at least one creature in play.
===Mana Drain Variant===

Team White Lotus (TWL) Oath 

Article at Star City Games [http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/9815.html here].

===GWS Oath===
This is the variant that has recently became very popular and has placed high in numerous tournaments. It too runs no Mana Drains in favor of Impulse and a black splash for additional Tutors and Duress. As a result, this variant can be built on a budget without losing any cards when one utilizes the ten proxies that most American tournaments now allow.

Variations of this build, popularized by team GWS, have placed in the top 8 of the GenCon Vintage Championships and several Starcity Power 9 events.  This has become the most popular form of Oath of Druids decks.  Tinker-Darksteel Colossus can be run maindeck.  It does have the advantage of getting around Meddling Mage and Chalice of the Void, however is bad if the opponent controls a Goblin Welder.  Razia is starting to take the place of Spirit of the Night as the deck's second large hasted flier.  The deck plays as an aggro-control deck disrupting the opponent until it finds Forbidden Orchard and Oath of Druids to win.  Other cards commonly played are Mystical Tutor, Misdirection and Chalice of the Void.

* 1 Mox Emerald
* 1 Mox Jet
* 1 Mox Pearl
* 1 Mox Ruby
* 1 Mox Sapphire
* 1 Strip Mine
* 1 Island
* 1 Underground Sea
* 2 Tropical Island
* 2 Wasteland
* 2 Flooded Strand
* 3 Polluted Delta
* 4 Forbidden Orchard

Some of the Drainless Oath builds including the first such build (listed above) run Tinker and Darksteel Colossus as an additional way to combo out quickly. This gives the additional advantage of an alternative win condition in situations when Oath of Druids is neutralized by cards such as Meddling Mage, Forbidden Orchard, Goblin Bombardment, or Wasteland targeting Forbidden Orchard. Such variations sometimes run Imperial Seal, Mystical Tutor and Personal Tutor to help grab Tinker, Ancestral Recall, Time Walk, or disruption. Other Drainless Oath builds such as the one above do not run either Tinker or Darksteel Colossus and instead run Razia, Boros Archangel. 

Other variations on the deck include running cards such as [b]Muddle in the Mixture, Crop Rotation, Chalice of the Void, Pithing Needle, Regrowth, Library of Alexandria, City of Brass, more Sensei's Divining Top and on occasion running three creatures rather than two[/b] in order to significantly decrease the probability of being slowed down by an active Goblin Welder. Some rarely even run cards such as Yawgmoth's Will, Enlightened Tutor, Engineered Explosives and Balance.

==Stax Primer==

The Stax deck in Vintage wins through a board-lock created by cards like Trinisphere, Smokestack, Tangle Wire and lots of other cards that restrict the number of spells being played.

The advantage of Stax is that it has a lot of permanents, so it does not care about Tangle Wire or Smokestacks.

The win conditions are Karn, Silver Golem, Sundering Titan or Triskelion who could be reanimated with Goblin Welder, also a quite important part of the deck.
Even 2 Goblin Welders could create a Tangle Wire of fading 4 permanently which makes playing impossible for your opponent.

==Belcher Primer==
==The Mountains Win Again Primer==
==Everything Wins Again Primer==

Everything Wins Again is a metagame hate deck designed to have a 50/50 matchup against any deck in the metagame preboard,
and a 51/49 matchup postboard.

This is done by completely sacrificing manabase immunity to Wasteland for the support of all five colors.
Sometimes this element is forgone in favor of a four color manabase depending on the metagame.

The first and only top 8 of this deck was recorded [http://morphling.de/top8decks.php?id=480 here].

6. Andrew Fox
&quot;Everything Wins Again&quot;

Maindeck (60 cards):

* 1 Mox Emerald
* 1 Mox Jet
* 1 Mox Pearl
* 1 Mox Ruby
* 1 Mox Sapphire
* 4 Dark Confidant
* 1 Demonic Consultation
* 1  Duress
* 1 Ancestral Recall
* 2 Brainstorm
* 1 Curiosity
* 1 Daze
* 1 Disrupt
* 1 Memory Lapse
* 1 Ninja of the Deep Hours
* 1 Seal of Removal
* 1 Spell Snare
* 1 Time Walk
* 2 Fire/Ice
* 3 Hide/Seek
* 3 Meddling Mage
* 1 Call of the Herd
* 1 Sylvan Safekeeper
* 1 Gorilla Shaman
* 1 Pyroblast
* 4 Swords to Plowshares
* 1 Children of Korlis
* 3 Jotun Grunt

Lands (18):
* 2 Bloodstained Mire
* 4 City of Brass
* 2 Flooded Strand
* 2 Mishra's Factory
* 1 Island
* 1 Plains
* 1 Plateau
* 1 Scrubland
* 1 Swamp
* 1 Taiga
* 1 Underground Sea
* 1 Volcanic Island

Sideboard: (15 cards)

* 1 Artifact Mutation
* 1 Darkblast
* 1 Flametongue Kavu
* 1 Gifts Ungiven
* 1 Hide and Seek
* 1 Meddling Mage
* 1 Pyrokinesis
* 3 Pyrostatic Pillar
* 4 Serenity
* 1 Spell Snare

Everything Wins Again builds up incremental card advantage over the course of the game
by confusing the opponent and causing them to misplay.
This is done by playing almost no repeating cards in a given game so that the opponent cannot
correctly find the 'optimal' play in any given situation.

=Tier Two Strategies=
==Dragon Primer==
==Fish Primer==

Fish is a tier two Vintage Deck that tries to win throug little creatures like &quot;Isamaru&quot;, &quot;Kataki, War´s Wage&quot; and &quot;Meddling Mage&quot;.
Secondly Fish includes a lot of hate-cards and counters like Force of Will and Stifle or Trickbind.
As an answer for creatures it has 4 Swords to Plowshares, the best Spot-Removal ever printed.

It´s a nice opportunity to start with playing Vintage and a so called Budget-Deck, the most valuable cards are Force of Will and probably Meddling Mage.

At a high player-skill it could even reach the Top 8 of a T1 tournament.

'''[[w:Cocoa_(API)|Cocoa]]''' is possibly one of the most rewarding, fun and productive ways to program a modern computer yet devised. If you own a Mac running Mac OS X, you already have Cocoa, and all the tools needed to program your Mac are available for free from Apple. Anyone who has an interest in programming can use Cocoa to write Mac applications, yet it is not just for beginners; many of the best OS X software titles available are written using Cocoa. You are able to harness the full power of the machine from Cocoa.

Programming using Cocoa involves both using a graphical user interface (GUI -- pronounced &quot;gooey&quot;) tool to build your user interfaces, and an integrated development environment (IDE).  Cocoa consists of literally hundreds of ready-built classes, which are pre-programmed modules of reusable code, that you can simply include in your own work. Since these classes are well designed, powerful and fully debugged, using them saves you literally hundreds of hours in building in complex functionality.

Cocoa is the name given to the complete set of classes, functions and constants, grouped together into an Application Programming Interface, or [[w:API_(software)|API]].  For building Mac applications Cocoa is the only API that is really used anymore.  (The other APIs that used to be provided by Apple, the [[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS#.22Classic.22_Mac_OS_.281984.E2.80.932001.29|Classic API]] and the [[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_API|Carbon API]] have been deprecated.)

To get the most out of this text, you will need to be running Mac OS X 10.3 or later. If you have 10.2, most of what is here will work OK, but the tools as described will be different, and a little harder to use. The coding examples avoid Cocoa features that only exist on 10.3 or 10.4, but later chapters will explain them.

Significant parts of this text describe older versions of Interface Builder. Some of what is described will not work with version 3.0.

Above all, this text aims to get you started in the smoothest way possible, so that you can begin to see not just how powerful Cocoa can be, but also how much fun it is to work with.

Before you can begin, you need to install the developer tools. These are supplied on a separate CD or DVD with your OS X install discs. Find the CD and insert it. Because Apple works on the principle that developers need less hand-holding than the average user, the installer will not run automatically. Instead, you need to find the &quot;devtools.mpkg&quot; icon, and double-click it to run the installer.

Follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Make sure you have enough disk space available. At this stage, do not be tempted to customise the installation, just do a standard install which will give you everything you need (and more, but you may need it later).

Once the installer has run its course, you will find a new folder at the top level of your machine's disk, called Developer. Note&amp;nbsp;— this is at the root level of the hard disk, ''not'' in your Home folder. To find it, you may need to open a Finder window and navigate to the disk itself, depending on how your Finder is configured.

Within Developer→Applications you will find a variety of folders, plus two applications, called Xcode and Interface Builder. These are the two main applications you will be working with throughout this text. You can ignore any others for now.

Double-click Xcode to launch it.

When Xcode starts, it defaults to multi-window mode which is not how this tutorial expects you to use it. In general, single-window mode is easier to use and avoids a confusing proliferation of windows as you work. To change it, before doing anything else, open the Preferences. Under General, choose &quot;All-in-One&quot; layout. In the same place, check the four boxes on the right - &quot;Open counterparts in same editor&quot;, &quot;Automatically open/close attached editor&quot;, &quot;Automatically Clear Log&quot;, &quot;Save Window State&quot;. Click OK.

It's also a good idea to make a folder for all the coding work you will do. This should be somewhere in your own Home area&amp;nbsp;— you could make it directly under the Home folder, or perhaps within &quot;Documents&quot;. It's up to you. Create the folder in the Finder wherever you want it, and name it &quot;Projects&quot;. Xcode will make new folders inside this one for each new application we build.

Now we are ready to begin.

If you plan to work through this text, a good idea is to add the Xcode icon to the Dock for easy access. To do this, simply drag the Xcode icon in the Finder to the Dock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Installing_the_developer_tools|Previous Page: Installing the developer tools]] | [[../First_Cocoa_program_-_Hello_World|Next Page: First Cocoa program - Hello World]]

We will shortly write our first Mac application in Cocoa, good old &quot;Hello World!&quot;. While not very useful, this will give you confidence that your developer installation is working as it should.

==XCode 3 and Earlier==

[[image:newproject1.png|right|thumb|350px|XCode 3 New Project assistant - select &quot;Cocoa Application&quot;]]

When Xcode first starts, it may not create any windows but it will have a menu bar and you can create a project and open its window by choosing: File→New Project...

An assistant opens with all the types of projects that Xcode can build. We want to make a simple Cocoa application, so scroll down the list to find &quot;Cocoa Application&quot;, select it and click Next.

[[image:newproject2.png|right|thumb|350px|XCode 3 New Project assistant - enter the name and path of the project]]

In the upper field, type the name of the project. We will call it &quot;HelloWorld&quot;. In the lower field, Xcode wants the path to the Projects folder. You could type it, but it's safer to use the &quot;Choose...&quot; button to navigate to it. Find wherever you put it, and click Choose. The path will be filled in. Click Finish.

[[image:HWXcodegen.png|right|thumb|350px|XCode 3 Xcode in single window mode]]

Xcode opens a window with the title of your project&amp;nbsp;— in this case &quot;HelloWorld&quot;. Down the left hand side of the window is a hierarchical list which lists all of the various elements that make up the program. The first item is selected, called &quot;HelloWorld&quot;. The main part of the window lists a number of files, such as 'Cocoa.framework', but they are not important right now. The top part of the window is the toolbar with a number of buttons, such as &quot;Build&quot;, &quot;Info&quot;, etc.

Let's build and run the project, to see what it does. Click the &quot;Build and Run&quot; (&quot;Build and Go&quot; on older versons of Xcode) button. Xcode will churn away for a minute, compiling various files. Shortly it will finish, the toolbar will change to the running state, and the application will be launched. A new window with the title &quot;Window&quot; will open with nothing in it, and the menu bar will show the name of the application, HelloWorld.

You will see that while this isn't a very useful application, it does exhibit much of the basic behaviour that any Mac application would be expected to. You can drag the window around, resize it, choose items from the menu, and so forth. It even has an &quot;about box&quot;! Not bad for not even writing any code yet. When you're done, choose &quot;Quit&quot; and control will return to Xcode. If you want to run it again, you can click the &quot;Run&quot; button.

On returning to Xcode, you are in the &quot;build&quot; view. To return to the original project view, click the leftmost button at the top left of the toolbar, below the window close button.

==Interface Builder==

We'll now jump into Interface Builder (IB) to make our application do something. While you could launch Interface Builder from the Finder, Xcode works hand in hand with it, so it's usually easier to let Xcode handle this. To start IB then, find the item &quot;NIB Files&quot; at the bottom of the list on the left. Open it, and double-click 'MainMenu.nib'. IB will launch and open that file in one go.

[[image:IBBasic.png|thumb|right|350px|XCode 3 MainMenu.nib in Interface Builder]]
MainMenu.nib contains the resources for the basic application. This includes the default menu bar and the simple window we already saw. The main view of a file in IB is a graphical list of the objects it contains, just like files in the Finder. Thus there is the MainMenu object, the Window object, and a couple of others, such as 'File's Owner' and 'First Responder' which will be explained in detail much later. Double-click on the icon for Window. The actual window will open. The size and position of this window is exactly what will show up in the finished app, so put it where you want it.

Let's add some text to the window. You should see a palette called Cocoa-Controls. Click the Text button which is third from the left. The window title will now be Cocoa-Text, and you will see various examples of text. Find the 'System Font Text' item in the pallete. (Note: In newer versions of Xcode and Interface Builder, the Cocoa-Control palette has been replaced with a content library, and 'System Font Text' items have been replaced with 'labels'.  In Xcode 3.2.6, for example, in Tools→Library→Objects, indented under 'Library' and 'Views &amp; Cells' select 'Inputs &amp; Values', then below choose 'Label'.) Drag the 'System Font Text' item from the palette (or 'Label' item from the library) into the window and drop it there. It will appear with a set of selection 'handles' around it. Double-click on the text to select it, and change the text to &quot;Hello World!&quot;. Click outside of the text to deselect it.

Choose File→Save and return to Xcode. Click &quot;Build and Run&quot;. When your application launches, it now includes the text you just added.

Well, so far not so very impressive, but it means that at this stage, everything is working as it should. We can now proceed to more interesting and challenging things with confidence in our tools.

==Documentation==

Xcode comes with the complete Apple Developer Reference Library locally installed. It is fully integrated into the Xcode editor&amp;nbsp;— to look up any method or class within Cocoa, simply option-double-click the class or method name anywhere in any text editor, or you can command-click on the identifier in the source-code and be taken to the declaration of that identifier in the .h file. Remember, all Cocoa classes start with 'NS...' (this stands for NextStep, the predecessor to Mac OS X where the Cocoa API first appeared as the programming environment itself.  Because of this, avoid the temptation to call your own classes 'NS...' anything. 

There are other APIs available to use to develop software that runs on Mac OS X include Carbon, Toolbox for the Classic environment, POSIX, and Java), making them easy to spot.  Though, Carbon and Classic aren't really supported by Apple anymore.  They were for providing developers with an upgrade path from old version of Classic Mac OS (before Cocoa).  You can still use Java, but Apple has lessened its support of Java.  Java is good for cross-platform work where you want to develop apps that will run on Mac or Windows.  The problem with Java is it reduces the application software to the &quot;least common denominator&quot; disallowing the use of many APIs in Cocoa and Mac OS X.  The Mac App Store will not accept applications written in Java.

Although there are a number of APIs available to program the Mac, Cocoa and Objective-C are &quot;native&quot; allowing you to develop apps that are truly &quot;Mac-like&quot;.

You can open the documentation window at any time using Help→Documentation.  This will take you to the documentation that was installed when you installed XCode, etc. on your computer.

The documentation library can also be updated by going to the Xcode Preferences (Xcode→Preferences), and choosing the Documentation option.

As well as complete descriptions of all Cocoa classes and methods, it also has a number of extended discussions about particular aspects of Cocoa programming. These are well worth reading once you have picked up the basics, perhaps from here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Problem''': given a function '''f''' defined on complex numbers and a square area that contains only one root of the function, find this root.

We will use [[:w:residue theorem|residue theorem]] for the function 1/f(x). First we need to be able to calculate integrals on a square path.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun integrate-square-path (f start length precision)
  &quot;f is the function to integrate.
   Start is a complex number: the lower left corner of the square.
   Length is the length of the side of square.
   Precision is the distance between two points that we consider acceptable.&quot;
  (let* ((sum 0) ;;The result would be summed there
         (n (ceiling (/ length precision))) ;;How many points on each side
         (step (float (/ length n))) ;;Distance between points
         (j 0) ;;index
         (side 0) ;;The number of side: from 0 to 3
         (d (complex step 0)) ;;Complex difference between two points
         (cur start)) ;;Current position 
    (loop (incf sum (* (funcall f cur) d)) ;;Increment the sum
          (incf cur d) ;;Change the position
          (incf j) ;;Increment the index
          (when (= j n) ;;Time to change the side
            (setf j 0)  
            (incf side)
            (setf d (case side  ;;Change the direction
                      (1 (complex 0 step))
                      (2 (complex (- step) 0))
                      (3 (complex 0 (- step)))
                      (4 (return sum))))))))
&lt;/source&gt;

The main loop could be made more concise with the use of extended '''loop''' syntax. The above function is very procedural in nature. You would use the same algorithm in C-like programming languages. Still, Lisp has a little advantage due to its native complex number support and the fact that '''case''' returns value, unlike '''switch''' in C.

Note the use of '''float''' function that converts the result of division to float. Without it, Lisp would operate with rational numbers, and the result won't be pretty (unless you find rationals with 1000-digit denominators pretty). As soon as the function is loaded into Lisp, you can test it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 CL-USER&gt; (integrate-square-path (lambda (x) (/ 1 x)) #C(-1 -1) 2 0.001)
 #C(-0.0019999794 6.2832413)
&lt;/source&gt;

This correlates with the theory that predicts 2πi being the result.  

Now, the corollary of the residue theorem states that there is a pole in the area iff the path integral that goes around that area is not zero. We can write a simple function on top of the previous one that provides what we need:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun pole-p (f start length precision)
  &quot;Tests, whether the given square contains a pole of f and
returns the center of the square if there is a pole after all&quot;
  (when (&gt; (abs (integrate-square-path f start length precision)) (sqrt precision))
    (+ start (/ (complex length length) 2))))
&lt;/source&gt;

The return value would be useful in the recursion-terminating case of the next function, which divides a square into 4 smaller squares and uses indirect recursion to complete its task.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;            
(defun find-pole (f start length precision)
  &quot;Finds a pole of the function in the square area&quot;
  (when (&gt; (* precision 10) length) 
    (return-from find-pole (pole-p f start length precision)))
  (let ((h (float (/ length 2))))
    (flet ((check-pole (start)
             (when (pole-p f start h precision)
               (find-pole f start h precision))))
      (or (check-pole start)
          (check-pole (+ start (complex 0 h)))
          (check-pole (+ start (complex h 0)))
          (check-pole (+ start (complex h h)))))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, this is an example how functional programming can save lines of code. We define a small helper function that uses its ''lexical environment'' to know the values of '''f''', '''start''', '''h''' and '''precision''', so the only thing we need to pass to it is the upper-right corner of the square.  The power of '''or''' macro saved some superfluous branching as well. This function, while elegant, is quite hard to understand. It's a good exercise to work out what do check-pole and find-pole return in different situations and how their return values affect the control flow.

Finally, to find a root of function f we need to find a pole of 1/f. This is quite easy to do.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun find-root (f start length precision)
  &quot;Finds a root of the function in the square area&quot;
  (find-pole (lambda (x) (/ 1 (funcall f x))) start length precision))      
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's test it. f(x)=x²+2 has two complex roots: ±sqrt(2)*i. Let's see if our program can find the upper one:
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 CL-USER&gt; (find-root (lambda (x) (+ (* x x) 2)) #C(-1 0) 5 0.0001) 
 #C(-5.493164E-4 1.4138794)
&lt;/source&gt;

Looks like the right answer!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Introspection, in psychology, means to examine experience for its constituents, or elements. It was utilized by the first psychologist (Wilhelm Wundt) as a method of discovering the elements of conscious experience. Basically, Wundt showed visual stimuli to well-trained subjects and asked them what elements they were experiencing. The method proved to be unreliable as other researchers, using other subjects, discovered other elements than Wundt. Wundt's first student in America, Bradford Titchner, had just such a long-running disagreement with Wundt.

The common use of &quot;introspection&quot; today is to look inward in an effort toward self-understanding. While both the present-day and the historical uses of the term utilize observations of unknown veracity, it is important to note that psychology, historically, used the method to examine sensory phenomena to deduce elements of mental experience, not explanations for individual behavior.

== Concentration Is Like Salt Used For Food ==

After eagerness comes concentration on studies. One may think that motivation is all that one requires to become a good student, but it is not this easy. Remember: the journey never has a quick end. Education is what schools, colleges and universities are all made for. Concentration isn't something which is always required, but when it is, it must be done whether it is difficult or easy. It can take a long time for some people to learn how to properly concentrate in a given environment, but like in meditation or prayer, it will come with time and practice.

Concentration can be made easier following these steps:
#Arouse Concentration By Increasing Its Consciousness In Your Mind
#:One can arouse concentration by spending extra time with some good educational chores, or spending time on the Internet searching for good articles at Wikipedia. ''Yeah! Wiki Rules!''
#:You can also try chewing thick pieces of gum. The deep muscle exercising of your jaws can help you focus on the task at hand. Some people find bouncing on a big ball while studying will also move those muscles in much the same way. 
#Reading Books
#:Reading good books can arouse concentration towards studies ''sometimes''. Try reading books related to your favorite hobbies, subjects, role models, etc.
#Good Hobbies
#:Reading books can actually belong in this category. Like other good hobbies, it not only arouses concentration for studies, it also arouses concentration for lifetime processes.
#Discussion On Projects
#:Discussion on certain good subjects (e.g., physics phenomena) also leads to concentration automatically. It can also help you to remember important information in those subjects, as discussing things will often embed concepts and key facts deeper into your mind.
#Environment
#:Make sure there is nothing to distract you. You should have a working surface such as a desk in front of you, but some people may prefer to work on the floor. Remember that the optimum goal is to achieve comfort so that you can focus on your work. Clear everything off your desk or other surface so that you only have what you need on it. Nothing can make work harder than continuously looking for space to put your books, so put things you don't need on a shelf or somewhere else where they will not distract you. On top of that, make sure that there is nothing which may divert your attention away from your work such as a game, or even any books and papers which you don't need. Some people will be surprised at how much their mind can wander when they are trying to do work! 

#:Make sure you have done your dishes, cleaned the sink, and that you have done all the other things you suddenly 'want' or 'need' to do when you should start studying. Another option is to do your work in the library. Many libraries will provide a room which is specially designed for studying in. They may even go so far as to provide some light music to listen to while you work!

#:One major thing that you want to avoid is doing your homework on your bed, in the kitchen or in the lounge room. Your mind is conditioned to performing different activities in these rooms which do not require the same level of concentration as when you are studying. For example, if you try doing work on your bed, you may suddenly feel tired! This is because your body is used to sleeping on a bed, not doing work. Another negative effect is that you may find it harder to sleep at night, as your body becomes confused as to whether it should be concentrating or relaxing.
#:For the same reasons, try to avoid the following:
#:*Eating heavy meals at your designated work area. (Light snacks might be acceptable for some people)
#:*If you are able, try not to do your work on your computer desk if you use it mostly for playing games. That's why many houses have a 'study' room.
#:With time, your body will become used to concentrating at your work area, and you may find studying much easier after a while!
# Time
#:Time is important in two ways. First, think about when you are most able to study, when you are most awake. Is it in the morning, the afternoon or in the evening? Study at that time.&lt;br/&gt;Second, don't try to study for a whole day, or even a whole afternoon. Study for 45 minutes or an hour and take a break of about 15 minutes.
#:Students can increase their concentration by doing exercises and yoga in the morning. One of the best tips being tried by many Indian students to increase their concentration is  '''Brahmari''' pranayam.
#:To practice it:
#:*Sit in a relaxed posture
#:*Take a deep breath inside
#:*Close both of your eyes using your index and middle finger
#:*Close your nose with your third finger
#:*Close your ears with your thumbs
#:*Exhale slowly

Use your creativity
One effective way of developing deeper level of understanding is to use creative skills to think on the subject. One can do that by trying to arrive at the conclusion from a different point of view, or by trying to make original questions. This technique is [http://thinkingbuddy.uni.cc/wiki/?title=How+to+improve+concentration+in+studies elaborated here].
Following these can help your concentration and increase your comfort so that you can focus on the work at hand.

That's it for here. Let's learn manners next.

== Manners, The One Behind Your True Reputation ==

Whether you are a president at a conference or a normal guy in the street, your reputation is what your respect determines it all and the one behind your reputation is &quot;Manners&quot;. Manners is almost everything you can represent at a meeting or anywhere in the world other than your contributions. Excellent behavior leads to excellent results. Behavior also determines the quality &amp; dignity a person has. Behavior is developed easily in students, though it takes time.

== Ways To Behave ==

Good behavior should become a way of life, not just something that is shown or talked about. The ways to behave differs from situation to situation, for example.

If a man talks to you by saying &quot;Hello!&quot; or &quot;Good Evening!&quot; or &quot;Good Afternoon!&quot;, your reply will absolutely be positive like &quot; Hello! Nice to meet you!&quot;

Situations can be of two types:-

1.) Positive Situations - As illustrated in the example given above

2.) Negative Situations - 

Example:- If someone teases you, you'll probably say a negative reply like &quot;Stop teasing me, you idiot!!!&quot;

Although someone can arise you to say a negative reply, you can say a reply which is not rude but still negative.

Example:- Watch &quot;MTV's Boiling Points&quot;. In a situation, you'll see that the one who passes the time of the ''Boiling Point'' always/probably uses negative replies which aren't rude.

== Behaving At School/University ==

So how does all this behavior fit into your education? Well first of all you may find it much easier  to deal with pressure, and you won't take it out on the people you love, but you can also use it to win the favour of your teacher. Giving out a pleasant, positive atmosphere is sure to make you stand out in your classes, and your teachers may be more willing to help you succeed.

So always try your best to be on your best behavior, no matter wherever you are, because it determines your respect in the world. Let's move onto management.

In the last chapter, we made a version of &quot;Hello World&quot; just by adding the text to a window in Interface Builder. You may have felt that this was cheating a little, as we haven't even written a line of code yet. We'll now revisit &quot;Hello World&quot;, but this time do it in code.

First, we need to know a little bit about writing code for Cocoa. Cocoa is programmed in Objective-C, a small extension to the C language. If you know C, Objective-C is very easy to learn. If you know C++, it's far simpler while embodying many of the same basic concepts, and more. If you know another language, you should be able to pick it up easily enough.

Objective-C, is, as its name might suggest, a version of C that supports Objects, or Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Some people that have come from a traditional procedural language background find object-oriented a bit alien at first, but those with no programming experience at all often do better, because OOP is much closer to how we deal with things in the real world.

Most objects in the real world have a defined purpose, a set of properties, and a particular way that they are best used. Think of the everyday task of making a cup of tea. Several objects are involved, each with their particular role in the overall task. A tap provides water; a kettle raises its temperature to boiling point; a cup provides a container for the tea, and so on. The kettle for example, has particular ''properties''&amp;nbsp;— how much water it can contain, its operating voltage, the material it is made from. It also has one main job&amp;nbsp;— to boil the water. In OOP terms, the boiling operation is a ''method'' of the kettle object, as is the pour into cup operation. All objects are described in terms of their properties and their behaviours (methods). It is the same in an OOP programming language.

A collection of methods and properties is defined in the idea of an object which we call a class. The class 'kettle' is just the idea of a kettle, it is not any particular kettle. When we want an actual kettle, we are then talking about a concrete example of a kettle, which in OOP programming we call an ''instance'' of the class 'kettle'. This distinction is important&amp;nbsp;— we will occasionally define a class of object, but this on its own will do nothing until we make an actual concrete example of that class, or ''instantiate'' it. A class definition describes the properties and methods of the object, but only the instance actually has those properties, and is able to carry out the methods. Usually, when we are casually talking about &quot;objects&quot; within the program, we are talking about instances of objects.

In Objective-C, an instance of an object is referenced by a pointer variable:

 NSString* myString;

This references an NSString object with the variable name 'myString'. Note: all Cocoa's built-in classes start with 'NS'. Your own classes should probably adopt a naming convention of your own device&amp;nbsp;— perhaps your initials. This is just to make sure that there is no ambiguity between the classes Cocoa provides and any you create. Another example:

 GCKettle* teasMaidK2;

One of the key goals of OOP programming is to hide implementation details from the user of an object&amp;nbsp;— for example, we don't care whether a kettle boils the water using a resistive element or an exotic molecular jiggler device, we only care that the water boils when we press the 'boil' switch, or some short time after. Similarly, users of objects in a program should generally be designed to not care about how objects work, only that they give the expected results on demand. This means that in order to examine the properties of an object, we should not rudely peek directly at the innards of the object, but instead ask the object politely to tell us the value of a particular property. Some properties of an object are fixed, others changeable. In OOP-speak, we call this 'immutable' and 'mutable' respectively. Since we can ask for properties, or change them, or set a method going such as 'boil', all of these things are achieved in the same way, which is by ''sending a message'' to the object. Because we are hiding the implementation details of the object, all properties are in fact accessed via methods, so the distinction between them is fairly blurred.

In Objective-C, we send a message to an object by using a square bracket notation:

 [teasMaidK2 boil];

This sends the message 'boil' to the kettle object 'teasMaidK2'.

We can also obtain information about properties in the same way:

 NSColor* kettleColor = [teasMaidK2 color];

This sends the message 'color' to the kettle object. It responds by returning the value of the 'color' property and assigns it to 'kettleColor'.

Very often, we need to supply additional information to a method so it knows what we want. This extra information is called the method's ''parameters''. Objective-C has a very interesting way of passing parameters, one that might look strange at first, but which has some great advantages. Suppose we have a kettle that can operate on either 220V ac or 110V ac, and we can change it using a method called setVoltage. We need to tell it what voltage to use, and it's as simple as:

 [teasMaidK2 setVoltage:110];

We simply put a colon and the value of the parameter.

Where it gets interesting is when there is more than one parameter to a method. C and C++ programmers (and most others) are used to using commas to separate a list of parameters, such as:

 object-&gt;setColor( 255, 128, 0 );

Looking at this, you have no idea what the three parameters actually are&amp;nbsp;— you would have to look it up in the header to find the original definition, hoping that the programmer actually included the information (some languages such as C don't require parameter names here, so you could still be in the dark):

 void setColor(int green, int red, int blue);

Note that if you assumed it was in order red, green, blue you'd have been wrong!

Objective-C takes a different approach, one that saves you the trouble of looking up the header to simply read the code, and it makes it much more self-documenting. For example:

 [teasMaidK2 setColorWithRed:128 green:255 blue:0];

In Objective-C, the parameter names are part of the overall method name; they can't be missed out. The actual method is called &quot;setColorWithRed:green:blue:&quot; The colons are also part of the unique method name, so setVoltage and setVoltage: are two distinct methods. This often catches out beginners, so make a note of it.

Method calls in Objective-C can be nested as required, e.g.

 [teasMaidK2 setVoltage:[mainsSupply outputVoltage]];


Note that the square brackets as used for array indices in C are still available without ambiguity:

 [teasMaidK2 setVoltage:supply[2]];

==Don't call us, we'll call you==

When should you call a method? Whenever you want information or action from another object. However, very often, it's not you that wants to know&amp;nbsp;— it's Cocoa itself, and you are expected to provide the answer. In practice, writing applications with Cocoa needs both, but there are many places where you will simply be expected to provide answers on demand. Again, classically-oriented programmers often have trouble with this idea; they are used to having complete control, and asking the operating system to do things ''for them''. OOP tends to turn things on their heads a bit&amp;nbsp;— make the right object, put it in the right place and wait for it to be called upon. Again, this is more like real life, where you as an employee have a particular role&amp;nbsp;— your boss will give you tasks, you carry them out. It's not your job to run the whole company, just to do your little bit. You might delegate part of your task to others, or request information from others to get the job done, but your boss doesn't care as long as he gets his results.

In this exercise, we will in fact be doing just this&amp;nbsp;— creating an object that will be called upon by Cocoa to perform a little task for it. What is the task? It's to draw the famous words &quot;Hello World&quot; to the screen when needed.

To do this, we need to make an object that we can be sure will be called upon whenever a window's contents needs to be drawn. Later in this text, we will go into this in much more detail, but for now we'll just gloss over the basics. In Cocoa, stuff that is drawn in windows is actually drawn by objects called ''views''. A button that you can click is a view, for example, as is the &quot;Hello World&quot; text that we added in the first part. Views can contain other views, so a complex hierarchy of them can exist. Here though, we will keep it simple.

We'll need a custom view that 'knows' how to write &quot;Hello World&quot;; that is, it contains code that will accomplish this when called upon by Cocoa.

In all OOP frameworks such as Cocoa, another main goal is to make coding as efficient as possible by maximizing ''reuse'' of code. The idea is to solve a typical kind of problem once, then allow the programmer to leverage that solution in their own work rather than starting again from scratch, which is usually just a waste of valuable time. In Cocoa, the 'problem' of drawing all sorts of things in windows has already been solved by the views classes, so we do not need to solve this problem again. Instead, we can make use of the existing code and simply extend it a little bit to do the unique thing that we want it to do, without worrying about the rest. This customisation of existing classes is called ''subclassing''. We will subclass Cocoa's NSView class, and then write some code to make it do the unique extra thing we want.

Interface Builder contains some neat helper tools to make this task very easy. Go into Interface Builder by double-clicking &quot;MainMenu.nib&quot; in the left hand panel of Xcode. Double-click the Window icon to make the window come to the front. Select and delete the &quot;Hello World&quot; text. In the library go to the map Cocoa and submap `views &amp; Cells` (for Xcode versions prior to Xcode 3.1 it is in the tools palette). Drag the 'CustomView' into the window and drop it.

Drag the selection handles to position the view where you'd like&amp;nbsp;— for this exercise, don't make it fit exactly to the whole window; leave a bit of a margin. Note how Interface Builder gives you guidelines as you move and size the custom view. These guidelines are a boon for neatly laying out more complex interfaces.

At the moment, &quot;CustomView&quot; is just a placeholder for the view we are going to make, so next we need to define a class for the custom view. IB will help us. Go back to the main IB window, titled &quot;MainMenu.nib (English)&quot;, and click the tab button marked 'Classes'. This shows a column view of lots of classes, starting with 'NS'. Find NSObject→NSResponder→NSView and select it. A number of existing NSView subclasses will show to its right, but we don't need those now&amp;nbsp;— we want to add to this list. With NSView selected, choose Classes→Subclass NSView. A new item is added to the list, with its name highlighted. Type in a descriptive name for the class. If you are using XCode 3.0 or greater, Apple changed the way to do this step. In XCode, right click in the folder &quot;Other Sources&quot;, then mouse over &quot;Add&quot;, then &quot;New File...&quot;. Under the Cocoa heading, choose &quot;Objective-C Class&quot; from the icon list, then in the drop down list below that area, select &quot;NSView subclass&quot;. Type in your name in place of untitled, and leave the other stuff alone. I used 'GCHelloView' because GC are my initials, and HelloView is reasonably descriptive. Avoid the temptation to use silly or obscure names&amp;nbsp;— you'll regret it later!

Now go back to the window and click on CustomView to select it. Choose Tools→Show Identity Inspector. A new palette appears, which allows you to set the properties of objects. In the pop-up menu, choose &quot;Custom Class&quot;. A list appears. Find your custom class name ('GCHelloView' in my case) and select it. You'll see that the name of the view in the window changes to this name.

The next step is to get IB to actually create some skeleton code for this new class. Go back to the main window and its &quot;Classes&quot; panel. Ensure your custom view class is selected, and choose Classes→Create Files for GCHelloView (or whatever you named it). A dialog opens asking whether you want the files added to the project. Of course you do, so the defaults are fine. Click Choose. The files are created and added to Xcode automatically. If you're using a version of XCode larger than 3.0, however, don't worry&amp;nbsp;— you created these files earlier during the process of adding them. We're done with IB for now, so save the changes, and return to Xcode.

In the left-hand panel of your Xcode project, drill down to HelloWorld/Other Sources. You'll see two files added there: GCHelloView.h and GCHelloView.m (or whatever name you chose). The .h file is the header, as with any C program. The .m file contains the Objective-C code. Select the .h file. The main area of the Xcode window changes and displays the content of this file. (By the way, you might like to make the text part bigger by dragging the split bar upwards&amp;nbsp;— the top area isn't very interesting here and can be made much smaller.) The interesting part looks like:

 @interface GCHelloView : NSView
 {
 }
 @end

This is how a subclass is defined in Cocoa&amp;nbsp;— everything between '@interface' and '@end' is the ''class definition''. The class name is GCHelloView, and it is a subclass of NSView. Because our class doesn't implement any new methods, it will just reimplement (or ''override'', as we call it) existing NSView methods, the definition is empty and we don't need to add anything here. Note: C++ programmers might find this a bit odd&amp;nbsp;— in C++ we must explicitly declare which methods we are going to override; in Objective-C we just do it, which saves ourselves a little effort.

OK, to the code! Select the .m file. You will see two method skeletons there, one called 'initWithFrame:', and one called 'drawRect:' (remember, a colon is an intrinsic part of a method's name). For this exercise, we don't need to worry about the initWithFrame: method; all of our code will go in the drawRect: method.

First though, what happens if we build and go now? Try it! You'll see that everything compiles just fine, the program runs, and the window is blank once more (assuming you took the old text out in IB). OK, quit and go back to the editor.

This time, we want to make the text we write in the window a lot more impressive, so we'll make it use a large font size and a bright color. The way that Cocoa specifies fonts and so forth when rendering strings is to use a ''dictionary of attributes''. This is an object which simply associates a named property with a value. The font property is named &quot;NSFontAttributeName&quot;, and the color of the text attribute name is &quot;NSForegroundColorAttributeName&quot;. These names are called the ''keys'' of the attributes. First we'll set up these attributes, then draw the string using them. Here's the code:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect
{
       NSString*               hws = @&quot;Hello World!&quot;;
       NSPoint                 p;
       NSMutableDictionary*    attribs;
       NSColor*                c;
       NSFont*                 fnt;

       p = NSMakePoint( 10, 100 );

       attribs = [[[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init] autorelease];

       c = [NSColor redColor];
       fnt = [NSFont fontWithName:@&quot;Times Roman&quot; size:48];

       [attribs setObject:c forKey:NSForegroundColorAttributeName];
       [attribs setObject:fnt forKey:NSFontAttributeName];

       [hws drawAtPoint:p withAttributes:attribs];
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Type that in exactly as given, and hit &quot;Build and Go&quot;. Your application should greet you in large red letters! (If the text doesn't show up, try making the &quot;GCHelloView&quot; box in IB larger.) This code might look a little complex for such a trivial task as drawing a large red string, but in some ways that's because this task is a little artificially contrived. However, it's not that complex, let's look at it line by line.

The top five lines are simple variable declarations as you'd find in any C routine. The pointer variables with the name 'NS…' indicate that these are references to Cocoa objects. We declare a simple fixed string first, containing the text &quot;Hello World&quot;. This is an NSString object. This object is very different from an old-style C string, though here we use it in a very similar way. NSStrings are objects containing a text string which is encoded in a particular way, such as Unicode. NSStrings are more than mere containers, however; they have many methods for performing operations on strings. We'll revisit it later, but for now we just use it in a fairly dumb manner. Note that NSString constants are preceded by the '@' symbol and surrounded by quote marks.

The attributes are stored in a NSDictionary object which here is mutable&amp;nbsp;— that is, we wish to change it so that we can set up the attributes, so we use an NSMutableDictionary object. The color and font information is encapsulated in NSColor and NSFont objects.

Note that NSPoint is not a class but a plain old C type. It is a struct consisting of two floats x and y representing coordinates. That is why p is not a pointer variable like hws or attribs.

Now we will tell the text WHERE it will be drawn within the window. 'p' is just a coordinate which is 10 pixels in from the left, and 100 pixels up from the bottom of the view.

Next we instantiate the dictionary object&amp;nbsp;— that is, we make a concrete object of the class NSMutableDictionary. The line that does this is one you will encounter again and again&amp;nbsp;— the first method ''alloc'' reserves memory for the object and returns it; the second one, ''init'', asks it to initialise itself (whatever that means in practice); and the third tells it to &quot;autorelease&quot; itself. We'll discuss what that means later. Hold on, you might be saying&amp;nbsp;— what object is being called with the alloc method? We haven't made the object yet! In fact, alloc is an example of a ''class method'', which is a method that doesn't require a concrete example of the object, the class itself knows what to do. Class methods are common&amp;nbsp;— we'll encounter two more in a minute&amp;nbsp;— and very useful. They allow us to perform generic operations that pertain to the class of object without actually having an object available. Very often these class methods return actual objects&amp;nbsp;— they are known as ''factory methods'' in OOP-speak. A class method is called very simply by using the name of the class in place of an object instance variable, e.g.

 red = [NSColor redColor]; /* class method */

is a class method but:

 bright = [red brightnessComponent]; /* instance method */

is an instance method.

Two more factory methods follow&amp;nbsp;— the first to make an object embodying the color red, the second a font object embodying the font 48 point Times Roman. These are then added as attributes to the dictionary using the appropriate keys.

Finally, we are all set and ready to draw. The last line accomplishes this. Note that it is a method of NSString itself&amp;nbsp;— the string knows how to render itself, provided we give it enough information. So we tell it where, and what attributes we'd like it to use. Note that what we didn't tell it was WHEN to draw the string. Instead, we just made the method available, knowing that Cocoa would call upon it when required. Cocoa will do this when it needs to refresh the content of the window&amp;nbsp;— at such times, the documentation tells us that a view's drawRect: method will be called, so provided we put our code there, it will get called as needed.

==Gilding the lily==

Let's add a little more code, just for fun. At the end of the method, before the closing brace, add:

 [[NSColor blueColor] set];
 NSFrameRect([self bounds]);

Hit Build &amp; Go (command-R), and see what that does. Maybe you can guess?

The first line is a class method on NSColor to get us a blue color object, then call its 'set' method. This simply establishes that color as the one that will be used for drawing whatever happens to be drawn next. This is a handy way of setting up colors, and you will use it often. Finally we use a simple C function, 'NSFrameRect' which draws a rectangular frame. The interesting thing here is that the rectangle it draws is a property of the view itself, called ''bounds''. To ask an object for one of its own properties, or to call one of its own methods we use the object reference 'self'. This always refers to the object in which the code itself resides, so it's a very handy way of talking to yourself. The bounds of a view is the space it occupies within its parent view or window.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When we look around us, we observed that most of the people are engaged in one activity or the other. Teacher teach in the school, farmers work in the fields, workers work in the factories, drivers drive vehicles, shopkeepers sells goods, doctors attend to patients and so on. In this way,people are busy during the day and sometimes during the night throughout the year. Now the question WHY we all keep ourselves busy. The answer is to satisfy our wants. By doing so, we either fulfill various obligations or earn money through which we can buy goods and commodities.

Business is a human activity in order to satisfy our wants.

== Human Activities ==
Activities which human being undertake are known as human activities. These may be cultivating land, growing plants, rearing animals, teaching in school or college, working in a factory or office, watching television, listening radio, reading newspaper, worshiping in a temple, playing football, etc. We can divide this activities into two broad categories as
(i) economic activities
(ii) non-economic activities

'''(i) Economic activities'''

Activities, which are performed with an objective to earn money, are known as economic activities. For example, a farmer grow crops to sell them, a factory or office employee works and gets wage or salary, a businessman earns profit through buying and selling of goods.

'''(ii) Non-economic activities'''

Activities which are not performed to earn money but to get some satisfaction

==Types of Businesses==
'''Sole Proprietorship'''

A sole proprietorship is a business run by one person. This one person, known as a proprietor, has the advantage of being in control of the entire business, and having all the income of the business going directly to him or her. The downside of this is that a Sole Proprietorship is not taxed as a business entity, so all income of the business is taxed as personal income tax. Additionally, the proprietor has '''Unlimited Liability''' meaning that if the business goes under, and the assets of the business are insufficient to satisfy the debts of the business, the creditors can seize the personal assets of the proprietor.

'''Partnership'''

A partnership is a firm run by more than one person. These people are all known as partners of the company, and they have the advantage of sharing the losses, but have to share the profits too. The percentage of sharing loses and profits could be determined according to the partnership agreement drawn between the partners, they vary from country to country. The partners make all decisions collectively, and each partner is responsible to the others for any decision he makes with relation to the business. Each partner, by the virtue of being a partner, represents the business and is expected to act in ways that won't be detrimental to the business. New Partners are added for their expertise. Partnerships are easy to form usually professionals lawyers, doctors and consultants form partnership to benefit from the expertise of each other. 

'''Private Limited Companies'''

A private limited company too can have just two shareholders. However the shareholders of a private limited company could be limited to family members or friends. A private limited company is formed by registering the memorandum and articles of association with the local registrar of companies. The shareholder liability is limited to the authorized share capital. It is less complex to form unlike a public limited company. The rules and regulations on the formation of a private limited company have to be checked out with your local chamber of commerce or registrar of companies. The accounts of a private limited company have to be audited by independent auditors and board of director; they meet regularly to make decisions and they have an annual general meeting when all shareholders meet to discuss the wider management issues of the company.

'''Corportations'''

A corporation is created as a separate legal entity that has privileges and liabilities that are distinct from those of its owners. Despite not being a natural person, corporations are recognized by the law, in some countries and the USA in particular, as having the same legal rights and responsibilities as natural persons (&quot;people&quot;). The formation of a corporation protects the owners against unlimited liability. As long as the business operates legally it is liable to it's creditors only the value of the assets of the business. If the corporation fails the investors are liable only for the assets of the business.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

The '''Continuous-Time Fourier Transform''' (CTFT) is the version of the fourier transform that is most common, and is the only fourier transform so far discussed in EE wikibooks such as [[Signals and Systems]], or [[Communication Systems]]. This transform is mentioned here as a stepping stone for further discussions of the '''Discrete-Time Fourier Transform''' (DTFT), and the '''Discrete Fourier Transform''' (DFT). The CTFT itself is not useful in digital signal processing applications, so it will not appear much in the rest of this book

== CTFT Definition ==

The CTFT is defined as such:

{{eqn|CTFT}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\omega) = \int f(t) e^{-j \omega t} dt&lt;/math&gt;

== CTFT Use ==

== Frequency Domain ==

== Convolution Theorem ==

Multiplication in the time domain becomes convolution in the frequency domain. Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain. This is an example of the property of '''duality'''. The convolution theorem is a very important theorem, and every transform has a version of it, so it is a good idea to become familiar with it now (if you aren't previously familiar with it).

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

The '''Discrete-Time Fourier Transform''' (DTFT) is the cornerstone of all DSP, because it tells us that from a discrete set of samples of a continuous function, we can create a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_summation periodic summation] of that function's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform Fourier transform].  At the very least, we can recreate an approximation of the actual transform and its inverse, the original continuous function.  And under certain idealized conditions, we can recreate the original function with no distortion at all.  That famous theorem is called the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem].

== DTFT ==

{{eqn|DTFT}}
:&lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x[n]e^{-j\omega n}&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting function, &lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega})&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function that is interesting for analysis.  It can be used in programs, such as Matlab, to design filters and obtain the corresponding time-domain filter values.

== DTFT Convolution Theorem ==

Like the CTFT, the DTFT has a convolution theorem associated with it. However, since the DTFT results in discrete-frequency values, the convolution theorem needs to be modified as such:

{{TextBox|
;DTFT Convolution Theorem: Multiplication in the continuous time domain becomes  discrete convolution in the discrete frequency domain. Convolution in the continuous time domain becomes mulitplication in the discrete frequency domain.}}

== Energy ==

It is sometimes helpful to calculate the amount of '''energy''' that exists in a certain set. These calculations are based off the assumption that the different values in a set are voltage values, however this doesn't necessarily need to be the case to employ these operations.

We can show that the energy of a given set can be given by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_x = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \left| x[n] \right| ^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Energy in Frequency ==

Likewise, we can make a formula that represents the power in the continuous-frequency output of the DTFT:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_x = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|X(e^{j \omega})\right|^2 d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

== Parseval's Theorem ==

Parseval's theorem states that the energy amounts found in the time domain must be equal to the energy amounts found in the frequency domain:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \left| x[n] \right| ^2 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi \left|X(e^{j \omega})\right|^2 d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

== Power Density Spectrum ==

We can define the power density spectrum of the continuous-time frequency output of the DTFT as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{xx}(e^{j\omega}) = \left|X(e^{j \omega})\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

The area under the power density spectrum curve is the total energy of the signal.</text>

As the name implies, the '''Discrete Fourier Transform''' (DFT) is purely discrete: discrete-time data sets are converted into a discrete-frequency representation. This is in contrast to the DTFT that uses discrete time, but converts to continuous frequency. Since the resulting frequency information is discrete in nature, it is very common for computers to use DFT(Discrete fourier TransforM) calculations when frequency information is needed. 

Using a series of mathematical tricks and generalizations, there is an algorithm for computing the DFT that is very fast on modern computers. This algorithm is known as the '''Fast Fourier Transform''' (FFT), and produces the same results as the normal DFT, in a fraction of the computational time as ordinary DFT calculations. The FFT will be discussed in detail in later chapters.

== DFT ==

The Discrete Fourier Transform is a numerical variant of the Fourier Transform.  Specifically, given a vector of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; input amplitudes such as {f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,  ... , f&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;}, the Discrete Fourier Transform yields a set of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; frequency magnitudes.

The DFT is defined as such:

&lt;math&gt;X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{\frac{-j 2 \pi k n}{ N }}&lt;/math&gt;

here, k is used to denote the frequency domain ordinal, and n is used to represent the time-domain ordinal. The big &quot;N&quot; is the length of the sequence to be transformed.

The '''Inverse DFT''' (IDFT) is given by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X[k] W_N^{-kn}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;W_N&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;W_N = e^{-j2\pi/N}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, &quot;N&quot; is the length of the transformed sequence.

== Matrix Calculations ==

The DFT can be calculated much more easily using a matrix equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{D}_N \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

The little &quot;x&quot; is the time domain sequence arranged as a Nx1 vertical vector. The big &quot;X&quot; is the resulting frequency information, that will be arranged as a vertical vector (as per the rules of matrix multiplication. The &quot;D&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; term is a matrix defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}_N = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1      &amp; 1         &amp; 1            &amp; \cdots &amp; 1
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N       &amp; W_N^2        &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{(N-1)}
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^2     &amp; W_N^4        &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{2(N-1)}
  \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots    &amp; \vdots       &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{N-1} &amp; W_N^{2(N-1)} &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{(N-1)(N-1)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar way, the IDFT can be calculated using matrices as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{D}_N^{-1} \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;

And we will define &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}_N^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}_N^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1      &amp; 1          &amp; 1             &amp; \cdots &amp; 1
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{-1}   &amp; W_N^{-2}      &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{-(N-1)}
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{-2}   &amp; W_N^{-4}      &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{-2(N-1)}
  \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots     &amp; \vdots        &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots
  \\
    1      &amp; W_N^{-N-1} &amp; W_N^{-2(N-1)} &amp; \cdots &amp; W_N^{-(N-1)(N-1)}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Visualization of the Discrete Fourier Transform==

It may be easily seen that the term

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-\pi t} &lt;/math&gt;

represents a unit vector in the complex plane, for any value of j and k.  The angle of the vector is initially 0 radians (along the real axis) for &lt;math&gt;j=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;.  As j and k increase, the angle is increased in units of 1/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a circle.  The total angle therefore becomes &lt;math&gt;2\pi*jk/n&lt;/math&gt; radians.  

To understand the meaning of the Discrete Fourier Transform, it becomes effective to write the transform in matrix form, depicting the complex terms pictorally.  

For example, with &lt;math&gt;n=8&lt;/math&gt;, the fourier transform can be written:

:[[Image:DFT_vis.jpg]]

The top row (or the left-hand column) changes not at all; therefore, F0 is the resultant when the amplitudes augment each other.  The second row changes by 1/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a circle, going from left to right.  The third row changes by 2/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;s of a circle; the fourth row changes by 3/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;s of a circle; the fifth row, here, changes by 4/n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;s = 4/8 = 1/2 a circle. Therefore, F4 is the resultant when the even terms are set at odds with the odd terms.

We therefore see from the square matrix that the DFT is the resultant of all 2-D vectoral combinations of the input amplitudes.

== Relation to DTFT ==

The DFT and the DTFT are related to each other in a very simple manner. If we take the DTFT of a given time sequence, x[n], we will get a continuous-frequency function called &lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega})&lt;/math&gt;. If we sample &lt;math&gt;X(e^{j\omega})&lt;/math&gt; at N equally-spaced locations, the result will be the DFT, X[k]

== Circular Time Shifting ==

'''Circular Time Shifting''' is very similar to regular, linear time shifting, except that as the items are shifted past a certain point, they are looped around to the other end of the sequence. This subject may seem like a bit of a tangent, but the importance of this topic will become apparent when we discuss the [[Digital Signal Processing/Circular Convolution|Circular Convolution]] operation in the next chapter.

Let's say we have a given sequence, x[n], as such:

 x[n] = [1&amp; 2 3 4]

As we know, we can time-shift this sequence to the left or the right by subtracting or adding numbers to the argument:

 x[n+1] = [1 2&amp; 3 4 0]

 x[n-1] = [0&amp; 1 2 3 4]

Here, we've padded both sequences with zeros to make it obvious where the next item is coming in from. Now, let's say that when we shift a set, instead of padding with zeros, we loop the first number around to fill the hole. We will use the notation x[&lt;n+A&gt;] to denote an A-point circular shift:

 x[&lt;n+1&gt;] = [2&amp; 3 4 1]

Notice how the length of the sequence started as 4, and ended as 4, and we didn't need to pad with zeros. Also notice that the 1 &quot;fell off&quot; the left side of the set, and &quot;reappeared&quot; on the right side. It's as if the set is a circle, and objects that rotate off one direction will come back from the other direction. Likewise, let us rotate in the other direction:

 x[&lt;n-1&gt;] = [4&amp; 1 2 3]

If we rotate around by N points, where N is the length of the set, we get an important identity:

 x[&lt;n+N&gt;] = x[&lt;n-N&gt;] = x[n]

== Time Inversion ==

Now, let's look at a more complicated case: mixing circular shifting with time inversion. Let's define our example set x[n]:

 x[n] = [1&amp; 2 3 4]

we can define our time-inverted set as such:

 x[n] = [4 3 2 1&amp;]

notice that the &quot;4&quot; went from n=3 to n=-3, but the &quot;1&quot; stayed at the zero point. Now, let's try to combine this with our circular shift operation, to produce a result x[&lt;-n&gt;]. We know that the &quot;1&quot; (in the zero position) has not moved in either direction, nor have we shifted to the left or right, because we aren't adding or subtracting anything to our argument (n). So we can put 1 back in the same place as it was. All the rest of the numbers (2 3 and 4) all shifted to the right of the sequence, and therefore we will loop them around to the other side:

 x[&lt;-n&gt;] = [1&amp; 4 3 2]

Here is a general rule for circular time-inversion:

:&lt;math&gt;x[&lt;-n&gt;] = \left\{
\begin{matrix} 
    x[0],  &amp; \mbox{if }n = 0 
  \\ 
    x[&lt;N-n&gt;], &amp; \mbox{if }n \ne 0
\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

== Circular Convolution ==

'''Circular Convolution''' is an important operation to learn, because it  plays an important role in using the DFT.

Let's say we have 2 discrete sequences both of length N, x[n] and h[n]. We can define a circular convolution operation as such:

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[m]h[&lt;n-m&gt;_N]&lt;/math&gt;

notice how we are using a circular time-shifting operation, instead of the linear time-shift used in regular, linear convolution.

== Circular Convolution Theorem ==

The DFT has certain properties that make it incompatible with the regular convolution theorem. However, the DFT does have a similar relation with the Circular Convolution operation that is very helpful. We call this relation the '''Circular Convolution Theorem''', and we state it as such:


{{TextBox|
;Circular Convolution Theorem: Multiplication in the discrete-time domain becomes circular convolution in the discrete-frequency domain. Circular convolution in the discrete-time domain becomes multiplication in the discrete-frequency domain.}}

== Relation to Linear Convolution ==

Circular Convolution is related to linear convolution, and we can use the circular convolution operation to compute the linear convolution result. Let's say we have 2 sets, x[n] and h[n], both of length N:

# pad both sets with N-1 zeros on the right side.
# perform the circular convolution on the new sets of length N+(N-1)
# The result is the linear convolution result of the original two sets.

== Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ==
The Fast Fourier Transform refers to algorithms that compute the DFT in a numerically efficient manner.Algorithms like:-decimation in time and decimation in frequency.
This is a algorithm for computing the DFT that is very fast on modern computers.</text>

The '''Z Transform''' has a strong relationship to the DTFT, and is incredibly useful in transforming, analyzing, and manipulating discrete calculus equations. The Z transform is named such because the letter 'z' (a lower-case Z) is used as the transformation variable. 

== z Transform Definition ==

For a given sequence x[n], we can define the z-transform X(z) as such:

{{eqn|Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}(x[n]) = X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x[n]z^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;it is important to note that z is a continuous complex variable defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;z = Re(z) + j Im(z)&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the z-transform rarely needs to be computed manually, because many common results have already been tabulated extensively in tables, and control system software includes it (MatLab,Octave,SciLab).

== The Inverse Z-Transform ==

The inverse z-transform can be defined as such:

{{eqn|Inverse Z Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt;x[n] = \frac{1}{2 \pi j} \oint_C X(z) z^{n-1} dz&lt;/math&gt;

Where C is a closed-contour that lies inside the unit circle on the z-plane, and encircles the point z = {0, 0}.

The inverse z-transform is mathematically very complicated, but luckily--like the z-transform itself--the results are extensively tabulated in tables.

== Equivalence to DTFT ==

If we substitute &lt;math&gt;z = e^{j\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in radians per second, into the Z-transform, we get

:&lt;math&gt;Z(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]e^{-j\omega n}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the definition of the [[Digital Signal Processing/Discrete-Time Fourier Transform|Discrete-Time Fourier Transform]]. In other words, to convert from the Z-transform to the DTFT, we need to evaluate the Z-transform around the unit circle.

== Properties == 

Since the z-transform is equivalent to the DTFT, the z-transform has many of the same properties. Specifically, the z-transform has the property of duality, and it also has a version of the convolution theorem (discussed later).

The z-transform is a linear operator.

== Convolution Theorem ==

Since the Z-transform is equivalent to the DTFT, it also has a convolution theorem that is worth stating explicitly:

{{TextBox|
;Convolution Theorem:Multiplication in the discrete-time domain becomes convolution in the z-domain. Multiplication in the z-domain becomes convolution in the discrete-time domain.}}

== Z-Plane ==

Since the variable z is a continuous, complex variable, we can map the z variable to a complex plane as such:

[[Image:Empty Z Plane.svg|center|300px]]

== Transfer Function ==

Let's say we have a system with an input/output relationship defined as such:

 Y(z) = H(z)X(z)

We can define the transfer function of the system as being the term H(z). If we have a basic transfer function, we can break it down into parts:

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{N(z)}{D(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where H(z) is the transfer function, N(z) is the numerator of H(z) and D(z) is the denominator of H(z). If we set N(z)=0, the solutions to that equation are called the '''zeros''' of the transfer function. If we set D(z)=0, the solutions to that equation are called the '''poles''' of the transfer function.

The poles of the transfer function amplify the frequency response while the zero's attenuate it. This is important because when you design a filter you can place poles and zero's on the unit circle and quickly evaluate your filters frequency response.

=== Example ===

{{TextBox|Here is an example:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(z) = \frac{z^{-1}}{(z^{-1} + 2)}X(z)&lt;/math&gt;

So by dividing through by X(z), we can show that the transfer function is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{z^{-1}}{(z^{-1} + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also find the D(z) and N(z) equations as such:

:&lt;math&gt;N(z) = z^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D(z) = (z^{-1} + 2)&lt;/math&gt;

And from those equations, we can find the poles and zeros:

;Zeros: z &amp;rarr; 0
;Poles: z &amp;rarr; -1/2}}

== Stability ==

It can be shown that for any causal system with a transfer function H(z), all the poles of H(z) must lie within the unit-circle on the z-plane for the system to be stable. Zeros of the transfer function may lie inside or outside the circle.

== Gain ==

Gain is the factor by which the output magnitude is different from the input magnitude. If the input magnitude is the same as the output magnitude at a given frequency, the filter is said to have &quot;unity gain&quot;.

== Properties ==

Here is a listing of the most common properties of the Z transform.

You've finally made that perfect object, armature or material:  a gamepiece, a robot, a fully rigged vampire character, or a millimeter-accurate model of the Empire State Building.  Besides using this work in your own artistic project, you have made the courageous decision to share that creation with the world.

Sharing your creative work is a great way to &quot;give back to the community,&quot; even if you don't write Blender code and you can't translate the Blender documentation to Swahili.

== How to Make a Library ==

So how do you make a library?  In Blender, you don't need to export to a special format.  In fact, you don't need to do anything special beyond saving your regular .blend file.  Every .blend is a library file.  Users can Append what they like from your .blend file, and ignore parts which they don't need for their own project.

This scheme has some benefits and some drawbacks.

The benefit of using .blend files as a library format is that it's super easy to include extra stuff to help the user see the objects.  If the user loads the .blend file directly, it works like the pretty packaging for foods, including a quick and easy way to get a pretty &quot;serving suggestion&quot; rendering of the library contents.  What you save in your .blend is what the user will see when they load it, including all your user interface settings, lighting types, and camera positions.

The drawback of using .blend files as a library format is that it's super easy to include ''unintended'' things, such as extra meshes, unused material and texture channels, and other things which the user will not find helpful.  Blender doesn't save things which are no longer referenced anywhere, but it cannot read your mind if you leave a spare mesh on layer 13 which uses some abandoned Material.034.

Also, some people are not accustomed to the way that Blender saves all of the user interface settings along with the .blend file.  When they load your mesh, they see your way of working.  This can be instructive, but unless that's your intention, it's best to try to stick to a simple and clean user interface setup for your library files.

For best results, you need to apply some discipline to publish a clean and useful library.

== Library Usefulness Checklist ==

After having used several library .blend files from various sources, I propose that anyone making libraries follow a few suggestions:

* keep to a certain object, theme or area of focus for each library file
* all the test cameras and lights prefixed with a dash; e.g., '''-Camera''', '''-HemiLight.001''', etc.
* any other components not intended for Appending prefixed with a dash; e.g., '''-ground'''
* all the test cameras and lights on the last one or two layers ('''lower right layer button''')
* any composite object intended for Appending organized in a '''group''' to hold it together
* any groups, objects, materials, textures intended for Appending given '''meaningful names'''
* document your unit scheme; e.g., '''1 blender unit == 1 imperial foot''', etc.
* any other layer contains test-render-ready objects or scenes
* choose rendering and world '''settings which will not take an hour''' to make a simple test render
* make visible upon loading the layers required for a camera, a good lighting angle, and a shared object 
* make visible upon loading one small text file which lists layers and objects
* make visible upon loading any python script, '''with instructions on how to start it''' in a big comment
* make your licensing expectations clear:  '''artistic license''', '''creative commons''', etc.
* pack the texture files and other data before saving that final .blend for publishing
* sign your work, stable email address or website url if possible

The dash prefixes for test-rendering cameras, boxes, floors and lights will help the user know at a glance what to Append and what not to Append from your library.

Here's a quick way to throw out all the stuff you really don't need, including extra meshes, materials and user interface complexity.

* save your current .blend (and make a nice backup file too)
* shut down Blender entirely
* open up Blender again, which will load the default settings
* delete the cube and cameras from the default settings
* Append all the useful parts of your library .blend file (including the ''useful'' test-rendering items)
* select the proper test-rendering camera for users to try out your model quickly (select, then Ctrl+KEYPAD0)
* adjust the views to ensure important things are visible and ready to render
* save the new library .blend, ready to publish

Blender saves the default settings in a file called '''.b.blend''' on your disk.  If your own preferred default settings are still too complicated for newcomers to understand, you can move that file away temporarily to get the &quot;factory&quot; built-in default settings which the Blender team produces as a part of each new version of the software.  Move the file back again when you want to go back to your individual way of working.

== Publishing Your Library ==

It's helpful to include the .txt file and/or post it separately so that people can read a summary before loading the blend file.  This should include any credits, usage notes, layer explanations, and licensing information.  For you Unix folks, remember to run it through '''unix2dos''' to enforce \r\n CRLF newlines, readable by people with less flexible tools such as Windows Notepad.

It's also of immense benefit to put up small test-renders of your library objects or materials.  They don't need to be large but they should give an honest view of the work you're sharing before a potential user takes the time to download library files that will not be useful to them.

So, where do you publish your work of artistic genius?

* http://www.e2-productions.com/bmr Blender 3D Model Repository
* http://blenderartists.org/ forums
* http://www.deviantart.com/
* http://www.blendswap.com
* your own website

If you post things on your own website, try not to rely on a free site that will over-run your bandwidth limits and disappear two months later.  Search engine links will sometimes live on for years, just frustrating those who were hoping to find a millimeter-accurate model of the Empire State Building.

== Beyond Libraries ==

If you have even more time to spare, consider writing up a tutorial on how you achieved any tricky results!

== Thank You ==

For every artist who chooses to share their creative works with the community, there are a dozen artists, or even hundreds, who thank you immensely.

&lt;!-- {{mergefrom|Modern Physics/Acceleration, Force and Mass}} - done --&gt;
==Introduction==

The way that the velocity of a particle can differ between observers who are moving relative to each other means that momentum needs to be redefined as a result of relativity theory.

The illustration below shows a typical collision of two particles. In the right hand frame the collision is observed from the viewpoint of someone moving at the same velocity as one of the particles, in the left hand frame it is observed by someone moving at a velocity that is intermediate between those of the particles.

[[Image:relcollision.gif]]

If momentum is redefined then all the variables such as force (rate of change of momentum), energy etc. will become redefined and relativity will lead to an entirely new physics. The new physics has an effect at the ordinary level of experience through the relation &lt;math&gt;K = \gamma m c^2 - m c^2\,&lt;/math&gt; whereby it is the tiny deviations in gamma from unity that are expressed as everyday kinetic energy so that the whole of physics is related to &quot;relativistic&quot; reasoning rather than Newton's empirical ideas.

==Momentum==

In physics momentum is conserved within a closed system, the '''law of conservation of momentum''' applies.  Consider the special case of identical particles colliding symmetrically as illustrated below:

[[Image:relcollision2.gif]]

The momentum change by the red ball is:

&lt;math&gt;2m\mathbf{u_{yR}}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum change by the blue ball is:

&lt;math&gt;-2m\mathbf{u_{yB}}&lt;/math&gt;

The situation is symmetrical so the '''Newtonian''' conservation of momentum law is demonstrated:

&lt;math&gt;2m\mathbf{u_{yR}}=2m\mathbf{u_{yB}}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that this result depends upon the y components of the velocities being equal, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u_{yR}}=\mathbf{u_{yB}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The relativistic case is rather different. The collision is illustrated below, the left hand frame shows the collision as it appears for one observer and the right hand frame shows '''exactly the same collision''' as it appears for another observer moving at the same velocity as the blue ball:

[[Image:relcollision3.gif]]

The configuration shown above has been simplified because one frame contains a stationary blue ball (ie: &lt;math&gt;u_{xB}=0&lt;/math&gt;) and the velocities are chosen so that the vertical velocity of the red ball is exactly reversed after the collision ie:&lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt;. Both frames show exactly the same event, it is only the observers who differ between frames. The relativistic velocity transformations between frames is:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = \frac{u_{yR} \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB}^' =\frac{u_{yB} \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}{1 - u_{xB}v/c^2}= u_{yB} \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; given that &lt;math&gt;u_{xB}=0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that the y components are equal in one frame, in Newtonian physics they will also be equal in the other frame. However, in relativity, if the y components are equal in one frame they are '''not''' necessarily equal in the other frame (time dilation is not directional so perpendicular velocities differ between the observers). For instance if &lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt; then:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB} = \frac{u_{yR}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt; then in this case &lt;math&gt;u_{yR} \ne u_{yB}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the mass were constant between collisions and between frames then although &lt;math&gt;2 mu_{yR}^' = 2mu_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt; it is found that:

&lt;math&gt;2 mu_{yR} \ne 2mu_{yB}&lt;/math&gt;

So momentum defined as mass times velocity is not conserved in a collision when the collision is described in frames moving relative to each other. Notice that the discrepancy is very small if &lt;math&gt;u_{xR}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are small. 

To preserve the principle of momentum conservation in all inertial reference frames, the definition of momentum has to be changed. The new definition must reduce to the Newtonian expression when objects move at speeds much smaller than the speed of light, so as to recover the Newtonian formulas. 

The velocities in the y direction are related by the following equation when the observer is travelling at the same velocity as the blue ball ie: when &lt;math&gt; u_{xB} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB} = \frac{u_{yR}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

If we write &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; for the mass of the blue ball) and &lt;math&gt;m_R&lt;/math&gt; for the mass of the red ball as observed from the frame of the blue ball then, if the principle of relativity applies:

&lt;math&gt;2 m_R u_{yR} = 2 m_B u_{yB} \,&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;m_R = m_B \frac{u_{yB}}{u_{yR}}&lt;/math&gt;

But:

&lt;math&gt;u_{yB} = \frac{u_{yR}}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;m_R = \frac{m_B}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that, if the principle of relativity is to apply then the mass must change by the amount shown in the equation above for the conservation of momentum law to be true.

The particle velocities were chosen so that &lt;math&gt;u_{yR}^' = u_{yB}^'&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; was selected so that &lt;math&gt; v = u_{xR}^'&lt;/math&gt;.  This allows &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to be expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;u_{xR}\,&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;u_{xR}^' = \frac{u_{xR} - v}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2} = v&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{c^2}{u_{xR}}(1 - \sqrt{1-u_{xR}^2/c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

So substituting for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;m_R = \frac{m_B}{1 - u_{xR}v/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;m_R = \frac{m_B}{\sqrt{1 - u_{xR}^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The blue ball is at rest so its mass is sometimes known as its '''rest mass''', and is given the symbol &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  As the balls were identical at the start of the boost the mass of the red ball is the mass that a blue ball would have if it were in motion relative to an observer; this mass is sometimes known as the '''relativistic mass''' symbolised by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. These terms are now infrequently used in modern physics, as will be explained at the end of this section.
The discussion given above was related to the relative motions of the blue and red balls, as a result &lt;math&gt;u_{xR}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the '''speed''' of the moving ball relative to an observer who is stationary with respect to the blue ball.  These considerations mean that the relativistic mass is given by:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The relativistic momentum is given by the product of the relativistic mass and the velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=M\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;.

The overall expression for momentum in terms of rest mass is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{m\mathbf{u}}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the components of the momentum are:

&lt;math&gt;p_x = \frac{mu_x}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_y = \frac{mu_y}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_z = \frac{mu_z}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

So the components of the momentum depend upon the appropriate velocity component and the speed.

Since the factor with the square root is cumbersome to write, the following abbreviation is often used, called the Lorentz gamma factor:

&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for the momentum then reads &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m \gamma \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;.

It can be seen from the discussion above that we can write the momentum of an object moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt; as the product of a function &lt;math&gt; M(u) &lt;/math&gt; of the speed &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and the velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;: 

&lt;math&gt; M(u) \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt; M(u) &lt;/math&gt; must reduce to the object's mass &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; at small speeds, in particular when the object is at rest &lt;math&gt; M(0) = m &lt;/math&gt;. 

There is a debate about the usage of the term &quot;mass&quot; in relativity theory.  If inertial mass is defined in terms of momentum then it does indeed vary as &lt;math&gt;M = \gamma m&lt;/math&gt; for a single particle that has rest mass, furthermore, as will be shown below the energy of a particle that has a rest mass is given by &lt;math&gt;E=Mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Prior to the debate about nomenclature the function &lt;math&gt; M(u) &lt;/math&gt;, or the relation &lt;math&gt;M = \gamma m&lt;/math&gt;, used to be called 'relativistic mass', and its value in the frame of the particle was referred to as the 'rest mass' or 'invariant mass'. The relativistic mass, &lt;math&gt;M = \gamma m&lt;/math&gt;, would increase with velocity. Both terms are now largely obsolete: the 'rest mass' is today simply called the mass, and the 'relativistic mass' is often no longer used since, as will be seen in the discussion of energy below, it is identical to the energy but for the units.

==Force==

Newton's second law states that the total force acting on a particle equals the rate of change of its momentum. The same form of Newton's second law holds in relativistic mechanics. The relativistic ''3 force'' is given by:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} = d\mathbf{p}/dt&lt;/math&gt;

If the relativistic mass is used:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}= \frac{d(m\mathbf{u})}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

By Leibniz's law where &lt;math&gt;d(xy)=xdy+ydx&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}= m\frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt}+\mathbf{u}\frac{dm}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation for force will be used below to derive relativistic expressions for the energy of a particle in terms of the old concept of &quot;relativistic mass&quot;.

The relativistic force can also be written in terms of acceleration. Newton's second law can be written in the familiar form

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = d\mathbf{v}/dt &lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration.

here m is '''not''' the relativistic mass but is the invariant mass.

In relativistic mechanics, momentum is &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m \gamma \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;

again m being the invariant mass and the force is given by &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d(\gamma \mathbf{v})}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

This form of force is used in the derivation of the expression for energy without relying on relativistic mass.

It will be seen in the second section of this book that Newton's second law in terms of acceleration is given by: 

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m \gamma( \mathbf{a} + \frac{\gamma^2 v}{c^2} \frac{dv}{dt} \mathbf{v}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Energy==

The debate over the use of the concept &quot;relativistic mass&quot; means that modern physics courses may forbid the use of this in the derivation of energy.  The newer derivation of energy without using relativistic mass is given in the first section and the older derivation using relativistic mass is given in the second section.  The two derivations can be compared to gain insight into the debate about mass but a knowledge of 4 vectors is really required to discuss the problem in depth. In principle the first derivation is most mathematically correct because &quot;relativistic mass&quot; is given by: &lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt; which involves the constants &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.


===Derivation of relativistic energy using the relativistic momentum===

In the following, modern derivation, m means the invariant mass - what used to be called the &quot;rest mass&quot;. Energy is defined as the work done in moving a body from one place to another. We will make use of the relativistic momentum &lt;math&gt; p=\gamma mv &lt;/math&gt;. Energy is given from:

&lt;math&gt; dE = \mathbf{f}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

so, over the whole path:

&lt;math&gt; E = \int_{0}^{x} \mathbf{f}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Kinetic energy (K) is the energy used to move a body from a velocity of 0 to a velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;. Restricting the motion to one dimension:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} \mathbf{f} dx&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relativistic ''3 force'':

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} \frac{d(m\gamma u)}{dt}dx=\int_{u=0}^{u=u}m \frac{d(\gamma u)}{dt}dx= \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m d(\gamma u)\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

substituting for &lt;math&gt;d(\gamma u)&lt;/math&gt; and using &lt;math&gt;dx/dt=u&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m (\gamma du + ud\gamma) u&lt;/math&gt;

Which gives:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m (u\gamma du + u^2 d\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

The Lorentz factor &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt; 

meaning that :

&lt;math&gt;d\gamma = \frac{u}{c^2}\gamma^3du&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;du = \frac{c^2}{u\gamma^3}d\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

So that

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} m (u\gamma \frac{c^2}{u\gamma^3}d\gamma + u^2 d\gamma)
= \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} m (\frac{c^2}{\gamma^2} + u^2) d\gamma
= \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} m c^2 d\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we can use the fact that:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma^2c^2 - \gamma^2u^2 = c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating:

&lt;math&gt;2\gamma c^2d\gamma - \gamma^22udu -u^22\gamma d\gamma =0\,&lt;/math&gt;

So, rearranging:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma u du + u^2 d\gamma = c^2 d\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;

In which case:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m (u\gamma du + u^2 d\gamma) = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} m c^2 d\gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; goes from 0 to &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;, the Lorentz factor &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; goes from 1 to &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;, so:

&lt;math&gt;K = m c^2 \int_{\gamma=1}^{\gamma=\gamma} d\gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;K = \gamma m c^2 - m c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

The amount &lt;math&gt;\gamma mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''total energy''' of the particle.  The amount &lt;math&gt;m c^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''rest energy''' of the particle. If the total energy of the particle is given the symbol &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; E = \gamma m c^2  = mc^2 + K \,&lt;/math&gt;

So it can be seen that &lt;math&gt;m c^2&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a mass that is stationary.  This energy is known as '''mass energy'''.

The Newtonian approximation for kinetic energy can be derived by using the binomial theorem to expand &lt;math&gt;\gamma = (1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The binomial expansion is:

&lt;math&gt;(a + x)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}x + \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}a^{n-2}x^2 ....&lt;/math&gt;

So expanding &lt;math&gt;(1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} m u^2 + \frac{3m u^4}{8c^2} + \frac{5m u^6}{16c^4} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is much less than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} m u^2 &lt;/math&gt;

which is the Newtonian approximation for low velocities.

===Derivation of relativistic energy using the concept of relativistic mass===

Energy is defined as the work done in moving a body from one place to another. Energy is given from:

&lt;math&gt; dE = \mathbf{F}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

so, over the whole path:

&lt;math&gt; E = \int_{0}^{x} \mathbf{F}d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Kinetic energy (K) is the energy used to move a body from a velocity of 0 to a velocity &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. So:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} F dx&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relativistic force:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} \frac{d(Mu)}{dt}dx&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} d(Mu)\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

substituting for &lt;math&gt;d(Mu)&lt;/math&gt; and using &lt;math&gt;dx/dt=u&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} (Mdu + udM) u&lt;/math&gt;

Which gives:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} (Mu du + u^2 dM)&lt;/math&gt;

The relativistic mass is given by:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which can be expanded as:

&lt;math&gt;M^2c^2 - M^2u^2 = m^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating:

&lt;math&gt;2Mc^2dM - M^22udu -u^22MdM =0&lt;/math&gt;

So, rearranging:

&lt;math&gt;Mu du + u^2 dM = c^2 dM&lt;/math&gt;

In which case:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} (Mu du + u^2 dM)&lt;/math&gt;

is simplified to:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int_{u=0}^{u=u} c^2 dM&lt;/math&gt;

But the mass goes from &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; so:

&lt;math&gt;K = c^2 \int_{M=m}^{M=M} dM)&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;K = Mc^2 - mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

The amount &lt;math&gt;Mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''total energy''' of the particle.  The amount &lt;math&gt;mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''rest energy''' of the particle. If the total energy of the particle is given the symbol &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2 + K&lt;/math&gt;

So it can be seen that &lt;math&gt;mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a mass that is stationary.  This energy is known as '''mass energy''' and is the origin of the famous formula &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt; that is iconic of the nuclear age.

The Newtonian approximation for kinetic energy can be derived by substituting the rest mass for the relativistic mass ie:

&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt;K = Mc^2 - mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}} - mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

ie:

&lt;math&gt;K = mc^2 ((1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}} -1)&lt;/math&gt;


The binomial theorem can be used to expand &lt;math&gt;(1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

The binomial theorem is:

&lt;math&gt;(a + x)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}x + \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}a^{n-2}x^2 ....&lt;/math&gt;

So expanding &lt;math&gt;(1-u^2/c^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} mu^2 + \frac{3mu^4}{8c^2} + \frac{5mu^6}{16c^4} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is much less than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2} mu^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the Newtonian approximation for low velocities.

==Nuclear Energy==

When protons and neutrons (nucleons) combine to form elements the combination of particles tends to be in a lower energy state than the free neutrons and protons.  Iron has the lowest energy and elements above and below iron in the scale of atomic masses tend to have higher energies.  This decrease in energy as neutrons and protons bind together is known as the '''binding energy'''.  The atomic masses of elements are slightly different from that calculated from their constituent particles and this difference in mass energy, calculated from &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;, is almost exactly equal to the binding energy.

The binding energy can be released by converting elements with higher masses per nucleon to those with lower masses per nucleon. This can be done by either splitting heavy elements such as uranium into lighter elements such as barium and krypton or by joining together light elements such as hydrogen into heavier elements such as deuterium.  If atoms are split the process is known as '''nuclear fission''' and if atoms are joined the process is known as '''nuclear fusion'''.  Atoms that are lighter than iron can be fused to release energy and those heavier than iron can be split to release energy.

When hydrogen and a neutron are combined to make deuterium the energy released can be calculated as follows:

The mass of a proton is 1.00731 amu, the mass of a neutron is 1.00867 amu and the mass of a deuterium nucleus is 2.0136 amu. The difference in mass between a deuterium nucleus and its components is 0.00238 amu. The energy of this mass difference is:

&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2 = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \times 0.00238 \times (3 \times 10^8)^2&lt;/math&gt;

So the energy released is &lt;math&gt;3.57 \times 10^{-13}&lt;/math&gt; joules or about &lt;math&gt;2 \times 10^{11}&lt;/math&gt; joules per gram of protons (ionised hydrogen).

(Assuming 1 amu = &lt;math&gt;1.66 \times 10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt; Kg, Avogadro's number = &lt;math&gt;6 \times 10^{23}&lt;/math&gt; and the speed of light is &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^8&lt;/math&gt; metres per second)

Present day nuclear reactors use a process called '''nuclear fission''' in which rods of uranium emit neutrons which combine with the uranium in the rod to produce uranium isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U which rapidly decay into smaller nuclei such as Barium and Krypton plus three neutrons which can cause further generation of &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U and further decay. The fact that each neutron can cause the generation of three more neutrons means that a self sustaining or '''chain reaction''' can occur. The generation of energy results from the equivalence of mass and energy; the decay products, barium and krypton have a lower mass than the original &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U, the missing mass being released as 177 MeV of radiation. The nuclear equation for the decay of &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U is written as follows:

&lt;math&gt;^{236}_{92}U \rightarrow ^{144}_{56}Ba + ^{89}_{36}Kr + 3n + 177 MeV &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg|left|thumb|Nuclear explosion]]If a large amount of the uranium isotope &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (the '''critical mass''') is confined the chain reaction can get out of control and almost instantly release a large amount of energy.  A device that confines a critical mass of uranium is known as an '''atomic bomb''' or '''A-bomb'''.  A bomb based on the fusion of deuterium atoms is known as a '''thermonuclear bomb''', '''hydrogen bomb''' or '''H-bomb'''.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Nominative case''' is the most commonly used [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|grammatical case]] in Russian. It is the default case for words, and so it is the case that words are written in the dictionaries.

== What is a case? ==
The nature of cases in Russian is detailed more thoroughly on [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|its dedicated page]]. A case tells you what a noun, pronoun, or adjective is doing in a sentence, and is denoted by a set of rules that change the end of the word. For instance, if a person or thing is the object of a sentence (the 'object' is the thing which is being verbed), then you place it in the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative_case|accusative case]]; an example of a rule for this case states that words which usually end in '''а''', such as '''книга''' ('book'), change the '''a''' to '''у''' (so '''книга''' becomes '''книгу'''). English relies on the ''order'' of words to convey this kind of meaning, but Russian does this with grammatical cases, so they use word order for different purposes.

So, cases have rules that change a word and tell you what it's doing in a sentence. A word in the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|accusative case]] is the thing being verbed ('the dog chased ''the cat''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;), the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive case]] describes something being counted ('he has five ''apples''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) or something owned ('the house ''of Sasha''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Sasha's'' house'), and so on.

The nominative case is special, as there are few rules to learn. When you look up a word in the dictionary, it will be in its nominative form. Thus, you don't need any rules to change a word into the nominative case: it's already in it by default. The only rules that are used in the nominative case are those to turn a word into its plural form (each case has its own rules for converting a word into the singular of that case, and into that case's plural form).

== Usage ==
The Nominative case is used when no other case is being used. Its use is to denote a word as being the ''subject'' of a verb - that is, the thing that's doing the verb. For instance, in the sentence, &quot;Peter is driving a car&quot;, 'Peter' is the ''subject'' of the verb 'to drive'. In Russian, then, the word 'Peter' would be placed in the nominative case. If you don't know what case to put a word in, use the nominative, and you'll probably be right.

One of the first things to learn in Russian is the idea of [[Russian/Grammar/Gender|gender]]; this article will give a brief overview, but see the dedicated page for a more thorough treatment. Unlike French, where gender is arbitrary, you can work out a word's gender by it's ending:
* Most words are &lt;small&gt;''MASCULINE''&lt;/small&gt;, and they end in a consonant in the nominative case: '''б, в, г, д, ж, з, й к, л, м, н, п, р, с, т, ф, х, ч, ц, ш''', or '''щ'''. It is easiest to remember that a word that doesn't have a feminine or neuter ending, is probably masculine, though you will soon learn to predict gender intuitively. Words which are masculine in meaning but feminine in grammar (such as 'uncle', '''дядя'''), are classed as masculine (for adjectives, pronouns, etc), but conjugate as a feminine noun ('''дядя &gt;&gt; дядю''', for instance). The soft sign, '''ь''', can be on either masculine or feminine nouns. Examples are '''стол''' ('chair'), '''музей''' ('museum'), and '''медведь'''' ('bear').
* Most other words are &lt;small&gt;''FEMININE''&lt;/small&gt;, and they end in '''а''' or '''я''', or occasionally '''ь'''. Examples are '''корова''' ('cow'), '''змея''' ('snake'), and '''дочь''' ('daughter').
* Then there are &lt;small&gt;''NEUTER''&lt;/small&gt; words, which end in either '''o''' or '''e'''. Examples are '''письмо''' ('letter'), '''море''' ('sea'), and '''платье''' ('dress').

You may have noticed that not all the letters in the Russian alphabet have been used here, such as '''ё''', '''у''', '''и''', etc. This is because they don't occur on the ends of default, nominative, singular nouns, and instead are really only used as noun endings after conjugation ('''ы''', for instance, is the common ''plural'' ending for nouns). Rarely, unusual or foreign words may end in these non-standard letters, such as '''такси''' ('taxi') - these have irregular genders, and are indeclinable (that is, they don't change according to case or number).

Finally, apart from denoting verbal subjects and helping us tell a word's gender, the nominative has one other, small use: it is used after some prepositions. Like other cases, there are prepositions that call the nominative case, though these are extremely rare nowadays, and are mostly used in sayings and idioms. They are:
* '''За''' + ''nom'', 'of', 'what kind of' - this preposition is used in sentences like, &quot;What kind of X is Y?&quot;, and are constructed in Russian using the word '''что''': &quot;Что Y за X&quot;, with both X and Y being in the nominative. For example: What kind of woman is she? '''Что она за женщина?'''. What kind of worker is Ivan? '''Что Иван за работник?'''.
* '''В''' + ''nom'', 'became' - this is used only with plural nouns to denote joining a group: &quot;I became a worker&quot;, '''Я в рабочие'''.

==Nouns==
As stated above, the nominative case is the default, dictionary, singular form of a noun, and is used to denote the subject of a verb. As such, there are no rules for working out how to conjugate a singular word into this case, as it's already in it by default. When learning about other cases, the rules will explain how to go from this nominative case, to the case in question. Examples of nouns in the nominative are:
:The husband is talking - '''Муж говорит'''
:The train is old - '''Поезд старый'''
:The student is new - '''Студент новый'''

=== Plural Nouns ===
If you want to refer to a group of objects in the nominative, you use the plural, just like in English. Though there are no rules needed to form the nominative singular (just look the word up in the dictionary), there ''are'' rules for forming the plural. These are very simple to learn:
: Masculine nouns add '''-ы''' to the end of the word, just like how we add 's' in English. For example, '''стол''' ('table') &gt;&gt; '''столы''' ('tables').
: Feminine nouns that end in '''-а''' replace the vowel with '''-ы''', while nouns that end in '''-я''' or '''-ь''' have '''-и'''. For example, '''машина''' ('car') &gt;&gt; '''машины''' ('cars'); '''свинья''' ('pig') &gt;&gt; '''свиньи''' ('pigs'); '''ночь''' ('night') &gt;&gt; '''ночи''' ('nights').
: Neuter nouns that end in '''-о''' have '''-а''' in the nominative plural, while '''-е''' becomes '''-я''': '''письмо''' ('letter') &gt;&gt; '''письма''' ('letters'); '''море''' ('sea') &gt;&gt; '''моря''' ('seas').
These are the basic rulers for making words plural. In other cases, there are different rules which must be learned. As with many things in Russian, there are exceptions. There are several words in Russian with exceptional nominative plurals:
:'''Сын '''&gt;&gt;''' Сыновья''' ('son', 'sons')
:'''Брат '''&gt;&gt;''' Братья''' ('brother', brothers')
:'''Друг '''&gt;&gt;''' Друзья''' ('friend', 'friends')
Perhaps the most common exceptions are those that fall under the Seven-Letter Rule.

===The 7-letter spelling rule===
There is a spelling rule called the '7-letter spelling rule', so called because it comes into effect after seven letters: '''к, г, х, ш, щ, ж''', and '''ч'''. When you remove the default ending from a word, you are left with the stem. If the stem ends in one of those seven letters, then you generally have to add an alternate ending. For example, '''книга''', 'book', has the stem '''книг-''', so it obeys the 7-letter rule. What to do when this spelling rule appears will be covered in each instance individually. However, the rule generally just requires the use of an 'alternate' noun ending.

For the nominative plural, if a masculine or feminine word ends in the 7-letter rule, you always use the ending '''-и''', not '''-ы'''. So, although '''книга''', 'book', ends in '''-а''', its nominative plural is '''книги''', as its stem ends in '''г'''.
:These rabbits - '''Эти кролики'''
:The mice are nice - '''Мыши симпатичные'''
:These are my friends - '''Эти мои друзья''' - ''Note the exceptional ending '''-я'''''

What follows is a summary table for the endings found on singular and plural nouns in the nominative case. Where there are multiple endings, refer to the rules above:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Nominative !! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter
|-
| Singular || ''const.'', '''ь''' || '''а/я/ь''' || '''о/е'''
|-
| Plural || '''ы/и''' || '''ы/и''' || '''а/я'''
|}

In the future, the plural case will be treated as a sort of 'fourth gender', and will be give its own column. Here, however, it has a separate row.

As with all things in Russian, there are some irregular, unpredictable exceptions to the above rules:
: Some masculine nouns drop the last vowel before adding '''ы''' or '''и''', such as '''подарок''' ('gift') &gt;&gt; '''подарки'''. Theses are known as 'fleeting vowels', and are generally found in dictionaries in parentheses: '''подар(о)к'''.
: Some masculine nouns add '''a''' to form the nominative plural, such as '''дом''' ('house') &gt;&gt; '''дома''' ('houses').
: As mentioned above, words of foreign origin ending in '''o''', '''и''', or '''у''', don't change between singular and plural. So, '''радио''' means 'radio' or 'radios', and '''такси''' is both 'taxi' and 'taxis'.

==Adjectives==
Like nouns, adjectives change according to case, number, and gender. An adjective has no inherent gender, so it changes its ending to suit the gender (and case and number) of the noun it's modifying. An adjective modifying a singular, feminine noun in the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental case]], is itself in the singular, feminine, instrumental case. 

However, when you look up an adjective in the dictionary, what do you see? You see the default, nominative, masculine, singular form. For a more thorough treatment of adjectives, see their [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives|dedicated page]]. For our purposes, we only need to know two things: all adjectives end in either '''-ый''', '''-ий''', or '''-ой''', and conjugating adjectives is as simple as removing these endings and adding the new ones. The ending you add is the one that corresponds to the noun.

Adjectives modifying masculine nouns in the nominative case keep their default endings: 'new pencil' is '''новый карандаш'''.
For feminine nouns, the adjective takes on the ending '''-ая''': 'new book' is '''новая книга'''.
For neuter nouns, the ending is '''-ое''': 'new letter' is '''новое письмо'''.

Adjectives also change according to number, so when modifying a plural noun, regardless of gender, they have the ending '''-ые''': 'new books' is '''новые книги'''. However, like nouns, they obey the 7-letter spelling rule.

=== The 7-letter spelling rule ===
As mentioned earlier, if the stem of a noun ends in '''к''', '''г''', '''х''', '''ш''', '''щ''', '''ж''', and '''ч''', then different endings from usual apply. The same is true for adjectives. Adjectives such as '''хороший''' ('good'), '''русский''' ('Russian'), and '''другой''' ('different'), take on alternate endings to other adjectives. In the nominative case, this only affects plural adjectives: instead of '''-ые''', these adjectives have the ending '''-ие'''.
:New books - '''Новые книги'''
:Old books - '''Старые книги'''
:Good books - '''Хорошие книги'''
:Different books - '''Разные книги'''
In general, after these seven consonants, whenever you would normally see '''ы''' in an adjectival ending, you instead find '''и'''. This also applies to standard adjectival endings: after these seven letters, you always have the default ending '''ий'''. This can be useful in predicting or remembering the default endings of adjectives.
Unlike nouns, adjectives are affected by a second spelling rule.

=== The 5-letter spelling rule ===
On top of the previous spelling rule, there's a second important rule: after the letters '''ш, щ, ж, ч''', and '''ц''', the first unstressed '''о''' in an ending becomes '''е'''. For nominative adjectives, this only affects neuter singular endings: we have '''-ее''' as the ending, not '''-ое'''.
:Bad wine - '''Плохое вино'''
:Good wine - '''Хорошее вино'''
:Old letter - '''Старое письмо'''
:Fresh letter - '''Свежее письмо'''
An easy way to remember this is that four of the five letters are the 'hushes', '''ш''', '''щ''', '''ж''', and '''ч''', and these are also four letters from the seven-letter spelling rule. Few adjectives end in '''цый''', so you don't have to worry about this so much. As such, almost all adjectives that follow this rule also follow the 7-letter rule: '''хороший''', '''хорошее письмо''', '''хорошие письма'''.

=== Soft adjectives ===
The final nuance with Russian adjectives are the adjectives that have the so-called 'soft ending': '''-ний''', such as '''синий''' ('dark blue'). These adjectives don't fall into the above two spelling rules, but still take on the exceptional endings. These are covered more thoroughly on [[Russian/Grammar/Adjectives#Soft_endings|their own page]], but in the nominative case they have only one unique ending: the feminine singular ending for these adjectives is '''-яя''', not '''-ая'''. They also take on the alternate neuter and plural endings we learned for the seven- and five-letter spelling rules: '''-ее''' for neuter nouns, and '''-ие''' for plural nouns.

So, a summary of adjectival endings in the nominative case is as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter !! Plural
|-
| ый ий ой || ая&lt;br&gt;''яя''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || ое&lt;br&gt;''ее''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || ые&lt;br&gt;''ие''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;For adjectives with the soft ending.
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For adjectives ending in the five-letter rule, and those with the soft ending.
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;For adjectives ending in the seven-letter rule, and those with the soft ending.

==Personal Pronouns==
The personal pronouns (words used to denote the speaker) are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! 1st-person
| Я ('I') || Мы ('We')
|-
! 2nd-person
| Ты ('You', informal) || Вы ('You', polite/plural)
|-
! 3rd-person
| Он/она/оно ('He', 'She', 'It') || Они ('They')
|}

They are more thoroughly discussed on their [[Russian/Personal_Pronouns|dedicated page]].

==Possessive pronouns==
The possessive pronouns are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter !! Plural
|-
! My
| Мой || Моя || Моё || Мои
|-
! Your (informal)
| Твой || Твоя || Твоё || Твои
|-
! Our
| Наш || Наша || Наше || Наши
|-
! Your (polite/plural)
| Ваш || Ваша || Ваше || Ваши
|}

'His' and 'its' are '''его''' ('ye-voh'), 'her' is '''её''' ('ye-yoh'), and 'their' is '''их''' ('eekh'), and these do not change with the gender or number of the possessed object.

==Demonstrative Pronouns==

это (&quot;ehtuh&quot;) translates to &quot;this&quot; or &quot;these.&quot;

Note that it starts with э (&quot;eh&quot;), not е (&quot;yeh&quot;) or з (z).

When это is followed by a nominative case noun, это changes to match the gender of the noun, thus becoming a demonstrative adjective:

&lt;table cols=5 border=1&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Masculine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feminine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;этот (&quot;etuht&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;эта (&quot;etuh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;это (&quot;etuh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;эти (&quot;etee&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

For example, Этот чемодан мой (&quot;This suitcase is mine.&quot;).

However, when a possessive pronoun is between это and the noun, the possessive pronoun changes but это doesn't change. For example, Это мой чемодан (&quot;This is my suitcase&quot;).

Also note that for neuter nouns, changing word order doesn't change это, and that эта and это are both pronounced &quot;etuh&quot;, since their endings are both unstressed.

==Demonstrative Adjectives==

&lt;table cols=5 border=1&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Masculine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feminine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тот (&quot;tot&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;та (&quot;ta&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;то (&quot;to&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;те (&quot;tyeh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called RBlowes. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name RBlowes~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Accusative case is the second most common grammatical case in Russian. It is mainly used to identify a word as being the ''object'' of a verb, such as the word 'him' in the sentence &quot;She likes him&quot;. In English, this is denoted by the ''objective'' case. Other uses of the accusative case are after some common prepositions, such as '''в''' + ''acc'', 'into', or '''на''' + ''acc'', 'onto'.

== Usage ==
As mentioned above, the primary use of the accusative case is to denote the object of a verb. The ''indirect'' object ('I write a letter ''to you'' ') is denoted by the [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|''dative case'']]. English has a case called the ''objective'' case, so called because it denotes the object of verbs. However, words in the English objective case are largely the same as when they're the subject of a verb (i.e., in the subjective case). Thus, English uses word order to denote what's the subject and object of a verb: though 'cats' and 'dogs' remain the same in &quot;cats hate dogs&quot; and &quot;dogs hate cats&quot;, word order denotes which is the subject and which is the object.

In Russian, there is a very definite case system which denotes what's what in a sentence. Since Russians don't have to rely as much on word order to convey grammatical information, they can move words around more freely than in English. Word order instead denotes emphasis; whatever is on the end of a sentence is what's being emphasised. That said, Russians typically use a 'Subject Object Verb' construct by default, placing emphasis on the verb. So you would often see the sentence &quot;I speak to her&quot; as '''Я ей говорю''', even though other permutations like '''Ей говорю я''' or '''Я говорю ей''' are grammatically correct.

In practice, though you can use the 'Subject Verb Object' system of English and still be understood, it pays to be aware that Russians don't always construct sentences that way. Thus, a good understanding of the Russian case system is essential.

:I like dogs - '''Я люблю собак''' - English 'SVO' word order; usual Russian word order
:''I'' like dogs - '''Собак люблю я''' - Emphasis on 'I'
:I ''like'' dogs - '''Я собак люблю''' - Emphasis on 'like'
:I like '' dogs'' - '''Я люблю собак''' - Emphasis on 'dogs'; same as English word order

The other use of the accusative case is with two major prepositions: '''в''' and '''на'''. When followed by the accusative case, '''в''' means 'to' or 'into', as in 'I walked ''into'' the house' ('''Я шёл в дом'''), and '''на''' means 'onto' or 'toward', as in 'I walked ''onto'' the street' ('''Я шёл на улицу'''). However, both prepositions can also use the [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional case]]: '''в''' + ''prep'' means 'in' or 'at', as in 'I lived in London' ('''Я жил в Лондоне'''), and '''на''' + ''prep'' means 'upon' or 'at', as in 'It's on the table' ('''Оно на столе'''). The accusative and prepositional uses are similar, though generally the accusative case denotes ''direction'' ('I walked ''towards'' the hotel'), while the prepositional case denotes ''location'' ('I stayed ''at'' this hotel').

:I walked towards the hotel - '''Я шла в гостиницу''' - note the use of the accusative ending '''-у'''
:I lived at the hotel - '''Я жила в гостинице''' - note the use of the prepositional ending '''-е'''
:He walked onto the roof - '''Он шёл на крышу'''
:He is on the roof - '''Он на крыше'''

==Nouns==
The accusative case is a peculiar case in Russian, as it makes a distinction that other cases do not. Specifically, if a masculine word denotes an inanimate thing ('table', 'chair', etc), then it remains the same as the nominative. If, however, a masculine word denotes a person or animal ('man', 'son', 'cow', etc), then the case uses the endings of the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|''genitive case'']]. For plurals in the accusative, no matter what gender the word, they are also split: any plural word that's inanimate is identical to its [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative case|nominative plural form]], while animate plural words follow the rules for the genitive plural. Some examples highlighting this distinction are as follows:
:This chair is brown - '''Этот ''стул'' коричневый''' - Nominative of an inanimate noun
:I made a chair - '''Я де́лал ''стул''''' - Accusative of the noun
:This cat likes me - '''''Этот кот'' любит меня''' - Nom. of an animate noun
:I like this cat - '''Я люблю ''этого кота''''' - Acc. of the noun
:These women like me - '''''Эти женщины'' любят меня''' - Nom. of an animate, plural, feminine noun
:I like these women - '''Я люблю ''этих женщин''''' - Acc. of the noun

So, masculine nouns denoting inanimate objects in the accusative case are the same as in the nominative case. If they're animated nouns, they follow the genitive rules, which are: add '''-а''', and replace '''-й''' and '''-ь''' with '''-я'''.

Neuter nouns, regardless of animation, also keep their nominative forms in the accusative case.

Feminine words are the only words to have their own accusative ending: '''-а''' becomes '''-у''', and '''-я''' becomes '''-ю'''. Feminine nouns ending in the soft sign '''-ь''' do not change.

To form the plural of an inanimate word, use the nominative rules: add or replace with '''-ы''' or '''-и''', and neuter nouns change '''-o''' to '''-а''' and '''-e''' to '''-я'''. If the word is animate, regardless of gender, use the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case#Nouns|genitive plural]]: drop '''-а''' and '''-о''', convert or append ending consonants with '''-ов''', '''-ев''', or '''-ей''', and replace '''-я''' with '''-ь''' or '''-й'''.

This summary table splits the masculine and plural forms into to sections, the left being the inanimate form, the right being the animate form.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Masculine
! Feminine !! Neuter
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Plural
|-
| Accusative || valign=&quot;bottom&quot;|''As nom.'' || '''+a''', '''-я'''&lt;br&gt;''As gen.'' || valign=&quot;top&quot;|'''у''', '''ю''', '''ь''' || '''о, е'''&lt;br&gt;''As nom.'' || '''ы, и, etc'''&lt;br&gt;''As nom.'' || '''ов, ев''', etc&lt;br&gt;''As gen.''
|}

Examples:
*Dogs don't like cats - '''Собаки ненавидят котов'''
*Cats don't like dogs - '''Коты ненавидят собак'''
*I drove to the museum - '''Я поехал в музей'''

==Adjectives==
Adjectives change to fit the noun they modify, taking on their noun's gender, number, and case. This also includes animation: adjectives modifying inanimate masculine nouns keep their [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative case#Adjectives|nominative form]] ('''ый''', '''ий''', and '''ой'''), while animate masculine adjectives take on their [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case#Adjectives|genitive form]] ('''ого''' and '''его''').

Neuter adjectives also keep their nominative form ('''ое''').

Feminine adjectives in the accusative case have the ending '''-ую''' - this is easy to remember, as it's the two endings of feminine nouns in the accusative.

Plural adjectives take on their nominative form ('''ые''' and '''ие''') when modifying inanimate nouns, and their genitive form ('''ых''' and '''их''') when modifying animate nouns, as you might have guessed.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Masculine
! Feminine !! Neuter
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Plural
|-
| Accusative || '''ый, ий, ой'''&lt;br&gt;''As nom.'' || '''ого, его'''&lt;br&gt;''As gen.'' || valign=&quot;top&quot;|'''ую''' || '''ое'''&lt;br&gt;''As nom.'' || '''ые, ие'''&lt;br&gt;''As nom.'' || '''ых, их'''&lt;br&gt;''As gen.''
|}

Examples:
* 1
* 2
* 3

== Personal Pronouns ==
Personal pronouns conjugate as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Nominative !! Accusative
|-
| I/me || Я || Меня
|-
| We/our || Мы || Нас
|-
| You || Ты || Тебя
|-
| You || Вы || Вас
|-
| He/him || Он || Его
|-
| She/her || Она || Её
|-
| It || Оно || Его
|-
| They/them || Они || Их
|}

Notice that the third-person singular masculine and neuter pronouns are the same word, '''его''', and, like the genitive adjectival endings '''-ого''' and '''-его''', are pronounced ''ye-&lt;small&gt;VOH&lt;/small&gt;''. The third-person personal pronouns, '''его, её''', and '''их''', are the same as those in the genitive. Finally, if it's a preposition (i.e., '''в''' + ''acc'' or '''на''' + ''acc'') that calls the accusative, then the three third-person pronouns have the suffix '''н-''': '''Я еду к нему''', 'I'm walking towards him'.

Examples:
* 1
* 2
* 3

==Possessive pronouns==
Possessive pronouns act like adjectives, changing to suit the noun they modify, and thus, in the accusative case, make a distinction between animation. Like before, masculine and plural pronouns are split into inanimate forms on the left, and animate forms on the right.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! 
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Masculine
! Feminine !! Neuter
! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Plural
|-
| My || Мой || Моего|| мою || Моё || Мои || Моих
|-
| Your &lt;small&gt;''(informal/single)''&lt;/small&gt; || Твой || Твоего ||твою || Твоё || Твои || Твоих
|-
| Our || Наш || Нашего || нашу || Наше || Наши || Наших
|-
| Your &lt;small&gt;''(formal/plural)''&lt;/small&gt; || Ваш || Вашего ||вашу || Ваше || Ваши || Ваших
|}

For the third-person, the masculine and neuter possessive pronouns are the same as the personal pronouns: '''его'''. The feminine is '''её''', and the third-person plural is '''их'''. These do not decline according to the gender or number of the modified noun.

Examples:
:I want his cat - '''Я хочу его кота'''
:I want his cats - '''Я хочу его котов'''

== Prepositions ==
As well as the two major prepositions, '''в''' and '''на''', there are a total of ten prepositions that can call the accusative case: '''в, на, за, под, по, с, про, о''', '''сквозь''', and '''через'''. Мany of these can also call other cases to denote other things.

=== Direction of motion, в, на, за, &amp; под ===
Four prepositions refer to the direction of movement, and generally answer the directional question, '''Куда?''', &quot;Where (are you going)?&quot;. They can also call either the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]] or [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional]] case to answer the location question, '''Где?''', &quot;Where (are you)?&quot;. In depth, these four are:
*'''В''', 'into' - as discussed earlier, this preposition states that something is moving ''into'' something else, such as 'I walk ''into'' the building'. It can also call the prepositional case to say you ''are'' in somewhere, such as 'I'm ''in'' the theatre'.
*'''На''', 'onto' - as discussed earlier, this denotes onto which something is moving, such as 'I'm landing ''onto'' the roof'. Like '''в''', if it calls the prepositional, it states what you ''are'' upon: 'I'm ''on'' the roof'.
*'''За''', 'behind' - this denotes that you are moving to the rear of something, as in 'I'm walking ''behind'' the building'. If it calls the instrumental case, it denotes that you ''are'' behind something, as in 'I'm ''behind'' the building'.
*'''Под''', 'under' - like '''за''', this denotes that you are moving to the underside of something. By calling the instrumental case, it denotes that you ''are'' under something, as in 'I'm ''under'' the bridge'. '''Под''' also has three minor, unrelated uses for which it calls the accusative case: to denote something as being 'designated' for something else ('That bar is designated for celebrities'), to denote something fake ('artificial furniture', '''под обстановку'''), or to denote an approximate time ('around the evening', '''под вечер''')

=== The remaining six: по, с, про, о, сквозь, через ===
The remaining six prepositions operate as follows:
*'''Про''', 'about' - this preposition means 'about', in the same way as '''о''' + ''prep'' does. So, 'Let's talk about me!' can be translated as either, '''Давайте говорить обо мне!''' ('''о''' + ''prep''), or, '''Давайте говорить про меня!''' ('''про''' + ''acc'').
*'''С''', 'about' - this preposition denotes an approximate number, as in 'I stayed there about a week'. When stating specific numbers, such as &quot;I have five apples&quot;, Russians normally say, '''У меня есть пять яблок'''. To approximate the quantity, simply reverse the number and object: &quot;I have about five apples&quot; is '''У меня есть яблок пять'''. However, as Russian omit the word 'one', to say 'about one', you use '''с''' + ''acc'': &quot;I have about one apple&quot; is '''У меня есть с яблоко'''.
*'''По''', 'up to' - this means 'up to' in the context of the extent of an object's involvement, relative to some other object. For example, 'I'm up to my neck in work' is '''Я по шею в работе'''. It is also used in the same way as '''по''' + ''dat'' to denote several verbal objects: &quot;Dad gave the kids two apples each&quot; - '''Папа дал детям по два яблока'''.
*'''О''', 'against' - this means 'against' in a physical sense, such as 'They hit their ball against the tree'. '''О''' + ''prep'' means 'about', in the same way as '''про''' + ''acc''.
*'''Сквозь''', 'through' - this denotes the object through which another passes, as in 'The ball went through the window!'.
*'''Через''', 'through'/'across' - the final preposition has two main meanings. The first is synonymous with '''сквозь''' + ''acc'', meaning 'through', and the second is to move 'across' something, as in 'I walked through the woods' - '''Я шёл через лес'''. The verbal prefix '''пере-''' is synonymous with this preposition, so '''через''' can be omitted when a verb with this prefix is used. For example, both of the following are grammatically correct: 'I crossed the street' - '''Я перешёл через улицу''', '''Я перешёл улицу'''.

Most information on Russian accusative prepositions was derived from [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/prepacc.html here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''prepositional case''' is the sixth and final case in Russian, though due to its relative simplicity it is often learned before the more complex genitive, dative, and instrumental cases.

== Usage ==
Words decline into a case for two broad reasons: because they match that case's primary function (the [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|nominative]] denotes the verbal subject, the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|accusative]] denotes the verbal object, etc), or because they come after a preposition that commands that particular case ('''у''' calls the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive]], '''между''' calls the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]], etc). The prepositional case is so called because it is only ever used after prepositions. Historically, the prepositional case was called the ''locative'' case as it did have a main function, which was to denote the location of something. This use has been taken over by prepositions, so its name was changed accordingly. However, you may still hear it referred to by it's old name, and some words still bear hallmarks of the old locative case.

=== Prepositions ===

The four prepositions that call this case are '''о/об/обо''' ('about'), '''при''' ('on') '''в''' ('in'), and '''на''' ('on'). Notice that these last two are locative in meaning when they call the prepositional case.

* '''О/об/обо''' means 'about', and denotes the person or thing about which some verb is done ('they were talking about him', '''они говорили о нём''').
::When the following word begins with a vowel, '''о''' becomes '''об''' ('I heard about the bus', '''я послышал об автобусе''').
::Before awkward clusters of consonants, it becomes '''обо''' ('Boris read about me', '''Борис читал обо мне''').
* '''При''' means 'on' or 'on one's person' ('She has an umbrella on her', '''У её есть зонтик при себе'''), and 'during' ('This happened during the reign of Peter I', '''Всё это случилось при Петре первом'''). As you might guess, this preposition is quite rare
* '''В''' means 'in' or 'at', referring to the location of a person or thing ('I'm in Moscow', '''я в Москве'''). 
* '''На''' means 'on' or 'at', and like '''в''' refers to the location of something ('He's on the roof', '''Он на крыше''').

=== At a place ===
The word 'at' is translated using '''в''' + ''prep', '''на''' + ''prep', and '''у''' + ''[[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|gen]]''.

If you wished to say someone or something is at an enclosed building, such as 'He is at the theatre', use '''в''' + ''prep'', as he is ''in'' that particular place: '''Он в театре'''. To say someone or something is at a particular street, such as 'She lives at Tverskaya street', use '''на''' + ''prep'', as she is ''on'' something, rather than in it: '''Она живёт на Тверской улице'''. In general, if the place where someone or something is 'at' is an inanimate structure that humans normally go inside, use '''в''' + ''prep'' (e.g., 'They were at the theatre', 'He was at Moscow for the meeting'), otherwise use '''на''' + ''prep'' (e.g., 'They were at the field'). If the place is ''animate'', instead use '''у''' + ''[[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|gen]]'', meaning 'by someone's place' (e.g., 'They were at Sasha's')

'''В''' and '''на''' can also call the [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case#Usage|accusative case]] to refer to the direction towards which something is moving into or onto ('I'm walking ''into'' Moscow', 'He climbed ''onto'' the roof'). As a memory aid, recall that when '''в''' and '''на''' refer to the ''location'' of something, they use the prepositional case, which was once called the ''locative'' case. '''О/об/обо''' calls the accusative to mean 'against' or 'upon' something ('He leant upon the wall').

Examples:
: Let's talk about the weather - '''Дава́йте говори́ть о пого́де'''
: They'll read about [[w:Aeroflot|Aeroflot]] tomorrow - '''Они́ прочита́ют об Аэрофло́те за́втра'''
: She told a story about me - '''Она́ рассказа́ла расска́з обо́ мне'''
: Boris lives in Liverpool - '''Бо́рис живёт в Ливерпул́е'''
: Tatya is at work - '''Та́тя на рабо́те'''

== Nouns ==
Forming the prepositional case is arguably easier than any other case.

=== Singular ===
To form the prepositional case, in general, you add '''е''' (pronounced ''yeh''):
* Masculine and neuter nouns ending in a consonant add '''e''', and nouns ending in '''й''', '''o''', or '''ь''', replace that letter with '''е'''. Nouns ending in '''ий''' instead become '''ии'''.
::About the garden - '''Сад --&gt; Саде'''
::About the train - '''Поезд --&gt; Поезде'''
::About the museum - '''Музей --&gt; Музее'''
::About the letter - '''Письмо - Письме'''
* Feminine nouns ending in '''а''' or '''я''' replace that letter with '''е'''. Those ending in '''ь''' instead replace that letter with '''и'''. Feminine nouns that end in '''ия''' become '''ии'''.
::About the book - '''Книга --&gt; Книге'''
::About the bird - '''Птица --&gt; Птице'''
::About the pig - '''Свинья --&gt; Свинье'''
::About mother - '''Мать --&gt; Матери''' - ''note the addition of '''-ер-''' when '''мать''' declines''
* Neuter nouns ending in '''е''' are unchanged, unless they end in '''ие''', in which case they become '''ии'''. Those that have the exceptional ending '''мя''' become '''ени''' (though this is fortunately quite rare).

Exceptions:
* As you might have guessed from the above, always write '''ии''' instead of '''ие'''
*Some nouns have a stressed '''у''' or '''ю''' after '''в''' + ''prep'' and '''на''' + ''prep'', but not after '''о/об/обо''' + ''prep''. This is the final hallmark of the old locative meaning of this case, as it can be seen as an ending that only occurs after ''locative'' prepositions ('in' and 'on'). See [http://www.study-languages-online.com/grammar_comments/locative-case.html here] for a list of such words.

In general, add or replace with '''е''', but always have '''ии''' instead of '''ие'''.

=== Plural ===
The two plural endings, '''ах''' and '''ях''', follow the same rules as the [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|dative]] plurals: after consonants, '''o''', or '''а''', use the ending '''ах'''. If such a noun has an irregular nominative plural ending in '''я''' (e.g., '''друг''' --&gt; '''друзья'''), or if the noun ends in '''ь''', '''й''', '''е''', or '''я''', the ending is '''ях''' (e.g., '''друг''' --&gt; '''друзья''' --&gt; '''друзьях''').
::About the gardens - '''Сад --&gt; Садах
::About the trains - '''Поезд --&gt; Поездах
::About the museums - '''Музей --&gt; Музеях
::About the letters - '''Письмо - Письмах
::About the books - '''Книга --&gt; Книгах
::About the birds - '''Птица --&gt; Птицах
::About the pigs - '''Свинья --&gt; Свиньях
::About the mothers - '''Мать --&gt; Матерях'''

One exception is feminine nouns ending in '''мя''', which instead take the ending '''енах'''. Again, this ending is fortunately quite rare.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! ''Prepositional'' !! Masculine !! Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! Nouns
| е&lt;br&gt;(''ий --&gt; ии'') || е&lt;br&gt;(''ие --&gt; ии'')&lt;br&gt;(''мя --&gt; ени'') || а, я --&gt; е&lt;br&gt;ь --&gt; и&lt;br&gt;(''ия --&gt; ии'') || ах ях&lt;br&gt;(''мя --&gt; енах'')
|}
Rules in italics are rare exceptions to the more general rules.

==Adjectives==
Adjectives modifying masculine or neuter nouns in the prepositional case usually end in '''ом'''. For adjectives with the soft ending ('''ний'''), or for those whose stem ends in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж, ц'''), the ending is '''ем'''.

For feminine adjectives, the endings are the same as those in the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive]], [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|dative]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental case|instrumental]] cases: '''ой''' or, for those with the soft ending or which end in the 5-letter rule, '''ей'''.

Like nouns, adjectives in the prepositional plural end in &quot;х&quot;, and in fact take the same endings as the genitive plural: '''ых''' or, for those which normally end in '''ий''', '''их'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! ''Prepositional'' !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! Adjectives
| ом ем || ой ей || ых их
|}

: I heard about your beautiful new wife - '''Я слышал о твое́й красивой новой жене'''
: They're talking about those old Russian cars in the big red garage - '''Они говорят об этих старых русских машинах в большом красном гараже'''

== Pronouns ==
=== Personal ===
The personal pronouns in the prepositional case are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Мне || Нас
|-
! Second person
| Тебе́ || Вас
|-
! Third Person
| Нём/Ней || Них
|}
The third person singular personal pronoun '''нём'''  is masculine and neuter, and '''ней''' is feminine.

===Possessive===
The possessive pronouns are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! My
| Moём || Мое́й || Мои́х
|-
! Our
| На́шем || На́шей || На́ших
|-
! Your (sg., informal)
| Твоём || Твое́й || Твои́х
|-
! Your (pl., formal)
| Ва́шем || Ва́шей || Ва́ших
|}

As ever, possessive pronouns conjugate almost exactly like adjectives. The possessive pronouns in the third person are '''его''' for masculine and neuter owners ('his' and 'its), '''её''' for feminine owners ('her'), and '''их''' for plural owners ('their'). These are the same in all cases.

Examples:
: I am reading about them - '''Я чита́ю о них'''
: I am reading about their children - '''Я чита́ю о их де́тях'''

=== This and that ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! About this
| Э́том || Э́той || Э́тих
|-
! About that
| Том || Той || Тех
|}

Remember that '''о''' ('about') becomes '''об''' before the vowel '''э'''.

It may seem strange to have a section devoted to analog filter design in a digital signal processing book. However, there is a method to the madness. It turns out that digital filters can be modeled using analog filters, and analog techniques--which have been studied in depth for many years prior to digital systems--can be utilized to quickly and efficiently design digital filters. 

The following chapters will show some of the techniques involved in designing analog filters, and transforming analog filters from one type to another. The section will culminate on a chapter on the bilinear transform, which transforms the mathematical representation for an analog filter into the equations for an equivalent digital filter.

== Analog Design Process ==

Digital filters can be designed using analog design methods by following these steps:

#Filter specifications are specified in the digital domain. The filter type (highpass, lowpass,bandpass etc.) is specified.
#An equivalent lowpass filter is designed that meets these specifications.
#The analog lowpass filter is transformed using '''spectral transformations''' into the correct type of filter.
#The analog filter is transformed into a digital filter using a particular mapping.

There are many different types of spectral transformations and there are many mappings from analog to digital filters. the most famous mapping is known as the '''bilinear transform''', and we will discuss that in a different chapter.

== Butterworth ==
Butterworth ensures a flat response in the passband and an adequate rate of rolloff. A good &quot;all rounder,&quot; the Butterworth filter is simple to understand and suitable for applications such as audio processing.

== Chebyshev I ==

The Chebyshev 1 filter has ripple in the passband of the filter.

== Chebyshev II ==

Chebyshev 2 has ripple in the stopband.

== Elliptic ==

This filter has equiripple (the same amount of ripple in the passband and stopband).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The genitive case has four main uses: to denote possession ('Michael's car', meaning 'the car of Michael'), to denote number ('five apples'), in negative constructions ('there are no books'), and after several important prepositions ('without me').

== Usage ==
The genitive case is the third most commonly used case, after the nominative and accusative, and has four main uses.

=== Counting ===
When denoting how many of something you have, we usually place the object in question in the genitive case. However, Russian has some key differences to English:
* If there is 1, 21, 31, 41, etc, of something, they go in the ''nominative singular'':
:There is one cat - '''Есть оди́н кот'''
:He knows 21 words - '''Он зна́ет два́дцать одно́ сло́во'''
* If there is 2, 3, 4, 22, 23, 24, 32, 33, 34, etc, of something, use the ''genitive singular'':
:Two roubles - '''Два рубля́'''
:22 kopecks - '''Два́дцать две копе́йки'''
* If there is 5 to 19, 25 to 29, 35 to 39, etc, or something, use the ''genitive plural'':
:Five roubles - '''Пять рубле́й'''
:25 kopecks - '''Два́дцать пять копе́ек'''
&lt;br&gt;
There are also other quantity words that take the genitive, either singular or plural according to meaning:
*'''Мно́го''' - a lot, many, much,
*'''Не́сколько''' - a few, not many
*'''Ма́ло''' - few, little
*'''Ско́лько''' - how much? How many?
Examples:
:Few beers - '''Ма́ло пива'''
:A few months - '''Не́сколько ме́сяцев'''
:A lot of money - '''Мно́го де́нег'''
:Many apples - '''Мно́го я́блок'''
:How many pounds? - '''Ско́лько фунтов?'''

The effective difference between '''не́сколько''' and '''ма́ло''' is like that between 'a few' and 'few' - one denotes a quantity that is just enough ('I have a few friends here'), while the other denotes an insufficient quantity ('I have few friends here'). That said, though, they are largely interchangeable.

=== Possession and Negation ===
To denote something as belonging to something else, you place the owner in the genitive case:
:This is David's house - '''Э́то - дом Дэвида'''
:This is Ivan's brother - '''Э́то - брат Ива́на'''
Note that (unlike English'' 's'' forms and Russian possessive adjectives and pronouns) Russian possessive genitives are usually ''postpositional''.

Another use of the genitive is in the phrase &quot;I have...&quot;. Though Russian does have the verb 'to have' ('''иметь'''), it is rarely used. Instead, Russians use the following construction to say &quot;I have X&quot;: '''У меня есть Х'''.
This literally means, 'By me exists X'. Since the preposition '''у''' calls the genitive case, the person or thing that has the object in question is placed in the genitive. The thing that is possessed remains in the nominative: '''У''' + ''gen'' + '''есть''' + ''nom''
To turn this into a question, place an inflection on '''есть''', just as you place an inflection on the verb in a normal question.
:Do you have a son? - '''У вас есть сын?'''
:Yes, I have a son - '''Да, у меня есть сын.'''
:Yes, I do - '''Да, есть.'''

'''Есть''' on its own can also be used on its own to say 'There is...', 'There are...', or 'There exists...'. It is followed by the nominative case:
:There are Frenchmen on this street - '''На э́той у́лице есть францу́зы'''
:There are old buildings in Moscow - '''В Москве́ есть ста́рые зда́ния'''

Conversely, to say 'There isn't...', 'There aren't...', we use the word '''нет''' followed by the genitive case. Note that this use of the word '''нет''' is quite different from its usual meaning of 'no', and is closer to its original meaning as a contraction of '''не есть'''.
:There are no restaurants - '''Нет рестора́нов'''
:There are no old buildings in Moscow - '''В Москве́ нет ста́рых зда́ний'''

So, combining the above, to say 'I ''don't'' have...' is constructed as ''''У меня нет...'''', followed by the ''genitive'' case.
:Do you have a son? - '''У вас есть сын?'''
:No, I don't have a son - '''У меня́ нет сы́на'''
:My brother doesn't have any money - '''У моего́ бра́та нет де́нег'''

=== Prepositions ===
We've already seen how '''у''' commands the genitive case to roughly mean 'by', but many more prepositions use the genitive. The four most common, including '''у''', are:
*'''Для''' - for, for the benefit of
:I want a present for my friend - '''Я хочу́ пода́рок для моего́ дру́га'''
:He did this for her - '''Он э́то сде́лал для неё'''
*'''У''' - by, near
:I am standing by the fence - '''Я стою́ у забо́ра'''
:She is sitting by the window - '''Она сидит у окна́'''
:Your husband has one friend - '''У твоего́ му́жа есть оди́н друг'''
*'''Без''' - without
:He will drive without you - '''Он пое́дет без тебя́'''
:Black coffee - '''Ко́фе без молока́'''
*'''Из''' - from, out of (the opposite of '''в''' + ''acc'', 'into')
:I'm from England - '''Я из А́нглии'''
:She's arrived from work - '''Она́ пришла́ с рабо́ты'''

== Nouns ==
=== Singular ===
Masculine and neuter nouns follow the same rules for forming the genitive case:
* Replace a consonant or '''-o''' with '''-a'''.
* Replace '''-й''', '''-ь''', and '''-е''' with '''-я'''.

Notice that these are the same rules for masculine animate nouns in the accusative case. Similarly, feminine nouns use the same rules as the nominative plural:
* Replace '''-a''' with '''-ы'''.
* Replace '''-я''' and '''-ь''' with '''-и'''.
* If '''-а''' is preceded by one of the 'seven consonants', replace it instead with a '''-и'''.

=== Plural ===
The genitive plural is by far the most complicated ending in Russian, and is also the one with the most exceptions. However, as these rules are also the same for the accusative plural of animate nouns, they are also very commonly used:
* Masculine nouns ending in a consonant add '''-ов''' in the genitive plural.
:Table, five tables - '''Стол, пять столов'''
* Nouns ending in '''ц''' or '''-й''', ц or ҋ is replaced by '''-ев'''.
:Museum, six museums - '''Музе́й, шесть музе́ев'''
* Nouns ending in '''-е''', '''-ь''', or one of 'hushes' ('''-ш''', '''-щ''', '''-ж''', '''-ч''') add '''-ей'''.
:Thing, ten things - '''Вещь, десять веще́й'''
* Feminine nouns ending in a consonant and '''-я''' replace the '''-я''' with '''-ь'''. If they end in a vowel and '''-я''', replace the '''-я''' with '''-й'''.
:Week, seven weeks - '''Неде́ля, семь неде́ль'''
* Feminine nouns lose their '''-a''', and neuter nouns lose their '''-o'''.
:Book, eight books - '''Кни́га, во́семь книг'''

In the case of awkward consonant clusters from dropping end vowels, it is common for '''o''' or '''e''' to be added between the consonants: '''марка''' - '''марок''', '''англичанка''' - '''англичанок'''.

==Adjectives==
=== Usage ===
Adjectives take the number, gender, and case of the noun they modify. However, there is a peculiarity in Russian when counting: though we use the genitive singular on nouns that are numbered 2, 3, 4, 22, 23, 24, etc, we use the genitive ''plural'' for any adjectives attached to that noun:
:Three bookshops - '''Три кни́жных магази́на'''
:Five bookshops - '''Пять книжных магази́нов'''
:He knows 102 Russian words - '''Он зна́ет сто два ру́сских сло́ва'''
:He knows 106 Russian words - '''Он зна́ет сто шесть ру́сских слов'''

=== Conjugation ===
Like nouns, masculine and neuter adjectives have the same ending in the genitive singular, '''-ого''', pronounced 'oh-vo'. If the adjectival stem ends in '''ж''', '''ч''', '''ш''', '''щ''', or '''ц''', the ending is '''-его''', pronounced 'ye-vo'. Notice that this is the same ending for masculine animate adjectives in the accusative case.
Similarly, feminine adjectives in the genitive case have the same ending as the prepositional case: '''-ой''', or, after the same five 'hush' consonants, '''-ей'''.
:A kilogram of good Russian cheese - '''Кило́ хоро́шего ру́сского сы́ра'''
:A kilogram of good Russian sausage - '''Кило́ хоро́шей ру́сской колбасы́'''

To form the plural, the ending for all genders is simply '''-ых''', or, if the stem ends in '''к, г, х, ш, щ, ж''', or '''ч''', the ending is '''-их''',
:A kilogram of clean fresh apples - '''Кило́ чи́стых све́жих я́блок'''

== Personal Pronouns==
To use personal pronouns refer to the following table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! '''English''' || I || We || You || You || He/she/it|| They
|-
! '''Nominative'''
| Я || Мы || Ты || Вы || Он/она/оно || Они
|-
! '''Genitive'''
| Меня́ || Нас || Тебя́ || Вас || Его́/её || Их
|}

Notice that the genitive for 'of him' and 'of it' are the same: '''его́'''. Also, when the genitive is called by a preposition, '''его''', '''её''', and '''их''' have an '''н''' preceding them:
:For him/it - '''Для него́'''
:Without her - '''Без неё'''

Other pronouns are conjugated as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Of this &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of that &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of all &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of one's own &lt;small&gt;(mn/f/pl)&lt;/small&gt; || Of what? || Of whom?
|-
| Э́того́ / э́той / э́тих || Того́ / той / тех || Всего́ / всей / всех || Своего́ / своей / своих || Чего || Кого
|}

Notice that, where available, variants of a word in the genitive are given in the order masculine/neuter, then feminine, and then plural.

==Possessive Pronouns==
Like personal pronouns, refer to this table for the possessive pronouns:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! English !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! of my
| '''Моего́
| '''Мое́й || '''Мои́х 
|-
! of our
| '''На́шего || '''На́шей || '''На́ших
|-
! of your
| '''Твоего́ || '''Твое́й || '''Твои́х
|-
! of your
| '''Ва́шего || '''Ва́шей || '''Ва́ших
|}

As ever, possessive pronouns conjugate almost exactly like adjectives. For third person possessive pronouns (of his, of her, of its, of their), use '''его''', '''её''', or '''их''', regardless of the gender of the modified noun.

Examples:
:The roof of my house - '''Крыша моего дома'''
:The brother of his uncle - '''Брат его дяди'''
:The sister of his aunt - '''Сестра́ его тёти'''
:The brother of my wife - '''брат моей жены'''
:The wife of my brother - '''жена моего брата'''
:My brother is older than your sister - '''Мой брат старше твоей сестры'''
:Without his chair - '''Без его сту́ла'''
:Without his letter - '''Без его письма́'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''dative case''' is traditionally the third grammatical case, and denotes the indirect object of a verb. This page assumes some familiarity with [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|verbal aspect]] and the [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|case system]].

== Usage ==
Remember that verbs generally have a subject and an object: the person or thing that performs the verb (the subject: &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''He'' is reading a book'), and the person or thing that is receiving the action (the object: 'He is reading ''a book''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Just as the subject of a verb is in the nominative case, and the object of the verb is in the accusative case, there can be an ''indirect'' object of the verb that goes in the ''dative'' case.

The indirect object refers to objects that are not being directly acted upon. For example, 'I wrote a letter to you' - 'I' is the subject, 'a letter' is the object, and 'to you' is the indirect object. Thus, in Russian, instead of saying 'to you', they say the word 'you' in it's dative form: '''Я пишу письмо ''вам'''''. There are many common verbs that can have an indirect object, and most correspond with the English use of the word 'to':
: To speak to... - '''Говорить/сказать''' + ''dat''
: To relate, tell to... - '''Рассказывать/рассказать''' + ''dat''
: To telephone (to)... - '''Звонить/позвонить''' + ''dat''
: To answer, reply to... - '''Отвечать/ответить''' + ''dat''
: To show (to)... - '''Показывать/показать''' + ''dat''
: To give (to)... - '''Давать/дать''' + ''dat''
Some of these verbs don't use 'to' in English (e.g., 'I'll ring you' is, in Russian, is 'I'll ring ''to'' you'), while others can either use it or omit it (e.g., we can say both 'Give it to him' and 'Give him it'). In general, the object given or spoken about is in the accusative, while the person to whom the object is given or spoken about is in the dative case.

=== To give, давать/дать ===
One important verb that calls the dative is давать/дать, 'to give'. It is irregular, and conjugates as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|-

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | давало || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | дало
|-
! Plural
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | давали || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | дали
|}

=== Prepositions ===
Like other cases, there are prepositions that require the following phrase to be place in the dative case. The two main prepositions are '''к(о)''' ('to', 'towards') and '''по''' ('along'). Of all Russian prepositions, '''по''' is the vaguest: it can call three difference cases as a preposition, it's commonly seen as a prefix in the perfective [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|aspect of verbs]], and has seven broad categories of meaning when it calls the dative case:
* '''Motion on/along/across a surface''' - the most common meaning is movement across (e.g., crossing the road), or along (e.g., walking along the street), or about (i.e., moving all around the entirety of a surface), or otherwise moving in some fashion on top of some surface.
:: We drove &lt;u&gt;along&lt;/u&gt; the street - '''Мы поехали по улице'''
:: To travel &lt;u&gt;about&lt;/u&gt; Russia - '''Ездить по России'''
:: Housework (work about the house) - '''Работа по дому''' - ''notice that 'about a surface' can be interpreted quite loosely, and can lead to idioms such as this.''
* '''Activity in identical places/times''' - some activity or verb is occurring in multiple instances of a place or time. Places visited multiple times, or things done at multiple times, use '''по'''.
:: She went &lt;u&gt;around to&lt;/u&gt; many shops - '''Она шла по многим магазинам'''
:: She runs &lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt; the evenings - '''Она бегает по вечерам'''
:: They meet every Friday - '''Они встречаются по пятницам'''
* '''Uniform distribution''' - commonly translated as 'apiece' or 'per', this use of '''по''' is used to denote a singular noun as being distributed one apiece. For example, in the sentence, 'He gave his boys one apple each', we could say '''по яблоку''' to mean 'one apple each'. If there are multiple objects being given out,  (e.g., 'five apples each'), use '''по''' and the ''accusative'' case.
:: He gave his boys one apple each - '''Он дал его детям по яблоку''' - one item each, so '''по''' + ''dat''; note that the dative is also used for 'his kids'.
:: He gave his boys two apples each - '''Он дал его детям по два яблока''' - two items each, so '''по''' + ''acc''.
* '''The thing struck''' - primarily used with the verb '''бить/побить''' ('to beat/strike'), this denotes something as being struck or hit or beat.
:: He hit &lt;u&gt;the table&lt;/u&gt; with his shoe - '''Он бил ботинком по столу'''
:: Rain drummed &lt;u&gt;against&lt;/u&gt; the window - '''Дождь барабанил по окну'''
* '''Reason or cause of''' - the reason or cause of some event can be denoted using '''по''' and the dative case.
:: The woman drank the poison &lt;u&gt;by mistake&lt;/u&gt; - '''Женщина выпила яд по ошибке'''
* '''Your specialization''' - the trade or subject you specialize in, particularly with work, school, exams, etc. This typically translates as 'in'.
:: Russian exam (exam &lt;u&gt;in Russian&lt;/u&gt;) - '''экзамен по русскому языку'''
:: in my opinion (colloquially, 'in my') - '''По моему мнению ('по-моему')'''
* '''In accordance with''' - this usage denotes one thing as being in line with, or in accord with, or in accordance with, another thing, such as a plane flying &lt;u&gt;to&lt;/u&gt; schedule.
:: The plane flew according to plan - '''Самолёт летал по плану'''

'''По''' can also be used with the accusative case (meaning 'up to' or 'till', or, as discussed above, 'apiece'), and with the prepositional case (meaning 'after' or 'for'). '''К''' is relatively simpler, referring to or gesturing at the direction something is located.

== Nouns ==
To decline masculine and neuter nouns into the dative case, replace the ending '''o''' with '''у''', add '''у''' to a consonant, or replace '''й, е''', or '''ь''' with a '''ю'''. Feminine nouns decline exactly as in the prepositional case: '''а''' and '''я''' become '''е''', while '''ь''' becomes '''и'''.

The dative plural is formed using the same rules that govern the instrumental and prepositional plural, albeit with slightly different endings: all nouns which end in a consonant, an '''а''', or an '''о''', the plural ending is '''-ам'''. As a memory aid, try to link the '''a''' and '''ам'''. For those that end in a '''й''', a '''я''', or a '''е''', ''and'' any noun with an irregular nominative plural ending in '''-я''', the ending is '''-ям'''. Again, try to link the '''я''' and the '''ям'''.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
!  !! Masculine !! Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! Dative
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''у/ю''' || '''е/и''' || '''ам/ям'''
|}
Examples:
: The pen moved across the letter - '''Ручка пошла по письму'''
: Why did he tell it to the policeman? - '''Почему он сказал это полицейскому?'''
: She gave money to the museum - '''Она дала деньги музею'''
: The ship traveled about the sea - '''Судно шлo по морю'''
: Sasha is walking towards the school - '''Саша идёт к школе'''
: 
: 
:
: Boris won, thanks to his friends - Борис побеждал благодаря его друзьям

==Adjectives==
Adjectives modifying masculine or neuter nouns in the dative case have the ending '''-ому'''. If they end in the 5-letter rule ('''ш, щ, ч, ж''', or '''ц''') or have the soft ending (-'''ний'''), their dative ending is '''-ему'''. Feminine adjectives have '''-ой''' or, after the 5-letter rule or soft ending, '''-ей'''. Essentially, these are the same as e prepositional endings, with masculine and neuter adjectives having an extra '''-у''' - the same ending most masculine and neuter nouns get.

To form the dative plural, the ending is '''-ым''' or, after the soft ending or the 7-letter rule ('''к, г, х, ш, щ, ч''', or '''ж'''), '''-им'''.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
!  !! Masculine !! Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
| Dative || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ому/ему || ой/ей || ым/им
|}

: She spoke to his good friend Sasha - '''Она сказала его хорошему другу Саше'''
: Tanya will give the presents to the nice Russian man  - '''Таня даст подарки симпатичному русскому человеку'''
: They traveled across the large country - '''Они поехали по большей стране'''

== Pronouns==
===Personal===
The possessive pronouns in the dative case are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Мне || Нам
|-
! Second person
| Тебе || Вам
|-
! Third Person
| Ему/ей || Им
|}
The third person singular personal pronoun '''ему'''  is masculine and neuter, and '''ей''' is feminine.

===Possessive===
The possessive pronouns are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! English !! Masculine/Neuter !! Feminine !! Plural
|-
! to my
| Моему
| Мое́й || Мои́м
|-
! to our
| На́шему || На́шей || На́шим
|-
! to your
| Твоему || Твое́й || Твои́м
|-
! to your
| Ва́шему || Ва́шей || Ва́шим
|}

As ever, possessive pronouns conjugate almost exactly like adjectives. The third person pronouns are '''его''' for masculine and neuter owners, '''её''' for feminine owners, and '''иx''' for plural owners. These are the same in all cases.

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тому (&quot;tomoo&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;той (&quot;toy&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тому (&quot;tomoo&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тем (&quot;tyem&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The instrumental case is traditionally taught as the fourth case in Russian. It typically denotes an object as being the means by which some action is carried out (e.g., I ate ''with a fork'').

== Usage ==
The instrumental case is used to denote the means by which some actions is carried out. In the phrase, 'Boris wrote a letter to school with a pencil', there are four items:
# 'Boris' is the person who is doing, or did, or will do, the verb, so he is the ''subject'' of the verb. Thus, the word '''Бори́с''' is in its nominative form.
# 'A letter' is the thing that's being verbed, the ''direct object'' of the verb. Thus, the word '''письмо''' is in its accusative form.
# 'To school' is the thing that's being indirectly verbed, so it's the ''indirect'' object of the verb. Thus, the word '''школа''' is in its dative form, '''школе''', and means 'to school'.
# 'With a pencil' is the thing that allows the verb to be done, or is the means by which it is done. Thus, the word '''карандаш''' is in its instrumental form, '''карандашо́м''', and means 'with a pencil'
# Finally, the complete sentence is: '''Борис писал письмо школе карандашом'''. Notice that the words 'a', 'to', 'with', etc, are omitted in Russian and instead controlled by grammatical endings.

So the instrumental case is so called because it denotes the instrument by which some task is carried out, and this is its primary meaning. Thus, a word in the instrumental case can be translated by adding the words 'with' or 'by'.

Like the other cases, there are prepositions which can place whatever comes after them in the instrumental case. There are six in total: '''С(о), над, под, за, перед''', and '''между'''.
*'''C(o)''' + ''inst'' means 'with'. This may be confusing, as the primary meaning of the instrumental case on its own is also 'with'. There are two concepts that are both conveyed by the English word 'with', but are conveyed separately in Russian. 'With', as in 'by means of' ('He built it with his hands') is conveyed by the instrumental case on its own ('his hands' in their inst. form). 'With', as in 'accompanied with' ('He built it with her') is conveyed by '''''c(o)''''' followed by the instrumental case ('with her' is '''c''' + ''inst.''). It can also be used to denote the manner in which something is done ('He built it with ease'). In both of these uses, '''c(o)''' ''inst'' is the antonym of '''без''' + ''gen'' ('without').
*'''Над''' means 'over' or 'above', and '''под''' means 'under' or 'beneath'. '''Под''' + ''inst'' means 'under' if there is no motion involved - if there's motion, use '''под''' + [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative case|''acc'']] instead ('The book is under the bed' - no movement, 'The book slid under the bed' - movement). '''Под''' + ''inst'' can also mean 'physically near', and '''под''' + ''acc'' can mean 'temporally near' or 'near in time' ('They live ''near'' the city' - physically near).
*'''Перед''' means 'before' or 'in front of' in terms of positioning, and can also indicate responsibility ('The dog is in front of the house', 'The dog walked in front of the house', 'the family has a responsibility ''to'' the dog').
*'''Между''' means 'between' or 'among', similar to '''среди''' + ''gen'', 'among' (e.g., 'He stood between them').
*'''За''' generally means 'behind' or 'beyond', but has a few nuances to it. Like '''под''', when no motion is involved, the instrumental case is used. When motion ''is'' involved, however, the accusative case is used ('It's behind the house' - '''под''' + ''inst'', 'It went behind the house' - '''под''' + ''acc'').

== Nouns ==
Nouns in the instrumental case decline unusually compared to other cases, using rules that aren't found elsewhere. While not as complex as the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive plural]], it still warrents extra attention.

=== Singular ===
* Nouns ending in '''о''' or a consonant have '''-ом''' in the instrumental. However, if this ending syllable is both a) unstressed, and b) preceded by the five-letter rule ('''ч, ж, ш, щ, ц'''), then the ending becomes '''-ем'''.
:: Train - '''поезд''' --&gt; '''поездом'''
:: Morning - '''утро''' --&gt; '''утром'''
:: Pencil - '''карандаш''' --&gt; '''карандашом''' - ''ends in '''ш''', but ending syllable is stressed''
:: Husband - '''муж''' - '''мужем''' - ''ends in '''ж''' and is unstressed''
* Nouns ending in '''й''', '''е''', or '''ь''', have the ending '''-ем'''. If this ending is stressed, it becomes '''-ём'''. This applies mainly to masculine and neuter nouns; See below for feminine nouns ending in '''ь'''.
:: Museum - '''музей''' --&gt; '''музеем'''
:: Sea - '''море''' --&gt; '''морем'''
:: Dictionary - '''словарь''' --&gt; '''словарём''' - ''ending is stressed''
:: Day - '''день''' --&gt; '''днём''' - '''''e''' is a fleeting vowel, so vanishes when the word declines''
* Those ending in '''а''' of any gender have '''-ой'''. As above, if the ending is both unstressed and ends in the five-letter rule, the ending becomes '''-ей'''.
:: Book - '''книга''' --&gt; '''книгой'''
:: Newspaper - '''газета''' --&gt; '''газетой'''
:: Arm/hand - '''Рука''' --&gt; '''Рукой'''
:: Chicken - '''курица''' --&gt; '''курицей''' - ''untressed ending and stem ends in '''ц'''''
:: Pear - '''груша''' --&gt; '''грушей''' - ''unstressed ending and stem ends in '''ш'''''
* The ending '''я''' of any gender becomes '''-ей'''. If stressed, it becomes '''-ёй'''.
:: Week - '''неделя''' --&gt; '''неделей'''
:: Surname - '''фамилия''' --&gt; '''фамилией'''
:: Pig - '''свинья''' --&gt; '''свиньёй''' - ''stress on end syllable''
* Feminine nouns ending in '''ь''' have '''-ью''' in the instrumental.
:: Square - '''площадь''' --&gt; '''площадью'''
:: Horse - '''лошадь''' --&gt; '''лошадью'''
:: Church - '''церковь''' --&gt; '''церковью'''
So masculine and neuter nouns have the endings '''ом''', '''ем''', or '''ём''', and feminine nouns have '''ой''', '''ей''', '''ёй''', or '''ью'''.

=== Plural ===
There are two general endings for the instrumental plural: '''ами''' and '''ями'''. If the noun ends in a consonant, '''й''', '''о''', or '''а''', the ending is '''ами'''. However, if such a noun has an irregular nominative plural that ends in '''я''', use '''ями''' instead. If the noun ends in '''ь''', '''е''', or '''я''', use '''ями'''. In the following examples, the first word is the nom. sing., the last is the inst. pl., and the middle word (if one is given) is the nom. pl.:
: House - '''дом''' --&gt; '''домами'''
: Book - '''книга''' --&gt; '''книгами'''
: Letter - '''письмо''' --&gt; '''письмами'''
: Day - '''день''' --&gt; '''днями'''
: Pig - ''' свинья ''' --&gt; '''свиньями'''
: Sea - '''море''' --&gt; '''морями'''
: Brother - '''брат''' --&gt; '''братья''' --&gt; '''братьями''' - ''note the irregular nominative plural''
: Friend - '''друг''' --&gt; '''друзья''' --&gt; '''друзьями''' - ''note the irregular nominative plural''

There are three words which have the irregular instrumental plural ending '''ьми''',  (the three words given are the nom. sing., the nom. pl., and the inst. pl.):
: Daughter - '''дочь''' --&gt; '''дочери''' --&gt; '''дочерьми'''
: Child - '''ребёнок''' --&gt; '''дети''' --&gt; '''детьми'''
: Person - '''человек''' --&gt; '''люди''' --&gt; '''людьми'''

| Nouns || ом/ем/ём || ой/ей/ёй || ами/ями
|}

== Adjectives ==
Adjectives modifying masculine or neuter nouns in the instrumental case have two endings: adjectives which have the default ending '''ый''' or '''ой''' have the instrumental ending '''ым''', and those which end in '''ий''' have '''им'''. Feminine adjectives have the same endings as the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive]], [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional case|prepositional]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Dative case|dative]] cases: '''ой''', or, if the adjective's stem ends in the five letter rule ('''ц, ш, щ, ч, ж''') or it has the soft ending ('''ний'''), the ending is '''ей'''.

The plural ending is '''ыми'''. For adjectives that end in '''ий''', the ending is '''ими'''.

Digital Signal Processing units, on first glance, are very similar to other programmable microprocessors, microcontrollers, and FPGAs. However, DSP chips frequently have certain features and limitations involved that other categories of chips don't have. This chapter will attempt to explain, in broad language-neutral terms, some of the issues involved with DSP programming.

== Saturation Arithmetic ==

Intel-compatible microprocessors, something that most programmers are familiar with, have several features that people have come to expect from programmable chips. In particular, Intel-compatible chips have an arithmetic mode known as &quot;Roll-Over Arithmetic&quot;, also called modular arithmetic. Let's say that we have the integer number 250 (decimal) stored in a byte-sized register. If we add 10 to that number, the processor will overflow, and will roll-over the answer, giving us the answer 4. However, DSP chips frequently do not roll-over, and instead '''saturate''' to the maximum value. 

Let's say we are processing a grayscale image. This image has byte-sized integer values of white/black value as such: Pure white is 255, and pure black is 0. Now, let's say we want to &quot;brighten&quot; every pixel by 10 points, to improve visibility. So we create a loop, and we go through each pixel in the image, adding 10 to the value at any particular point. But what happens if we add 10 to a pixel that is already pure white? In a regular Intel-compatible chip, the value 255 + 10 = 9. In effect, if we make the white pixels brighter, we are turning them black! now, to avoid this, DSP chips saturate, and will go up to the highest value (255), and won't roll over. So, on a DSP chip, white can't get any whiter. Here are some examples (using unsigned bytes):

:&lt;math&gt;255 + 10 = 255&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0 - 10 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) ==

In difference equations, we have seen that multiply and addition operations are the most common. Let's look at a general example:

:&lt;math&gt;A x_n + B x_{n-1} + C x_{n-2} + D x_{n-3} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we notice that each element in this equation is multiplied by a coefficient, and added to the total. DSP engineers have noticed this pattern, and have optimized DSP chips to be able multiply and add very quickly (at the expense of other operations missing or slow). In fact, many DSP chips will have instructions known as '''multiply and accumulate''', which will perform both operations simultaneously, much quicker than a normal processor could do.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Are you learning Russian to &quot;get by&quot; on a one-week business trip to Moscow? Or do you want to learn &quot;good Russian&quot;? 

Russians will love you if you speak &quot;good Russian.&quot; Educated Russians are extremely proud of their grammar skills, and rightly so. Russian grammar is unbelievably complex. The Russian word for &quot;good&quot; sounds like &quot;horror show,&quot; and if you want to learn &quot;horror show Russki&quot; (good Russian) prepare for some scary stuff!

If you learn Russian grammar, you'll see how precise a language can be, and how imprecise English is in comparison. English is full of useless little words such as &quot;a,&quot; &quot;an,&quot; &quot;the,&quot; &quot;this,&quot; &quot;that,&quot; etc. These words add no meaning to sentences, they just make sentences &quot;sound right.&quot; English also conveys meaning via word order and context. Russian words communicate meaning so clearly that the order of the words can be mixed up. For example, in Russian you can say &quot;Bob eats lunch&quot; or &quot;Lunch eats Bob&quot; and there's no doubt that Bob is doing the eating. 

Pronouns (&quot;I,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; &quot;they,&quot; etc.) are built into verbs, so Russians often drop pronouns without losing clarity. Thus Russian sentences are typically shorter and less ambiguous than English. The price you pay for this efficient, precise language is far more demanding grammar.

But to &quot;get by&quot; you need only basic grammar, but not the byzantine grammar of &quot;good Russian.&quot; You could treat all nouns as if they were masculine, and all verbs as if you are the person doing the action, and Russians would usually understand your meaning. But you should read over the many grammar rules so that you have a clue what Russians are saying. E.g., you should be able to recognize when a Russian uses the prepositional case, even if you only use the nominative case.

Native speakers learn grammar as children by listening to adults talk, and by being corrected by their parents. A child who reads a lot and whose parents speak correctly doesn't need to learn grammar rules. As an adult learning Russian, you'll learn best if a native Russian listens to you and corrects your mistakes. But the grammar rules will act as shortcuts, to help you learn faster.

In learning some people are auditory learners, some are visual, and some are movement learners. (See ISBN 1573240648 &quot;The Open Mind&quot; by Dawna Markova, for more about this.) But all three learning styles are needed for organizing and committing to long-term memory. You may prefer to hear spoken Russian, or see written Russian, or (for movement learners) write a Russian word and then write how it sounds in English. You may need to do an activity, such as cooking dinner, to pay attention. But all of us need to do all of these things to learn well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pronouns are words which take the place of nouns (compare &quot;Your husband drove to Florida&quot; with &quot;He drove to Florida&quot;), which denote ownership (&quot;My cat&quot;, &quot;Your cat&quot;, etc), or which replace nouns with questions (compare &quot;He drove&quot; with &quot;Who drove?&quot;, &quot;What drove?&quot;, and &quot;What drove?&quot;). Russian has six categories of pronouns, the three most common of which are detailed further on their own pages: Personal, Possessive, Interrogative, Demonstrative, Reflexive, and Determinative. In Russian, the pronouns change according to the gender of the  noun.

== Formality ==
While most pronouns can be used just as they would in English, there's an important facet to them that English doesn't have: formality.

In English, there are two first-person personal pronouns, 'I' and 'we', four third-person pronouns, the singular ('he, 'she', and 'it') and the plural ('they'), and a single second-person pronoun, 'you'. That English has only one second-person personal pronoun, is a peculiarity of our language. In Russian, and indeed in most other languages, there is a distinction between two forms of 'you'.

Like first- and third-person pronouns, second-person pronouns have a singular and a plural form. To say 'you' and mean one person, say '''ты''' (''ti''). To refer to more than one person, use '''вы''' (''vi'').  However, if you want to show respect, such as to a teacher or elder, or the person is someone you don't know, use '''вы''' instead of '''ты'''.
:Where are you, brother? - '''Где ты, брат?''' - Notice the singular form '''ты'''
:Where are you, teacher? - '''Где вы, учительница?''' - Notice the plural form '''вы'''

Interestingly, though English lost its second-person plural pronoun, some dialects have recreated it: Southern US English uses 'y'all' to refer to just that: 'you all'. But this isn't just a contraction, as it's used in a pronoun in its own right, giving us constructions like: &quot;I want to talk to all y'all&quot;.

It is important to at least grasp this distinction, as it becomes important when learning about [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs|verbs]]: verbs have ''six'' basic forms of conjugation, one for each type of pronoun (1st/2nd/3rd person, and singular/plural).

== [[Russian/Personal Pronouns|Personal]] ==
Broadly speaking, sentences involve three people: the person speaking, the person being spoken to, and someone else not involved in the conversation. The person speaking is known as the 'first person' (think of ''first-person games'' that are viewed through the eyes of the player), the person spoken to is the 'second person', and the other person is the 'third person'. Each 'person' can be referred to as either singular ('I', 'he') or plural ('we', 'they'). Finally, note that third-person singular pronoun comes in three varieties that vary with gender: 'he', 'she', and 'it'. Russian pronouns are generally used the same as in English, with the exception of the above distinction between formal and informal 'you':
:I see  - '''Я ви́жу''' - ''ya &lt;small&gt;VEE&lt;/small&gt;-zhoo''
:We see - '''Мы ви́дим''' - ''mi &lt;small&gt;VEE&lt;/small&gt;-deem
:You speak (sing. informal) - '''Tы говори́шь''' - ''ti ga-vo-&lt;small&gt;REESH&lt;/small&gt;''
:You speak (sing. formal) - '''Вы говори́те''' - ''vi ga-vo-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye''
:You speak (plural) - '''Вы говори́те''' - ''vi ga-vo-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye''
:He/she/it reads - '''Он/Она́/Оно́ чита́ет''' - ''on/on-&lt;small&gt;AH&lt;/small&gt;/on-&lt;small&gt;OH&lt;/small&gt; chee-&lt;small&gt;TA&lt;/small&gt;-yet''
:They read - '''Они́ чита́ют''' - ''on-&lt;small&gt;EE&lt;/small&gt; chee-&lt;small&gt;TA&lt;/small&gt;-yoot''
Notice that though the verbs are the same in meaning, they change form: 'speak' changes from '''ты говоришь''' to '''вы говорите'''. Changing verbs like this is known as ''conjugation'', and is covered more fully on its [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs#First_conjugation|dedicated page]]. When nouns, pronouns, and adjectives change, it's called ''declension'' (this can also refer to verbs changing, however 'conjugation' refers specifically to verbs). Like most things in Russian, the personal pronouns change depending on which of the [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|six cases]] they're in:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|''Personal Pronouns !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|First person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Second person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Third person
|- style=&quot;font-style:italic&quot;
! s !! p !! s !! p !! s !! p
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Nominative|Nominative]]
| Я || Мы || Ты || Вы || Он/Она/Оно || Они
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive_case|Genitive]]
| Меня́ || Нас || Тебя́ || Вас || Его́/Её || Их
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Dative_case|Dative]]
| Мне || Нам || Тебе́ || Вам || Ему́/Ей || Им
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Accusative_case|Accusative]]
| Меня́ || Нас || Тебя́ || Вас || Его́/Её || Их
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Instrumental_case|Instrumental]]
| Мной || На́ми || Тобо́й || Ва́ми || Им/Ей || И́ми
|-
! [[Russian/Grammar/Prepositional_case|Prepositional]]
| Мне || Нас || Тебе́ || Вас || Нём/Ней || Них
|}
Note that when some of these have several forms, these are clarified in the pages for that specific case. Also note that third-person singular pronouns have the suffice '''н-''' when preceeded by a preposition: '''к ней''', '''от неё''', etc. This doesn't apply to the possessive pronouns, or in general any third-person pronoun that isn't ''directly'' called by the preposition.
:I like you - '''Я тебя люблю'''
:You talk to me - '''Вы мне говорите'''
:You talk about me - '''Вы говорите обо мне'''
:You talk with me - '''Вы говорите со мной'''

As the last example shows, the third-person singular pronouns '''он''', '''она''', and '''оно''' vary by gender in grammar, but not in meaning. The '''он''' in &quot;Я сел на стул, и он развалился&quot; (I sat on a chair, and it fell apart) is grammatically male to correspond with the table, but still translates to 'it' in English.

|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- formal
+ informal

{Formal or informal? Tы говори́шь
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- formal
+ informal


&lt;/quiz&gt;

== [[Russian/Possessive Pronouns|Possessive]] ==
These pronouns act as adjectives and modify a noun, stating that it is owned by one of the three speakers (''my'' cat, ''your'' cat, '''his''' cat). Unlike personal pronouns, but like adjectives, possessive pronouns also change to match the gender and number of the noun they modify. So in the following table, notice that the different gender and number of each type of pronoun refers to the object that's possessed, not the possessor. Since there are four pronouns that conjugate in four ways laterally and six ways vertically, shown here is only the forms for '''мой''', 'my'. The rest are detailed on their own pages:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ''My'' !! Masculine !! Feminine !! Neuter !! Plural

| Моём || Мое́й || Моём || Мои́х
|}
The various forms given in the accusative case are detailed more thoroughly on that page.
Third-person possessive pronouns are special: there are only three words, and each refers to the gender of the speaker, not the case, gender, or number of the object possessed. For masculine and neuter possessors, the word is '''его''', 'his'/'its', pronouns ''ye-vo''. For feminine possessors, use '''её'''. For plural possessors of any gender, use '''их'''.
:My chair - '''Мой стул'''
:My dog - '''Моя собака'''
:My dress - '''Моё платье'''
:My books - '''Мои книги'''

==Russian names==

Russians use three names: first name, or имя; middle or patronymic name, or отчество, which is their father's first name plus a suffix meaning &quot;son of&quot; (ович) or &quot;daughter of&quot; (овна); and the last name or family name, or фамилия. Women's last names add an а to the masculine form of the name.

To address a boss, a teacher, or somebody who is older or superior in rank use the person's first name and patronymic. For instance: Василий Иванович!

To address a military or police officer use the rank and the officer's family name. For instance: Рядовой Иванов (Private Ivanov).
If you don't know the family name, use Товарищ and the rank. For instance Товарищ рядовой (Comrade private).

To address a suspect, a former spouse, and other types that don't deserve the title Comrade, use гражданин fem. гражданка (citizen). For instance: Гражданин, пройдёмте. (The citizen, follow me.)

The titles Господин fem. Госпожа (Mr. or Ms.) are reserved for wealthy foreigners. Ordinary citizens of foreign countries are your comrades. However, lately Russians have started to use Господин/Госпожа more frequently, especially in business circles.

Russians use relatively few first names. There are only a dozen or so men's first names, and maybe three dozen women's first names. Creativity in baby-naming isn't encouraged.

Russians also use diminutives or nicknames&amp;#151;lots! Each name typically has a version used by your best friend, another used by your other friends, another used by your teachers, another used by your grandmother, another used when you are scolded, etc. Some of the most common examples include Sasha for Alexander, Alyosha for Alexei, Misha for Mikhail, Dima for Dmitri, Lena for Elena, Olya for Olga, Natasha for Natalya and Katya for Ekaterina.

Digital Filters can be very complicated devices, but they must be able to map to the difference equations of the filter design. This means that since difference equations only have a limited number of operations available (addition and multiplication), digital filters only have limited operations that they need to handle as well. There are only a handful of basic components to a digital filter, although these few components can be arranged in complex ways to make complicated filters.

There are two types of filters in the digital realm: '''Infinite Impulse Response''' (IIR) filters, and '''Finite Impulse Response''' (FIR) filters. This page will attempt to discuss the differences between the two filter types, and the pros and cons of each.

== FIR Filters ==

We will start the discussion with FIR filters, which are conceptually the easiest to understand and the easiest to design. However, FIR filters suffer from low efficiency, and creating an FIR to meet a given spec requires more hardware than an equivalent IIR filter.  However, an FIR filter with symmetric coefficients is guaranteed to have linear phase.  This is important in some applications.

If we define the discrete time impulse function as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta [n] = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; n = 0 \\ 0 &amp; n \not = 0 \end{cases} \mbox{,} &lt;/math&gt;

the response of an FIR filter to &amp;delta;''[n]'', denoted as ''h[n]'', will decay to zero after a finite number of samples.  The transfer function of an FIR filter contains only zeros and either no poles or poles only at the origin.

===Filtering a time-series in Octave/Sciplot===

First create some points for a time series. In this case we'll create one second of random data sampled at 44 kHz.

 sampling_t = 1/44000;
 t = 0:sampling_t:1;
 x = rand(size(t));

Have a look at the time series

 plot(t,x);

Have a look at its spectrum (it is mostly uniform, what we would expect from noise)

 specgram(x)

Now we'll use a built-in function to create a third order Butterworth low-pass filter with cutoff frequency pi*0.1 radians 

 [b,a] = butter(3,0.1)

Now filter the time series.

 y = filter(b,a,x);

Have a look at  the first 100 points of the filtered data.

  hold on
  plot(y(1:100))
  plot(x(1:100))
  hold off

Check its spectrogram

  specgram(y)

Now look at the magnitude of the FFT

  plot(log(abs(fft(y))))

== IIR Filters (infinite impulse response filter) ==

IIR filters are harder to design than the FIR filters, but the benefits are extraordinary: IIR filters are ''an order of magnitude more efficient'' than an equivalent FIR filter. Even though FIR is easier to design, IIR will do the same work with fewer components, and fewer components translate directly to less money. IIR filters differ from FIR filters because they always contain feedback elements in the circuit, which can make the transfer functions more complicated to work with.  

The transfer function of an IIR filter contains both poles and zeros.  Its impulse response never decays to zero (though it may get so close to zero that the response cannot be represented with the number of bits available in the system).

== High-pass and Low-pass ==

High-Pass and Low-Pass filters are the simplest forms of digital filters, and they are relatively easy to design to specifications. This page will discuss high-pass and low-pass transfer functions, and the implementations of each as FIR and IIR designs.

== Band-pass ==

'''Band-pass Filters''' are like a combination of a high-pass and a low-pass filter. Only specific bands are allowed to pass through the filter, and frequency data that is too high or too low

== Stop-band ==

'''Notch filters''' are the complement of Band-pass filters in that they only stop a certain narrow band of frequency information, and allow all other data to pass without problem.

== Notch ==

The direct complement of a bandpass filter is called a '''bandstop filter'''. A notch filter is essentially a very narrow bandstop filter.

== Comb Filters ==

'''Comb Filters''', as their name implies, look like a hair comb. They have many &quot;teeth&quot;, which in essence are notches in the transfer function where information is removed. These notches are spaced evenly across the spectrum, so they are only useful for removing noise that appear at regular frequency intervals.

== All-pass == 

The All-pass filter is a filter that has a unity magnitude response for all frequencies. It does not affect the frequency response of a filter. The All-pass filter does affect the phase response of the system. For example, if an IIR filter is designed to meet a prescribed magnitude response often the phase response of the system will become non-linear. To correct for this non-linearity an All-pass filter is cascaded with the IIR filter so that the overall response(IIR+All-pass) has a constant group delay.

== Canonic and Non-Canonic ==

'''Canonic filters''' are filters where the order of the transfer function matches the number of delay units in the filter. conversely, '''Noncanonic filters''' are when the filter has more delay units than the order of the transfer function. In general, IIR filters are noncanonic, and FIR filters are canonic. This is not always the case, however.

Here is a demonstration of a canonical, 2nd order filter:
[[Image:Cannonical DSP Filter.JPG]]

Here is an example of a non-canonical 2nd order filter:
[[Image:NonCanonical DSP Filter.JPG]]

Notice that in the canonical filter, the system order (2) equals the number of delay units in the filter (2). In the non-canonical version, the system order is not equal to the number of delays (4 delay units). Both filters perform the same task, however the canonical version will be easier to implement in digital hardware, because you will need fewer delay units.  However, this drawback nearly disappears if several second order IIR's are cascaded, as they can share delay elements.  In this case, the only &quot;extra&quot; delay elements are those on the input side of the first section.

== Notations ==

There are some basic notations that we will be using:

:&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; Pass-band cut off frequency
:&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; Stop-band cut off frequency
:&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; Pass-band ripple peak magnitude
:&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; Stop-band ripple peak magnitude</text>

Filtering a data input that is infinite in length can be a tricky task for any computer to manage, and DSP engineers have identified two techniques for breaking down an infinite input into manageable chunks for filtering.

== &quot;Infinite Input&quot; ==

'''infinite input response''' (IIR) filters are structures that use a feedback element to help filter data. An IIR filter has a transfer function of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = \frac{\prod(a_n - z^{-1})}{\prod(b_m - z^{-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

The constants ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are known as the '''zeros''' of the transfer function, and the ''b&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms are known as the '''poles''' of the transfer function. FIR filters, by comparison do not have poles.

IIR filters are named as such because the filter does not stop responding once the input has stopped, but instead the feedback element will continue to input values into the filter structure for processing after the input has stopped.

== IIR vs FIR Filters ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! !! FIR !! IIR 
|-
|Stability || Always BIBO Stable || May not be stable
|-
|Efficiency || Not efficient || Very Efficient
|-
|Phase || May have linear phase || phase not linear
|-
|}

An FIR filter will have an order that is a significantly higher than the order of an equivalent IIR filter. This means that FIR filters need more complexity and more components then IIR filters to complete the same task. However, IIR filters have a potential for instability, which requires more analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Articles are small grammatical words that convey the ''definiteness'' of a noun.

== Omission of articles ==
In English, the two articles are 'the' and 'a/an'. English uses the definite article &quot;the&quot; to indicate a specific place, thing, etc: 'I ate the orange' suggests there was only one orange, or it was in some way special. English uses the indefinite articles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; to indicate that the following noun is not specific, e.g., &quot;I ate an orange&quot; suggests there were several oranges. Note that English only uses indefinite articles for singular nouns: 'I ate oranges' (plural) lacks an article. The word 'some' is sometimes used as a sort of faux indefinite plural article: 'I ate some oranges' conveys the same indefiniteness as 'an'.

The details and nuances of articles can fortunately be glossed over, as Russians simply omit articles altogether. For example, while we say 'I want an apple', using the article 'an', in Russian this is simply 'I want apple', or '''Я хочу яблоко''' (''ya kha-&lt;small&gt;CHOO&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;YA&lt;/small&gt;-bla-ka''). This can make the language seem quite blunt, though this is due to Russian's deliberate efficiency in grammar.

== To be ==
To compound this efficiency, the most common verb in English, 'to be', is also omitted in Russian, at least in the present tense - that is, the words 'is', 'am', 'are', etc, don't have Russian counterparts. The infinitive '''быть''' 'to be' exists with past- and future-tense conjugations, but its present-tense conjugation is not used in contemporary Russian. For example, 'She is nice' becomes 'She nice', or '''Она симпатичная''' (''a-&lt;small&gt;NA&lt;/small&gt; seem-pa-&lt;small&gt;TEECH&lt;/small&gt;-na-ya'').

Thus, the English four-word sentence 'I am a student' is just two words in Russian: '''Я студент''' (''ya stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;''). In written Russian, when a sentence equates two nouns in a row, a long dash, or  —, is written between the nouns to indicate the verb 'to be'. For example, 'Tanya is a student' translates to '''Таня — студент''' (''&lt;small&gt;TAN&lt;/small&gt;-ya — stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;'').

==quiz==
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;

{Она актриса
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ She is an actor.
- She needs an aspirin.
- She is Alica.
&lt;/quiz&gt;

A '''court-bouillon''' is an aromatic liquid in which meat, fish, or vegetables may be cooked.

The simplest form is salted water. Normally, however, a court-bouillon consists of water flavoured with herbs, spices, wine, lemon juice, shallots, etc. The liquid is usually allowed to simmer for a while to concentrate the flavours before the item to be cooked is added.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called JeffreyAllen1975. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name JeffreyAllen1975~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Что (pronounced &quot;shto&quot;, not &quot;chto&quot;) and какой (pronounced &quot;kakoy&quot;) both mean &quot;what&quot;. As a loose rule, какой means &quot;which&quot;. The correct rule is that if a noun follows &quot;what&quot;, use какой. If no noun follows &quot;what&quot;, use что.

As a memory aid, the following noun's gender and number change какой. Какой precedes masculine nouns, какая precedes feminine nouns, какое precedes neuter nouns, and какие precedes plural nouns. Because что is never followed by a noun, it only changes form in different cases.

If you just want to &quot;get by,&quot; always use что for &quot;what.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page discusses the nature of verbs in Russian, as well as the basics of how to use them in the present tense. For more advanced concepts, see the pages on [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|verbal aspect]], the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|past tense]], the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|future tense]], and [[Russian/Grammar/Participles|verbal participles]].

[[File:G. Caillebotte - Homme portant une blouse.jpg|thumb|'''Идти''' (''eed-&lt;small&gt;TEE&lt;/small&gt;'') — to walk]]

== The Nature of Verbs ==
In English, there are several ways to say that different people are doing some action, such as studying: &quot;I study&quot;, &quot;we study&quot;, &quot;you study&quot;, &quot;he/she/it studies&quot;, and &quot;they study&quot;. However, notice that third-person singular pronouns (he, she, and it) change 'study' into 'studies'. When verbs change, this is called 'conjugation'. English has a simple two-form verb conjugation ('study' and 'studies'), which is the origin of the term: ''conjugate'' comes from the Latin ''conjugare'', meaning 'yoked together', because English verbs come in these pairs. Similarly, 'conjugal', meaning yoked together in marriage, comes from this same root.

Like English verbs, Russian verbs also conjugate according to who is doing the verb: when on its own the default ''infinitive'' form corresponds to the English 'to' ('to see', 'to walk', etc), and this infinitive can conjugate for each of the six [[Russian/Personal Pronouns|personal pronouns]] - '''я''' ('I'), '''мы''' ('we'), '''ты''' ('you', informal), '''вы''' ('you', plural/polite), '''он/она/оно''' ('he/she/it'), and '''они''' ('they'). Notice that although the third-person singular pronoun has three forms for each gender, there is still only one third-person singular form of a verb, just as in English. The other thing to note is that Russian has two words for 'you' like French and German, but unlike English. Briefly, '''ты''' is used informally for a single person who you know well, while '''вы''' is used for groups of people, or for an individual person to whom you want to show respect.
:You &lt;small&gt;(informal)&lt;/small&gt; are speaking - '''Ты говоришь''' - ''ti ga-vuh-REESH''
:You &lt;small&gt;(formal/plural)&lt;/small&gt; are speaking - '''Вы говорите''' - ''vi ga-vuh-REET-ye''

The rules for conjugating Russian verbs come in two main patterns: the [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs#First conjugation|'first' or 'type 1' conjugation]], and the [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs#Second conjugation|'second' or 'type 2' conjugation]]. All verbs have an infinitive form, which is listed in dictionaries, and this virtually always ends in '''-ть''' (e.g., '''говорить''', 'to speak', '''работать''', 'to work').

=== How to place emphasis ===
In Russian, basic sentences with verbs are constructed with the verb's subject (the thing doing the verbing), the verb's object (the thing being verbed), and the verb itself. English uses a specific word order to denote the subject and object of a verb: 'cats like dogs' and 'dogs like cats' are the same words but repressed to change who's doing what. Russian, however, uses a [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|case]] system to denote what's the object and what's the subject - that is, the words change their endings depending on what they're doing in a sentence.  This means that word order can instead be used to emphasise parts of a sentence; specifically, the word placed at the end of a sentence is the one emphasised. In practice, Russians usually say &quot;Subject object verb&quot;, such as &quot;I her like&quot;. Other word orders place emphasis on other words: &quot;I like her&quot; emphasises that it is ''her'' I like, while &quot;Her like I&quot; emphasises that is is ''me'' who likes her.

Because verbs take on different forms for different pronouns, Russians often omit the noun or pronoun altogether if it's obvious who the speaker is:
:Are you speaking? - '''Вы говори́те?''' - ''vi ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye?''
:Yes, I'm speaking - '''Да, говорю́.''' - ''da, ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;RYOO&lt;/small&gt;''
This can also be done for the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|future tense]], but not the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|past tense]], for reasons that will be obvious once you learn those tenses.
Finally, note that objects like 'plane' or 'boat' call for the third-person form of a verb: 'He is flying' and 'The plane is flying' both use the third-person singular form '''лета́ет'''.

=== Questions and negation ===
To form a question in Russian, simply place an higher intonation on stress of the verb. This is different to English, which often reorders sentences ('You are riding.' - 'Are you riding?') or adds auxiliary words ('You ride' - 'Do you ride?'), with a higher intonation on the end of the sentence. The use of pronouns in asking questions ('He is riding' - 'Who is riding?'; 'You are going here' - 'You are going where?') is detailed more thoroughly on the page on [[Russian/Interrogative Pronouns|interrogative pronouns]].

To negate a verb, simply add '''не''' (''nye'') before the verb:
:Are you speaking? - '''Вы говори́те?''' - ''vi ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;REE&lt;/small&gt;-tye?''
:Yes, I'm speaking - '''Да, говорю́''' - ''da, ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;RYOO&lt;/small&gt;''
:No, I'm not speaking - '''Нет, не говорю́''' - ''nyet, nye ga-vuh-&lt;small&gt;RYOO&lt;/small&gt;''
:He's not a student - '''Он не студент''' - ''on nye stoo-&lt;small&gt;DYENT&lt;/small&gt;'' - as '''быть''' is omitted in the present tense, that '''не''' is used on it's own 
:Boris isn't coming - '''Борис не приходит''' - ''borees nye pree-KHO-&lt;small&gt;deet&lt;/small&gt;''

The phrase '''У меня есть + ''nom''''' means 'I have...' (literally, 'by me exists...'), using the infinitive of the verb '''есть''' to mean 'exists'. To negate this and say 'I don't have...', we replace '''есть''' with '''нет''', and place the following object in the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|''genitive case'']].  '''Нет''' is a contraction of '''не есть''', and has a different meaning to '''нет''' as in 'no'. The use of this phrase, it's negation, and forming the genitive case in general, are discussed further on the [[Russian/Grammar/Genitive case|genitive page]].

=== The Infinitive ===
As discussed above, verbs by default are in their ''infinitive'' form, meaning they haven't been conjugated yet. In English, this correspond to the 'to...' form of a verb; in the sentence, &quot;I want to live in Moscow&quot;, 'to live' is the infinitive of that verb. Just like in English, dictionaries give verbs in their infinitive, unconjugated form. The infinitive almost always ends in '''-ть''', and conjugating a verb is as simple as removing this '''-ть''' and adding the appropriate ending.
:What do you want to do? - '''Что вы хотите делать?''' - ''shto vi kho-&lt;small&gt;TEE&lt;/small&gt;-tye'' - '''делать''' is the infinitive of the verb 'to do'

== The Present tense ==
The present tense is used much like in English, with a few important exceptions. First, Russians omit the verb 'to be' in the present tense: &quot;She is nice&quot; in Russian is '''Она симпатичная''', with no word for 'is'. A long hyphen or dash is used to equate two nouns together, where the word 'is' or 'are' is used in English: &quot;They are students&quot; is '''Они – студенты'''. Second, as discussed more in the page on the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|future tense]], there are times when Russians use the present tense when English wouldn't, such as reporting a story.

Second, there is the concept of [[Russian/Verbal_Aspect|verbal aspect]]: simply put, all verbs in Russian have ''two'' words, the imperfective and the perfective. For instance, 'to speak' is '''говорить''' ''and'' '''сказать'''. Which you use is discussed more thoroughly on the specific page, but for our purposed we just need to know that the present tense can only be formed using the ''imperfective'' word. So to say &quot;I am speaking&quot;, you use the imperfective '''говорить''', not the perfective '''сказать'''. So, unless otherwise stated, the rest of this page will use imperfective verbs.

So, to form the present tense, you simply take the ''imperfective aspect'' of the verb and add the appropriate endings. Verbs in Russian conjugate in one of two ways.

===First conjugation===
These verbs usually end in '''-ать''', though there are enough exceptions that it's probably best to simply learn the conjugation of a new verb. Eventually, you will be able to 'predict' how verbs conjugate. To conjugate these verbs, remove the '''-ть''', and add the appropriate ending:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Я, I !! Мы, we !! Ты, you (informal) !! Вы, you (formal) !! Он/она/оно !! Они, they
|-
| -ю || -ем || -ешь || -ете || -ет || -ют
|}

Remember, these six forms are for each personal pronoun ('I', 'we', etc). If you want to refer to something else, such as &quot;The plane flies&quot; or &quot;The boat sails&quot;, remember that 'plane' and 'boat' are in the third-person, so would take the '''он''' ending of '''-ет'''.

Let's look at how you conjugate '''читать''', 'to read':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Я читаю&lt;br&gt;I am reading&lt;br&gt;I read || Мы читаем&lt;br&gt;We are reading&lt;br&gt;We read
|-
! Second person
| Ты читаешь&lt;br&gt;You are reading&lt;br&gt;You read || Вы читаете&lt;br&gt;You are reading&lt;br&gt;You read
|-
! Third person
| Он/она/оно читает&lt;br&gt;He/she/it is reading&lt;br&gt;He/she/it reads || Они читают&lt;br&gt;They are reading&lt;br&gt;They read
|-
|}

Notice that conjugating verbs forms the present tense, and a Russian present tense verb can be translated as either the ''simple present'' tense ('I read') or the ''continuous present'' tense ('I am reading') in English.

===Second conjugation===
Second conjugation verbs usually end in '''-ить'''. Like other verbs, to conjugate them, simply remove the '''-ть''' and add the appropriate ending. These endings are similar to first-conjugation verbs, though with a change in vowel:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|  !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|First Person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Second Person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Third Person
|-
! Я, I !! Мы, we !! Ты, you (informal) !! Вы, you (formal) !! Он/она/оно !! Они, they
|-
! First conjugation
| -ю || -ем || -ешь || -ете || -ет || -ют
|-
! Second conjugation
| -ю || -им || -ишь || -ите || -ит || -ят
|}

Let's look at how you conjugate '''говори́ть''', 'to speak':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
! First person
| Я говорю́&lt;br&gt;I am speaking&lt;br&gt;I speak || Мы говори́м&lt;br&gt;We are speaking&lt;br&gt;We speak 
|-
! Second person
| Ты говори́шь&lt;br&gt;You are speaking&lt;br&gt;You speak || Вы говори́те&lt;br&gt;You are speaking&lt;br&gt;You speak 
|-
! Third person
| Он/она/оно говори́т&lt;br&gt;He/she/it is speaking&lt;br&gt;He/she/it speaks || Они говоря́т&lt;br&gt;They are speaking&lt;br&gt;They speak 
|-
|}

=== Exceptions ===
Like all things in Russian, there are exceptions to the above rules:
*Seven verbs with the infinitive ending '''–еть''', and three which end in '''-ать''', take the second conjugation: '''видеть''' ('to see'), '''вертеть''' ('to twirl'), '''обидеть''' ('to offend'), '''зависеть''' ('to depend'), '''ненавидеть''' ('to hate'), '''терпеть''' ('to tolerate'), '''смотреть''' ('to watch'), '''слышать''' ('to hear'), '''дышать''' ('to breathe'), and '''держать''' ('to keep').
*Two verbs with the infinitive ending '''–ить''' take the first conjugation endings: '''брить''' ('to shave') and '''стелить''' ('to lay').
*The verb '''гнать''' ('to drive') takes the second conjugation endings  - However, verbs of motion are quite complex, and will be discussed in [[Russian/Grammar/Verbs_of_Motion|their own page]].

== The Past and Future tenses ==
Now that we've covered the present tense, there are two other tenses that can be used in Russian: [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|the past tense]] and [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|the future tense]]. These are detailed more thoroughly on their own pages, but in brief, they are formed as follows:
* To form the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|&lt;small&gt;PAST TENSE&lt;/small&gt;]] of a verb, remove '''-ть''' and add '''-л''' ('''-ла''' if the subject is feminine, '''-ло''' if neuter, '''-ли''' if plural). This rule applies to both [[Russian/Verbal Aspect|aspects]] of a verb. So, &quot;I was speaking&quot; (imperfective) is '''я говорил''', while &quot;I spoke&quot; (perfective) is '''я сказал'''.
* To form the [[Russian/Grammar/Future tense|&lt;small&gt;FUTURE TENSE&lt;/small&gt;]] of verbs, choose your aspect. If you're using the ''perfective'' aspect to form the future, simply conjugate it as you would the imperfective aspect, and this creates the future tense. If you're using the ''imperfective'' aspect to form the future, conjugate the verb 'to be', '''быть''', and add the infinitive of the imperfective. So, &quot;I will speak&quot; (perfective) is '''я скажу''', while &quot;I will be speaking&quot; (imperfective) is '''я буду говорить'''.

== Missing Wikibooks policies ==

I know there is the little policy/vote thing, but I thought I'd bring it up here. We seem to be missing a few policies here at Wikibooks. Notably {{bad link|Wikibooks:Verifiability}}, {{bad link|Wikibooks:Cite sources}}, and {{bad link|Wikibooks:No original research}}. I am not positive which policies are really warranted here, but I thought I'd start building the Wikibooks policies. Please see [[User:Lord Voldemort/Quicksand|my sandbox]] for an adapted start to the No original research policy. Any comments or tweaks are encouraged. Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:22, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

And wow, no policy about personal attacks. I have adapted the en.wiki NPA policy and have started a poll about enforcing it. Please see [[Wikibooks talk:No personal attacks]]. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

Yet another missing policy important to Wikibook integrity. Please see [[Wikibooks talk:No legal threats]] for poll to enforce. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:50, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:I would suggest that bringing over all those policies quickly is critical to resolving some of the issues we've had here.--09:21, 25 November 2005 (UTC) ''this comment from [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]]''

::I've been so busy on my books trying to get content up to an acceptable level, that I havent really taken the time to cite everything. I try to list at least a partial bibliography, but it's hard to keep up with all the citations.

== Feedback on my first wiki-book? (&quot;Stuttering Therapy&quot;)== 

I've started moving my book &quot;No Miracle Cures: A Multifactoral Guide to Stuttering Therapy&quot; to wikibooks. The wiki-title is &quot;Stuttering Therapy.&quot; Please send me suggestions or tell me what mistakes I made! E.g., I couldn't find how to move the book onto the &quot;Medical: Clinical Medicine: Speech-Language Pathology&quot; bookshelf (which I also created). I've moved the first chapter. I'll try to move the other chapters in the next week or two. [[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 22:40, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

::[[Stuttering Therapy]] --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:28, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

::: You'd be better off splitting all of the chapters off onto their own pages. For example, the Introduction could go on {{bad link|Stuttering Therapy/Introduction}} and so on.

Why is the VB .NET book located here, and not at [[Visual Basic .NET]] --[[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 02:55, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:Because using the Programming namespace for a programming language makes eminent sense? [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 19:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

::Whether it makes sense or not (I don't particularly like it), the programming books are all located in the Programming: namespace. It's the way it's always been done here, and by having everything uniform, makes pages easier to find. All we need is a few pages to break the mould, and we will have total CS chaos. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:39, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:::[[Ada Programming]] moved out of the &quot;Programming:&quot; pseudonamespace; that seems to be the trend. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

::::Is there a consensus yet on whether or not to drop the the &quot;Programming:&quot; pseudo-namespace?  When I created [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] it seemed it was almost universal but now there is a drift away from it.  So what do people think?  As far as I am concerned it is perfectly reasonable to drop the pseudo-namespace but it will mean renaming a lot of pages.  As an aside: this illustrates perfectly why relational databases are not necessarily very good at manipulating hierarchical data (Wikibooks backend is a MySQL database I think, (alright MySQL isn't a classical Cobb relational database if you are a purist but it's close enough for engineering purposes :-)).  I made all the internal links relative so I shouldn't have to edit many pages, just rename them.  Does everyone use relative links? --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

::I don't like the Programming: namespace, but i can't see a reason why we would want to go out and rename ''all those pages''. I mean, unless you had a bot to do it all, it seems like a huge waste of effort. Just leave well-enough alone I suppose. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 14:28, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

::: With Opera and tabbled browsing you can rename about a 100 pages in one hour. With middle click you open about 10 pages at once, rename them, close them, next 10. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:19, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

:::If I start working on some book in the &quot;Programming:&quot; false namespace, then I might move it out of the namespace. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:03, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

This book only has about 5 pages. I don't like it in the programming namespace when other books are not put into a namespace. I am going to rename the pages anyway so is it OK to drop the Programming bit? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 05:05, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
:Go ahead.  After all if it's only five pages it can easily be undone.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:08, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] and [[Wikibooks:Policy]] ===

There are two point to this. The [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] and [[Wikibooks:Policy]] - chapter 4 and 5. The first considers all pseudo-namespaces as obsolete naming convention and while we have not jet agreed on [[WB:NP]] this particular point is undisputed. The later outlines a possible future of Programming: - a book to containt all the programming language which have not yet enough support to support a book of there own. I know this is harsh but live is harsh.

Then there is also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which can only detect books which follow [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. Statistics might not be all - however they can serve as a motivating factor. Especialy since the Stat is sorted by size ;-) .

== Raising Hell ==

I know it seems like I am raising hell, but I think I am going to nominate the entire Pokedex, and related pages for deletion. They are not a textbook, are not a source for academic information, and no class will be taught on Pokemon. There are about a billion modules connected and I just thought I'd give you all fair warning. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:20, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

::I think that's a bit rash, especially considering that we havent come to a concensus yet as to whether or not to keep the game manuals. It might not be a bad idea to alert the people who have put so much effort into it that it might come under the proverbial axe blade, but i dont think we need to be rash. I would actually cast a solid vote to keep the game manuals, if it came to a vote. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:53, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
:::Game manuals are not textbooks. A book perhaps on Game Theory might be, but have you even seen modules in the Pokedex? They are not textbooks, and never will be. Wikibooks is not a place for random game's walkthroughs, cheat codes, or indices. It is for textbooks. Wikibooks needs to be more serious, and the Pokedex hurts our reputation as a valid resource for educators and students. This should be able to be used as a resource in low-wealth areas such as parts of Asia and Africa as well. What good is the Pokedex going to do a 12-year-old Nigerian boy trying to learn?

::::No, it is some people's beliefs that wikibooks should only be textbooks.  That is not the original mission statement, nor has it ever been how wikibooks has operated.  Not even in its earliest days, when the point of wikibooks would have been well understood as it was just created.  There is no consensus at this time that wikibooks is textbook only-  if anything it seems to be the opposite.  
::::Hell, if we go by 12 year old Nigerian boys and 8 year old Thai girls, we need to delete just about everything?  What good is a book on Calculus or Quantum Mechanics to them?  We'd need to limit our wikibooks to &quot;How not to starve&quot; and &quot;Working in a sweat shop&quot;.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;Of course neither of those would qualify, as they aren't taught in classes and thus aren't textbooks either.  &lt;/sarcasm&gt;--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
:::::I think you know what I mean. This should be usefule for teachers and professors and especially students (no matter how old). And to quote the history of Wikibooks, &quot;''Wikibooks, previously called '''Wikimedia Free Textbook Project''' and '''Wikimedia-Textbooks''', is a sister project to Wikipedia and is part of the Wikimedia foundation, begun on July 10, 2003''&quot;, so originally it ''was'' just for textbooks. Somewhere along the lines, the intent and purpose was corrupted. Saying it wasn't for textbooks is just a fallacy. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:45, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
::::::Example: I have many non-fiction books on my shelves relating to wolves, wolf biology, history, etc. Despite never having seen a textbook on them, I think I would get support for a {{bad link|The Wolf}} Wikibook. But what about a book on something more specific, like the history of the wolves since their reintroduction to Yellowstone? I ''have'' books on that subject, but calling them textbooks would be an incredible stretch. Where do you draw the line? (I think without a '''very''' solid line very, very clearly defined somewhere, this discussion will be extremely difficult to advance.) --[[User:Telamon|Telamon]] 22:58, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

::::::No, I don't.  You have conflicting arguments, one of which is dead wrong, the other of which is asinine.  The dead wrong one is that this site is or ever has been textbooks only.  It is not, and never has been.  The purpose of the site is instructional books, not merely textbooks.  Textbooks are a major part of the site, arguably the most important part.  But not the only part.  The asinine part is that if an instructional book is not useful for third world nations, then it isn't applicable to wikibooks.  Even ignoring the fact that what third worlders need to know most would eliminate most wikibooks that both of us think should be here, this is still not a prerequisite for wikibooks.  Third worlders don't need english lit or US history-  yet we have wikibooks for each.  They also don't need instruction manuals on how to use obscure electronics-  yet we have those too.  The fact that they are unlikely to play pokemon does not mean that its a reason for it to be eliminated from wikibooks.  Hell, not even wikipedia would agree with you-  there are articles there on pokemon.  If you followed that line of thought, it would need to delete every article on every movie, game, book, TV show, musician, artist ever written from both sites-  a significant amount of material and time spent.  And much of it useful under the right circumstances.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 23:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
:::::::Oh, stop it. By this time, we all know what Wikibooks is for. ''It has specifically been outlined by Jimbo.''' As Jimbo has the right to speak for the Board of the Wikimedia Foundation, I am inclined to agree with him on how their website should be run. And I quote, &quot;''This is for textbooks, not joke books, '''not random books on any subject you like'''. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''&quot; (emphasis added). And I don't mean that only people in third world countryies should be able to use Wikibooks, and to try and paint my comments in such a light is dead wrong. I simply meant that the purpose of this project (to provide '''free''', open-source textbooks) ties in with the overall mission of the Wikimedia Foundation (to provide the sum of human knowledge and to be accessible by everyone... even those in third world countries). Stop trying to continue this fallacy that any random subject matter is appropriate for Wikibooks. We get crap dumped on us from Wikipedia, and for too long we just said, &quot;Hey, why not? We might attract more editors here if we had this. I know it doesn't really fall into line with was Wikibooks actually ''is'', but who cares... we need more editors.&quot; Well this thinking has to stop. And if that means losing editors (even great ones) then so be it. This might not be the wiki for them. This is for editors who want to help write free textbooks. Everyone else is expendible. I know I am harsh and am probably losing any chance at adminship here, but someone needs to stand up for Wikibooks and it might as well be me.

(De-indenting) First, let me call your baloney. There are a few others trying, or even want, to hold up the integrity and reputation of Wikibooks. 

Second, did you not even read what I wrote? What exactly do you think Wikibooks was founded for? As a retard-dump for out-of-place Wikipedia articles? I'm sorry that I am the one who has to be so vocal about this, but I'm not about to let you and your kind ramrod this crap down my throat. Let me quote again, since you apparantly missed it the first time: &quot;''This is for textbooks, not joke books, '''not random books on any subject you like'''. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''&quot; (emphasis added) I think Jimbo knows a little bit more about the goals than you do. 

Third, I ''am'' doing something constructive for this site. Do you have any idea how many missing policies are around here? You quote &quot;no original research&quot;, do you have any idea what that actually means? No, because there is no policy defining it. Should we even be deleting anything? Porbably not, because the Deletion policy isn't even approved of yet. I could tell you to &quot;die, mother fucker, i'm coming to stab you&quot;, because there is no &quot;No personal attacks&quot; policy. I could threaten to sue you if you even write on this board again, because there is no &quot;No legal threats&quot; policy. I seem to be one of the few that actually cares what happens here. I am trying to keep Wikibooks as a serious project that can be used as a useful resource. Sorry if you want this place to be shoddy, I don't. I can edit where I please, so don't try lecturing me on being useful. See you around, my friend. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:So you continue to quote a page that was recently edited and under dispute.  Much of the quote isn't even by your hero Jimbo (check the history).  It proves nothing.  Wikibooks is, and always has been, a repository of non-fictional books.  It has never been restricted to textbooks.  Its you who are undermining the integrity of wikibooks, by trying to change its definition and thus eliminate large amounts of good, solid content with your narrow views.  And you are the only one-  I don't see anyone else with you on your crusade.  If you want to bring it to a vote, try it.  You'll lose badly.  Otherwise drop it.

Your wishes that Wikibooks should include shoddy pieces of crap like the Pokedéx and other general junk doesn't make it so either. I don't doubt there is a lot of content that we would lose, but '''this wiki might not be the place for it, or you'''.

=== Why Keep {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex}} ===
If the Pokedex goes to VFD, then I will vote '''keep'''.
# The Pokedex is essentially a macropedia (banned by [[WB:WIW]]). A typical page like {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex:Farfetch'd}} contains tables, but it does not give instructions. However...
#* The {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex}} module explicitly says that it is a part of {{bad link|Pokémon}}. As part of the larger strategy guide for these video games, the macropedia is acceptable.
#* The main reason for the [[WB:WIW]] rule is to put encyclopedia information on Wikipedia, which has a Pokemon article. But [[Wikipedia:Farfetch'd]] does not contain the tables from {{bad link|Wikibooks Pokédex:Farfetch'd}}, and [[WB:WIW]] allows Wikipedia articles to be extended into Wikibooks in this manner.
# To quote [[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]]: ''They are not a textbook, are not a source for academic information, and no class will be taught on Pokemon.'' It is a textbook; the information might not be [[wikt:academic|academic]] but it is useful to certain video game players. A ''school'' class might not teach this material in lecture, but could still use it as a textbook. Some schools have classes for video games (studying the games themselves in addition to making new ones).

I created the page [[Wikibooks talk:Game manual guidelines]] for a discussion on whether Wikibooks should ban game guides. However, most opponents of game guides only associated them with Jokebook, Naturism, and [[Getting a date]], the three books that [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] wanted to delete. Those three books had problems that the game guides did not; they were debated at [[WB:VFD]] and [[WB:VFU]].

I had argued that game guides (1) are textbooks (2) are allowed by [[WB:WIW]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:39, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:The question is, are they allowed by Jimbo? He's tightening policy and all that. And here I quote from one of his diffs, &quot;''This is for textbooks, not joke books, not random books on any subject you like. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.''&quot; Judging by that line, game guides are definite goners, as they are certainly not the subject of classes other than being examples of game design or violence in media or whatnot. Hm. Wasn't someone (LV?) going to ask Jimbo about this? Anyway, we need an answer from him, and the policy page needs to be amended to reflect that.

----
' A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class' is a ludicrous definition of the word textbook.  My personal library is full of books that I consider, and are often described by the publishers, as textbooks but which would definitely not be usuable in their entirety for study in an 'existing class'.  A better definition is 'a book used as a standard work for the study of a subject' (from http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;field-12668446=textbook&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname), unfortunately for most of us that is in some ways an even more restrictive test than Mr Wales'.  It does, however, have the advantage that it does not not tie you down to a narrow definition of study.  To give one example: 'The Handyman's Complete Self Instructor' published by Odhams.  This is definitely a textbook, it has theory, practice and exercises but what class would use it?  It covers house building, decorating, radio receivers (theory and practice), the theory of internal combustion engines, and much more.  It was published in the heyday of self-improvement when an enthusiastic person might expect to make serious progress through independent study.  No class would ever have used it as its principal text and quite likely no one person would be interested in every chapter.  If we are to take literally the constraint that a book must be usable in an existing class then we must have a description of the syllabus that the class follows in order to determine whether or not the book qualifies.  For me a much more telling objection to the Pokemon modules is their lack of exercises, they read more like an operating manual than a textbook and the user is merely informed of facts, never challenged to use them to generate anything new.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:35, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:A [[wikt:class|class]] might not be a class at school, nor one with a syllabus. It might only be &quot;a group, collection, category or set sharing characteristics or attributes&quot;, for example, the class of all Pokemon users, instead of the class at school that studies whichever type of game includes Pokemon. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:08, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

I am new to this snakepit of endless wrangling. I am interested in editing a crummy old public domain translation into a modern edition. (A novel by Tolstoy.) Obviously, a translated version of a novel by Tolstoy could be used in a classroom, so it appears to fit the definition of a Wikibook mentioned several times above. This could turn into a whole series of modernized, public domain translations of classic fiction (and non-fiction, later). As I explained when discussing this over at GP, this would involve changing the mode of expression of a translator, not editing Tolstoy. The Gutenburg folks try to faithfully reproduce old works, not create new ones, so they suggested I try here. Is this within the Wikibook concept of itself? &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; --Gene (sorry, I am not conversant with all these codes; I just got here.)

== Another Language ==

Before I say anything, I just want to say that I love this site, it's so awesome and has great information...keeps me really busy at work when it's slow.  I just find this part of your website, wikibooks and notice that you have an area on learning a different language which is cool.  But you don't have an area on learning Latvian, which is strange considering you have an option to change the language format of Wikipedia to Latvian.  My wife is a Latvian and I always wanted to learn how to speak her language to her as a surprise gift without her knowing I learned it.  I was hoping that you could start including that language in the Wikibooks too. Well I hope that it happens, if not, I'll still keep this in my favorites.  

Thanks

Craig

:We don't have one because noone who knows both Latvian and English has volunteered their time to write one yet.  It would definitely be welcomed content.  Unfortunately, my knowledge of Latvian is limited to the fact it exists.

== Proposed [[Sexual Health]] Wikibook ==

I threw together a proposed outline for a book on sexual health on my user page. I think that a book like this could be a wonderful resource where people with serious questions about the subject can come to get serious and helpful answers. I do realize however a few important facts:

#I am not exactly an expert on the topic myself
#Such a book would probably invite a higher-then-average amount of vandalism
#some of the topics (birth control, STDs, sexual education in general) are hot-button topics, and would bring in alot of controversy.

Despite the hardships, I think that this book could still potentially be an excellent resource, and the type of serious, helpful book that could really help wikibooks out in general. I wanted to get some feedback on the current outline (which i threw together pretty quickly) before any motions were made to actually introduce this book onto a bookshelf. Comments and suggestions are welcome both here and on the page itself. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:02, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:We have a [[Sexual Psychology]] book with some of the same topics, but almost no actual content. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:50, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

::I have seen that book. Unfortunately, sexual psychology just can't cover all the same topics. Especially topics about hygene, contraception, disease, etc.. just can't be covered in a psychology book. Now, we could rename and expand that book to cover all these topics, but i dont know if that's the best idea. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 22:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

This book sounds like an excellent albeit difficult idea.  I have some comments.

* The &quot;Transmitting disease via Anal and Oral sex&quot; subtopic is misplaced under &quot;Fertility and Infertility&quot;.  I assume that that's basically a typo.
* Consider adding material on [[w:Circumcision|circumcision]] and so-called [[w:Female circumcision|female circumcision]].  The latter is not so relevant in the US where presumably it is rare&amp;mdash;however, we have a world-wide audience.  Be aware that (male) circumcision is far more a hot button topic than you might expect.  There is an amazing amount of near-insane fanaticism, both pro and con, over this little snip.
* Consider adding material on [[w:Abortion|abortion]] and [[w:Selective reduction|selective reduction]].  Well, out of the frying pan and into the fire concerning hot button topics.
* Consider adding material on such [[w:Abortifacient|abortifacients]] as [[w:Mifepristone|Mifepristone]] ([[w:RU-486|RU-486]]) and [[w:Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptives]] as [[w:Levonorgestrel|Levonorgestrel]] ([[w:Plan B|Plan B]]).

Note that, for the last three items, you should take the &quot;consider adding&quot; (as opposed to &quot;please add&quot;) part seriously.  I did not intend them as topics that need to be added, but rather ones that could possibly be worthing of adding.  I could very well see you thinking some or all of them as too tangential to include, or too controversial to be worth the headache or whatever. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:16, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:I wanted to add a heading for abortion, but i realize all too well that that page could quickly get out of control. It would be hard to add a page that is completely non-biased. The emergency abortifacients could be mentioned, but we can't recommend them as good ideas: that would only start a flame war. Also, if you see any typos on that page, feel free to edit them out, or to add your own ideas. It's only an outline afterall, and the more pre-planning we do now, the better the book will be when (if) we introduce it --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:57, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

Look at Amazon, there are dozens of fertility books (for women who want to get pregnant) and ZERO birth control books (for women who don't want to get pregnant). Seems like a big need there. The best birth control info I've seen is the chapter in &quot;Our Bodies, Our Selves.&quot; I would be happy to let you use a section about STDs I wrote for my book &quot;Hearts and Minds.&quot; My advice re. avoiding STDs differs from the &quot;conventional wisdom,&quot; you might find it interesting.

== Anon users can't create new pages ==
On wikipedia, Jimbo has established a new policy that anonymous users cannot create new pages, but are instead restricted to only editing current pages. This change was enacted after some amount of controversy involving a vandalized page that remained un-reverted for a very long length of time. I don't propose that wikibooks has all the same problems as wikipedia, but I am wondering if perhaps we don't need a similar safeguard. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:09, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
* Absolutely not. We have to few contributors and anons are creating many pages. If more sysops watched recent changes, there would be no problems with vandals. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:21, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
**I agree with [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]], anything that discourages contributors is definitely not a good idea.  I can easily imagine good reasons for a contributor wanting to remain anonymous (think about writing a book that discusses abortion, Scientology, etc.).  On the front page of Wikibooks it says 'Welcome to Wikibooks, a collection of open-content textbooks that anyone can edit.'  Let's cross that bridge when we reach it.  Also, did Jimbo Wales establish that policy unilaterally, or was there a consensus on Wikipedia for the change?  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 07:57, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
***I don't know all the specifics of the action, but i know that it was deemed news enough to appear on [http://www.slashdot.com slashdot]. I also did a quick test where i signed out and tried to create a new page on the 'pedia and i couldnt. I think Jimbo may have made that decision unilaterally. Also, nobody is saying that anonymous users can't contribute, they are only saying that an anonymous user can't create a new page. Why would we want a bunch of vandals being able to come in here and create a bunch of pages like {{bad link|Wiki is stupid}} or {{bad link|UR GAY ROFLS}}? Ordinary users then can't help to revert this vandalism, it falls on the backs of sysops to fix this stuff. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 13:49, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

I disagree strongly with the notion implicit in the change that anonymity implies bad faith.

Actually, when this change was mentioned on foundation-l (which I now read), it was described as an experimental change. The most significant problem is that anonymous users now cannot contribute to Wikipedia through red links. Also from reading foundation-l, I get the idea that a few English Wikipedia users now think that it is OK to deter new users instead of welcoming them when the new users make mistakes.

Jimbo was smart to try the experimental change on English Wikipedia, which has almost no need for new users and new pages when compared to other wikis, such as this one. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:50, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

I think that perhaps we could use a guide for creating style changes using monobook.js and monobook.css. for that matter, maybe we could just use a good guide to the skins here on wikibooks. on the 'pedia these kinds of tools and things are relatively popular, but on here they are unheard of. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:22, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Backing up and working offline ==

Hi. After spending a not insignificant amount of time on a wikibook that I am largely running, I am scared about the possibility of a wikibooks crash and the loss of all my painstaking work. Is there an easy way to locally back-up a wikibook (without going into edit for every page and copying the text and pasting it into a word file and saving it). Also, is there a way for me to make and see the results of  wiki on my computer when I'm not online (obviously I can write the mark-up, but I can't see what it looks like). If there is a way to make a wikibook locally, is it possible to have the images all ready locally and then upload them all in one go? At the moment the image upload page is a one at a time job, which is a little labour intensive.

May I also take the opportunity to say thank-you to whoever it is that deserves my thanks in making and maintaining this site. It is truely amazing and beautiful. [[User:Demipomme|Demipomme]] 21:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:I don't know of a way to locally keep specific modules, but you can get all of them from a database dump. That's probably not what you are looking for. I don't think there is a way to view wiki programming outside of a wiki. If you are really worried, perhaps create a user subpage on Wikipedia or another wiki much less likely to crash. But saving them as a word file would work too. Sorry I couldn't be more of a help... it may have been better if I had just let someone who could explain better tell you.

:As to the thank you... everyone maintains this site (even you, so thanks). Just keep up the good work. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:50, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

::You might want to look at [[Wikibooks:Mirrors and forks]]; there are some sites that have copies of everything from Wikibooks. Also [[MetaWikipedia:Wikimedia servers]] describes the servers, which are the same ones that host [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]. There are at least 100 servers in different parts of the world, so this wiki does not fail easily. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:57, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

''is there a way for me to make and see the results of  wiki on my computer when I'm not online?''
Well, in theory you could install 
[[w:MediaWiki]]
on your personal computer.
There are a *lot* of people who install wiki software on their own personal computer ( http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki ) -- most wiki software is fairly easy to install. Unfortunately, the MediaWiki software is (according to rumors I've heard) too complicated for most people.
(Is there some other, simpler-to-install wiki that uses MediaWiki-style markup?)

''image upload page is ... is a little labour intensive.''
Unfortunately, that's true on most web sites -- but people are coming up with some clever ideas to simplify the [http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.fcg/LongImageIncorporationProcess Visual:LongImageIncorporationProcess].

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:03, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for the feedback. I think I'll feel a little safer knowing there are &quot;at least 100 servers&quot;! And I'll create a back-up page as per the post below to back-up the html. Cheers.

:I use a local cacheing proxy server called [http://scache.sourceforge.net/ SmartCache] to keep a local copy of all my web browsing (well, not quite all, just the important bits).  When I want to keep a ''snapshot'' of part of a web site I use [http://www.httrack.com/ HTTrack].  [http://scache.sourceforge.net/ SmartCache] lets you browse the pages you have visited just as though you were on line, [http://www.httrack.com/ HTTrack] can copy entire web sites or parts of web sites to your local disk and rewrite the internal links so that the site works just by opening the files in a browser.  I haven't tried [http://www.httrack.com/ HTTrack] on WikiBooks yet so I'm not sure how easy it is to confine it to a single book.  You could also use [http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html wget].  These techniques will give you the rendered pages so they aren't exactly backups of the source but they would be enough to recreate the content. Please use common sense when using such mirroring tools so that you don't overload the servers. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

==  easy way to locally back-up a wikibook ==

There ''is'' an easy way to back up the rendered HTML output for an entire book in one fell swoop.
For example, you can go to
[[C++ Programming/Print version|Programming:C_plus_plus:All_Chapters]]
or [[Python/Print version]]
and tell your browser to save that one page, which contains the rendered HTML output for the latest version of every page in the entire book.

I'd be happy to help you set up a similar page for any other book.
([{{fullurl:C++ Programming/Print version|action=edit}} Check out how] the
[[w:Wikipedia:Transclusion &quot;transclusion&quot;]] is done if you want to do it yourself).

Alas, I don't know any way to back up the raw Wikitext other than going to each page manually, hitting the &quot;edit&quot; button, and copy-and-pasting it into a local text file.

== What language is en.wikibooks.org? ==

I ask, because I've just had a completely valid Australian english word (Glycaemic) repeatedly corrected as being a 'typo'.

Is there a policy as to the language to be used?  I looked but couldn't find one.  Thanks.  [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 11:15, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:The language is english, although there is no specific rule on which english is being used. There are many differences (although most are small) between the &quot;english&quot; spoken in australia, the UK, and America. A general guideline is people should be tolerant of these differences, but many people don't even know that a word is from a different dialect. The problem is that the word &quot;Glycaemic&quot; might be spelled correctly in Australian english, but the corrected version might be correctly spelled in British english, or American english. no sense getting into an edit war about it, maybe just provide a footnote or something. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 13:11, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:: Okay, Thanks. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 20:41, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

I say there should be no &quot;official&quot; dialect in wikibooks, else we would have to have 3 wikibook sites for German, some 100 dialects for the phillipeno one, etc. etc. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:05, 26 December 2005 

I think that turning the 'offending' word into a link to a footnote or to the Wiktionary entry would be better than correcting it unless it is wrong in all the dialects and variants.  Not sure that British, American and Australian English are different enough to qualify as dialects though; most of the differences that people mention are simply variant spellings.  I agree with [[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] that there should not be an official dialect.  This is especially so in English because we do not have any equivalent of [http://www.academie-francaise.fr  l’Académie française] or [http://www.sprakrad.no Norsk Språkrådet], the language belongs to the people who use it.  Perhaps this lack of policy should be made official :-) --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

== Recent changes question ==
As an active member of other Wikis and a newcomer to the Wikibook, I'm having a really difficult time orienting myself around here. My main problem is that I'd like to contribute to the Cookbook, but not the other areas of the site. I guarantee there are plenty of other folks out there like me who feel discouraged because there is too much to wade through before you can find what you're interested in. Specifically, I'd like to use the Recent Changes page to look at Cookbook specific changes. The problem is that there seems to be only a handful of Cookbook related changes per 500, making it near-impossible to selectively follow the Cookbook's progress. Is there some way to access a Cookbook specific Recent Changes page? [[User:Kneague|Kneague]] 22:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:Hmmm... you could always watchlist each Cookbook module. I don't think there is another way to just see Cookbook changes. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:39, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

:Is there some way such a feature could be programmed, then? Having a single Recent Changes page is a real limiting factor because it means so many new contributions and edits will fall under the radar. Looking through the Cookbook now, there are numerous things that need to be better streamlined, and I think that could be achieved if there a better mechanism for tracking Cookbook specific changes. On a more global scale, having Book specific Recent Changes pages could cultivate a sense of community on those pages, encouraging people to contribute and providing a newcomer with the necessary attention to keep them around. [[User:Kneague|Kneague]] 22:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::On the top of the page, when you are logged in, there is a tab that says &quot;watch&quot;. When you click that button, the page will go onto your personal watch list. Then, to see your watchlist, you can click the &quot;My Watchlist&quot; link in the upper right-hand corner (near your user name). Alternatively, when you edit a page, there is a check box labled &quot;Watch this page&quot;, which has the same effect. If you want to automatically watch every page you edit, you could click on the &quot;preferences&quot; link (right next to &quot;my watchlist&quot;), and under the &quot;editing&quot; button, click the checkbox called &quot;Add pages you edit to your watchlist&quot;. Then, every time you edit a page in the cookbook, it will add that page to your watchlist.

::: I think it's not exaltly what Kneague was looking for - this function lets you watch only single pages. There's another feature I think will meet your needs. In every article, you have &quot;toolbox&quot; left to the text of article. On its top you have &quot;Related changes&quot; link - it shows changes in every article current article is pointing to.

:Another way of monitoring pages is to use a program like [http://www.btinternet.com/~markwell/webmon/ Colin Markwell's WebMon] to periodically check the pages you are interested in and alert you when the have changed.  I do this for the pages that I edit most often.  You could tell WebMon to monitor the Related Changes for the contents page of the book.  Of course you might need to monitor several Related Changes pages if there is no comprehensive contents page.  As with any automated web client please don't overload the servers by careless use, that is, don't check too often.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:18, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

:The idea of watching the related changes pages sounds good, but i'm having trouble getting it to work.  when i click on Cookbooks, it gives me the option of watching the Cookbooks page. that works fine. However, when I click on &quot;related changes&quot; to the Cookbook, suddenly the watch button disappears. am i doing something wrong or this feature removed for a reason? if its not possible to add those pages to my watch list, i could always bookmark them in my browser, but i thought i should check here first. [[User:Kneague|Kneague]] 05:23, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:Looks like the related changes don't provide for watching; it isn't just the Cookbook that behaves that way.  [http://www.btinternet.com/~markwell/webmon/ WebMon] works though and gives you essentially the same feature.  In fact it could be argued that it is better as it will pop up a messge saying that the page has changed (WebMon Windows only I'm afraid but Unix users can probably throw a shell script together to do the same trick).  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:41, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

:The webpage says that wikimedia has a &quot;flawed business model&quot;, but considering that wikimedia is a not-for-profit organization, i hardly doubt we have a business model at all. What pisses me off the most is the fact that a few screw-ups on the 'pedia have created a situation where some people are being libeled. Beyond that, attempts to correct obvious cases of libel have been reverted, or discouraged. wikimedia needs to be far more careful on this subject then they historically have been. However, i don't think that this particular lawsuit will hold water. Wikimedia is a not-for-profit, and the contributers are not affiliated with wikimedia in any business sense. Saying that wikimedia should be responsible for the actions of it's contributers is akin to saying that ISPs should be responsible for the content on rented webspace, or that telecom companies should be responsible for terrorists who make phone calls. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 02:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
:On a side note, i personally am against the practice of allowing anonymous users post anything at will. I know that such a sentiment is against the general wiki-spirit of things, but i can't see any benefit to allowing anonymous users to post anything that their hearts desire. Further more, people should be legally responsible for the content that they do contribute. By disallowing anonymous posters, and making vandals legally responsible for their contributions, i think that would cut down on alot of the bullshit and nonsense that does happen. Either we should make the vandals responsible for their vandalism, or we have to drop that responsibility in the lap of the wikiemedia foundation itself.

== Do we need CheckUser? ==

Probably some of you have heard of [[m:CheckUser|CheckUser]] interface - allowing to find IP address of suspicious registered users. As you can see, we are having some cases of vandalism, there also were claims that people voting for BOTM or COTM were sockpuppets (not confirmed). Use of CheckUser is very restricted - only stewards have CheckUser rights on every project, and as you might know, it's not always easy to reach a steward. I think that we should have users with CheckUser rights, in order not to be dependant on stewards.

Choosing users with such rights will be similar to giving sysop rights, except that at least two users must have such rights (in able to control themselves). But before we can start discussion in [[WB:RFA]], we should decide whether we need ChecUser-s. What do you think? &lt;small&gt;(Preceding comment unsigned by [[User:Derbeth]])&lt;/small&gt;

:Yeah, I think it might be helpful to give access to a select few users, but I do not know how much it will need to be used. Over at WP, where this is much more needed, a very few of them currently have access to it, and there are a lot more of them than us. I don't know the necessity of this, quite yet. For votes and such, there should be some limit (say 30 edits) before their vote gets counted. That would rule out most socks. But when in doubt, I'd say [[WB:AGF|assume good faith]]. Just my 2 pennies. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:09, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

::I have stayed out of the whole Check User debate, but IMHO this is something that should be given to all admins.  I really don't understand the whole issue of &quot;privacy&quot; for a given user.  The Wikimedia Privacy policy clearly states that this information is available and can be used against somebody, like the current Siegenthaler case on Wikipedia, if they are caught saying something liabelous or illegal (like the notorious White Heritage Society Wikibook mentioned earlier, if the contributor was a German citizen).  This is merely another tool to help keep vandalism under control, and for some exceptionally rare circumstances can be used to identify sock puppets.  I have seen things like this on MUDs and IRC servers for decades (yes... decades) and if you are connected to the internet, there is no reason for your immediate connection to presume anonyminty unless you are specifically going through an anonymizer service.  Even then, your physical location could in theory still be traced, but you are relying on the policies of the anonymizer service to protect you at least for a brief period of time.  Only under the most exceptional circumstances could I see that this sort of feature could be abused, and the administrator vetting procedure alone IMHO is sufficient to keep this from going too far.&lt;p&gt;BTW, can a bureaucrat grant Check User status?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Upon further review of [[m:CheckUser Policy]], it seems as though Wikibooks will be a couple of years before we can even get the 30 or more active users to approve somebody for the CheckUser status, and it can only be granted by a Steward or Developer.  I really don't understand the privacy concerns here, but the only way I see the policy being changed is to run for the Wikimedia Foundation board with this issue as one of my platform planks.

And a standing offer to support any current admin on this project (baring any discussion for abuse where a vote for deadminship if it is currently occuring).  As for the requirement for two CheckUser privileges as a minimum, I think that is just simple paranoia from the group that wrote the CheckUser policy, not anything that came from actual experience (and a bad reason to write any rule of that nature).  The number of people with this &quot;privilege&quot; on all Wikimedia projects is appallingly small.  They aren't even giving this status to Stewards (although Stewards can give it to themself... if they can find a &quot;justification&quot;).  Since this option can also be given to non-admins, I would consider supporting other users here as well, but you would have to go through a vetting process that you might as well become an admin here too.  We could use the help even if done on a small scale.  Let's see if we can get the required 30 votes of support.

== Criticisms of Wikibooks ==

I thought that the Wikibooks community might be interested in this exchange I had with one of the early pioneers of e-book publishing, Ben Crowell.  I personally value his opinions considerably, perhaps even more than Jimbo's in many ways, and he does know how to organize collaborative e-book projects, with one GFDL'd Physics textbook he helped co-write that pre-dated Wikibooks by over three years.  You can read the full discussion at:

http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=170873&amp;cid=14234478

which is attached to an interview review that Jimbo gave earlier for Wikinews.

There are a number of interesting points brought up, including a very low S/N (signal to noise for non-techies) to be able to find a high quality Wikibook, and the quality of the stages icons.  I know there are many other areas of Wikibooks that need work, but some effort perhaps should be done to fix up the front page for those visitors who are perhaps not familiar with Wikimedia projects and editing styles.  I'm comfortable with Wikibooks, but I've been here for some time now.  The front page is the &quot;public personna&quot; of what we expect visitors to see.

His website, http://theassayer.org/ , is one that people on Wikibooks should also be aware of, as it lists free (as in speech as well as price) e-books, many of which can be used as resources for Wikibooks as well.  It may be wise to have some of the better quality Wikibooks be reviewed there as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:With en.wikipedia (if not other languages as well), it can be generally assumed that if one user starts an artical, other users will quickly come in and add to it. There are enough users on wikipedia, that you can assume that each given area of expertise can be well covered by contributers. Unfortunately for wikibooks, there simply aren't enough contributers to get any new project up and running (to a reasonable degree of completion) in any amount of time. Some books are started, but there aren't enough knowledgable contributers to complete it. Once a book has been dropped to the bottom of barrel, it is unlikely that potential contributers in the future will be able to find it, and they won't be able to coherently figure out what previous contributers had in mind. Textbooks require much more planning then a single encyclopedia artical, and it can be very difficult coming in the middle of the creation of the book. I know that I spend a good amount of time planning each new book I introduce, although i don't always leave enough notes around to aid future contributers in my absence. It's just a fact of life that we will need to deal with here until our numbers get larger. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 04:49, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::Wikipedia is an abnormally large project.

::But even when comparing Wikibooks to [[Wiktionary:Main Page|Wiktionary]], for example, many users (including myself) contribute to the Wiktionary, but few users contribute to any Wikibook (except very large books like [[Cookbook]]). Wikibooks is split into many individual books. Sometimes I work on one book, then switch to another book (or to Wiktionary or some other wiki), and when I come back, no one has edited the first book except for me and the anonymous IP that fixed the spelling and grammar.

::Wikibooks also includes many abandoned stubs and incomplete books, which are only useful when some Wikibookian comes and restarts work on them, as I sometimes do.

::Some users confuse Wikibooks or Wikisource with a project like Wiktionary. [[MeatBall:AccidentalLinking|AccidentalLinking]] (just putting brackets around words that you like) fails here when it succeeds at Wiktionary. In fact, sometimes I change red links into Wikipedia interwiki links. When I have time, I would like to work on the Wikibooks FAQ at [[WB:FAQ]] and explain some of this. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::That's exactly the problem. When you walk away from a particular book, and come back to it, nothing substantial will have changed. I would say that our ratio of Active Contributers-Per-Book is incredibly low. I know that I personally am the primary contributer to 6 books. Most contributions to those books by other people are usually (but not always) limited to simple fixes. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 15:46, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

:::I really think we need a better method of either

:::1)Getting contributors together to coauthor books.  Books with 1 author stall easily, books with 3 or 4 authors have peer pressure working for them.  It might be a good idea to push people to get at least 1 co-author before starting a book.
:::2)Groups of people willing to move from book to book within a subject, improving one at a time.  THis way books get concentrated resources for a while.  Probably best done within bookshelves (a math group, a CS group, etc).  Anyone else interested?

:::I agree, we have way too few editors/book on most books.  I've written the differential equations wikibook, and other than a few typos corrected, I have had 1 correction and a short intoduction to the idea of a solution added.  Thats it.  No example problems, no content additions, nothing.  Its currently stalled since I moved in September, due to my lack of time.  Unless my life changes again, or hell freezes over and someone else contributes to it, it will likely stay that way for another year at least.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 18:32, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

http://theassayer.org/ now links to http://www.lightandmatter.com/article/infrastructure.html where Ben Crowell discusses infrastructure for free textbooks, including Wikibooks....

I would have to check the text of the [[GFDL]] and CC-BY-SA again, but I believe that images at Wikimedia Commons which use these licenses are not restricted to only free textbooks as Ben Crowell claims. Instead, a free image may be aggregated to a non-free book. I can also put a CC-BY-SA image on a GFDL wiki page, even though the two licenses are incompatible. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:39, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

== Hijacking a Bookshelf ==

Hello, my name is Paul, and I've been looking around Wikibooks for a few months, but haven't really contributed anything. I have a great interest in adding things to the economics bookshelf and changing the way it looks, but I can't seem to find any activity on the whole bookshelf. Should I just start making changes, or is this rude? Thanks, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 04:51, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:I was able to make lots of edits to [[Wikibooks:Computer software bookshelf|Computer software bookshelf]]. I had posted proposals at the [[Wikibooks talk:Computer software bookshelf|talk page]] with almost no response. It seems that the best choice is to just start making changes. It should not be &quot;rude&quot; because other users are free to make their own edits improving the bookshelf, and to revert bad changes.

:However, your idea of ''adding things to the bookshelf'' gave me attention. Note that bookshelves, in general, only hold existing books (the top-level Wikibooks modules, see [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]). So if you were planning to add many red links for proposed books, put red links at [[Wikibooks:Requested Wikibooks]] instead of a bookshelf. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:31, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 04:38, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

:The problem was that it was a double-redirect:{{bad link|Wikibooks:Ask the school librarian}} redirected to {{bad link|Study help desk}} which redirected to [[Wikibooks:Study help desk]].

::That's me. And those two are named bureaucrats in the admin section.

::I havn't seen any seriously delayed actions that require specific action by a bureaucrat so far.  If there needs to be some action in that regard, it may be time to start the nomination process of a new bureaucrat... there are plenty of admins now that finding an admin who is doing a good job might be reasonable to &quot;promote&quot;, so to say.

::::I'm also wondering if perhaps we need to have a formal page for name change requests?  I don't know of any, and the usual forum so far is to simply ask a bureaucrat directly on their user talk page.  This shouldn't be a huge issue, but it is something that with multiple bureaucrats could become harder to deal with, and we should have a central place to put stuff like that.&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you compare Wikibooks to Wikipedia, yeah, we are as dead as your mother's web page.

== {{bad link|Qrai}} ==

The only two references to &quot;Qrai&quot; that I can find are the {{bad link|Qrai}} module at Wikibooks and http://www.geocities.com/qrai_dreamer/ at a free web host. It seems to me that one document is a derivative work of the other, which makes it either a copyright violation or an original work (candidate for speedy deletion). See my post at [[Talk:Qrai#Copyright violation]] where I explained my {{tl|copyvio}} tag on the [[Qrai]] page.

Recently, anonymous users edited the {{bad link|Qrai}} page and removed my {{tl|copyvio}} tag. One anonymous user (posting as an IP address but signing as [[Special:Contributions/David|&quot;User:David&quot;]], which is a user that never contributed to Wikibooks) posted to {{bad link|Talk:Qrai}}, claiming that these edits resolved the copyright-violation problem.

I would like someone other than me to examine the {{bad link|Qrai}} page and determine whether we have a [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]] license for the page and whether this page can remain at Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:22, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== We have Cookbook namespace ==

hashad has just informed me at the IRC channel that Cookbook namespace had been created. You can browse it here: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=&amp;namespace=102].

I'm not sure what for do we need such namespace, but have fun :) --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

----
I'm not sure how much time it takes to create one, but it might not be a bad idea for an admin or someone with a lot of knowledge of Wikibooks' structure to request that several namespaces be created to house bookshelves (such as a &quot;Programming&quot; namespace be created, etc.). It wouldn't be a bad idea in my opinion to add this to help organization. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 00:40, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, the current trend in [[Wikibooks:naming policy|naming policy]] is to ''not'' put books in bookshelf namespaces. For example, [[Programming:Ada]] changed its name to [[Ada Programming]]. The bookshelves themselves live in the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; project namespace. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:03, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Creating additional namespaces requires that a developer alter the configuration of the MediaWiki software.  We can do without creating any further new namespaces.  Stick to the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]] and use sub-pages.  It's simple, and it doesn't require developer intervention for every single module.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 13:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

: A Bookshelf namespace might make sense (Bookshelf:Computer science), in the same way of Portal: namespace in Wikipedia.

:: Indeed. A look on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistat] and you see that Cookbook is our largest book.

==Textbook layout==
I've been looking across the site but haven't found a page that includes any sort of suggested layout/template/design for a Wikibook. Most Wikibooks do have a slight resemblance with each other, but many features vary e.g. some have a title page, a contents page and an inroduction page; some have these three all on one page. Is there any sort of suggested layout at all? 
----

No, there's no strict policy about it. Book authors are free to decide if a book should contain a title page or not, how to make navigation in the book etc. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:25, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Personaly, I think that having at least standard navigation buttons would be an advantage (at least a nextpage/nextchapter button).  I dont know how many times I've been reading a book and lost the ability to go to the next chapter.  You shouldn't have to be using the browser &quot;back&quot; buttons to get back to a table of contents to get anywhere. - Jason

It would be a good idea to have a standard navigation method but it should be optional, not compulsory.  It would be especially useful to have a standardized way of tagging pages so that single page books could be automatically created for printing (and converting to PDF, PostScript, etc.). --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:10, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

== Think free. Learn free. ==

Is there any chance of having this slogan changed to ''Think freely. Learn freely.''? Using adjectives when you mean to use adverbs is non-standard English, silly, wrong and annoys me no end. --[[User:Mooquackwooftweetmeow|Greg K Nicholson]] 17:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

:The &quot;slogan&quot; that is used in the logo was simply something that was established to help give an initial start to the project.  The Wikibooks logo certainly hasn't had the kind of attention that the Wikipedia logo recieved, and the slogan on the bottom IMHO is irrelvant as well.  There were a bunch of logos that were proposed back at the beginning of the project, but perhaps it is time to make it more up-to-date in terms of what we are doing here right now.  Mind you, designing a logo is not a trivial task, and can take a whole log of time and arguments back and forth over what it should look like.  Do you have any other suggestions?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:57, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== Beginner's Guide to Wikibooks==

To me, the links on the main page and community portal and recent changes are all helpful, but when I first started looking around Wikibooks, I didn’t really pay attention to all the links. I didn’t know what was more important to read, in what order I should read it, or where to find answers to questions without having to ask them. I propose a Beginner’s Guide to Wikibooks, that will do the following:

*Explain every link in “navigation” and “toolbox” in the sidebar
*Explain the difference between enforced policies, proposed policies, and guidelines
*Explain the use of templates and categories
*Explain different places to ask different questions (staff lounge, talk pages, IRC, study help desk)
*”What Can I Do?” Links to pages involving active discussion (vfd, NPOV and accuracy disputes) and explanations on how to do small editing jobs (double redirects, orphaned pages, stubs, naming policy)

Perhaps the help files already available just need to be revised, or they need to be put in better order, but I think that a Beginner’s Guide to Wikibooks could really draw more people into the community- I know that everyone I tell right now feels overwhelmed. Let me know what you think, and if you’d like to help me write this book, leave me a message on my talk page. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 20:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

* I think that that could be a useful tool. I might like to work on something like that. (I know this isn't your talk page, but I hope you see this anyway.) --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:42, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
* The [[Help:Contents|help]] already has all of those. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 03:48, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
* Yes, the way that Wikibooks introduces itself is a mess. My idea is to improve the [[Wikibooks:FAQ]], but I have not started work on that yet. Do look at [[Help:Contents]] as Uncle G suggested; it links to several useful pages. We do have several important rules in the policy [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]; we only allow certain types of books. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:23, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

== Centralized development status proposal ==

I have a proposal for centralizing the development stages of books inspired by the current usage in Spanish Wikibooks. See [[User:ManuelGR/Centralized development status proposal]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 21:00, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

That's a really good idea, but is it not a problem to create so many templates? [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 22:12, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

:I don't know. In Spanish Wikibooks we use the main namespace for /Development pages and we haven't experienced any problem. Does it change anything in using the template namespace?  I think it doesn't because the transclusion is still made. Is it a performance penalty for the server for using transclusion? I don't know, but I think the maintainability would be greatly improved. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:12, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

Good idea! [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 16:27, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

----
Since you mentioned the development stages, I will mention that our current status images - [[File:00%.svg]] [[image:25%.png]] [[image:50%.png]] [[image:75%.png]] [[File:100%.svg]] - are copyright violations. These images violate policy at [[Special:Upload]] which requires that all images have copyright tags. Normally, one would put [[Template:image copyright]] on the talk page of the uploading user.

I was hoping to tag the images with {{tl|no license}}, because I thought that someone would know the correct license and replace it with the correct tag. But the image descriptions seem to be protected against vandalism, so I cannot add the tag. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:34, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

:All of these images are not copyright violations... they were created and uploaded by Karl Wick.  Commons has them listed as being released under the GFDL.  See [[commons:Wikibooks book development]] for more details.  Perhaps the images here on Wikibooks should be deleted instead so the images are drawn directly from commons?  BTW, the reason they are protected is because of their widespread use and the fact that vandals have overwritten these images in the past with... well... unsavory images instead that showed up all over Wikibooks simultaneously.  These images will need to be protected on commons if we draw from there instead. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:25, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for adding the {{tl|GFDL}} tags. I thought that someone would know the correct license. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:51, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== Law Issues ==
I think that perhaps wikibooks dealing with Law should have a tag at the top, saying perhaps something along the lines of &quot;This information is not a substitute for legal advice. If you have a legal problem you should consult a lawyer for specific legal advice. Do not wait since there may be a deadline which affects your legal claim. If you need immediate legal advice involving political opression, or other free speech violations, contact your local American Civil Liberties Union.&quot;  Just a bit of thought, for the author and webmaster's protection. [[User:CaladSigilon|CaladSigilon]] 15:24, 23 December 2005 (UTC)
:So be '''bold''' and do it. It seems like a reasonable addition. However, some will have a problem with the ACLU bit. I would support something like &quot;This information is not a substitute for legal advice. If you have a legal problem you should consult a lawyer for specific legal advice. Do not wait since there may be a deadline which affects your legal claim.&quot; That way there is a warning, but not an advertisment for a specific organisation. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:48, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

==Strange pattern of vandalism suggesting that commercial script has targeted page==

One wikibook discussion page that happens to be on my watchlist is being scrubbed and replaced by a commercial link every few days. History [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wikimania05/DEV&amp;action=history here]. DNS lookup shows that the IPs attacking the page come from all over the map--Madison, Ann Arbor, Hicksville ... Typically, each IP is making its first edit with this vandalism.

:IMHO this is a page (the Wikimainia page and related ones) that should never have been on Wikibooks in the first place, precisely for the reasons you are mentioning.  The policy wasn't all that clear in the past, but after a considerable amount of discussion we have made it abundantly clear (with general concensus from people on other Wikimedia projects as well, not to metion the Foundation board itself) that Wikibooks is not to be a seed wiki for new Wikimedia projects.  What really needs to happen here is a trans-wiki of this page to Meta and a complete deletion of all the content... perhaps even a deletion/protection from recreation as well.  Any takers on trying to do the transwiki? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:13, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

== References and footnotes? ==

I'm working on a stuttering therapy book. I have a couple hundred references, myself to studies in peer-reviewed journals. What's the best way to put in the references?

''unsigned comment by [[Special:Contributions/Tdkehoe|Tdkehoe]] at 00:06, 29 December 2005''

:For footnotes, try using the &quot;ref&quot; and &quot;note&quot; templates as explained at [[Wikibooks:Template_messages/General#Footnotes]]. For example, if I write &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ref|gnu}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; it makes a number.{{ref|gnu}}

Thanks, works great! I added a section about this to the &quot;Manual of Style.&quot;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 22:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

== Hide table of contents? ==

Is there a way to permanently hide the table of contents on a page? I have a page with many headings, each with a short paragraph of text. The reader can see the contents at a glance, no need for the TOC.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 23:00, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

: Sure.  Put &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the top of the page. [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:14, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, that worked.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 00:32, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== [[In Memoriam: September 11, 2001]] ==

I am adding a link to '''[[MetaWikipedia:Meta:Requests for deletion#Sept11 Memorial Wiki]]''' to this staff lounge. It is a request to delete the http://sep11.wikipedia.org/ wiki. Because the request suggests moving pages to Wikibooks, and because we already have a page [[In Memoriam: September 11, 2001]], this discussion concerns English Wikibooks. I invite Wikibookians to participate in the discussion. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:03, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== Linking to subsection in a page? ==

&quot;How do I make links?&quot; explains how to make links to pages, but it doesn't say how to make links to a subsection of a page. In HTML I would put &lt;a name=&quot;MyTag&quot;&gt;Heading&lt;/a&gt;, then link with &lt;a href=&quot;#MyTag&quot;&gt;.

: &lt;nowiki&gt; [[the/whole/page/address#heading]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;. Section headers automatically create shortcuts. For example:

 &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Linking to subsection in a page?]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:[[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Linking to subsection in a page?]]
: See how it works? Usual stuff apply. &lt;nowiki&gt; [[blahblah#blah | blah]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would display &quot;blah&quot; in a link. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:04, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

----
You can make links to a subsection of the same page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[#name of subsection]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

If you link from one page to a subsection of a different page, the wiki software sometimes drops the subsection. For example, [[:fr:Project:Le Bistro#Livre d'humour]] links to the top of the page, not the &quot;Livre d'humour&quot; section. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:52, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== Navigational map for books ==

[[m:User:Nigelk]] has implemented an extension for structuring a set of pages in a book or slide-like manner, providing a TOC and previous-up-next links to pages. I think this extension would be useful to Wikibooks, so I invite all the contributors to discuss it: [[m:User:Nigelk/Nav]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:55, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Type 4''' is a casual format with two fundamental rules:
* Players may play spells for free (i.e., players have infinite mana)
* Each player may play only one spell per round(this serves as a limitation to balance the first rule)
Due to these two rules, the format is also known as &quot;Limited Infinity&quot;. Some players use additional rules, such as 'only rares and uncommons are allowed'.

Since the mana cost of spells is irrelevant, players can more freely use powerful rare cards in ways that would be impossible in &quot;normal&quot; Magic. This makes the gameplay very dynamic and exciting. Also it means that players can use cards that are normally &quot;unplayable&quot; due to prohibitively high mana costs, allowing players to utilise cards which are in low commercial demand. This makes the format quite cheap to get into; along with the &quot;high thrill&quot; gameplay, this has made the format quite popular.

Due to the nature of the format, many cards are banned - for example, a Fireball would instantly win the game, due to the players having infinite mana to pump into it. Also, there are many cards that are extremely weak in constructed Magic but extremely powerful in Type 4 - such as Vedalken Orrery, which allows the controller to play threats during other players' turns.

To prevent the format from becoming excessively overpowered, players' decks are usually drafted, rather than constructed. Often one player would construct a '''stack''' of approximately 200 cards, which is then distributed amongst the players using one of several drafting methods - eg [[Booster Draft]], Rochester Draft, or Winston Draft.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../First_Cocoa_program_-_Hello_World|Previous Page: First Cocoa program - Hello World]] | [[../Some_Cocoa_essential_principles|Next Page: Some Cocoa essential principles]]

In the last chapter, we were introduced to Objective-C, and used it to write the &quot;Hello World&quot; code in an object-oriented fashion that worked with Cocoa. Now we will learn more about Objective-C as a language, and why it has certain advantages. This isn't meant as a complete guide to Objective-C, more of an overview. There is another wikibook that goes into far more detail. The original goal of Objective-C was to create a language that is efficient and productive, while avoiding being overburdened with too many features that are often only of theoretical benefit. As a strict superset of C, this does mean that some of C's drawbacks remain in Objective-C, but on the other hand it makes it much faster to learn. Becoming an expert in C++, with its myriad of features, can take years. It's probably fair to say that this learning curve for C++ means that much C++ code is not written as perfectly as it could be. Mastering Objective-C, by contrast, is quite easy, so code quality can be higher at an earlier stage. That said, Objective-C doesn't provide other features which can reduce bugs, such as const (read only) objects, and so forth. (In Cocoa, read-only objects are established by design, for example NSString is read only, whereas NSMutableString is read/write).

We have already seen much of the basic Objective-C syntax. Object methods are accessed using the square bracket notation, and parameters are passed using colons and parameter names. Methods are just like functions in C, only the syntax of how they are called differs. This different syntax is required because we need to specify WHAT object we are referring to, and WHICH method we'd like it to carry out. The square brackets link these two pieces of information together. Other than that they are just like functions&amp;nbsp;— they can return an optional value, and take any number of parameters.

The body of a method is also just like a function. We start with the name of the method and its return type, then enclose the method's code in curly braces, just as in C. Within the code, we have seen that we can refer to the object itself using 'self'. This saves us from having to find out our own address, the compiler will handle all of that. Most objects we'll encounter are subclasses of other, already existing objects. In Cocoa, there is a generic base object class called NSObject, which contains a lot of useful functionality that most classes will wish to inherit. So in general we can be sure that every object has an ancestor object. We can refer to the most immediate ancestor object (called the ''superclass'' of the object) within any method body using the shorthand 'super'. This is like self, but refers to the immediate ancestor instead.  Super is most often used when you need to override a method in your current class with a method in the superclass.  Self is used much more often than super, but occasionally we'll need to use super.

We saw how IB helped us out last chapter by creating the skeletons for our custom view class for us. Every class consists of two parts&amp;nbsp;— the ''interface'' and the ''implementation''. Usually these are placed in separate files, the .h and the .m respectively. The idea of this two-part design is both to make managing your code easier, and to encourage you to hide implementation details. Remember, objects should be usable from external code without the internal details of how they work being exposed. If we endeavour to hide all of the internal parts from the outside world, we will encounter fewer bugs, because we have eliminated dependencies on those details. Thus the interface (.h) file is used to tell the world about your object's methods, and the implementation file contains the code that makes it work, but should be of no interest to the outside world. If you use external libraries, very often you'll simply not have access to the .m files&amp;nbsp;— only the .h files are available. This is true of Cocoa itself; you will do well to follow the same model.

&lt;pre&gt;
 @interface GCHelloView : NSView
 {
     /* data members go here */
 }

     /* methods go here */

 @end
&lt;/pre&gt;
Within the curly braces you can add ''data members'' (or just members) to the class. Data members are like variables that are owned by concrete instances of the object. Every separate instance has its own copy of the data members, and they can have independent values. Data members are used to store the actual values of the properties of the object.

Methods are just like function prototypes. They go after the data member section, but before the '@end' statement.  As in C++, they are required, but unlike C++, only those that are unique to the class are required&amp;nbsp;— overrides of superclass methods don't need to be written out again. This helps the user of the object focus on what is unique and interesting about this object, as opposed to its superclasses. In other words the implementation file is a strict delta or difference file from the superclass.

Let's add some data members and methods, as an example.
&lt;pre&gt;

 #import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;

 @interface GCHelloView : NSView
 {
	int		_age;
	int		_size;
	NSString*	_text;
 }	
	- (void)	setAge:(int) age;
	- (int)		age;
	- (void)	setText:(NSString*) text withSize:(int) size;
	- (NSString*)	text;

 @end
&lt;/pre&gt;

We have added three data members, an integer called _age, an integer called _size, and an NSString called _text. The leading underscores used here are just part of the name, they have no special meaning, but they can be quite handy. Within code you write to implement an object's methods, you can refer to the object's data members simply by naming them, as if they were variables local to that function. By using the underscore, you can tell at a glance that they are data members, and not local variables. Any similar convention you might care to use is a good idea&amp;nbsp;— getting confused between what is local, global or an object's data member is a recipe for bugs.

We also added four methods, setAge:, age, setText:withSize: and text. Remember, the colons are part of the method's name. Method names should follow this convention in Cocoa. Whenever you want to set a property, create a method called setProperty, and whenever you want to ask for that property, create a method whose name is the property. Some programmers might be tempted to call such a method getProperty&amp;nbsp;— don't do this! In Cocoa, this naming scheme is more than just a convention, it is used later to allow us to automatically read and write properties in all sorts of simple and elegant ways that are awkward or impossible in other programming languages.

Since 'age' is just an integer, couldn't we just refer to it from elsewhere without having to go through all the overhead of calling a method? Yes we could, but we'd be breaking the rule about hiding the implementation. Suppose at a later stage you decided that this object should calculate the age by counting tree rings, instead of simply storing it. If external code was peeking at the integer, it would stop working when we changed the code within the age method so it counted tree rings. So never, never peek at data members from outside of an object. Even within the object, we should usually call our own methods to read our data member's values, since again, if later we change the way it works, we can minimise the number of places that need to be changed by making sure that there is only one main place that deals with that value.

Note how we declare a method's parameter types. We put the type in parentheses following the colon. We can also, as here, nominate a variable name for the parameter, though as in C this is optional. However, since the parameter name is built into the method, leaving it out doesn't leave us with an undocumented mystery, as it does in C. In other words:

 - (void)   setText:(NSString*) withSize:(int);

gives us all we need to know about what the method does, leaving no mystery. We have the names of the parameters (text and size) and their types (NSString* and int). For contrast, in C you might have had something like:

 void  setText( NSString*, int );

What is the second parameter? Unless the programmer used a more descriptive name or added a comment to tell us, we can't tell.

The return types of the method are also indicated using the same bracket notation. In addition, the leading '-' is important&amp;nbsp;— this tells us that this is an ''instance method'', one that pertains to a particular instance of an object. If we wanted to declare a class method, we would use a '+' symbol instead. This use of + and - allows us to tell at a glance which methods are which in the interface file. C++ by contrast uses the 'static' keyword for class methods.

Finally, notice that the interface ''imports'' the Cocoa/Cocoa.h file at the top. #import is just like #include, except that it automatically includes the file only one time, so you don't need to use any #define tricks to ensure it. Here we import Cocoa so that we get the interface for NSView, of which this is a subclass. At the very least, a class interface must somehow make details of its superclass known, though where you are subclassing a Cocoa object, using #import is best.

==Implementation==

The implementation of an object is placed in the .m file, and is declared like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &quot;GCHelloView.h&quot;

@implementation GCHelloView

- (id)		initWithFrame:(NSRect)frameRect
{
	if ((self = [super initWithFrame:frameRect]) != nil)
	{
		_text = @&quot;Hello World!&quot;;
		_size = 48;
		_age = 16;
	}
	return self;
}

- (void)		setAge:(int) age
{
	_age = age;
}

- (int)		age
{
	return _age;
}


- (void)		setText:(NSString*) text withSize:(int) size
{
	[text retain];
	[_text release];
	_text = text;
	_size = size;
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
}


- (NSString*)	text
{
	return _text;
}

- (void)		drawRect:(NSRect)rect
{
	NSPoint					p;
	NSMutableDictionary*	        attribs;
	NSColor*				        c;
	NSFont*					fnt;
	
	p = NSMakePoint( 10, 100 );
	
	attribs = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
	c = [NSColor redColor];
	fnt = [NSFont fontWithName:@&quot;Times Roman&quot; size:_size];
	
	[attribs setObject:c forKey:NSForegroundColorAttributeName];
	[attribs setObject:fnt forKey:NSFontAttributeName];
	
	[[self text] drawAtPoint:p withAttributes:attribs];
	
	[[NSColor blueColor] set];
	NSFrameRect([self bounds]);
}

@end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The implementation of an object is everything between '@implementation' and '@end'. The methods are coded just as a C function. Here we have our unique methods, setText:withSize: and so on, and also a couple of methods that we inherited from our superclass, initWithFrame: and drawRect: These last two don't appear in our interface file, as they are not a unique feature of this class. To override them, we simply redefine the methods in the implementation.

The setAge: and age methods should be fairly obvious&amp;nbsp;— the values are simply assigned to the data member _age, or return its value. Many methods that simply read and write properties of an Objective-C object are like this&amp;nbsp;— short and simple. It can get a bit tedious to write these all out if you have many properties, but don't be tempted to avoid this, because hiding the implementation is much more important in the long run.

The setText:withSize: method is a little more complex, since we need to retain and release objects. We'll be covering this in detail in the next chapter, so don't worry about it for now. However, this is required most times that you are using objects as properties of other objects, which will happen a lot. Simple values such as the int '_size' can just use simple assignments. The last line, [self setNeedsDisplay:YES] is an example of calling one of your own methods. Here, we use the method setNeedsDisplay which is inherited from NSView. This signals to Cocoa that the view content has changed and should be redrawn. Cocoa makes a note of that and will cause our drawRect: method to get called in due course, so anyone who makes use of the setText:withSize: method of our view will see those new settings appear immediately.

The initWithFrame: method also sets these various data members to some default values, so that the object will work even if nobody ever comes along and sets the text, its size, etc. Every object has an 'init' method whose purpose is to establish the object's default properties so that it will function properly right out of the box. Sometimes, objects will need parameters sent to the init method, so a different version of an init method is needed, as the way initWithFrame: was coded.  Note that the init method's first job is to call the superclass's initWithFrame: method. This happens all the way back up the chain of ancestor classes until everyone has initialized what it knows about. So there are two main rules to follow when writing your init method:

* call your super's init method
* initialize only what you know about (your own data members only)

The init method must return 'self' as its result, provided that the super's initialization succeeded. If not, it will return nil and so should you. If your own initialization fails, but your super's succeeded, you should return nil also. This indicates to the caller that something went wrong while making your object. More about this later.

==Some Objective-C advantages==

Like C++ and other object-oriented languages, Objective-C supports ''polymorphism''. This means two different things. In the first place, it means that you can have different methods that differ only according to their parameter types, and the correct one will be called according to what you're passing. This is static polymorphism, so in C++:

 void setAge( int );
 void setAge( float );

are two distinct methods. The right one is called depending on whether you pass an int or a float. While handy, this can get confusing, especially when automatic type conversion is taking place, as it frequently does between simple scalar values. Objective-C doesn't support this type of potentially ambiguous polymorphism. Instead, because parameters are an inherent part of a method's name, you can make it much clearer, e.g:

 - (void) setAgeWithInt:(int);
 - (void) setAgeWithFloat:(float);

There is no ambiguity, since you have to name which one you mean explicitly. This might reduce the potential for bugs for some people, though C++ programmers might grumble.

The second kind of polymorphism is ''dynamic polymorphism''. We have already seen this in action in our simple program. When Cocoa calls the view's drawRect: method, it actually doesn't have a clue that the object in question is a GCHelloView, and not a plain vanilla NSView. It calls our object ''as if it were'' an NSView. The method call resolves to our custom object however, and so our code gets called, allowing it to do its thing. All object-oriented languages need to support this kind of polymorphism, so the fact that Objective-C does too is no surprise.

What is different is that Objective-C resolves the method at runtime. This is in contrast to languages such as C++ that resolve everything at compile time, building a set of fixed tables that allow this apparent magic to occur. For the typical case, this runtime ''binding'' makes no difference. However, there are other cases where the runtime binding makes a huge difference, and this adds a degree of power to Objective-C that is absent from C++ and others. It safely allows us to use ''anonymous'' objects, and even null objects. It allows us to create a delayed method call called an ''invocation'' that can be used later, and it permits things like Undo to be implemented much more easily. It greatly helps us create a graphical user interface for our code, because commands, actions and so on of various window controls can be made extremely general. It also permits something called &quot;Key-value observing&quot; and &quot;key paths&quot; which are incredibly powerful&amp;nbsp;— more on these later.

Let's suppose we have an object that must respond to a click on a button in a window. Really, the button shouldn't need to care which sort of object it is controlling, only that when it is clicked, it should do something. Let's suppose a method exists called 'action:', and the button knows that it should call this on an object called 'target' when clicked. In a traditional language, the target object's type must be known to the button, so that it can determine if a method called action: really exists. Once that type is indicated to the button, it can only ever deal with objects of that type, or their subclasses. However, in Objective-C, we could hook up totally unrelated objects to the button, and as long as they implemented action:, they would respond to the button. This is a great improvement in flexibility. Many GUI elements such as buttons and menus use this type of target/action approach.

An 'anonymous' object has a type of 'id'. Anywhere you see 'id' used as an object type, an anonymous object reference is created. 'id' can stand in for any type of object whatsoever.

In Objective-C, the value ''nil'' has a type of id. This means that nil is an object! (NULL, meaning nothing, is still available) In other languages, especially C and C++, we must be careful not to use an object reference of nil, meaning we have to litter our code with lots of checks, like:

 if ( object != nil )
     object-&gt;action();

In Objective-C, we don't need to bother. Calling a nil object's methods is harmless, because of the runtime binding of the method call. Of course the action won't do anything, but it won't crash.

Another example. Let's suppose we want to invoke a periodic action on one of our objects. Cocoa has a handy class for setting up periodic actions, NSTimer. One day we might want our 'GCWidget' class to have its 'dwim' method called once a minute, another time we have an unrelated HPSprocket class that needs its 'fubar' method called every 5 seconds. In a traditional language, both of these classes would have to inherit from a common class known to NSTimer, and in addition the periodic method would have to have the exact same name. But because of the runtime binding and anonymous objects, NSTimer simply needs to be told the method name to  call, and call it on an object type of 'id'. If the object implements the method, it does its thing. If not, nothing bad happens.

Objective-C implements the runtime binding using a mechanism called a ''selector''. This helps make the process a lot more efficient&amp;nbsp;— as you might imagine if a method lookup really had to go through and compare the actual names of the methods letter by letter it would be very slow. Instead, at compile time Objective-C converts every method name into a simple unique number which is much faster to lookup. There is still a cost compared to C++'s approach, but the benefits are worth it. In practice, a method call in Objective-C is probably only about 2 or 3 times slower than a C++ method call.

We can obtain the selector for a method using the '@selector( ... )' function. Sometimes we need to do this when we are setting up targets and actions, as in our timer example above.

We have already seen the basics of Cocoa in action. Last chapter, we talked about inheriting from NSObject, and how we must make sure that we call an object's chain of init methods. Here, we'll go into more detail about this, as it's important. Then, we'll talk about memory management.

==Creation==

Initialising an object properly is your responsibility. Unlike C++, there is no automatic ''constructor'' method, nor an automatic ''destructor'' method. However, we can easily do without these as long as we are aware of a few simple rules. Following the rules is necessary for success in Cocoa.

When we instantiate an object:

 id   myObject = [NSString alloc];

All we get back is a blob of uninitialised memory. If we were to use this object now, we'd be very unlikely to get the results we wanted. It could even crash. We MUST call the initialiser method:

 id   myObject = [[NSString alloc] init];

Then we'll be OK. You'll see this alloc/init combination all the time. So why doesn't alloc simply call init as part of its internals and be done with it? Wouldn't that save us the time and reduce the chance of forgetting? Yes, except for one problem. Sometimes we need a different version of init, that requires a parameter. Since alloc can't know which one we'd like, it leaves the call to us.

Every object has a version of init that acts as the 'master' init - the one we must call when we make that object. Things are arranged so that any other variations of init call it, so everything works properly. The master init method is called the ''designated initialiser''. In most cases this will be the vanilla 'init' method, so using any of the other variants will call init internally. Where this isn't the case, the documentation should indicate the designated initialiser.

'init' is just an ordinary method call, it has no special status like a C++ constructor. Thus it's your responsibility to write the code in init correctly, making sure you call your super's designated initialiser (or any of its initialiser methods that eventually call through the designated initialiser) first. Once you've done that, you should initialise your own part of the object.

Initialisation is permitted to fail. Your object might want to allocate a large block of memory for example. If there is no memory available, you should cleanup anything you've allocated already, then return nil from your init method. Since nil objects can be called safely, it means that running out of memory (for example) will not crash the program.

==Destruction==

When an object is no longer required, its 'dealloc' method will be called. If you allocated anything as part of your initialisation, or operation of your object, you need to override this method and deallocate it. Once done, you should call the super's dealloc method. You will be frequently overriding dealloc, so become familiar with doing it. However, dealloc is rarely called directly. Instead, it is called indirectly when an object is released.

==Retain and Release==

Every object that inherits from NSObject implements retain and release. This is a simple memory management technique that relies on ''reference counting''. An object keeps track of how many references there are to it within the program. When there are no more references, the count is zero and it is deallocated. In Cocoa, the reference count is often referred to as the ''retain count''. It's the same thing.

The retain method increments the count, and the release method decrements it. When the count reaches zero, dealloc is called automatically.

When an object is first created, its retain count is set to 1. Thus:

 id  myObject = [[NSString alloc] init];

'myObject' has a retain count of 1, because there is only one reference to it.

If we then do:

 [myObject release];

It will be immediately deallocated, because the count is decremented from 1 to 0, and dealloc gets called. By calling release, we are telling Cocoa we are no longer interested in this object here, and will not refer to it further.

Some people find retain and release confusing, but the rules are really quite simple. If you create an object, you are responsible for releasing it. If you create a new reference to an existing object, you are responsible for releasing it. You create an object using either alloc, or copy on another object, so any time you use these, you need to be aware of the retain/release responsibility. It is yours. If you forget to release, things will probably work out, but you have a ''memory leak'', which can cause problems down the track.

Let's look at the second part, creating a second reference. Suppose you have an object which is part of another object. We saw this in our earlier example, where our GCHelloView had an NSString as a data member. When we are passed an NSString from outside, we don't know who made it, who is responsible for it - we only know it's not us! However, by storing it as a data member, we are creating a new reference to that same string, so we must retain it. What about any previous string that we had there? Well, we created a reference to it, so we must release it.

 &lt;pre&gt;
 - (void)		setText:(NSString*) text withSize:(int) size
 {
	[text retain];
	[_text release];
	_text = text;
	_size = size;
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

So now we can see what's going on here. We retain 'text' because we are creating a new reference to it, our _text data member, and we are releasing the previous value as we are no longer concerned with it. We don't care where the string came from originally or who made it, we are done with it, so we release it. If someone else is still retaining it, it will continue to exist, but if not, it will be deallocated. Now, what if 'text' and '_text' are in fact the same string? This can easily happen. If we release the old one first, it might get deallocated. The following retain will be acting on a stale reference, which is likely to crash (note, unlike the case of accessing nil, accessing a deallocated object is unsafe). Thus by retaining before we release, we avoid that potential snag. &quot;retain before release&quot; is a common and sensible approach.

Note that the retention of objects is efficient, because only a simple count needs to be incremented. If you were required to make a copy of every object, not only would it be much slower, but you'd have the potential for different copies to get out of step with each other, as well as using up much more memory than necessary.

==Autorelease==

What happens when we make an object, but we want to hand it over to someone else? How can we ensure that it stays valid long enough to be retained by the other object, before we release it? Look at this:

 id myObject = [[NSString alloc] init];
 return myObject;

Does the receiver know that this object needs to be released? If no-one releases this object, then we have a memory leak. To eliminate the burden of releasing, we want to mark it for release, when the receiver has done with it. Autorelease designates the object to be released later, it says 'retain the object until the next memory pool is drained'. If you are not explicitly draining the pool, then you can be assured it the return value will remain for use in the receiver's immediate scope.

 id myObject = [[[NSString alloc] init] autorelease];
 return myObject;

This code is OK, since the returned object is valid, but responsibility for ownership has been passed to the pool.

When control returns to the main event loop, the pool can be sure that any objects that have an interest in the object will have retained it by then, and so it releases all of the objects it has. Any that have no references will be deleted, any that do have references will become owned by the objects retaining them. Everything remains neat and tidy.

Most factory methods return autoreleased objects. This is entirely sensible, and if you write a factory method, you should do the same. For example:

 NSColor* red = [NSColor redColor];

NSColor's redColor class method return an autoreleased colour object. If you want to keep this object, you should retain it. If you just want to use it for a few lines, then you don't need to do anything - it will get deleted automatically later, but only after you've finished.

In practice, retain, release and autorelease are straightforward. Some people seem to find it confusing but perhaps they think it's more complicated than it is. To keep an object you're given, retain it. Objects you make are already retained.  To throw it away and refer to it no more, release it. If you write a factory method, autorelease it. If you are simply making use of an object returned by a factory method for a short while, do nothing.

==Object values==

What about when a property of your object is another object, and someone else wants to read that property? Should you retain, autorelease, what? No, you should do nothing. You are already retaining it as it's your property. If the caller wants to retain it, that's their business, and autorelease doesn't come into it because it's not a factory method. So simply return the object verbatim. So:

 - (NSString*) text
 {
    return _text;
 }

is absolutely correct.

Note that if the caller did retain it, you are still completely free to release it when you're done with it. What would be an error would be for the caller NOT to retain it if it wanted to use the value for an extended time (being a time longer than the current event). This is not a new rule - if the caller creates a reference to an object, it must retain it. But if all it needs to do is use that object for a short time, within a single function say, it can simply do so and not worry that it will get released by someone else.

==Event loops==

We have touched on the event loop without explaining what it is. In a Cocoa application, user activities result in ''events''. These might be mouse clicks or drags, typing on the keyboard, choosing a menu item, and so on. Other events can be generated automatically, for example a timer firing periodically, or something coming in over the network. For each event, Cocoa expects there to be an object or group of objects ready to handle that event appropriately. The event loop is where such events are detected and routed off to the appropriate place. Whenever Cocoa is not doing anything else, it is sitting in the event loop waiting for an event to arrive. (In fact, Cocoa doesn't poll for events as suggested, but instead its main thread goes to sleep. When an event arrives, the OS wakes up the thread and event processing resumes. This is much more efficient than polling and allows other applications to run more smoothly).

Each event is handled as an individual thing, then the event loop gets the next event, and so on. If an event causes an update to be required, this is checked at the end of the event and if needed, and window refreshes are carried out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Situation: I teach 8th language arts and have had a difficult time reaching some of the students, especially in my 5th period. In this class, I have many students who are below grade level. One particular student, Mandy, refuses to write or read anything I give her. &quot;Miss, why do I have to read this anyway?&quot; I try to explain to her that it is required for the 8th grade and that she might finding it interesting if she gave it a chance. She just brushes me off. When I assign writing projects, she would rather take a zero instead. I know that she has potential; she seems very bright. I just don't know how to reach her. --New Teacher (sample)


Response #1: Relevant Reading Materials You have tough situation on your hands. As a teacher of Language Arts myself, I find that students who refuse to read or write usually feel that the stuff we assign them is boring. (Granted after reading it over and over for the last couple of years, I might agree!) One way I work around this is to bring popular trade books or magazines. At the beginning of the year, I give all my students an interest survey, which helps me get ideas about their hobbies and what topics they like. Then, I visit with the librarian to see what materials we might have available. Sometimes, I build my own library of interesting materials by going to yard sales. I hope this helps. --Miss. Carter, Central Middle School, Texas (sample)

Response #2: Success Builds on Success Having worked with at-risk students in my district for the last 5 years, I have discovered that students like Mandy oftentimes refuse to do work because they believe that they are not good in the subject. So, rather than try, they simply don't put forth the effort. This way if they fail, they can chalk it up to not caring. I would begin with small, simple reading passages or assignments. These assignments should have high interest value and incorporate higher thinking skills. If Mandy can complete these smaller assignments in class with success, she might begin to love her fear of failing and begin to see herself as successful. --Mr. Tweedmoore, Western Middle School, Alaska (sample)

***Note: This is just a sample page. I hope we can agree on the basic formatting. This makes it easier for the new teacher to navigate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When moving an RMI application over to Jini, the main issue is to stop [[Jini and Network Computing:Subclassing the UnicastRemoteObject class|subclassing UnicastRemoteObject]] and switch to [[Jini and Network Computing:Using Jini Exporters|using Jini Exporters]] instead.  

The RMI registry is replaced with [[Jini and Network Computing:The Jini Lookup Service|the Jini Lookup Service]] (referred to with LUS in many cases)).  The RMI registry is for local registration and remote lookup.  The Jini Lookup Service can be used from anywhere on the network that the appropriate routing is available.  The [[Jini and Network Computing:Jini Service Lookup Specification|Jini Service Lookup Specification]] provides for the use of multicast lookup which allows for come as you are computing to occur with no specific knowledge of the network.  Where multicast is not supported or routed, unicast lookup can be used with specific IP addresses/host names.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The classic specification of an RMI codebase is typically performed using the &lt;tt&gt;java.rmi.server.codebase&lt;/tt&gt; system property on the command line starting the Java Virtual Machine.  There are more powerful techniques that allow a single JVM to serve out remote objects with varied codebases.  This mechanism is through the codebase annotation service provider interface available through the [[Jini and Network Computing:java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSPI|RMIClassLoaderSPI]] abstract class.

One can simply subclass this class, providing the appropriate annotations that are appropriate for the classes in the getClassAnnotation(Class) call.  A container could allow the user to specify a codebase that is associated with a classpath that it could associate with a specific ClassLoader.  Then the implementation of RMIClassLoaderSPI would use the passed Class to find the appropriate ClassLoader that would then designate the codebase annotation that applied.

      <text xml:space="preserve">RMIClassLoaderSpi is the service provider interface for RMIClassLoader. It provides the ability for expanded control of the codebase annotation and unmarshalling control through the augmentation of the codebase.

One of the biggest items the community deals with is the rather strong silence from many commercial users.  They view Jini as a strategic decision that they do not want to publically discuss and/or expose.

This entire book makes absolutely no sense.  No offense, but I think this entire book hurts people more than making them want to learn. Perhaps the author is not English-native, however, that is no excuse for the constant mis-use of the English language.  Please edit/remove this book as soon as possible. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:67.150.6.135|67.150.6.135]] ([[User talk:67.150.6.135|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/67.150.6.135|contribs]]) 06:45, 18 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2--&gt;

Excuse me, but your comment is awfully negative and undermines the spirit of this website, not to mention it is just very rude.  I personally enjoyed this Wikibook very much and I think it could be very helpful to someone.  Yes, it is obvious that English is not the first language of this author.  I however, admire the courage it took for this person to write on a subject that is obviously very important to him, even though he is still struggling with the language.  Maybe, instead of making negative comments, someone like you could actually help the author out and edit some of this Wikibook, so that it may be more clear and coherent for others readers.  It is nay-sayers like you completely undermine the whole point of Wiki, and quite frankly, you make me sick.  Good day. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:12.47.73.242|12.47.73.242]] ([[User talk:12.47.73.242|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/12.47.73.242|contribs]]) 20:58, 18 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2--&gt;

== Message from Author ==

Well, not being harsh, it will take time for the completion of the book. So I'll slowly first put the main idea as to what to write. Then I'll try my best to make the English crystal clear as possible. You are most welcome to help. You can edit the module for now because it needs some attention. Then you can edit pages especially the ones which are provided by development stages mark.
Note:- If you are adding a &quot;Personal Note From Author&quot; or adding your preface please assign a signature with timestamp to know who worte what. &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] ([[User talk:Mastermind 007|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Mastermind 007|contribs]]) 10:41, 19 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2--&gt;

== Regarding: How To Become A Good Student ==

Actually, the idea for the book is a very intriguing one at best. It is important that students know how to become better students. I wish that you would only provide constructive criticism. I thank the author for starting this. I will be looking for several links to organizations and books that further educate students. I speak from personal experience because at the moment, I am a student. I'm involved with several organizations that deal with leadership, changing paradigms, and other community work. I would be happy to help you in my spare time with all that needs to be done.--Helius 16:46, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

== A Work For Some ==

Hello! Thank you for sending discussions. I'm the one who came up with the idea of this book, so if you have queries please respond to me. I would be delighted if you can help especially in the English grammar of this book. Please try an effort also to make this book with a good look. Hope you understand the motto of this book! Have a good day and enjoy reading this Wikibook. --[[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] 11:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== A Reminder ==

This is an important reminder of ones who are currently reading this book. This book is mostly for students in order to enlighten them for their future. Since it's for students, I've kept the data as brief and easy as I can. So, if you're editing a section or a part of this book, try to keep it small so that it would be easy for you as well as for other students to understand. Hope you enjoy this book!!! --[[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] 11:53, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== A Simple Request ==

Hello! Everybody. I think I've worked on this book as much as I can and I think it deserves either a &quot;Collaboration Of The Month&quot; or &quot;Book Of The Month&quot; award. Please support this book as much as possible. Have a good time! --[[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] 17:21, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== Failed Editing Attempts ==

It was my intention to spend this entire editing session fixing grammatical and communicational errors within this book. I quickly realized, however, that it is, as an editor, an extremely difficult book to approach, due, in large part, to the plentiful usage of first person point-of-view, and the constant basis on the author's personal experiences. This circumstance makes it difficult to both refine grammar and to add new advice and/or content beyond the author's own contributions. This is quite a shame given the author's obviously kind-hearted intentions. That is to say, it is unfortunate that such a book as this should suffer because of communicational barriers.

If the author is still interested in producing and developing this book, I would recommend to them that they take a day to revamp the book from a [[w:The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People|7 Habits of Highly Effective Adults/Teens/Etc.]] style, to a more neutral POV manual of advice, so that it may be more easily approached by outside editors. My email address can be found here if the author would like to discuss this with me personally: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Mitglied_von_die_Elektronischenzyklop%C3%A4die_Schriftleitung Wikipedia Email Service] --[[User:24.175.54.43|24.175.54.43]] 06:32, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== Major Revisions/Additions ==

D. I just wrote in a preface which described the importance and use of this page. I tried to explain the importance of this page as simply and as concisely as possible. If anyone can improve it or add additional information I would invite them to edit it. 

I just spent a fair bit of time on each of the chapters (except the last one, which is only a single paragraph at the moment) and I am quite happy with how things turned out. Overall the thing is still simply too difficult to read, but I intend on fixing this soon. Also, despite having covered the very basics, we need to spend time getting some more useful content into each of the chapters. I think the chapter on management is the most important one at the moment.

''Chapter 1: Motivation'' is fine at the moment, but nothing too special. ''Chapter 2: Concentration on studies'' has been improved nicely, but once again will need work later. ''Chapter 3: Behaviour'' is almost useless at the moment... I really can't see some guy reading that chapter and getting anything out of it. However, I do see potential in it. ''Chapter 4: Management'' is where I feel we should focus our energy. Putting things like 'how to keep a good study plan' would be invaluable in this book. ''Chapter 5: Helping Others And Advising''... I seriously think this would be one of the things that should be put at the very end of the book, as the book is about helping ''yourself'', not others. But if this book was fairly developed, then I would welcome it.

Well I'll see what I can do, but I know this could be a very good book if we work on it.
--[[User:Babij|Babij]] 08:31, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

Agreed. Needs major work before it can be considered complete. Plus - please get rid of the annoying and poorly designed logo at the top of the page. It's unnecessary.

I like this idea! thank you because you help mehow to bcome a good student.</text>

Yes, naming convention in this book is okay. Plese don't sign your name in book pages - authors should be mentioned once, in separate chapter (I see you already have one, that's fine).

You can add nice navigation to your book - see [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Navigation]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

I was poking through the [[Special:Lonelypages|ophaned pages]] and stumbled across [[Trouble With Mandy]].  I was about to put it up for [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] when I noticed it might belong to your [[Guide to First Year Teaching]].

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Acastro. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Acastro~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

In the following we will provide some notes on numerical optimization algorithms. As there are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_%28mathematics%29 numerous methods] out there, we will restrict ourselves to the so-called ''Gradient Methods''. There are basically two arguments why we consider this class as a natural starting point when thinking about numerical optimization algorithms. On the one hand, these methods are really workhorses in the field, so their frequent use in practice justifies their coverage here. On the other hand, this approach is highly intuitive in the sense that it somewhat follow naturally from the well-known [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point properties of optima]. In particular we will concentrate on three examples of this class: the ''Newtonian Method'', the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' and the class of ''Variable Metric Methods'', nesting amongst others the ''Quasi Newtonian Method''.

Before we start we will nevertheless stress that there does not seem to be a &quot;one and only&quot; algorithm but the performance of specific algorithms is always contingent on the specific problem to be solved. Therefore both experience and &quot;trial-and-error&quot; are very important in applied work. To clarify this point we will provide a couple of applications where the performance of different algorithms can be compared graphically. Furthermore a specific example on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood Maximum Likelihood Estimation] can be found at the end. Especially for statisticians and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics econometricians] the Maximum Likelihood Estimator is probably the most important example of having to rely on numerical optimization algorithms in practice.

==Theoretical Motivation==

Any numerical optimization algorithm has solve the problem of finding &quot;observable&quot; properties of the function such that the
computer program knows that a solution is reached. As we are dealing with problems of optimization two well-known results seem
to be sensible starting points for such properties. 

''If f is differentiable and &lt;math&gt;x^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a (local) minimum, then'' 

&lt;math&gt; (1a) \quad Df(x^\star) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''i.e. the Jacobian &lt;math&gt; D f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is equal to zero''

and

''If f is twice differentiable and &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; is a (local) minimum, then''

&lt;math&gt; (1b) \quad x^{T}D^2 f(x^\star)x \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''i.e. the Hessian &lt;math&gt; D^2 f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix pos. semidefinite].''

In the following we will always denote the minimum by &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt;. Although these two conditions seem to represent statements that help in finding the optimum &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt;, there is the little catch that they give the implications of &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; being an optimum for the function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;. But for our purposes we would need the opposite implication, i.e. finally we want to arrive at a statement of the form: &quot;If some condition &lt;math&gt; g(f(x^\star))&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; is a minimum&quot;. But the two conditions above are clearly not sufficient in achieving this (consider for example the case of &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^3 &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; Df(0) = D^2 f(0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; x^{\star} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;). Hence we have to look at an entire neighborhood of &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; as laid out in the following sufficient condition for detecting optima:


''If &lt;math&gt; Df(x^\star) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x^{T}D^2f(z)x \geq 0, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z \in \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta)&lt;/math&gt;, then: &lt;math&gt;x^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a local minimum.''

''Proof: For'' &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta) &lt;/math&gt; ''let'' &lt;math&gt; z=x^\star + t(x-x^\star) \in \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt;. ''The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem Taylor approximation] yields:'' &lt;math&gt; f(x) - f(x^\star) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(x-x^\star)^{T}D^2 f(z)(x-x^\star) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, ''where'' &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; ''denotes an open ball around'' &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B}(x^\star, \delta) = \{x : ||x - x^\star|| \leq \delta \} &lt;/math&gt; ''for'' &lt;math&gt; \delta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.


In contrast to the two conditions above, this condition is sufficient for detecting optima - consider the two trivial examples 

&lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^3 &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; Df(x^\star = 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; x^{T}D^2f(z)x = 6 z x^2 \not\geq 0 \quad (e.g. \,\,z = -\frac{\delta}{2})&lt;/math&gt; 

and 

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^4&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; Df(x^\star = 0) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{T}D^2f(z)x = 12 z^2 x^2 \geq 0 \quad \forall z&lt;/math&gt;.

Keeping this little caveat in mind we can now turn to the numerical optimization procedures.

== Numerical Solutions ==

All the following algorithms will rely on the following assumption:

''(A1) The set &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(0)}) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n | f(x) \leq f(x^{(0)})\}&lt;/math&gt; is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space compact]''

where &lt;math&gt; x^{(0)} &lt;/math&gt; is some given starting value for the algorithm. The significance of this assumption has to be seen in the ''Weierstrass Theorem'' which states that every compact set contains its ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremum supremum]'' and its ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum infimum]''. So ''(A1)'' ensures that there is some solution in &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(0)}) &lt;/math&gt;. And at this global minimum &lt;math&gt; x^\star &lt;/math&gt; it of course holds true that &lt;math&gt; D(f(x^\star)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. So - keeping the discussion above in mind - the optimization problem basically boils down to the question of solving set of equations &lt;math&gt; D(f(x^\star)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

=== The Direction of Descent === 

The problems with this approach are of course rather generically as &lt;math&gt; D(f(x^\star)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; does hold true for 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point maxima and saddle points] as well. Hence, good algorithms should ensure that both maxima and saddle points are ruled out as potential solutions. Maxima can be ruled out very easily by requiring &lt;math&gt; f(x^{(k+1)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt; i.e. we restrict ourselves to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence sequence] &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; such that the function value decreases in every step. The question is of course if this is always possible. Fortunately it is. The basic insight why this is the case is the following. When constructing the mapping &lt;math&gt; x^{(k+1)} = \varphi(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the rule how we get from &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;) we have two degrees of freedoms, namely

* the direction &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; and

* the step length &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence we can choose in which direction we want to move to arrive at &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' how far this movement has to be. So if we choose &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; in the &quot;right way&quot; we can effectively ensure that the function value decreases. The formal representation of this reasoning is provided in the following


''Lemma: If &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} \in \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Df(x)^{T}d^{(k)} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; then: &lt;math&gt;\exists \bar{\sigma} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
such that''

&lt;math&gt; f(x + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}) &lt; f(x) \quad \forall \sigma \in
(0,\bar{\sigma}) &lt;/math&gt;

''Proof: As &lt;math&gt;Df(x)^{T} d^{(k)} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Df(x)^{T} d^{(k)} = \lim_{\sigma \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}) - f(x)}{\sigma^{(k)}}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;f(x + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}) &lt; f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; small enough.''

=== The General Procedure of Descending Methods === 
A direction vector &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies this condition is is called a ''Direction of Descent''. In practice this Lemma allows us to use the following procedure to numerically solve optimization problems.

1. Define the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence sequence] &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; recursively via &lt;math&gt; x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \sigma^{(k)} d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; 

2. Choose the direction &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; from local information at the point &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Choose a step size &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; that ensures [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] of the algorithm.

4. Stop the iteration if &lt;math&gt;|f(x^{(k+1)}) - f(x^{(k)})| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is some chosen tolerance value for the minimum

This procedure already hints that the choice of &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are not separable, but rather dependent. Especially note that even if the method is a descending method (i.e. both &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are chosen according to ''Lemma 1'') the convergence to the minimum is not guaranteed. At a first glance this may seem a bit puzzling. If we found a sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; such that the function value decreases at every step, one might think that at some stage, i.e. in the limit of ''k'' tending to infinity we should reach the solution. Why this is not the case can be seen from the following example borrowed from W. Alt (2002, p. 76).

====Example 1====
* Consider the following example which does not converge although it is clearly descending. Let the criterion function be given by
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, let the starting value be &lt;math&gt;x^{(0)} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, consider a (constant) direction vector &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}=-1&lt;/math&gt; and choose a step width of &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{k+2}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the recursive definition of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence sequence] &lt;math&gt;\{x^{(k)} \}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; follows as

&lt;math&gt;(2) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + (\frac{1}{2})^{k+2} (-1) = x^{(k-1)} - (\frac{1}{2})^{k+1} - (\frac{1}{2})^{k+2} = x^{(0)} -
\sum_{j=0}^{k} (\frac{1}{2})^{j+2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt; x^{(k)} &gt; 0 \,\, \forall \,\, k&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt; f(x^{(k+1)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)}) \,\, \forall \,\,k&lt;/math&gt;, so that it is clearly a descending method. Nevertheless we find that

&lt;math&gt;(3) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}x^{(k)} = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} x^{(0)} - \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (\frac{1}{2})^{j+2} = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} 1 - \frac{1}{4}(\frac{1-(\frac{1}{2})^{k}}{\frac{1}{2}}) = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2} + (\frac{1}{2})^{k+1} = \frac{1}{2} \neq 0 = x^\star. &lt;/math&gt;

The reason for this non-convergence has to be seen in the stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; decreasing too fast. For large ''k'' the steps &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; get so small that convergence is precluded. Hence we have to link the stepsize to the direction of descend &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Efficient Stepsizes === 
The obvious idea of such a linkage is to require that the actual descent is proportional to a first order approximation, i.e. to choose &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; such that there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;  (4) \quad f(x^{(k)} + \sigma^{(k)}d^{(k)}) - f(x^{(k)}) \leq c_1
\sigma^{(k)} D(f(x^{(k)})) d^{(k)} &lt; 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that we still look only at descending directions, so that &lt;math&gt; Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; as required in Lemma 1 above. Hence, the compactness of &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(k)})) &lt;/math&gt; implies the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] of the LHS and by (4)

&lt;math&gt; (5) \quad \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \sigma^{(k)} D(f(x^{(k)}))
d^{(k)} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Finally we want to choose a sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}D(f(x^{(k)})) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; because that is exactly the necessary first order condition we want to solve. Under which conditions does (5) in fact imply &lt;math&gt; \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}D(f(x^{(k)})) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;? First of all the stepsize &lt;math&gt; \sigma^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; must not go to zero too quickly. That is exactly the case we had in the example above. Hence it seems sensible to bound the stepsize from below by requiring that

&lt;math&gt; (6) \quad \sigma^{(k)} \geq -c_{2} \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{||
d^{(k)}||^{2}} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for some constant &lt;math&gt;c_2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting (6) into (5) finally yields

&lt;math&gt; (7) \quad f(x^{(k)} + \sigma^{(k)}d^{(k)}) - f(x^{(k)}) \leq -c
(\frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||})^{2}, \quad c = c_1
c_2 &lt;/math&gt;

where again the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space compactness] of &lt;math&gt; N(f,f(x^{(k)})) &lt;/math&gt; ensures the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] of the LHS and hence

&lt;math&gt; (8) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} -c
(\frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||})^{2} = lim_{k
\rightarrow \infty} \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||} =
0 &lt;/math&gt;

Stepsizes that satisfy (4) and (6) are called ''efficient stepsizes'' and will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;. The importance of condition (6) is illustrated in the following continuation of Example 1.    

====Example 1 (continued)====
* Note that it is exactly the failure of (6) that induced Example 1 not to converge. Substituting the stepsize of the example into (6) yields

&lt;math&gt;(6.1) \quad \sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{(k+2)} \geq -c_{2} \frac{2x^{(k)}(-1)}{1} = c_{2}\cdot2(\frac{1}{2}+(\frac{1}{2})^{k+1}) \Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{4(1+2^{(k)})} \geq c_{2} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so there is ''no'' constant &lt;math&gt;c_{2} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; satisfying this inequality for all ''k'' as required in (6). Hence the stepsize
is not bounded from below and decreases too fast. To really acknowledge the importance of (6), let us change the example a bit and assume that &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we find that

&lt;math&gt;(6.2) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} x^{(k+1)} = lim_{k \rightarrow
\infty}x^{(0)} - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}(\frac{1}{2})^{i} = lim_{k
\rightarrow \infty}(\frac{1}{2})^{k+1} = 0 = x^\star, &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series convergence] actually does take place. Furthermore recognize that this example actually does satisfy condition (6) as

&lt;math&gt;(6.3) \quad  \sigma^{(k)} = (\frac{1}{2})^{(k+1)} \geq -c_{2}
\frac{2x^{(k)}(-1)}{1} = c_{2}\cdot 2(\frac{1}{2})^{k}  
\Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{4} \geq c_{2} &gt;0. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Choosing the Direction ''d'' ===

We have already argued that the choice of &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is intertwined. Hence the choice of the &quot;right&quot; &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is always contingent on the respective stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;. So what does &quot;right&quot; mean in this context? Above we showed in equation (8) that choosing an ''efficient stepsize'' implied

&lt;math&gt; (8') \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} -c (\frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||})^{2} = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The &quot;right&quot; direction vector will therefore guarantee that (8') implies that

&lt;math&gt; (9) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} Df(x^{(k)}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

as (9) is the condition for the chosen sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; to converge. So let us explore what directions could be chosen to yield (9). Assume that the stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is ''efficient'' and define

&lt;math&gt;(10) \quad  \beta^{(k)} = \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| Df(x^{(k)})|| ||d^{(k)}||} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \beta^{(k)}|| Df(x^{(k)})|| = \frac{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d^{(k)}}{|| d^{(k)}||} &lt;/math&gt;

By (8') and (10) we know that

&lt;math&gt;(11) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \beta^{(k)}|| Df(x^{(k)})|| = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

So if we bound &lt;math&gt;\beta^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; from below (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\beta^{(k)} \leq - \delta &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), (11) implies that

&lt;math&gt;(12) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \beta^{(k)}|| Df(x^{(k)})|| = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} || Df(x^{(k)})|| = lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} Df(x^{(k)}) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where (12) gives just the condition of the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; converging to the solution &lt;math&gt;x^{\star}&lt;/math&gt;. As (10) defines the direction vector &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; implicitly by &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt;, the requirements on &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; translate directly into requirements on &lt;math&gt; d^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Why Gradient Methods? ===

When considering the conditions on &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; it is clear where the term ''Gradient Methods'' originates from. With &lt;math&gt; \beta^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; given by

&lt;math&gt; \beta_{k} = \frac{D(f(x)) d^{(k)}}{|| Df(x^{(k)}) || || d^{(k)} ||} = cos(Df(x^{(k)}),d^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

we have the following result

''Given that'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''was chosen efficiently and'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfies''

&lt;math&gt;(13) \quad cos(Df(x^{(k)}),d^{(k)}) = \beta_{k} \leq - \delta &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''we have''

&lt;math&gt;(14) \quad lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} Df(x^{(k)}) \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt;

''Hence: Convergence takes place if the angle between the negative gradient at'' &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''and the direction'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''is consistently smaller than the right angle. Methods relying on'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfying (13) are called Gradient Methods.''

In other words: As long as one is not moving [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal orthogonal] to the gradient and if the stepsize is chosen efficiently, ''Gradient Methods'' guarantee convergence to the solution &lt;math&gt;x^{\star}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Some Specific Algorithms in the Class of Gradient Methods===
Let us now explore three specific algorithms of this class that differ in their respective choice of &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.
==== The Newtonian Method ====
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_method ''Newtonian Method''] is by far the most popular method in the field. It is a well known method to solve for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_%28mathematics%29 roots] of all types of equations and hence can be easily applied to optimization problems as well. The main idea of the Newtonian method is to linearize the system of equations to arrive at

&lt;math&gt;(15) \quad g(x) = g(\hat{x}) + Dg(\hat{x})^{T}(x-\hat{x}) =
0. &lt;/math&gt;

(15) can easily be solved for ''x'' as the solution is just given by (assuming &lt;math&gt;Dg(\hat{x})^{T} &lt;/math&gt; to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_matrix non-singular])

&lt;math&gt;(16) \quad x = \hat{x} - [Dg(\hat{x})^{T}]^{-1}g(\hat{x}). &lt;/math&gt;

For our purposes we just choose &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be the gradient &lt;math&gt;Df(x)&lt;/math&gt; and arrive at

&lt;math&gt; (17) \quad d_{N}^{(k)} = x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)} = - [D^2f(x^{(k)})]^{-1}Df(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d_{N}^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called ''Newtonian Direction''.

===== Properties of the Newtonian Method =====

Analyzing (17) elicits the main properties of the Newtonian method:

* If &lt;math&gt;D^2f(x^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt; is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix positive definite], &lt;math&gt;d_{N}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is a direction of descent in the sense of ''Lemma 1''.

* The ''Newtonian Method'' uses local information of the first ''and'' second derivative to calculate &lt;math&gt;d_{N}^{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

* As

&lt;math&gt; 
(18) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + d_{N}^{(k)} 
&lt;/math&gt;

the ''Newtonian Method'' uses a fixed stepsize of &lt;math&gt; \sigma^{(k)} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the Newtonian method is ''not'' necessarily a descending method in the sense of ''Lemma 1''. The reason is that the fixed stepsize &lt;math&gt; \sigma^{(k)} = 1 &lt;/math&gt; might be larger than the critical stepsize &lt;math&gt; \bar{\sigma_{k}} &lt;/math&gt; given in ''Lemma 1''. Below we provide the Rosenbrock function as an example where the ''Newtonian Method'' is not descending. 

* The Method can be time-consuming as calculating &lt;math&gt; [D^2f(x^{(k)})]^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; for every step ''k'' can be cumbersome. In applied work one could think about approximations. One could for example update the Hessian only every ''s''th step or one could rely on ''local approximations''. This is known as the ''Quasi-Newtonian-Method'' and will be discussed in the section about ''Variable Metric Methods''.

* To ensure the method to be decreasing one could use an efficient stepsize  &lt;math&gt;  \sigma_{E}^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; and set

&lt;math&gt;(19) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)}d_{N}^{(k)} = x^{(k)} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} [D^2 f(x^{k})]^{-1} Df(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

==== Method of Steepest Descent ====
Another frequently used method is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steepest_descent ''Method of Steepest Descent'']. The idea of this method is to choose the direction &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; so that the decrease in the function value ''f'' is maximal. Although this procedure seems at a first glance very sensible, it suffers from the fact that it uses effectively less information than the ''Newtonian Method'' by ignoring the Hessian's information about the curvature of the function. Especially in the applications below we will see a couple of examples of this problem.

The direction vector of the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is given by

&lt;math&gt; (20) \quad d_{SD}^{(k)} = argmax_{d : ||d|| = r} \{-Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d \} = argmin_{d : ||d|| = r} \{Df(x^{(k)})^{T}d
\}  = -r \frac{Df(x)}{|| Df(x) ||} &lt;/math&gt;

''Proof: By the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy-Schwartz_inequality Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality] it follows that''

&lt;math&gt; (21) \quad \frac{Df(x)^{T}d}{|| Df(x) || ||d||} \geq -1 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad Df(x)^{T}d \geq -r || Df(x) ||.
&lt;/math&gt;

''Obviously (21) holds with equality for'' &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)} = d_{SD}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; ''given in (20).''

Note especially that for &lt;math&gt;r = || Df(x) ||&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;d_{SD}^{(k)} = - Df(x^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. we just &quot;walk&quot; in the direction of the negative gradient. In contrast to the ''Newtonian Method'' the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' does not use a fixed stepsize but chooses an efficient stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' defines the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{x^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; by

&lt;math&gt; (22) \quad x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \sigma_{E}^{(k)} d_{SD}^{(k)}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is an efficient stepsize and &lt;math&gt;d_{SD}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; the Direction of Steepest Descent given in (20).

===== Properties of the Method of Steepest Descent =====
* With &lt;math&gt;d_{SD}^{(k)} = -r \frac{Df(x)}{|| Df(x)||}&lt;/math&gt; the Method of Steepest Descent defines a direction of descent in the sense of ''Lemma 1'', as

&lt;math&gt;Df(x)^{T}d_{SD}^{(k)} = Df(x)^{T}(-r \frac{Df(x)}{|| Df(x)||}) = - \frac{r}{|| Df(x)||}Df(x)^{T}Df(x) &lt; 0. &lt;/math&gt;

* The ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is only locally sensible as it ignores second order information.

* Especially when the criterion function is flat (i.e. the solution &lt;math&gt;x^\star&lt;/math&gt; lies in a &quot;valley&quot;) the sequence defined by the Method of Steepest Descent fluctuates wildly (see the applications below, especially the example of the Rosenbrock function).

* As it does not need the Hessian, calculation and implementation of the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is easy and fast.

==== Variable Metric Methods ====
A more general approach than both the ''Newtonian Method'' and the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' is the class of ''Variable Metric Methods''. Methods in this class rely on the updating formula

&lt;math&gt; (23) \quad x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} [A^{k}]^{-1} Df(x^{k}). &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix symmetric] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix positive definite] matrix, (23) defines a descending method as &lt;math&gt;[A^{k}]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite if and only if &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite as well. To see this: just consider the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_decomposition spectral decomposition]

&lt;math&gt; (24) \quad A^{k} = \Gamma \Lambda \Gamma^{T} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; are the matrices with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvectors eigenvectors] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvectors eigenvalues] respectively. If &lt;math&gt; A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, all eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are strictly positive. Hence their inverse &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are positive as well, so that &lt;math&gt;[A^{k}]^{-1} = \Gamma \Lambda^{-1} \Gamma^{T}&lt;/math&gt; is clearly positive definite. But then, substitution of &lt;math&gt;d^{(k)} = [A^{k}]^{-1} Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; yields

&lt;math&gt; (25) \quad Df(x^{k})^{T}d^{(k)} = -Df(x^{k})^{T}[A^{k}]^{-1}Df(x^{k}) \equiv - v^{T} [A^{k}]^{-1} v \leq 0, &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the method is indeed descending. Up to now we have not specified the matrix &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt;, but is easily seen that for two specific choices, the ''Variable Metric Method'' just coincides with the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' and the ''Newtonian Method'' respectively.

* For &lt;math&gt;A^{k} = \mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; being the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix identity matrix]) it follows that

&lt;math&gt; (22') \quad x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the ''Method of Steepest Descent''.

* For &lt;math&gt;A^{k} = D^{2}f(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; it follows that

&lt;math&gt; (19') \quad x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \sigma_{E}^{(k)} [D^{2}f(x^{k})]^{-1}Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the ''Newtonian Method'' using a stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{E}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

===== The Quasi Newtonian Method =====
A further natural candidate for a ''Variable Metric Method'' is the ''Quasi Newtonian Method''. In contrast to the standard ''Newtonian Method'' it uses an efficient stepsize so that it is a descending method and in contrast to the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' it does not fully ignore the local information about the curvature of the function. Hence the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'' is defined by the two requirements on the matrix &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt;:

* &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; should approximate the Hessian &lt;math&gt;D^{2}f(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; to make use of the information about the curvature and

* the update &lt;math&gt;A^{k} \rightarrow A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; should be easy so that the algorithm is still relatively fast (even in high dimensions).

To ensure the first requirement, &lt;math&gt;A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; should satisfy the so-called ''Quasi-Newtonian-Equation''

&lt;math&gt; (26) \quad A^{k+1}(x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)}) = Df(x^{(k+1)})-Df(x^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;

as all &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying (26) reflect information about the Hessian. To see this, consider the function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; defined as

&lt;math&gt; (27) \quad g(x) = f(x^{k+1})+Df(x^{k+1})^{T}(x - x^{k+1})+\frac{1}{2}(x-x^{k+1})^{T}A^{k+1}(x - x^{k+1}). &lt;/math&gt;

Then it is obvious that &lt;math&gt;g(x^{k+1}) = f(x^{k+1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Dg(x^{k+1}) = Df(x^{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; are reasonably similar in the neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;. In order to ensure that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is also a good approximation at &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;, we want to choose &lt;math&gt;A^{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; such that the gradients at &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are identical. With

&lt;math&gt;(28) \quad Dg(x^{k}) = Df(x^{k+1}) - A^{k+1} (x^{k+1} - x^{k})&lt;/math&gt;

it is clear that &lt;math&gt;Dg(x^{k}) = Df(x^{k})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the ''Quasi Newtonian Equation'' given in (26). But then it follows that

&lt;math&gt; (29) \quad A^{k+1} (x^{k+1} - x^{k}) = Df(x^{k+1}) - Dg(x^{k}) = Df(x^{k+1}) - Df(x^{k}) = D^2 f(\lambda x^{(k)} + (1-\lambda)x^{(k+1)})(x^{k+1} - x^{k}). &lt;/math&gt;

Hence as long as &lt;math&gt;x^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are not too far apart, &lt;math&gt;A^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying (26) is a good approximation of &lt;math&gt;D^2 f(x^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us now come to the second requirement that the update of the &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; should be easy. One specific algorithm to do so is the so-called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFGS_method ''BFGS-Algorithm'']. The main merit of this algorithm is the fact that it uses only the already calculated elements &lt;math&gt;\{x^{(k)}\}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{Df(x^{(k)})\}_{k}&lt;/math&gt; to construct the update &lt;math&gt;A^{(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence no new entities have to be calculated but one has only to keep track of the ''x''-sequence and sequence of gradients. As a starting point for the BFGS-Algorithm one can provide any positive definite matrix (e.g. the identity matrix or the Hessian at &lt;math&gt;x^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;). The ''BFGS-Updating-Formula'' is then given by

&lt;math&gt; (30) \quad A^{k} = A^{k-1} -
\frac{(A^{k-1})^{T}\gamma_{k-1}^{T}\gamma_{k-1}A^{k-1}}{\gamma_{k-1}^{T}A^{k-1}\gamma_{k-1}} + \frac{\Delta_{k-1}\Delta_{k-1}^{T}}{\Delta_{k-1}^{T}\gamma_{k-1}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{k-1} = Df(x^{(k)}) - Df(x^{(k-1)})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{k-1} = x^{(k)} - x^{(k-1)}&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore (30) ensures that all &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are positive definite as required by ''Variable Metric Methods'' to be descending.

===== Properties of the Quasi Newtonian Method =====
* It uses second order information about the curvature of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as the matrices &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are related to the Hessian &lt;math&gt;D^{2}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Nevertheless it ensures easy and fast updating (e.g. by the BFGS-Algorithm) so that it is faster than the standard Newtonian Method.

* It is a descending method as &lt;math&gt;A^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are positive definite. 

* It is relatively easy to implement as the BFGS-Algorithm is available in most numerical or statistical software packages.

== Applications ==

To compare the methods and to illustrate the differences between the algorithms we will now evaluate the performance of the ''Steepest Descent Method'', the standard ''Newtonian Method'' and the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'' with an efficient stepsize. We use two classical functions in this field, namely the Himmelblau and the Rosenbrock function.

=== Application I: The Himmelblau Function ===
The Himmelblau function is given by

&lt;math&gt; (31) \quad f(x,y) = (x^2 + y - 11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

This fourth order polynomial has four minima, four saddle points and one maximum so there are enough possibilities for the algorithms to fail. In the following pictures we display the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line contour plot] and the 3D plot of the function for different starting values.

In Figure 1 we display the function and the paths of all three methods at a starting value of &lt;math&gt;(2, -4)&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously the three methods do not find the same minimum. The reason is of course the different direction vector of the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' - by ignoring the information about the curvature it chooses a totally different direction than the two ''Newtonian Methods'' (see especially the right panel of Figure 1). 

[[Image:Himmelblaufunction1.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Figure 1: The two Newton Methods converge to the same, the Method of Steepest Descent to a different minimum.]]

Consider now the starting value &lt;math&gt;(4.5, -0.5)&lt;/math&gt;, displayed in Figure 2. The most important thing is of course that now ''all'' methods find different solutions. That the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' finds a different solution than the two ''Newtonian Methods'' is again not that surprising. But that the two ''Newtonian Methods'' converge to different solution shows the significance of the stepsize &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. With the ''Quasi-Newtonian Method'' choosing an efficient stepsize in the first iteration, both methods have different stepsizes ''and'' direction vectors for all iterations after the first one. And as seen in the picture: the consequence may be quite significant. 

[[Image:Himmelblau no2.JPG|center|thumb|550px|Figure 2: Even all methods find different solutions.]]

=== Application II: The Rosenbrock Function ===

The Rosenbrock function is given by

&lt;math&gt; (32) \quad f(x,y) = 100(y - x^2)^2 + (1-x)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Although this function has only one minimum it is an interesting function for optimization problems. The reason is the very flat valley of this U-shaped function (see the right panels of Figures 3 and 4). Especially for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics econometricians] this function may be interesting because in the case of Maximum Likelihood estimation flat criterion functions occur quite frequently. Hence the results displayed in Figures 3 and 4 below seem to be rather generic for functions sharing this problem.

My experience when working with this function and the algorithms I employed is that Figure 3 (given a starting value of &lt;math&gt;(2,-5)&lt;/math&gt;) seems to be quite characteristic. In contrast to the Himmelblau function above, all algorithms found the same solution and given that there is only one minimum this could be expected. More important is the path the different methods choose as is reflects the different properties of the respective methods. It is seen that the ''Method of Steepest Descent'' fluctuates rather wildly. This is due to the fact that it does not use information about the curvature but rather jumps back and forth between the &quot;hills&quot; adjoining the valley. The two Newtonian Methods choose a more direct path as they use the second order information. The main difference between the two Newtonian Methods is of course the stepsize. Figure 3 shows that the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'' uses very small stepsizes when working itself through the valley. In contrast, the stepsize of the ''Newtonian Method'' is fixed so that it jumps directly in the direction of the solution. Although one might conclude that this is a disadvantage of the ''Quasi Newtonian Method'', note of course that in general these smaller stepsizes come with benefit of a higher stability, i.e. the algorithm is less likely to jump to a different solution. This can be seen in Figure 4.

[[Image:Rosenbrockfunction1.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Figure 3: All
methods find the same solution, but the Method of Steepest Descent
fluctuates heavily.]]

Figure 4, which considers a starting value of &lt;math&gt;(-2,-2)&lt;/math&gt;, shows the main problem of the ''Newtonian Method'' using a fixed stepsize - the method might &quot;overshoot&quot; in that it is not descending. In the first step, the ''Newtonian Method'' (displayed as the purple line in the figure) jumps out of the valley to only bounce back in the next iteration. In this case convergence to the minimum still occurs as the gradient at each side points towards the single valley in the center, but one can easily imagine functions where this is not the case. The reason of this jump are the second derivatives which are very small so that the step &lt;math&gt;[Df(x^{(k)})]^{-1} Df(x^{(k)}))&lt;/math&gt; gets very large due to the inverse of the Hessian. In my experience I would therefore recommend to use efficient stepsizes to have more control over the paths the respective Method chooses.

[[Image:Rosenbrockfunction2.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Figure 2: Overshooting of the Newtonian Method due to the fixed stepsize.]]

=== Application III: Maximum Likelihood Estimation ===

For econometricians and statisticians the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood Maximum Likelihood Estimator] is probably the most important application of numerical optimization algorithms. Therefore we will briefly show how the estimation procedure fits in the framework developed above.

As usual let

&lt;math&gt;(33) \quad f(Y | X; \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

be the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_distribution conditional density] of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;(34) \quad l(\theta; Y | X)  &lt;/math&gt;

the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function conditional likelihood function] for the parameter &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;

If we assume the data to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iid independently, identically distributed (iid)] then the sample log-likelihood follows as

&lt;math&gt;(35) \quad \mathcal{L}(\theta; Y_{1}, ..., Y_{N}) = \sum_{i}^{N} \mathcal{L}(\theta; Y_{i}) = \sum_{i}^{N} log(l(\theta; Y_{i})). &lt;/math&gt;

Maximum Likelihood estimation therefore boils down to maximize (35) with respect to the parameter  &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;. If we for simplicity just decide to use the ''Newtonian Method'' to solve that problem, the sequence  &lt;math&gt; \{ \theta^{(k)} \}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; is recursively defined by

&lt;math&gt;(36) \quad D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k+1)}) = D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)}) + D_{\theta \theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})(\theta^{(k+1)} -\theta^{(k)}) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \theta^{(k+1)} = \theta^{(k)} - [D_{\theta \theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})]^{-1}D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)}) &lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;D_{\theta}\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_{\theta \theta}\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the first and second derivative with respect to the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; [D_{\theta \theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})]^{-1}D_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(k)})&lt;/math&gt; defines the ''Newtonian Direction'' given in (17). As Maximum Likelihood estimation always assumes that the conditional density (i.e. the distribution of the error term) is known up to the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the methods described above can readily be applied.

==== A Concrete Example of Maximum Likelihood Estimation ====

Assume a simple linear model

&lt;math&gt; (37a) \quad Y_{i} = \beta_{1} + \beta_{x} X_{i} + U_{i} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\theta = (\beta_{1}, \beta_{2})'&lt;/math&gt;. The conditional distribution ''Y'' is then determined by the one of ''U'', i.e.

&lt;math&gt; (37b)  \quad p(Y_{i} - \beta_{1} - \beta_{x} X_{i}) \equiv p_{\mid X_{i}}(Y_{i})  = p(U_{i}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_function density function]. Generally, there is no closed form solution of maximizing (35) (at least if ''U'' does not happen to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution normally distributed]), so that numerical methods have to be employed. Hence assume that ''U'' follows [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution Student's t-distribution] with ''m'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_%28statistics%29 degrees of freedom] so that (35) is given by

&lt;math&gt; (38)  \quad \mathcal{L}(\theta;Y_{\mid X}) = \sum log( \frac{\Gamma(\frac{m+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi m}\Gamma(\frac{m}{2})}(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m})^{-\frac{m+1}{2}}) &lt;/math&gt;

where we just used the definition of the density function of the t-distribution. (38) can be simplified to

&lt;math&gt; (39) \quad \mathcal{L}(\theta;Y_{\mid X}) = N[log(\Gamma(\frac{m+1}{2})) - log(\sqrt{\pi m}\Gamma(\frac{m}{2}))] -\frac{m+1}{2} \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m}) &lt;/math&gt;

so that (if we assume that the degrees of freedom ''m'' are known)

&lt;math&gt; (40) \quad \textit{argmax} \{ \mathcal{L}(\theta;Y_{\mid X}) \} = \textit{argmax} \{ -\frac{m+1}{2} \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m}) \}  = \textit{argmin} \{ \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - x_{i}^{T}\beta)^2}{m}) \}. &lt;/math&gt;

With the criterion function

&lt;math&gt; (41) \quad  f(\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}) = \sum log(1+\frac{(y_{i} - \beta_{1} - \beta_{2}x_{i})^2}{m}) &lt;/math&gt;

the methods above can readily applied to calculate the Maximum Likelihood Estimator &lt;math&gt;(\hat{\beta}_{1,ML}, \hat{\beta}_{2,ML})&lt;/math&gt; maximizing (41).

We have already had a brief encounter with NSDictionary, when we used one to set up a couple of attributes for drawing our &quot;Hello World&quot; string. Now we will have a look at it in more detail, and look at some of Cocoa's other container classes.

A '''container class''' is an object that is designed simply to look after collections of other objects. Time and again we will need to keep things in lists or tables, and the two main classes in Cocoa that do this job are NSArray and NSDictionary, and their mutable versions, NSMutableArray and NSMutableDictionary. In addition, Cocoa has some other containers such as NSSet, but for this tutorial we will not be looking at these.

==Arrays==

In Cocoa, NSArray and NSMutableArray objects are 'smarter' than the traditional arrays that you may be used to if you've programmed in C before. C arrays are still available if you need them, but they are very simplistic and in many cases using an NSArray or NSMutableArray will be worthwhile.

Note that an NSArray is a static array (its contents cannot be changed after it is created) while an NSMutableArray is a dynamic array (its contents can be changed after it is created).  NSMutableArray is a subclass of NSArray, so it can do everything an NSArray can do and more.

If you want to keep lists of objects, NSMutableArray is generally superior to the equivalent C array. The biggest difference is that an NSMutableArray can grow (and shrink) to accommodate as many objects as you want to store. A C array has a fixed size.

Just like a C array, you refer to the elements of the array using a simple index, starting at 0 for the first element. Here are the basic access methods of NSMutableArray:

 - (void)       addObject:(id)object;
 - (void)       insertObject:(id)object atIndex:(NSUinteger)index;
 - (void)       removeObject:(id)object;
 - (void)       removeObjectAtIndex:(NSUinteger)index;
 - (id)         objectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;
 - (NSUInteger) count;

Note that NSUInteger represents an unsigned integer (32 or 64-bit, depending on platform).

We must use these access methods to change what the array stores, there is no special syntax such as myarray[5] to access array elements, as there is with a C array. In some C++ frameworks, the C array syntax can be used to access elements in a dynamic array thanks to operator overloading of the [] operator, but Objective-C does not support this.

addObject: adds an object to the end of the array. insertObject:atIndex: inserts an object anywhere in the array, though be sure that the index already exists - if it's beyond the end of the array you'll get an error. Elements above the index inserted will be moved up one to accommodate the new item. removeObject: removes an object from the array, moving elements at higher index positions down to fill the gap. objectAtIndex: returns the object stored at the index, and count returns the total number of elements in the array.

When objects are added to an array, the array retains the object. When the object is removed from the array, the array releases the object. This means that objects within an array should always be valid. If the array itself is released, all the objects it contains are released too. All of Cocoa's object containers work this way.

==Dictionaries==

An array is great when you want to use index numbers to refer to objects, and don't mind if the indexes can change as objects come and go. You can use arrays for other types of structures too, such as queues and stacks. However, when you want to store objects in a way so that they are always associated with the same &quot;index value&quot;, or ''key'', a '''dictionary''' is a better bet.

NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary are Cocoa's dictionary classes. Instead of an index, you associate objects with a key value. Later, you can retrieve the object using the key. The key never changes even as other objects come and go.

The main methods are:

 - (void)    setObject:(id) object forKey:(id) key;
 - (id)        objectForKey:(id) key;
 - (void)    removeObjectForKey:(id) key;
 - (int)       count;

The key is itself declared to be an object, so you can use anything you like. Most commonly, you would use an NSString as the key, but you are not required to.

Internally, NSDictionary is implemented as a hash table, so accessing elements is fast.

==Iterators==

Often, you will want to loop over the contents of an array or dictionary, and carry out some action on each object. Cocoa declares a number of ''iterator'' or ''enumerator'' classes to make this easy. Of course, you could use a simple for(...) loop, using 'count' as a terminal value, but using an iterator is both more object-oriented, and allows quick and easy change between using an array or a dictionary for storage.

To obtain an iterator for a given container, ask the container to make it for you. The generic iterator class is NSEnumerator:

 NSEnumerator* myIterator = [myArray objectEnumerator];

Because 'objectEnumerator' is a factory method, the returned iterator is autoreleased, so you don't usually need to retain it - you'll be using it once to iterate the contents of the array, then throw it away. In fact, iterators can only be used once - once you have iterated the array, there is no way to &quot;back up&quot; and do it again with the same iterator. Instead, you ask for a new iterator, which starts at the beginning.

To iterate, you repeatedly call the iterator's 'nextObject' method until it returns nil, meaning there are no more objects. So, an iterative loop looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
 id anObject;

 while( anObject = [myIterator nextObject])
 {
     /* do something useful with anObject */
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This code would be identical whether the container was a dictionary or an array. If you used a for loop, the dictionary case would need to be quite a bit more complex than the array case, since you'd need to obtain all of the keys, then get each in turn to obtain the object.

If you wish to iterate backwards over a set of objects, ask for the reverseObjectEnumerator instead. The body of the loop doesn't change:

&lt;pre&gt;
 NSEnumerator* myIterator = [myArray reverseObjectEnumerator];
 id anObject;

 while( anObject = [myIterator nextObject])
 {
     /* do something useful with anObject */
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Iterators and enumerators have, to a large extent, been superseded in the Objective-C language by the concept of 'fast enumeration'. Fast enumeration is a language feature that allows you to efficiently and safely enumerate over the contents of a collection using a concise syntax.  The Cocoa collection classes support fast enumeration. For example

&lt;pre&gt;
  NSArray *cities = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;London&quot;, @&quot;Paris&quot;, @&quot;Rome&quot;, nil];

  for (NSString *city in cities) // fast enumeration
  {
    NSLog(@&quot;City is %@&quot;, city);
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Cocoa enumerator classes also support fast enumeration. For example

&lt;pre&gt;
  NSArray *cities = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;London&quot;, @&quot;Paris&quot;, @&quot;Rome&quot;, nil];

  for (NSString *city in [cities reverseObjectEnumerator]) // fast enumeration
  {
    NSLog(@&quot;City is %@&quot;, city);
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whenever you consider any available language, it gives information about the frequency of letters that occur most frequently in it. The same matter is more enough for cryptanalysis (process of discovering ciphertexts) which is more beneficial when encryption is performed using the Conventional Classical Encryption Techniques.

This gives statistical information of data that cryptanalysts can use in order to decrypt the encrypted data, provided the language in which data is present is known.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In many ways the United Nations is a product of the Second World War.  It took quite a bit of effort to forge the political alliances necessary to build the Allied military force that defeated the Axis powers during this war.  Even before the formal surrender of Germany and Japan, it was realized that a long-term relationship should be developed among those countries that participated in the defeat of Facism, and a political solution that had global input needed to occur with the territories captured from the Axis powers.

During the final years of WWII, the name of the alliance had even changed, with the term United Nations being used formally for the first time as the name of the allied nations in press releases and newspaper accounts.  While not formally the organization that exists today that is called the United Nations, many of the tasks that are now handled by the various Secretariats of the UN were first started at this time.  There was also a strong sentiment among all of the participants of this alliance that they should not repeat the same mistakes that occurred at the end of the First World War, and in retrospect it could be argued that the framers of the United Nations have largely succeeded in that task.

Another aspect of the organization of the United Nations is the need to coordinate new participation in the war.  The wartime alliance toward the end of WWII had many new countries willing to participate directly and indirectly in the combat operations, but this requried formal alliance treaties independently with each of the major allied powers and grew more complex as more countries joined the alliance.  It was becoming so complex that some otherwise needed wartime supplies were actually refused because of the political bureaucracy that was developing.

Some international agencies such as the International Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union pre-date the founding of the United Nations as well, but currently receive support from the UN and are considered appendenges to the larger organization as well and are governed under charters issued by the UN.  There were also some aspects of the League of Nations that were absorbed into the United Nations, as most of the participants in the older League of Nations were also members of the United Nations as well.  This is largely the result of a spirit of cooperation between nations that existed in the years prior to WWII, particularly for issues that didn't seem to have significant differences of opinion on how to proceed but required cooperation and standardization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Italian, ''passato prossimo'' is a very common tense expressing a recent, concluded action.
To have an idea, you can use passato prossimo for an action you have just done, let's say from five minutes ago to two or three days ago.
Despite this rule (which is not as strict as you can imagine), in northern Italy ''passato prossimo'' is also used to refer to actions which took place years ago, and the use of the correct tense for these cases, the ''passato remoto'', is almost disappeared (but its use is compulsory when writing). On the other hand, in southern Italy, the ''passato prossimo'' tense has been dropped, and, especially in Sicily, ''passato remoto'' is used in its stead.

just an example of conjugation:

'''fare''' (to do)
---- transitive verb, you must use &quot;avere&quot; to form the tense:

io     ho       fatto &lt;/br&gt;
tu     hai      fatto &lt;/br&gt;
egli   ha       fatto &lt;/br&gt;
noi    abbiamo  fatto &lt;/br&gt;
voi    avete    fatto &lt;/br&gt;
essi   hanno    fatto &lt;/br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This ''Italic text'' tense is like the third form of the verbs in English (done, fallen...), and is used only to compose some other tenses like ''passato prossimo'', ''trapassato prossimo/remoto'', ''congiuntivo trapassato''.

A general rule to form the ''Participio passato'' (not valid for the irregular verbs) is the following

'''for the first and the third group (-''are'' and -''ire'' verbs)''':

-drop '''-re'''&lt;/br&gt;
-add '''-to'''

examples: dare (to give) = da'''''to''''', mangiare (to eat) = mangia'''''to''''', dormire (to sleep) = dormi'''''to'''''.

'''''for the second group (-''ere'' verbs)'''''&lt;/br&gt;
-drop '''-ere'''&lt;/br&gt;
-add '''-uto'''

cadere (to fall) = cad'''''uto'''''; avere (to have) = av'''''uto'''''&lt;/br&gt;
Remember that for the verbs in which ''-ere'' follows '''-sc''' (conoscere (to know)), the sound sh must be preserved also in the ''participio'' ''passato form'', so an -i must be added in front of -uto:

conoscere = conosc'''i'''''uto''


some irregular verbs:

essere (to be)  =  stato

== Hi again ==

I started up editing lesson three, it's about connective forms and also negation.  I'm beginning to think the format we're using is a bit to change retroactively, but I don't think the entire format needs to change just yet. 14:32, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

== Spanish ==

The template does indeed belong there, if you're willing to change all the links :). As to &quot;buenas mañanas&quot;, I don't know. I was taught it, so I added it to the Wikibook. If you know better, please change it.

Check out my new vocabulary page at [[Spanish/Vocabulary/People]]. What do you think of structuring the vocabulary pages this way? [[User:Cilantrohead|Cilantrohead]] ([[User talk:Cilantrohead|talk]]) 00:58, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

: It's nice for concrete nouns, but it might be challenging to get contributors to find or draw images.  Besides, it's much more difficult to supply pictures for more abstract words. Also, I'd hope to see each foreign vocabulary word in such lists link to the English Wiktionary entry for that word.  Does that feeback help?

&lt;math&gt;dq_{rev} \;=\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right )_vdT+\left [ P_{ext}+\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

We assume quasistatic situation, so &lt;math&gt;P_{ext} = P \;&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;dq_{rev} \;=\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right )_vdT+\left [ P+\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=C_vdT+\left [ P+\left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=C_vdT+\left [ P+\left ( \frac{a}{\overline V^2} \right ) \right ]dV&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=C_vdT+\left ( \frac{RT}{\overline V-b} \right )dV&lt;/math&gt;

Now, you take the cross partial derivatives.

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial C_v}{\partial V} \right )_T=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial \left ( \frac{RT}{\overline V-b} \right )}{\partial T} \right )_V=\frac{R}{\overline V-b}&lt;/math&gt;

They are not equal; hence, &lt;math&gt;q_{rev} \;&lt;/math&gt; is not exact differential (not a state function).

However, if we take &lt;math&gt;\frac{q_{rev}}{T}&lt;/math&gt; it will be exact differential (a state function).

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq_{rev}}{T}=\frac{C_v}{T}dT+\left ( \frac{R}{\overline V-b} \right )dV&lt;/math&gt;

Take the cross partial derivatives.

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial \left ( \frac{C_v}{T}\right )}{\partial V} \right )_T=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{\partial \left ( \frac{R}{\overline V-b} \right )}{\partial T} \right )_V=0&lt;/math&gt;

Both are equal making &lt;math&gt;\frac{q_{rev}}{T}&lt;/math&gt; exact differential (a state function).

== A man of the law ==
Hello, Mr Paquette.

I see that you are a man of the law, if I'm led to the correct impression by clicking links which you have put on your user page.

I hope you contribute heaps to Wikibooks, and that you have lots of fun and teach lots of people.

Thank you very much for being here,

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Paul.Paquette. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Paul.Paquette~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <comment>/* &quot;This is...&quot; and the feminine */ corrected typo: endng -&gt; ending</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If we want to use the phrase &quot;This is...&quot; basically pointing to something or identifying it, we would use the Arabic word '''(هذا)'''
which means &quot;this&quot;.

As we learned earlier(and to repeat here as a reminder) there are no connecting verbs in the Arabic language, by that I mean the words &quot;is&quot; and &quot;are&quot;.
Therefore remember when using the term  '''(هذا)''' that, in most cases, you will not need to add anything between &quot;this&quot; and the noun you are identifying.

== &quot;This is...&quot; and common nouns ==

Lets show a few examples to make it a bit clearer:

Phrase: This is a boy
this = '''(هذا)'''
a boy = '''(ولد)'''
thus the Arabic is : '''(هذا ولد)'''

At first glance one might see this as translating to (this boy)
yet there is another way to say that phrase, and before getting into we will practice using '''(هذا)''' a bit more.

This is a book = '''(هذا كتاب)''' 
This is a chair = '''(هذا كرسي)'''
This is a pen = '''(هذا قلم)'''

These sentences are both grammatically correct and complete sentences.

== &quot;This is...&quot; and proper nouns ==
'''(هذا)''' when used with a proper personal nouns, i.e. a person's name, nothing is added.
Thus you would say when introducing your friends John, Muhammad, Ali, and Rama:
This is John = '''(هذا جان)'''
This is Muhammad = '''(هذا محمد)'''
This is Ali = '''(هذا علي)'''
This is Rama = '''(هذا راما)'''

However, when using '''(هذا)''' with a proper noun that denotes other than a personal name, care must be taken to use it is a manner which will fulfill the requirements of a complete sentence.
Thus &quot;This pen...&quot; = in Arabic (هذا القلم) would be a sentence fragment, and would not carry a meaning that whoever you are speaking to can understand (unless of course you are answering a question about a pen)
An example will make this clearer:
Q: Which pen do you want? = '''(أي قلم تريد؟)'''
A: This pen.'''(هذا القلم)''' [identifying the specific pen he wants.]

== &quot;This is the...&quot; and the word (هذا) ==

Now when using the word '''(هذا)''' one might want to exclaim &quot;This is the boy!&quot; or point out &quot;This is the pen.&quot; 
Here a pronoun = '''(هو)''' needs to be added [in Arabic grammar this pronoun is called '''(ضمير الشأن)''']
This pronoun allows the sentence to move from one of a sentence fragment to one of a complete sentence.
Examples: 
&quot;This is the boy!&quot; = '''(هذا هو الولد)'''
Compare to = &quot;This boy...&quot; = '''(هذا الولد)'''
&quot;This is the pen.&quot; = '''(هذا هو القلم)'''
Compare to = &quot;This pen...&quot; = '''(هذا القلم)'''

== &quot;This is...&quot; and the feminine ==
The feminine form of '''(هذا)''' is '''(هذه)''' which means exactly the same thing yet will only be used for feminine nouns.

One might then ask &quot;How do I know that the noun is feminine?&quot;
Answer: Well one apparent clue is that you are using it to describe a female. Thus names such as Rebecca, Sara, Fatimah, and Aishah will all be identified with the word '''(هذه)'''.
This is Rebecca = '''(هذه رابكا)'''
This is Sara = '''(هذه سارة)'''
This is Fatimah = '''(هذه فاطمة)'''
This is Aishah = '''(هذه عائشة)'''

If the word is not blatantly used to describe a female, than there are certain signs that will denote for you the proper usage of '''(هذه)''' with that word, such as:
1- the word ending in '''(ــة ، ة)''' 
such as:
car = '''(سيارة)'''
printer = '''(طابعة)'''
government = '''(حكومة)'''

2- the word ending in '''(ـاء)''' 
such as the words: 
sky = '''(سـماء)'''
air = '''(هواء)'''
cover = '''(غطاء)'''

Other words are known to be feminine by usage, one needs to build their vocabulary in order to distinguish the masculine from the feminine.

== Overview ==

'''''Broderick Bode''''' is a worker in the Ministry of Magic's Department of Mysteries.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Bode attends the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] points him out to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] as he passes the Weasleys' tents.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]], accompanied by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], arrive to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]], the day after the snake attack, they wait in line after an old stooped wizard who is there to see Broderick Bode. The Welcome Witch says he's wasting his time, Bode still thinks he's a teapot.

Some days later, Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] happen to end up on the long-term residents floor, due to a chance encounter with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]]. There, they see Bode, who is apparently getting better. He receives a pot plant (US: house plant) for a Christmas present from an unnamed well-wisher.

Hermione later reads that he has been strangled by the pot plant, which turns out to have been a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Devil's Snare|Devil's Snare]]. 

In a dream Harry has in late February, where he perceives things happening in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s mind, Harry hears that Bode had been placed under the Imperius spell by Malfoy, but that he had known that he would not be able to do what was being asked of him, and so fought the spell very hard. Based on this sketchy information, Harry, Ron, and Hermione conclude that Bode was placed under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and was supposed to remove a prophecy concerning Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] from the shelf it is stored on. As an employee in the Department of Mysteries, however, he knew that he could not touch it, so he fought the curse unsuccessfully. The shock of touching the prophecy may have lifted the curse, but left him unable to speak. He was admitted to St. Mungo's, but was killed by the anonymously sent Devil's Snare plant as he began to regain speech abilities. It is theorized that the Death Eaters wished to silence him and so sent the plant, which his Healer thought was a harmless Christmas gift. Encouraged to care for the plant himself, Bode touched the Devil's Snare and was instantly throttled. His death was only briefly mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Standard (or Type 2) is a Constructed format where the total card pool is restricted by sets.  Normally, the standard format pool consists of cards from the most recent core set and the two most recent expansion blocks.
Currently, the core set is Magic 2011 and the expansions are the Scars of Mirrodin block and Zendikar.

Players must have at least a 60-card deck (a sideboard containing exactly 15 extra cards is not optional) consisting of cards of any printings that are legal in the current standard format; however, players must be able to shuffle their decks without assistance.  Decks (including the sideboard) may contain no more than 4 copies of any card other than basic lands.  In addition, certain cards may be &quot;restricted&quot; (only one copy of the card allowed) or &quot;banned&quot; (the card may not be used).

As of July 16th 2011, the sets legal in Standard:


'''CORE SET'''

Magic 2011
Magic 2012


'''Zendikar'''

Zendikar

Worldwake 

Rise Of The Eldrazi

'''Scars of Mirrodin'''

Scars of Mirrodin

Mirrodin Besieged

New Phyrexia

----

Beginning from September 30th 2012, standard will consist of the following sets:

'''CORE SET'''

Magic 2012

'''Scars of Mirrodin'''

Scars of Mirrodin

Mirrodin Besieged

New Phyrexia

'''Innistrad'''

Innistrad

----


Since the format rotates each year, decks have a maximum shelf life of two years, meaning that the format is quick to change and easily impacted. There are deck archetypes that have waxed and waned through the years, but maintain their existence in some form or another (White-Defensive, Blue-Control, Black-Kill and Weaken, Red-Direct Damage, Green-Creature Based ), while others (usually combo decks) are spawned from the centerpiece card (Tooth and Nail, Enduring Ideal), and are thus usually subject to their key card leaving Standard.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This article presents a small Java program which can be run from the console. It computes the distance between two points on a plane. You do not need to understand the structure and meaning of the program just yet; we will get to that soon. Also, because the program is intended as a simple introduction, it has some room for improvement, and later in the module we will show some of these improvements. But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves!

== The Distance Class: Intent, Source, and Use ==

This class is named ''Distance'', so using your favorite editor or [[Java Programming/Java IDEs|Java IDE]], first create a file named &lt;code&gt;Distance.java&lt;/code&gt;, then copy the source below, paste it into the file and save the file.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 2.1: Distance.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 public class Distance {
   private java.awt.Point point0, point1;
 
   public Distance(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1) {
     point0 = new java.awt.Point(x0, y0);
     point1 = new java.awt.Point(x1, y1);
   }
 
   public void printDistance() {
     System.out.println(&quot;Distance between &quot; + point0 + &quot; and &quot; + point1
                     + &quot; is &quot; + point0.distance(point1));
   }
 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     Distance dist = new Distance(
              intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
              intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
     dist.printDistance();
   }
 
   private static int intValue(String data) {
     return Integer.parseInt(data);
   }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

At this point, you may wish to review the source to see how much you might be able to understand. While perhaps not being the most literate of programming languages, someone with understanding of other procedural languages such as C, or other object oriented languages such as C++ or C#, will be able to understand most if not all of the sample program.

Once you save the file, [[Java Programming/Compilation|compile]] the program:
{{XCode|1='''Compilation command'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ javac Distance.java
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
(If the &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt; command fails, review the [[Java Programming/Installation|installation instructions]].)

To run the program, you supply it with the ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates of two points on a plane separated by a space. For this version of Distance, only integer points are supported. The command sequence is ''&lt;code&gt;java Distance &lt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; &lt;y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; &lt;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; &lt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'' to compute the distance between the points (''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'').
{{XWarning|If you get a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.NumberFormatException&lt;/code&gt; exception, some arguments are not a number. If you get a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&lt;/code&gt; exception, you did not provide enough numbers.}}

Here are two examples:
{{XCode|1='''Output for the distance between the points (0, 3) and (4, 0)'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java Distance 0 3 4 0
Distance between java.awt.Point[x=0,y=3] and java.awt.Point[x=4,y=0] is 5.0
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

{{XCode|1='''Output for the distance between the points (-4, 5) and (11, 19)'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java Distance -4 5 11 19
Distance between java.awt.Point[x=-4,y=5] and java.awt.Point[x=11,y=19] is 20.518284528683193
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

We'll explain this strange looking output, and also show how to improve it, later.

== Detailed Program Structure and Overview ==

As promised, we will now provide a detailed description of this Java program. We will discuss the syntax and structure of the program and the meaning of that structure.

:&lt;span id=&quot;figure-1&quot;&gt;Figure 2.1&lt;/span&gt;: Basic Java syntax.
::''For a further treatment of the syntax elements of Java, see also [[Java Programming/Syntax|Syntax]].''

The ''syntax'' of a Java class is the characters, symbols and their structure used to code the class. Java programs consist of a sequence of tokens. There are different kinds of tokens. For example, there are word tokens such as {{java:class}} and {{java:public}} which represent ''[[Java Programming/Keywords|&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;'''keywords'''&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;'''(in purple'''&lt;/span&gt; [[#figure-1|&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;'''above'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple&quot;&gt;''')'''&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; special words with reserved meaning in Java. Other words such as &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;printDistance&lt;/code&gt; are not keywords but &lt;span style=&quot;color: grey&quot;&gt;''identifiers'' (in grey)&lt;/span&gt;. Identifiers have many different uses in Java but primarily they are used as names. Java also has tokens to represent numbers, such as &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;; these are known as ''[[Java Programming/Literals|&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange&quot;&gt;literals&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange&quot;&gt;(in orange)&lt;/span&gt;. ''[[Java Programming/Literals/String Literals|&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;String literals&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;(in blue)&lt;/span&gt;, such as  &lt;code&gt;&quot;Distance between &quot;&lt;/code&gt;, consist of zero or more characters embedded in double quotes, and ''[[Java Programming/Operators|&lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;operators&lt;/span&gt;]]'' &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;(in red)&lt;/span&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; are used to express basic computation such as addition or String concatenation or assignment. There are also left and right braces (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) which enclose ''blocks''. The body of a class is one such block. Some tokens are punctuation, such as periods &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; and commas &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; and semicolons &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. You use ''whitespace'' such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, to separate tokens. For example, whitespace is required between keywords and identifiers: &lt;code&gt;publicstatic&lt;/code&gt; is a single identifier with twelve characters, not two Java keywords.

=== Declarations and Definitions ===

&lt;div style=&quot;border: blue solid 3px; background-color: #ccf&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;public class Distance {&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: green solid 3px; background-color: #cfc&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;private java.awt.Point point0, point1;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;border: orange solid 3px; background-color: #fdc&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;public Distance(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1) {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;point0 = new java.awt.Point(x0, y0);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;point1 = new java.awt.Point(x1, y1);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;border: red solid 3px; background-color: #fcc&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;public void printDistance() {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;System.out.println(&quot;Distance between &quot; + point0 + &quot; and &quot; + point1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;+ &quot; is &quot; + point0.distance(point1));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;border: red solid 3px; background-color: #fcc&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Distance dist = new Distance(&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;dist.printDistance();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;border: red solid 3px; background-color: #fcc&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;private static int intValue(String data) {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;return Integer.parseInt(data);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;span id=&quot;figure-2&quot;&gt;Figure 2.2&lt;/span&gt;: Declarations and Definitions.

Sequences of tokens are used to construct the next building blocks of Java classes as shown [[#figure-2|above]]: declarations and definitions. A class declaration provides the name and visibility of a class. In our example, &lt;code&gt;public class Distance&lt;/code&gt; is the class declaration. It consists (in this case) of two keywords, {{java:public}} and {{java:class}}&lt;/code&gt; followed by the identifier &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;.

This means that we are defining a class named &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt;. Other classes, or in our case, the command line, can refer to the class by this name. The &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; keyword is an [[Java Programming/Scope|access modifier]] which declares that this class and its members may be accessed from other classes. The &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keyword, obviously, identifies this declaration as a class. Java also allows declarations of ''[[Java Programming/Interfaces|interfaces]]'' and ''[[Java Programming/Annotations|annotations]]''.

The class declaration is then followed by a block (surrounded by curly braces) which provides the class's definition &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;(in blue in [[#figure-2|figure 2.2]])&lt;/span&gt;. The definition is the implementation of the class &amp;ndash; the declaration and definitions of the class's members. This class contains exactly six members, which we will explain in turn.
# Two field declarations, named &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: green&quot;&gt;(in green)&lt;/span&gt;
# A constructor declaration &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange&quot;&gt;(in orange)&lt;/span&gt;
# Three method declarations &lt;span style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;(in red)&lt;/span&gt;

==== Example: Instance Fields ====

The declaration
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.1: Declaration.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private java.awt.Point point0, point1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

...declares two ''instance fields''. Instance fields represent named values that are allocated whenever an instance of the class is constructed. When a Java program creates a &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; instance, that instance will contain space for &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt;. When another &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object is created, it will contain space for its ''own'' &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; values. The value of &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; in the first &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object can vary independently of the value of &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; in the second &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object.

This declaration consists of:

#The &lt;code&gt;[[Java Programming/Keywords/private|private]]&lt;/code&gt; access modifier,&lt;br/&gt;which means these instance fields are not visible to other classes.
#The type of the instance fields. In this case, the type is &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;This is the class &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;java.awt&lt;/code&gt; package.
#The names of the instance fields in a comma separated list.


These two fields could also have been declared with two separate but more verbose declarations,

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.2: Verbose declarations.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 private java.awt.Point point0;
 private java.awt.Point point1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Since the type of these fields is a reference type (i.e. a field that ''refers to'' or can hold a ''reference to'' an object value), Java will implicitly initialize the values of &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; to null when a &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; instance is created. The null value means that a reference value does not refer to an object. The special Java literal {{java:null}} is used to represent the null value in a program. While you can explicitly assign null values in a declaration, as in

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.3: Declarations and assignments.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 private java.awt.Point point0 = null;
 private java.awt.Point point1 = null;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It is not necessary and most programmers omit such default assignments.

==== Example: Constructor ====

A ''[[Java Programming/Methods#Special method, the constructor|constructor]]'' is a special method in a class which is used to construct an instance of the class. The constructor can perform initialization for the object, beyond that which the Java VM does automatically. For example, Java will automatically initialize the fields &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; to null.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.4: The constructor for the class'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public Distance(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1) {
   point0 = new java.awt.Point(x0, y0);
   point1 = new java.awt.Point(x1, y1);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The constructor above consists of five parts:
# The optional [[Java Programming/Scope|access modifier(s)]]. &lt;br/&gt; In this case, the constructor is declared &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;
# The constructor name, which must match the class name exactly: &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; in this case.
# The constructor parameters.&lt;br/&gt; The parameter list is required. Even if a constructor does not have any parameters, you must specify the empty list &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. The parameter list declares the type and name of each of the method's parameters.
# An optional {{java:throws}} clause which declares the [[Java Programming/Exceptions|exceptions]] that the constructor may throw. This constructor does not declare any exceptions.
# The constructor body, which is a Java block (enclosed in &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;).  This constructor's body contains two statements.

This constructor accepts four parameters, named &lt;code&gt;x0, y0, x1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y1&lt;/code&gt;. Each parameter requires a parameter type declaration, which in this example is &lt;code&gt;{{java:int}}&lt;/code&gt; for all four parameters. The parameters in the parameter list are separated by commas.

The two assignments in this constructor use Java's ''{{java:new}} operator'' to allocate two &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; objects. The first allocates an object representing the first point, &lt;code&gt;(x0, y0)&lt;/code&gt;, and assigns it to the &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; instance variable (replacing the null value that the instance variable was initialized to). The second statement allocates a second &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; instance with &lt;code&gt;(x1, y1)&lt;/code&gt; and assigns it to the &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; instance variable.

This is the constructor for the Distance class. Distance implicitly extends from &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Object&lt;/code&gt;. Java inserts a call to the super constructor as the first executable statement of the constructor if there is not one explicitly coded. The above constructor body is equivalent to the following body with the explicit super constructor call:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.5: Super constructor.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{
   super();
   point0 = new java.awt.Point(x0, y0);
   point1 = new java.awt.Point(x1, y1);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

While it is true that this class could be implemented in other ways, such as simply storing the coordinates of the two points and computing the distance as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, this class instead uses the existing &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; class. This choice matches the abstract definition of this class: to print the distance between two points on the plane. We take advantage of existing behavior already implemented in the Java platform rather than implementing it again. We will see later how to make the program more flexible without adding much complexity, because we choose to use object abstractions here. However, the key point is that this class uses information hiding. That is, ''how'' the class stores its state or how it computes the distance is hidden. We can change this implementation without altering how clients use and invoke the class.

==== Example: Methods ====

[[Java Programming/Methods|Methods]] are the third and most important type of class member. This class contains three ''methods'' in which the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class is defined: &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt;

==== The printDistance() method ====

The &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt; method prints the distance between the two points to the standard output (normally the console).
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.6: &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt; method.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void printDistance() {
  System.out.println(&quot;Distance between &quot; + point0
    + &quot; and &quot; + point1
    + &quot; is &quot; + point0.distance(point1));
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This ''instance method'' executes within the context of an implicit &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; object. The instance field references, &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt;, refer to instance fields of that implicit object. You can also use the special variable &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; to explicitly reference the current object. Within an instance method, Java binds the name &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; to the object on which the method is executing, and the type of &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is that of the current class. The body of the &lt;code&gt;printDistance&lt;/code&gt; method could also be coded as
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.7: Explicit instance of the current class.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  System.out.println(&quot;Distance between &quot; + this.point0
    + &quot; and &quot; + this.point1
    + &quot; is &quot; + this.point0.distance(this.point1));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

to make the instance field references more explicit.

This method both computes the distance and prints it in one statement. The distance is computed with &lt;code&gt;point0.distance(point1)&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;distance()&lt;/code&gt; is an instance method of the &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt; class (of which &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt; are instances). The method operates on &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; (binding &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; to the object that &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; refers to during the execution of the method) and accepting another Point as a parameter. Actually, it is slightly more complicated than that, but we'll explain later. The result of the &lt;code&gt;distance()&lt;/code&gt; method is a double precision floating point number.

This method uses the syntax

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.8: String concatenation.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 &quot;Distance between &quot; + this.point0
 + &quot; and &quot; + this.point1
 + &quot; is &quot; + this.point0.distance(this.point1)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

to construct a String to pass to the &lt;code&gt;System.out.println()&lt;/code&gt;. This expression is a series of ''String concatenation'' methods which concatenates Strings or the String representation of primitive types (such as doubles) or objects, and returns a long string. For example, the result of this expression for the points (0,3) and (4,0) is the String
{{XCode|1='''Output'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
&quot;Distance between java.awt.Point[x=0,y=3] and java.awt.Point[x=4,y=0] is 5.0&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
which the method then prints to &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt;.

In order to print, we invoke the &lt;code&gt;println()&lt;/code&gt;. This is an instance method from &lt;code&gt;java.io.PrintStream&lt;/code&gt;, which is the type of the static field &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; in the class &lt;code&gt;java.lang.System&lt;/code&gt;. The Java VM binds &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; to the standard output stream when it starts a program.

==== The main() method ====

The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method is the main entry point which Java invokes when you start a Java program from the command line. The command
{{XCode|1='''Output'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
java Distance 0 3 4 0
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
instructs Java to locate the Distance class, put the four command line arguments into an array of String values, then pass those arguments to the &lt;code&gt;public static main(String[])&lt;/code&gt; method of the class. We will introduce arrays shortly. Any Java class that you want to invoke from the command line or desktop shortcut must have a main method with this signature or the following signature: &lt;code&gt;public static main(String...)&lt;/code&gt;.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.9: &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {
   Distance dist = new Distance(
         intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
         intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
   dist.printDistance();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method invokes the final method, &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt;, four times. The &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; takes a single string parameter and returns the integer value represented in the string. For example, &lt;code&gt;intValue(&quot;3&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; will return the integer 3.

People who do test-first programming or perform regression testing
write
a main() method in every Java class, and
a [[Python Programming/Modules and how to use them | main() function in every Python module]],
to run automated tests.
When a person executes the file directly,
the main() method executes and runs the automated tests for that file.
When a person executes some other Java file
that in turn imports many other Java classes,
only one main() method is executed --
the main() method of the directly-executed file.

==== The &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method ====

The &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method delegates its job to the &lt;code&gt;Integer.parseInt()&lt;/code&gt; method. The main method could have called &lt;code&gt;Integer.parseInt()&lt;/code&gt; directly; the &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method simply makes the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method slightly more readable.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.10: &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private static int intValue(String data) {
   return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This method is {{java:private}} since, like the fields &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;point1&lt;/code&gt;, it is part of the internal implementation of the class and is not part of the external programming interface of the &lt;code&gt;Distance&lt;/code&gt; class.

==== Static vs. Instance Methods ====

Both the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; methods are ''static methods''. The {{java:static}} keyword tells the compiler to create a single memory space associated with the class.  Each individual object instantiated has its own private state variables and methods but use the same &lt;b&gt;static&lt;/b&gt; methods and members common to the single class object created by the compiler when the first class object is instantiated or created.  This means that the method executes in a static or non-object context &amp;mdash; there is no implicit separate instance available when the static methods run from various objects, and the special variable &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is not available. As such, static methods cannot access instance methods or instance fields (such as &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;point0&lt;/code&gt;) directly. The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method can only invoke the instance method &lt;code&gt;printDistance()&lt;/code&gt; method via an instance reference such as &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Data Types ===

Most declarations have a data type. Java has several categories of data types: reference types, primitive types, array types, and a special type, void.

==== Primitive Types ====

The ''[[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive types]]'' are used to represent boolean, character, and numeric values. This program uses only one primitive type explicitly, &lt;code&gt;''{{java:int}}''&lt;/code&gt;, which represents 32 bit signed integer values. The program also implicitly uses &lt;code&gt;''{{java:double}}''&lt;/code&gt;, which is the return type of the &lt;code&gt;distance()&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;java.awt.Point&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; values are 64 bit IEEE floating point values. The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method uses integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3 to access elements of the command line arguments. The &lt;code&gt;Distance()&lt;/code&gt; constructor's four parameters also have the type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. Also, the &lt;code&gt;intValue()&lt;/code&gt; method has a return type of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. This means a call to that method, such as &lt;code&gt;intValue(args[0])&lt;/code&gt;, is an expression of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. This helps explain why the main method cannot call:

{{XWarning|1=&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 2.11: Wrong type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
new Distance(args[0], args[1], args[2], args[3]) // This is an error
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Since the type of the &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; array element is String, and our constructor's parameters must be &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, such a call would result in an error because Java will not automatically convert values of type String into &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; values.

Java's primitive types are
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:boolean}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:byte}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:char}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:short}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:int}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:long}}''&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:float}}''&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;''{{java:double}}''&lt;/code&gt;. Each of which are also Java language keywords.

==== Reference Types ====

In addition to primitive types, Java supports ''reference type''. A reference type is a Java data type which is defined by a Java class or interface. Reference types derive this name because such values ''refer to'' an object or contain a ''reference to'' an object. The idea is similar to pointers in other languages like C.

Java represents sequences of character data, or ''[[Java Programming/API/java.lang.String|String]]'', with the reference type &lt;code&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/code&gt; which is most commonly referred to as &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. ''String literals'', such as  &lt;code&gt;&quot;Distance between &quot;&lt;/code&gt; are constants whose type is String.

This program uses three separate reference types:
# java.lang.String (or simply String)
# Distance
# java.awt.Point

:''For more information see chapter: [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types]].''

==== Array Types ====

Java supports ''[[Java Programming/Arrays|arrays]]'', which are aggregate types which have a fixed element type (which can be any Java type) and an integral size. This program uses only one array, &lt;code&gt;String[] args&lt;/code&gt;. This indicates that &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; has an array type and that the element type is &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. The Java VM constructs and initializes the array that is passed to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method. See ''[[Java Programming/Arrays|arrays]]'' for more details on how to create arrays and access their size.

The elements of arrays are accessed with integer indices. The first element of an array is always element 0. This program accesses the first four elements of the &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; array explicitly with the indices 0, 1, 2, and 3. This program does ''not'' perform any input validation, such as verifying that the user passed at least four arguments to the program. We will fix that later.

==== void ====

{{Java:void}} is not a type in Java; it represents the absence of a type. Methods which do not return values are declared as ''void methods''.

This class defines two void methods:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.12: Void methods'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
public void printDistance()  { ... }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Whitespace ==
Whitespace in Java is used to separate the tokens in a Java source file. Whitespace is required in some places, such as between [[Java Programming/Scope|access modifiers]], [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|type names]] and Identifiers, and is used to improve readability elsewhere.

Wherever whitespace is required in Java, one or more whitespace characters may be used. Wherever whitespace is optional in Java, zero or more whitespace characters may be used.

Java whitespace consists of the
* space character {{Java:ch| }} (0x20),
* the tab character (hex 0x09),
* the form feed character (hex 0x0c),
* the line separators characters newline (hex 0x0a) or carriage return (hex 0x0d) characters.

Line separators are special whitespace characters in that they also terminate line comments, whereas normal whitespace does not.

Other Unicode space characters, including vertical tab, are not allowed as whitespace in Java.

=== Required Whitespace ===

Look at the {{Java:static}} method &lt;code&gt;intValue&lt;/code&gt;:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.13: Method declaration'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private static int intValue(String data) {
  return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Whitespace is required between {{Java:private}} and {{Java:static}}, between {{Java:static}} and {{Java:int}}, between {{Java:int}} and &lt;code&gt;intValue&lt;/code&gt;, and between &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;.

If the code is written like this:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.14: Collapsed code'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
privatestaticint intValue(String data) {
  return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

...it means something completely different: it declares a method which has the return type &lt;code&gt;privatestaticint&lt;/code&gt; It is unlikely that this type exists and the method is no longer static, so the above would result in a semantic error.

== Indentation ==
Java ignores all whitespace in front of a statement. As this, these two code snippets are identical for the compiler:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.15: Indented code'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Distance dist = new Distance(
           intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
           intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
  dist.printDistance();
}

private static int intValue(String data) {
  return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.16: Not indented code'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {
Distance dist = new Distance(
intValue(args[0]), intValue(args[1]),
intValue(args[2]), intValue(args[3]));
dist.printDistance();
}

private static int intValue(String data) {
return Integer.parseInt(data);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

However, the first one's style (with whitespace) is preferred, as the readability is higher. The method body is easier to distinguish from the head, even at a higher reading speed.

I really dislike a Hello, World application as a first Java program. 
I propose [[User:Djb//First_Java_Program]] as a replacement for this page.
The first Java class there, and the associated discussions
may look more complicated but I think it will be much more educational and provide a better way of introducing Java as an OO language. This proposed first class also provides many opportunities to introduce other language concepts such as refactoring, overloading, packages, etc., all from a simple, understandable basis. I've not fleshed out the discussions here; I will work on them later...

== Net Beans ==

Hello, I am a user of limited coding experiance by most standards. I was hoping to rely on this (and another tutorial hosted in Wikiversity) to pick up some Java, however, even with a few modifications made by seemingly intelligent reasoning, my IDE, Net Beans does not want to compile your code to the effect promised... or at all really. Someone please re-evaluate this code or add notes for my fellow Net Beans users, thank you. [[User:Zeotronic|Zeotronic]] 01:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

So far we have used Interface Builder to create a very simple interface for our &quot;hello world&quot; example. Now we'll look at it in a bit more detail so that we can see how to build much more complex and useful user interfaces.

==Building a GUI==

We have already discussed the concept of targets and actions in a very general way; now we'll see how Interface Builder makes extensive use of this to connect graphical controls to pieces of code that you write which implement the interesting functionality of your application.

Using &quot;hello world&quot; as a starting point, let's add a simple action to our code so that we can see how this works. The action is very basic - it just sets the font size of the text as a slider control is moved. In Xcode, click on &quot;GCHelloView.h&quot; so that it appears in the editor. Now add the following line to the class definition, below the other methods, but before the '@end' statement:

 - (IBAction)	textSizeAction:(id) sender;

Then do a Save to make sure this change is saved to the file. Here, we have declared the return type of the method to be IBAction. In fact, this is just a macro which is just 'void', but anything tagged as IBAction can be automatically detected by Interface Builder as an ''action routine'', that is, one which can be connected to any control that supports the target/action mechanism. We'll come back to Xcode in a moment to implement this method, but first let's hook it up in IB.

If IB isn't running, start it by double-clicking on 'MainMenu.nib'. Arrange the window in IB so that you can drag the file &quot;GCHelloView.h&quot; from Xcode to IB. This triggers IB to read the file, and so it will pick up the action method and add it to a list of available actions for the GCHelloView object. Next, switch back to the 'Instances' panel, and bring Window to the front by double-clicking its icon (or just click the window if you can see it). Make a bit of room at the bottom of the window by dragging it a little bigger. In the widgets palette, select the Controls panel (second from the left), and drag a horizontal slider control from the palette into the window. Make sure you put the slider in the space you made, not into the GCHelloView.

Select the slider control, and open the Inspector (Tools-&gt;Show Inspector if it's not visible). Make sure the pop-up menu is set to 'Attributes'. Set the attributes as follows:

* minimum - 9.0
* maximum - 72.0
* current - 48.0

Also, check the boxes 'Continuously send action while sliding' and 'Enabled'. The other settings should remain at their default values.

Next we need to give the slider control a target - that is, a connection to the object it should send the action to. IB sets up targets graphically. We control-drag FROM the sender of the action TO the target. A line will be drawn linking the two. Do that now - control-drag FROM the slider TO the GCHelloView. The Inspector will switch to the 'Connections' section and list all of the available action methods for GCHelloView. Highlight 'textSizeAction:' and click 'Connect' to make the connection. (Note - if textSizeAction: doesn't appear in the list, you can add it manually. Select GCHelloView in the 'Classes' list. Use the Inspector Attributes to switch to 'Actions', click 'Add', then type the name of the method - don't forget the colon! You might need to do this, since the earlier dragging of the file into IB, which should handle this for you, doesn't always seem to work reliably. Once you've added the method, try again with the control-drag step).

Save the changes, then return to Xcode. We now need to implement the action method. Find and select the GCHelloView.m file. Add the following method to the body of the implementation:

&lt;pre&gt;
 - (IBAction)	textSizeAction:(id) sender
 {
	[self setText:[self text] withSize:[sender floatValue]];
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[image:HWvers2.png|thumb|right|350px|Extended version of &quot;Hello World&quot; with slider control]]
Now Build and run the project. Drag the slider... the text should change size as you drag.

The above line implements the action. It is called whenever the slider is dragged to a new position, and sends a message to its own setText:withSize: method, passing the existing text ([self text]) and a size which is obtained from the slider's value itself. We set up the range of values in IB to be from 9 to 72 - this becomes the point size of the text. The 'sender' parameter to an action method is always the object that caused the action - in this case the slider. So we can simply call its 'floatValue' method to find out its current value, and simply pass that along as the text size. The change is immediately visible as you drag because we earlier added the line [self setNeedsDisplay:YES] to our setText:withSize: method, which causes Cocoa to call our drawRect: method, which redraws the text using the new size.

While simple, this example is very typical of how all controls interface to pieces of code in your application. You write an action method (which always has an IBAction return type, and a single 'sender' object parameter) in some suitable target object, then hook up that action and target in IB.

==Menu commands==

Menu commands work pretty much the same way as sliders or buttons. They have a target and an action. When the menu item is chosen, it sends the action to the target. You can set them up exactly like we did for the slider - control-drag FROM the menu item TO the target, select the action and click 'Connect'.

There are times when we don't want a menu command to go to a specific fixed target however, but one that depends on the context. For example, we might have an application with multiple similar windows open, such as a document. When the user chooses the 'Copy' or 'Paste' command, it should always target the currently active document. If we had tied this menu command to a specific target, these commands would not work as the user generally expects.

To fix this, Cocoa maintains a 'chain of command' which changes depending on the context. The frontmost window will contain a target which should be the first to respond to a command. If it can, it responds. If not, the command passes to the next object in the chain, which might be another view within the window, or the window itself. If the command can be handled, it is. If not, it passes up again, this time to the application object. If the application can't handle the command, it is discarded and ignored.

The first object in the chain that can respond to a command at any particular moment is called the '''first responder''', and an icon representing this object is shown in the main IB window. So all we need to do is to make it the target of our action, and we have solved the problem of changing targets for menu items. You'll find you can control-drag to this target just as any other targettable object. The 'Actions' list for the first responder lists all of the actions for all objects known to IB. You can link to any action. If the action is found within the current chain of command, the action will find its target and be executed. If the particular action can't be found in the chain of command at a particular time, what happens? Well, if the action is sent, nothing happens, because no-one responds to it, but in fact in this case Cocoa disables the menu item automatically! Thus actions that can't find a target are automatically greyed out, saving us a large part of the job of managing menu enabling as the context changes.

&quot;Hello World&quot; doesn't have multiple windows, so at this stage we can't demonstrate this convincingly, but shortly we'll be making a much more sophisticated application, and this approach will come into its own.

==Resizing Windows==

Run &quot;Hello World&quot;. Try resizing the window. It's probably not the behaviour you would expect - everything remains at a fixed distance from the bottom. Let's look at how we make views size the way we want them.

In Interface Builder, bring Window to the front and select the GCHelloView. Using the Inspector, switch to the 'Size' panel using the pop-up menu. The diagram there indicates which edges of the view should be rigidly linked to the edges of the window, and which can be flexible. By clicking on the links, you can change them from one to the other. GCHelloView should probably change size along with the window, so change the interior links to be flexible, and the exterior ones to be rigid. Now select the slider. Allow it to have a flexible link to the top and right edges, but a rigid link to the left and bottom edges. The interior should be rigid. Save the file and use Xcode to build and run the project. Now, you'll see that the GCHelloView (as shown by its blue border) stretches as you resize the window.

You'll probably notice that the text however, still doesn't seem to behave as we'd probably like, being a fixed distance from the bottom edge of the view. We are used to text remaining at a fixed distance from the TOP edge. The reason for this is that Cocoa's default coordinates follow the underlying Quartz graphics system, in which increasing y values go UP the screen, not down. While this is the mathematical convention, computer programmers are usually used to having things the other way up. Cocoa can allow any view to be ''flipped'' in this manner, using a simple override. So let's change it now.

In Xcode, select GCHelloView.m and add the following method to the implementation:
&lt;pre&gt;
 - (BOOL)  isFlipped
 {
     return YES;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is an override of an NSView method, so we don't need to declare it in our class. We simply return YES to let Cocoa know we'd like this view to have the y coordinate go from top to bottom. Build and run again and you'll see the difference this makes. Because of the choice of y coordinate used in drawRect:, the text will be fairly far down the view - you might like to change that to something like 10 so it's near the top.

This construction method can be used as a survival technique or to create a long-term home.  The practice differs from creating a log cabin in that the logs are typically cut to 12 or 16 inch lengths and instead of being placed end to end are placed much the same as stacking wood to burn. The improvement comes when one uses a type of mortar to create a seal around the wood and acts as though the wood was a brick.
     
Increasing the length of wood can increase the thermal mass of the wall.  However in cold climates the greatest concern would be the ceiling and roof.  This is not an improvised shelter.  While the home can be built for next to nothing, proper construction will require a good saw for extended use.  If the only tool you had was a hatchet you may be better off building a cabin or hogan.

A good combination of clay soil and some type of dried grass can make a great mortar.  This may sound like a poor quality home for people living in &quot;modern housing&quot; but don't be fooled.  If built as to keep water away from the home especially these homes can last hundreds of years.  They have the same failing as all other homes made of wood.  Once the wood is wet termites can infest it.  Wet wood will also draw carpenter ants.  

Structurally, this type of home can be very resilient to bad weather and debris hitting the home.  The outside walls on these homes is very thick.  If you have the time this home can be built for almost no out of pocket expense and can be fitted at some expense with any modern convenience.

Well, &quot;Hello World&quot; will only take us so far. In order to get into more advanced aspects of Cocoa, we'll need to be a little more ambitious. The rest of this book will develop a new application, which will be a simple vector drawing program, a little like MacDraw. While we won't attempt to make this full featured, we will develop enough of the foundation so that you could go on to make it full featured.

The features we will develop are:

* Multiple drawings open at once (document interface)
* Saving and reading drawings from a file
* A palette of tools, such as rectangle, oval, line
* A drawing area allowing selection of objects for editing
* Objects can be resized and moved by dragging
* Objects can be cut and pasted
* An inspector for setting the properties of selected objects
* Changes are undoable
* Drawings can be printed

Writing a full-featured drawing program from scratch is not a small undertaking, though Cocoa is probably a faster route than most. Because we'd like to get to understand as much of Cocoa as possible, those parts of this code that don't contribute to this understanding will be glossed over a little. The full source code can be downloaded however.

==Application design==

Before we code, we must have a clear design in mind. Cocoa provides a lot of the basic infrastructure we'll need, such as a comprehensive document-based interface. However, we'll still have to develop a number of our own objects, since Cocoa is general purpose, and a drawing program is very specific.

We will need a class to embody the actual shapes that we will draw. Each new shape we draw creates a new instance of the object and adds it to a list of objects in the drawing. In fact the drawing is nothing more than a list of the objects it consists of. An array will make an ideal container for the contents of the drawing. By flattening the array to a file, we can easily save drawings. Reading a drawing file is a simple matter of reconstructing the array from the flattened file copy.

Because different shapes can be drawn, we will need different kinds of shape objects. Therefore a generic shape class which contains everything that is common to all shapes is needed, with subclasses of it to represent each different type of shape. The common class can deal with things such as the position and colours of the shape, handle mouse clicks, and so forth. The subclasses only need to provide the actual shapes. We will be using Cocoa's built-in graphics objects, mainly NSBezierPath, to implement the actual shape outlines.

The palette of tools is a user interface for selecting which type of shape will be drawn. One way to implement a tool palette is to use the selected tool to indicate which factory method should be used to make the shape being added. After that, the shape itself handles its own drawing. In fact the case of drawing the shape initially and resizing it later are almost the same, so we can leverage the same code for the two situations.

When we select objects, we will maintain a list of the selected objects. Another Array makes an ideal container for this. When the drawing is displayed, objects that are in the selection array can have the drag handles added. Changes to the selection need to be signalled to the Inspector so that it can update itself to reflect the object state, and so that it knows which object to target when changes are made. We will see how Cocoa makes this straightforward using notifications.

Every change to the list of objects, or to the object itself, needs to be recorded so it can be undone. As we will see, Cocoa has some very powerful features that make Undo quite easy to implement. As long as we design with Undo in mind, making it work is very straightforward.

The ability to print is also straightforward, because the Quartz graphics we will use for rendering is very close to the PDF (Portable Document Format) that is used for printing.

==Getting started==

To get started, return to Xcode and close the HelloWorld project. Choose File-&gt;New Project... In the assistant, find 'Cocoa Document-based application', select it and click 'Next'. Choose a name for the project - I have called it Wikidraw. Choose a path for the project - a good place is the same projects folder you made earlier, for the HelloWorld project. Click 'Finish'. A new project window is opened.

Click 'Build and Go' to compile the project source code, and run the resulting application. This time, an untitled window will be displayed, including the text 'your document contents here'. If you choose File-&gt;New, you'll get a second window, and so on. Unlike HelloWorld, you will see that automatically we have a multi-window application already, and we haven't written any code yet. Quit Wikidraw and return to Xcode.

In the left hand panel, drill down to Wikidraw-&gt;Resources-&gt;MyDocument.nib (in Xcode 4, these document-related files will be named &quot;Document&quot; rather than &quot;MyDocument&quot;). You'll see that we have a 'MainMenu.nib' as we did for HelloWorld, but also MyDocument.nib, which we didn't have before. This file contains the user interface resources for the document windows. MainMenu.nib, as before, contains the menubar and all the menus, but this time it doesn't include a Window. You can open these files in Interface Builder by double-clicking them. Have a look and see how they are different from the earlier case.

In developing Wikidraw, we will stick to these two resource files. Interface elements that pertain to the whole application, like the tool palette and the Inspector, will go in MainMenu.nib. Things that pertain to each document window, such as the view that displays the drawing, will go in MyDocument.nib. In all real applications, you will often create more .nib files as your interfaces develop, but we are trying to keep it fairly simple here. Once you get the general idea, it should be clear how and when to create new .nib files.

The first thing we'll do is customise the menu bar.

Open MainMenu.nib in IB, and double-click the 'MainMenu' icon. A small window containing a menu bar will open. To edit a menu, click its title to show the menu, then click the item to select it. Double-clicking an item selects it so you can edit its text. First go through and change every instance of 'NewApplication' to 'Wikidraw'.

We'll add more here later. Save the file, return to Xcode, build and run. Verify that the changes to the menubar show up.

==Setting up the document view==

Close MainMenu.nib, and open MyDocument.nib. Double-click Window to make it visible and frontmost. Position and size the window where you'd like it to show up in the application. Select and delete the 'Your document content here' text item. As with HelloWorld, drag a CustomView into the window. Position the view at the top left of the window . Choose Layout-&gt;Embed Objects In-&gt;Scroll View. This places the customView inside a scrollable view so that we will be able to scroll the drawing. Drag the scrollview so that it fits the edges of the window. Use the Size inspector to set the scroll view to follow the size of the window by making both interior &quot;springs&quot; flexible (click the straight line--it should become a coiled &quot;spring&quot;), and all the exterior ones rigid (straight). Double-click the CustomView to select it and use the Size inspector to make its width and height both 1500 pixels.

Create a subclass of NSView using the 'Classes' tab of the main window, selecting NSView, then choosing Classes-&gt;Subclass NSView. Type the class name as 'WKDDrawView'. Remember that if you are using XCode 3.0 or greater, Apple changed the way to do this step. In XCode, right click in the folder &quot;Other Sources&quot;, then mouse over &quot;Add&quot;, then &quot;New File...&quot;. Under the Cocoa heading, choose &quot;Objective-C NSView subclass&quot;. Type in your name in place of untitled, and leave the other stuff alone.

Use the Custom Class panel in the inspector to change the class of CustomView to WKDDrawView. (If you need to select the view, double-click it within the scroll view).

Finally, generate files for WKDDrawView (Classes-&gt;Create Files for WKDDrawView, having selected the class in the 'Classes' pane of the main window). Accept the default settings when asked if you want it added to the project. if you are using XCode 3.0 or greater, you can skip this step.

Save the nib file, and build and run it in Xcode. Verify that the window contains working scrollbars.

Assuming that works OK, let's add two simple methods to WKDDrawView.m. We will work in a flipped view, so we need to implement isFlipped, returning YES, and we can optimise drawing a little, by implementing a method called isOpaque, returning YES:

&lt;pre&gt;
 - (BOOL)	isFlipped
 {
	return YES;
 }


 - (BOOL)	isOpaque
 {
	return YES;
 }

&lt;/pre&gt;

Build and Go again to confirm that the scrollbars now start at the top rather than the bottom, and that the view is filled with white rather than the Aqua background stripes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gathering Edibles'''

Depending on your location in the country or world, many types of food could already be available in your surroundings depending on the time of the year.  

Since the purpose of this book is self reliance lets operate with the idea of having a permanent connection to your land and surrounding area.  As you look at the location you are living in.  You need to keep your eyes open on a weekly basis.  New types of fruit and vegetable can make themselves available to you as the seasons progress. Marking on a calendar when and where you harvested will keep you prepared for next year. 

You must avoid the tendancy to over exploit any one food.  This leads to stomach upset very quickly and a poor diet will create health issues as time progresses.  Their have been times when I paid the price for too many green apples or too much yellow wood sorrel.

The list of edibles is incredibly long: Yellow Wood Sorrel, Apples and Crab apples, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, wild carrots, grapes, and currants are just some of my favorites from my area.  Other areas that I have been in offer; coconuts, mango, banana, paw paw, bamboo and sea weed.  Exploration of your area is the only way to get a full knowledge of what is available to you.  

Even the smallest amount of care for these wild plants will pay you back with large dividends.  Remove weeds from around the plants, make sure they get some water in a dry spell and pruning fruiting trees as needed are all quick easy methods of improving your harvest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Standard''' (also known as Type 2) is a Constructed format where the total card pool is restricted by sets.  Normally, this standard format pool consists of cards from the most recent core set and the two most recent expansion blocks.

The core set is currently comprised of the Magic 2011 core set(m11), the Magic 2012 Core set (m12), the Zendikar block and the Scars of Mirrodin block.

Players must have at least a 60-card deck (and optional sideboard containing exactly 15 cards) consisting of cards of any printings that are legal in the current standard format. Players must be able to shuffle their decks without assistance.  Decks (including the sideboard) may contain no more than 4 copies of any card other than basic lands.  In addition, certain cards may be &quot;banned&quot; (the card may not be used). There are currently two banned cards in the Standard Format. Jace, The Mind Sculpter and Stoneforge Mystic.

As of July 15th, 2011, the sets legal in Standard are:

&lt;DL&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''Battle For Zendikar BLOCK'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Battle for Zendikar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;/DL&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''Khans of Tarkir BLOCK'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Khans of Tarkir&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Fate Reforged&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Dragons of Tarkir&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;/DL&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''CORE SET'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Magic Origins&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;/DL&gt;


After January 22nd Standard Legal Sets will consist of

&lt;DL&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''Battle For Zendikar BLOCK'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Battle for Zendikar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Oath of the Gatewatch&lt;br&gt;&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''Khans of Tarkir BLOCK'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Khans of Tarkir&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Fate Reforged&lt;/DD&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Dragons of Tarkir&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;DT&gt;'''CORE SET'''&lt;/DT&gt;

&lt;DD&gt;Magic Origins&lt;/DD&gt;

&lt;/DL&gt;


Since the format now rotates twice as fast with the new block rotation pattern effective with the rotation of Khans of Tarkir on April 8, 2016, decks have a maximum shelf life of one years, meaning that the format is quick to change and easily impacted. There are deck archetypes that have waxed and waned through the years, but maintain their existence in some form or another (prowess white, white black warriors, black blue control, red aggro), while others (usually combo decks) are spawned from the centerpiece card (Hardened Scales, Nantuko Husk), and are thus usually subject to their key card leaving Standard.

The Vintage format allows the use of all cards in the magic cardpool, barring those found in the Unglued/Unhinged sets, and those found on the banned and restricted list.  This list can be found on the link provided above.

A banned card is a card that cannot be played at all.  In vintage, only &quot;athletic&quot; cards, cards which require you to perform some sort of physical feat like flipping a card or spinning a card, and cards that deal with the &quot;ante&quot; are banned.  Ante was how magic was originally played, with players essentially playing each other for a card in the other's deck.  The only other card that is banned from the format is Shahrazad.

If a card is restricted, a deck may only contain one copy of it between the maindeck and the sideboard.  These are cards that are either format-warping, incredibly strong, or as recently declared by Aaron Forsythe in an article, &quot;un-fun&quot;.

&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;Hi guys, this is Surya, &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I'm a proud son, good brother &amp;amp; a great friend other than being a cricketer, cook, guide, software engineer, philosopher, tennis player, guitarist(soon&amp;nbsp;;))&amp;amp; many&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;My father's eldest brother (pedananna) proudly named as Surya Chandra Ra0 Gandreddi. I'm unfortunate to born to my Mom &amp;amp; Dad (:pp) on Febraury, 26th 1981.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I like so many things, out of which I like the most are girls and sports(alphabetical order&amp;nbsp;;)). Cricket is my passion. I play all kinds of sports, and I talk (make friendship) with all kinds of girls ..ssshh.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I have some problems, one of my biggest problem I want to be nice to people. &quot;Kindness is a desire that makes you want to do good things even though you dont get anything in return&quot;. May be this is what I had a bit 

more than any normal guy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I too love. My experience in Love is 1+0.98+0.0004 one-side&amp;nbsp;:) loves, once completely failed.... and almost fall in the second one, and just looking for the third one with two very real bad experiences, wish me all the best.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;I have some drawbacks, one of my biggest drawback is ... unable to give the biggest drawbacks, lemme think.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;Can you read this line=&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT color=white&gt;I'm Modest, by now you must have known that. I always hide things from people, just like this :) /FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkgreen&gt;Watchout this place to know more....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

&lt;TABLE&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;2006, No SENTI&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;I always try to be kind but there are many others who are much worse than you can think of(kind-kinder-kindest).... so practically its tough for me to reach there.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;yeah man,I too love.. some love stories, but all of them are bad experiences but you know what in life there is always a next chance.... so waiting for the next bus *Hum Tum*&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;I have some drawbacks, one of my biggest drawback is ... nope I dont have any.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;Some people say I'm Modest, Is it so? :) .....  &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkblue&gt;Watchout this place to know more....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TABLE&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT color=darkred&gt;I'm getting married this Feb, 9th.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TR&gt;
