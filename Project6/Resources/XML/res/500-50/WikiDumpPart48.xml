      <text xml:space="preserve">The movement is the heart of the watch, the part that actually keeps the time. 

Types of movements:

LCD:  The most common digital.  Uses a Liquid Crystal Display to tell time--Generally black numbers on a silver or gray background, however colors are becoming more common.  Some LCD watches have more than just a basic readout of time, such as the Fossil Big Tic series that have animated seconds digits. 

Stepper-motor Quartz:  The most common type of analog watch.  These have one or more stepper motors that move in precise increments.  A typical watch will have a single stepper motor to drive the hands through a series of gears, while a chronograph may have one for each independent hand.  

LED:  The first type of digital watch, using glowing red numbers to read the time.  These required a large amount of current for a watch--Typically using 2 of the largest watch batteries available would give a year or so of run time, even with the display only active when the button is pushed.  Difficult to read in sunlight.  Obsolete soon after the LCD. 

Tuning fork--Invented by Bulova, most commonly known as the Accutron.  In this watch a tiny tuning fork vibrates at around 300-360 Hz, driving a tiny toothed wheel with a matching number of teeth.  This wheel would turn once per second, and in turn drove the rest of the movement.  Far more accurate than watches available at the time, surpassed by Quartz which could be made both cheaper and more accurate.  Several other watch companies either used Accutron movements or licensed the Accutron patents.  Tuning fork watches can be easily recognised by their completely smooth sweeping second hand.  

Electric/Elecronic:  While these terms would be a technically accurate description for any of the watches above, it is most generally understood to refer to movements with electrically-driven balance wheels.  To avoid confusion, these may be known as electromechanical or balance-wheel electric.   The earliest versions had no electronic components and suffered from contact arcing which limited the life of the watch.  The earliest ones had little practical advantage over automatic watches, and were not particularly reliable.  

Hybrid Quartz:  Either a balance-wheel electric or a tuning fork movement controlled by a quartz crystal. The first Timex quartz was a balance-wheel electric with a quartz module controlling the rate of the escapement.  The first Swiss quartz and the Accutquartz were both tuning-fork based hybrids.  A transitional step before switching to stepper-motor technology.  

Mechanical:  Using the power of a coiled spring to run the watch.  Almost all modern mechanical watches use some form of the lever escapement.  Some inexpensive watches in the 1800's and early 1900's used a cylinder escapement which is both more fragile and less accurate than a lever escapement.  

Lever escapement watches can be divided into pinlever and jeweled-lever, and mechanical watches can be divided into automatic (also known as self-winding) and manual wind.  A few watches use a plastic fork shaped like a jeweled lever.  

A jeweled lever watch has 2 jewels on the portion of the lever that touches the escape wheel.  A jeweled lever movement will almost always have at least 7 jewels--In addition to the jewels on the fork, there will be 2 cap, 2 pivot and an impulse jewel on the escape wheel.  

A pinlever watch will have the main body of the fork below the escape wheel, with hardened steel pins extending upward to a specially shaped escape wheel.  These watches were generally considerably cheaper, as well as less accurate and less durable over time (although likely more forgiving of abuse) than jeweled lever watches.  Typically they would have no jewels, or a single nearly useless cap jewel on the escape wheel.
There were some pinlever watches with a jeweled escapement; these were generally done for marketing reasons rather than for technical merit, since a jeweled lever will help timekeeping far more than a jeweled train.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Subdivision and Such==
Wings 3d is a polygon modeler that incorporates subdivision as one of its core functions. Wings and other modeling packages that subdivide polygonal meshes are often referred to as &quot;subdivision modelers&quot;. Wings is also often called a &quot;box modeler&quot; since most models start out as a cube primitive.

===Types of Subdivision=== 

There are fundamentally three types of subdivision surface styles available for polygon modelers:
&lt;ul&gt;
[[Image:Wings_Subd.png|frame|right|''Left: Smoothed Cube, Centre: Cube Primitive, Right: Faceted.  To achieve the facet type subdivision all the edges on the centre cube were made Hard prior to the Smooth operation. This kept the cube from smoothing out as the one on the left did.'']]
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Simply subdivides (tessellates) the model without doing any smoothing.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smooth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Does the subdivision and smooths the model by displacing the resulting vertices. This makes it look much more organic, which is why subdivision modeling has become so popular for organic modeling.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Metaform shows the smoothed model with the un-smoothed cage floating about it.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
[[Image:Wings_Cube.png|frame|left|''Wings has the ability to do facet and smooth, but currently does not support metaform. To get a feel for metaform modeling, create an object, press the '''Shift+Tab''' key combination for the Quick Smooth Preview then hit the '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' key by itself to lay the wireframe on top of it. This is similar to metaforms, but with true metaforms you would be able to specify the number of smooth levels, and manipulating the un-smoothed cage would give real-time  feedback to the smoothed model so you could see how changes affect the final form.'']]

===To Smooth Or Not To Smooth===

One of the mistakes new modelers often make is subdividing their models too soon, and/or too often.  When modelers smooth too soon and don't get the organic form they were hoping for they then often resort to smoothing again, to make it look well... smoother. Some people will smooth a model three or four times to try and get it to look right. This is almost always a mistake. It creates very bloated models, meaning a high in polygon count, which devour lots of memory needlessly. If you take the time to hand craft in details, then one smooth is likely to give you the results you want, the model will be much more efficient, and it will most likely look better too.

====Hard Edge Modeling: ''Keeping Edges Crisp''====

Often a model will lose desired edges and creases when it is smoothed. Fortunately there are several methods to keep sharp details even on a smoothed model.  There are three basic ways to ensure that an edge will stay sharp.  You can use '''Bevel''' on corners to add a slight chamfer which will help preserve the detail. Or you can add ''control edges'' on either side of edges you wish to remain defined. Sometimes these are called ''mechanical bevels'' and they offer the most control over how a model appears after smoothing.  You can also select the necessary edges and set them to '''Hard'''. Be sure the model export format and the rendering engine you intend to use support hard edges, or you may not get the results you expect.  The added geometry of Bevels or Control Edges on the other hand will always do the trick.

Another reason to use '''Bevel''' instead of hard edges is that they help show off detail. It seems that sharp edges don't show specularity well, making details hard to see. By giving man made objects softer edges via Bevel, it increases their specularity, thereby drawing out the detail that would otherwise be lost. Some online model stores will not even accept models for sale that do not use beveled edges to maintain detail, so avoid hard edges if you can.

And as with smoothing, some people tend to '''Bevel''' too soon in the modeling process. It should be one of the last things you do, unless you are using it to create new base geometry. The reason is that it overcomplicates your model, forcing you to manipulate many more elements than you otherwise would have had to deal with had you not beveled too soon.

We have already seen how to create a subclass of NSView that gives us the ability to draw in a window. Before we get into the hard work of implementing our drawing program, Wikidraw, we'll need to have a better understanding of graphics, and how to use the built-in vector graphics API, to do our bidding.

First let's recap the principles of views and how they draw. When we subclass NSView, we supply a method called drawRect: which Cocoa will call whenever it needs us to draw the content of our view. Any code we place here is executed at that time, so if we place graphics commands here, we can draw in the window. Anything we draw will be confined automatically to the boundary (the ''bounds'') of our view. Within the view, we have our own coordinate system, so we can draw without regard to where our view is within the window - everything is drawn relative to the view's bounds. Normally, coordinates are arranged so that x increases from left to right, and y increases from bottom to top, but by implementing isFlipped, returning YES, we can invert the y axis which will usually be more comfortable for programmers.

The coordinate system within a view starts at 0,0 for the top, left (assuming it is flipped), and increases by 1 for each pixel. However, coordinates are expressed as floating point values, so it's perfectly reasonable to specify a point 2.5 pixels across or 3.5612 pixels down if you want. We are not limited to integer coordinates, in other words. The view will render appropriately, rasterising our graphics using antialiasing so that these fractional pixel positions do have the proper outcome on a screen.

==NSBezierPath==

A key object for drawing any shapes in Cocoa is NSBezierPath. Its name is a little misleading, since while it is able to render bezier paths, it can also handle a variety of shapes including rectangles, circles, lines and polygons. Think of NSBezierPath as a '''list''' of coordinate points that can be joined up by lines, or optionally by curved bezier paths. We can build a list of points, adding them to the path object. We can then draw the outline of the path formed (called ''stroking'') or fill the interior of a closed shape (called ''filling''). A stroked path can have any width we choose. We can either use any colour we choose, or with more effort, a gradient or patterned fill.

Earlier we used a utility function, NSFrameRect, to draw the bounds of the view used in HelloWorld. Behind the scenes, NSFrameRect simply makes a temporary NSBezierPath object with a rectangular shape, then strokes the path. In Wikidraw, we will be using NSBezierPath as our workhorse to draw each shape we create.

Before we do that though, let's just try out a few simple shapes with NSBezierPath to get an idea of how it works. We'll temporarily add some code to WKDDrawView's drawRect: method. Later we'll remove it and put the real code there. To make this easier, we'll put our test code into a method called testDraw, and call it from drawRect.  Add the following code to WKDDrawView.m:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
static NSPoint tp[] = { 10, 10, 400, 100, 300, 200, 10, 150 };

- (void)	testDraw
{
	NSBezierPath* path = [NSBezierPath bezierPath];
	
	[path moveToPoint:tp[0]];
	[path lineToPoint:tp[1]];
	[path lineToPoint:tp[2]];
	[path lineToPoint:tp[3]];
	[path closePath];	
	[[NSColor yellowColor] set];
	[path fill];
	
	[[NSColor blackColor] set];
	[path stroke];
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To make supplying a set of points easier, we just create a static array with alternating x and y values. We can then refer to these points as tp[0], tp[1] and so on. We create an NSBezierPath object called 'path'. We use a class factory method to return an empty object, which is autoreleased, so we don't need to retain or release it, just use it and forget it.

We form the path using the moveToPoint:/lineToPoint: methods, finally closing the shape using closePath. Then we set yellow as the drawing colour and ask the path to fill itself. Then we set black and ask the path to stroke itself.

Next we need to call our method from drawRect: so it gets drawn when the view is refreshed. We also need to do one other thing. Though we have signalled that our view is opaque, we do need to erase the part of the background we are refreshing to avoid problems when we scroll. The 'rect' parameter passed to drawRect: is the area that is to be redrawn, so we set the colour white and erase this rect using the utility NSRectFill. Then we call our testDraw method.

&lt;pre&gt;
 - (void)	drawRect:(NSRect) rect
 {
	[[NSColor whiteColor] set];
	NSRectFill( rect );

	[self testDraw];
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add this code then Build and Go. Verify that the shape is drawn and that it works correctly when the view is scrolled. Now you have a basic mechanism for experimenting with NSBezierPath, you might like to explore some of its other methods, such as curveToPoint:controlPoint1:controlPoint2: which is how bezier curves are specified. You can also set rectangles and ovals in one go. Try altering the stroke width. Look at the documentation for NSBezierPath to see what else it can do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Nature of Edge Loops==

''Edge Loop'' is a term you will see used often in polygon modeling circles. It is often confusing to new users just what edge loops are and what their significance to modeling is. Edge loops can be thought of in two senses:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A series of edges connecting vertices that are shared by four faces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the aesthetic sense, the controlling elements that define the overall form of the object you are trying to model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

In the first sense they are important to Wings because if you maintain them well you can breeze up and down the edge loop chain with the '''F3''' and '''F4''' keys to do all sorts of tweaks and adjustments in no time. Let them fall apart and you'll be selecting things manually by hand constantly to make such adjustments.

But it's deeper than that. It has to do with how the overall form of the model will eventually turn out; whether or not it flows. I am told that Bay Raitt first coined the term as a way to create and maintain overall aesthetic control over a model, to use them to mimic the structure of the object, such as muscles.
&lt;!--There is a whole section on the use of edge loops in an article written by Bay Raitt and Greg Minter located at http://www.izware.com/news/indexa446.html. I suggest you read it in it's entirety. (Digital Sculpting Techniques by Bay Raitt and Greg Minter © Nichimen Graphics, 1998.) NOTE TO EDITORS: THE LINK IS DEAD--&gt;

So you can see that there are edge loops and there are edge loops. What I mean by that is that there are the actual loops themselves, composed of a series of edges all joined together at non-pole intersections, and there are the edge loops that define the form and nature of your model&lt;!--, as Bay Raitt describes in his excellent treatise--&gt;. Learning about the former is relatively easy and is necessary in order to develop the latter. But the real power and beauty of edge loops is in the latter, in the way they control and define the form and detail of the model. Here is where the true art occurs.

As stated before, technically, edge loops are a series of edges joined together at non-pole intersections. A non-pole intersection is an intersection of four edges at a given vertex. This is why quads usually help maintain edge loops, they help minimize poles. The edges that encircle an arm are edge loops.&lt;!--But if you look at the illustrations in Mr. Raitt's article, you will see there are other more important loops involved in the arm that link it to the chest and beyond. But that gets more into the artistic aspect, which I am not well qualified to discuss. So, back to the physical world.--&gt;

In Wings, there are tools that let you take advantage of edge loops in your modeling. You can use '''Loop Cut''' to cut off parts of the model when needed. You can select by edge loops and by edge rings (series of opposing edges of adjacent quads), and then work with that selection. You can use the '''F3''' and '''F4''' keys to march up and down a chain of edge loops to do rapid model adjustments. And of course there is the all-important central edge loop.

The central edge loop is important if you want to use '''Mirror''' or '''Virtual Mirror''' to speed up your modeling. If you maintain your central edge loop, the loop that runs entirely around the long axis of your model, then you will be able to model on one half of the model, '''Loop Cut''' off the other half, and then '''Mirror''', which will cut your modeling time in half. By maintain, I mean to keep the edges straight and not have it interrupted by poles. The first point is an absolute requirement, or very strange things will happen when you mirror. You can work around the second point. If when you go to select the loop it only partially encircles your model because of pole interruptions, you can manually select other parts to get a full loop for the '''Loop Cut''' operation.

Poles are vertices where more or less than four edges converge. An edge loop can only extend past a vertex at which four edges come together. If you think of a polygonal mesh as a city map with edges for streets, faces for city blocks and vertices for junctions, then drawing an edge loop means going straight on at four-way junctions and stopping at any others.

Keep in mind that quads (faces with four edges) do not ensure the absence of poles. To demonstrate this, create a cube and smooth it once. Now select an edge one level down from the top vertex. Do a '''Select''' | '''Edge Loop'''. The selected loop will not run all the way around the object, despite the fact that it is made entirely of quads. Examine where it stopped and you will see that there is indeed a three edged pole present where it stopped. Connect that vertex to the top most vertex (thus creating two triangles) and try the experiment again. The edge loops now runs on longer, despite the fact that there are now triangles in the model. Why? Because there are now four
edges	at 	that 	intersection; you have eliminated one pole, which was not necessarily a good thing to do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Winged Edge Topology==
One of the reasons Wings works so well with edge loops and edge rings is the fact that it is based on a topological data structure called ''winged edge topology''.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:WingedEdgeTopo.jpg|right]] --&gt;Winged edge topology is a method that mathematically defines all elements in a model by their relationships to other elements of the model. This is done by a set of tables; specifically, face, edge and node tables.

In the figure on the right, I have selected one face (Face 71) and then switched to Edge Mode to select its component edges. Similarly, if we had just selected Edge 72 and then done an edge loop selection, Wings would have selected edges 60, 68, 28, and the others on the back of the model that we can not see, to complete the loop. For a more detailed description of the winged edge data structure you can read The Winged Edge Data Structure by Dr. Ching-Kuang Shenefound here: http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/model/winged-e.html

The Status Line of Wings tells us that Face 71 is encircled by edges 9, 16, 70 and 72. (Note that newer versions of Wings place this information in a string at the top left of the workspace.) It only knows this because the winged edge topology exists to provide the information.

It is beyond the scope of a User's Manual to get into a thorough discussion of the winged edge data structure. It is enough to know that Wings is based on this data structure and it is used to make and manipulate selection sets very rapidly. You can also find winged edge topology illustrated from a geographic point of view here: http://www.bequia.swinternet.co.uk/edgeex.html

===Reference===
To use the commands in the menu, select one or more vertices and press RMB.
====Axes====
Many commands require that you select an axis from the menu. This axis defines the direction or orientation for the command.

In addition to the three world axes&amp;mdash;X, Y and Z&amp;mdash;many commands work with vertex normals, custom axes, default axes and most recently used axes.

If you specify vertex normals as the axis (by selecting '''Normal'''), each selected vertex uses its individual normal. Otherwise, the specified direction/orientation is used by all selected vertices.

Custom axes can be specified only when advanced menus are enabled. For details about this feature, see [[/The Wings3D Command Reference Guide/Advanced Menus|Advanced Menus]].

A default axis is an axis that you define in advance to use later. To define the default axis, use the '''Tools''' | '''Set Default Axis''' in the main menu. This is done in two stages: first you specify the actual axis, and then the point of origin for that axis. A default axis is stored until you redefine it. To recall the default axis for a vertex operation, such as '''Move''', select '''Default Axis''' from the vertex operations menu.

The '''Last Axis''' menu item recalls the axis you used during your most recent operation.
====Move, Rotate and Scale====
Moving, rotating or scaling are straightforward operations.

To move the selection, specify the axis you want to move it along. For details about axes, see above.

To rotate the selection, specify the pivot axis. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (center of rotation) is set automatically as well.

'''Scale Uniform''' scales the selection in all directions at once. If you use custom axes, specify the pivot point (scaling center). This can be used to quickly snap a vertex somewhere.

'''Scale Axis''' scales the selection along the axis you specify. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (scaling center) is set automatically as well.

'''Scale Radial''' scales sideways around the axis you specify, but not along it. Each vertex stays on the plane perpendicular to the specified axis. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (scaling center) is set automatically as well.

====Extrude====
Creates an edge loop that splits the edges connected to each selected vertex, and moves the vertex along the axis you specify, creating a &quot;spike&quot;.

====Flatten====
Puts the selected vertex or vertices on a plane perpendicular to the axis you specify. Can be used to make areas of the model planar or as a snapping tool.
Has three modes depending on which mouse button you click the command with:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;LMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Use one of the world axes, the default axis or the last axis. With advanced menus enabled, right-clicking an axis label lets you choose the point that the target plane must pass through.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;MMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Specify two things: a custom axis (for the plane normal) and a custom point that the target plane must pass through.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;RMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Specify a custom axis for the plane normal. The target plane passes through the center of the selection, so it doesn't make sense to use this option with one vertex selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
====Intersect====
Advanced aligning, projection and snapping tool. Requires advanced menus.
Has three modes depending on which mouse button you click the command with:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;LMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Projects the selected vertex or vertices along an axis onto a plane. Specify the axis first and the plane next.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;MMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Arranges the selected vertices along the specified line. The positions and spacing between the vertices are determined as follows: Wings puts parallel planes through each vertex and positions the vertices where their planes intersect the specified line. Specify two things: the normal of the resulting planes and the line that runs through them (and &quot;marks&quot; vertex positions).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;RMB&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;Collects all selected vertices at the point where a custom line intersects a custom plane. Specify four things:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The direction of the line&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The point that the line must pass through&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The normal of the plane&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The point that the plane must pass through&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

====Connect====
[[Image:Spiral.PNG|right]]
Creates edges that connect the selected vertices as long as the vertices share a face. Tends to create quads when given a choice. For example, in the image on the right, a guiding edge loop has been created manually. Here, '''Connect''' will create spiraling threads to try and conform to that loop. Without that first loop, '''Connect''' will make closed loops that go all the way round the cylinder.

====Tighten====
Averages the positions of the selected vertices, taking into account the vertices that surround the selection.

As you drag the mouse, Wings uses percentages to show the strength of '''Tighten'''. At 100%, you get the most tension-free surface that the current iteration of '''Tighten''' can produce. If you still want less tension, do another '''Tighten'''.
You can use it to gently smooth out regions where you've made changes in the surface too harsh, by tightening specific areas slightly.

====Bevel====
Creates a face in place of each selected vertex, putting the vertices of the new face on the edges that shared the original vertex. Drag the mouse to slide the face along those edges.
Bevel has no effect on vertices where only two edges meet (a single edge cut in two). Such vertices should be eliminated, by the way, using '''Dissolve''' or '''Collapse''' (or '''Cleanup''' in body mode).

====Dissolve====
Removes the vertex or vertices, adjusting the faces and edges associated with it accordingly and leaves you in face selection mode.

====Collapse====
Removes the vertex. Unlike '''Dissolve''', '''Collapse''' leaves you in vertex selection mode so that you can continue to select and eliminate vertices without having to switch modes.

====Crumple====
Moves the selected vertices at random speed along the specified axis. With the '''Random''' option, direction is also random.
Good for adding &quot;noise&quot;.

====Inflate====
Pushes/pulls selected vertices away from/towards a center using a falloff radius to decrease strength with distance. Vertices outside the radius reverse their direction.
Left-clicking the command uses the center of the selection and the distance from it to the furthest selected vertex as the radius. Right-clicking the command (with advanced menus enabled) lets you specify the center and the radius.

====Taper====
Scales up sideways whatever is selected up the specified axis and scales down sideways whatever is selected down the axis. Scale strength increases linearly from the selection center.

====Twist====
Twists the selected vertices proportionally along the specified axis around the selection center.

====Torque====
Twists the selected vertices proportionally along the specified axis. Unlike '''Twist''', this operation always uses ''world'' axes that intersect at the origin (X=Y=Z=0).

====Vertex Color====
Opens a dialog box where you can specify a color for the selected vertices. The specified color is strongest at the target vertices and fades out towards surrounding vertices.

'''Note:''' A vertex cannot have a color and a UV coordinate at the same time.

====Bend====
'''Bend''' is a family of tools that deform the selected vertices along a curve. '''Bend''' is available only if advanced menus are enabled.

There are 3 types of bend deformation depending on which mouse button you click the '''Bend''' command with: Plastic Bend, Pivot Bend and TopRad Bend.

=====Plastic Bend=====
Click '''Bend''' with '''LMB''' to go into Plastic Bend mode. In this mode, you put an imaginary rod through your selection and bend the rod. The selection follows the curvature of the rod. To visualize what Plastic Bend does, find a ballpoint pen and take out the ink reservoir and the spring. Put the spring in the middle of the reservoir and wrap the reservoir round the side of a cup. The spring follows suit.

In this real-life example, the ink reservoir represents the rod that you use with Plastic Bend, and the spring represents your vertex selection. Note that the length of the rod stays the same, only the curvature changes.

The bend amount is specified in degrees. At 0 degrees, the rod is straight. At 180 degrees, the center and both ends are located on the line you specify. If you extend the curvature of the rod, you will get a circle or a flat spiral.

Specify three things for Plastic Bend:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod center&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point that marks the middle of the rod.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod top&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point where the positive extreme end of the rod is located. The other end is located opposite it at the same distance from the center. The rod top does not mean that bending ends there. The curvature remains constant even past this point. The rod top and bottom are simply the points that will find themselves on a straight line passing through them and the rod center at a 180-degree bend.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bend normal&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the direction of a line that passes through the center. At a 180-degree bend, the rod center, the rod top and the rod bottom are all located along this line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=====Pivot Bend=====
Click '''Bend''' with '''MMB''' to go into Pivot Bend mode. In this mode, you also have a rod, but you use it differently. First you specify where the rod is located and how it is curved, and then you stretch the vertex selection proportionally along it.

To continue our ink reservoir and spring analogy, you first wrap the reservoir with the spring on it round the side of a cup and hold it there, and then start stretching the spring. The stretching spring follows the curvature of the ink reservoir.

The bend amount is specified in degrees. At 0 degrees, the vertex selection is flattened about the rod center. At other values, it is stretched along the rod curve. If you extend the curvature of the rod, you will get a circle, a helix (spring shape) or a 3D spiral.

Specify four things for Pivot Bend:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod center&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point that marks the middle of the rod.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod top&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point where the positive extreme end of the rod is located. The other end is located opposite it at the same distance from the center. The rod top does not mean that bending ends there. The curvature remains constant even past this point.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pivot axis&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This axis defines how the final bent rod will be oriented. As we have pointed out, the resulting curvature can be a circle, a helix or a 3D spiral. If it’s a circle, then the pivot axis is perpendicular to the circle’s plane. If it’s a helix or 3D spiral, then the pivot axis is a line that this helix or spiral coils around.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pivot location&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point through which the pivot axis runs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=====TopRad Bend=====
Click '''Bend''' with '''RMB''' to go into TopRad Bend mode. In this mode, you first define the curvature of the rod and then stretch the flattened selection along the rod, as in Pivot Bend. However, you define the curvature in the same way as for Plastic Bend&amp;mdash;you specify a line that runs through the center, and both ends of the curved rod.
The bend amount is specified in degrees. At 0 degrees, the vertex selection is flattened about the rod center. At other values, it is stretched along the rod curve. If you extend the curvature of the rod, you will get a circle or a 2D spiral.

Specify three things for TopRad Bend:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod center&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point that marks the middle of the rod.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rod top&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash;This is the point where the positive extreme end of the rod is located. The other end is located opposite it at the same distance from the center. The rod top does not mean that bending ends there. The curvature remains constant even past this point.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bend normal&lt;/b&gt;&amp;mdash; This is the direction of a line that passes through the center. The rod is bent in such a way that the rod center, the rod top and the rod bottom are all located along this line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

====Bend Clamped====
Bend Clamped has the same functionality as Bend and the same three modes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend Clamped Plastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend Clamped Pivot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend Clamped TopRad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
See above for details.
The difference is that Bend Clamped lets you set limits for rod curvature. In addition to the Bend options, Bend Clamped requires that you specify two more:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top Clamp Point&amp;mdash;This is a point ''up'' the rod (or up the rod extension) at which the rod stops curving and continues as a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom Clamp Point&amp;mdash;This is a point ''down'' the rod (or down the rod extension) at which the rod stops curving and continues as a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Blocked from adding chapter to Ecology on 'Conservation Managaement' ==

I'm sorry if I have done something for mistake, but I can't see how could I prevent you from writing such chapter. Have I deleted something or have you seen messages about IP block? Please let me know because I don't know how can I help you. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:57, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

: I unblocked this IP. Is everything ok now? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:03, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== Applied Ecology ==

You don't need to transfer anything - just treat [[Applied Ecology]] as new book's table of contents. Name book subchapter like &lt;tt&gt;Applied Ecology/Introduction&lt;/tt&gt;, you will be able to link to them writing &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Introduction|Introduction]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. After you write the TOC, add book to a bookshelf and [[template:new]]. I don't think you need any special preparations if you read naming policy.

For your conveniece, you can use [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Navigation|navigational templates]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:57, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== Blocks ==

Your network must be often used by Wikibooks vandals. Please take my apologies for all unconvenience, if you such situations will happen again (I hope not), please visit our IRC channel or send me an e-mail with blocked IP number and I will unblock it.

By the way, I made a small edit to TOC of your book to shorten it (it works the same as before). If you don't like my change, you can revert me. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:40, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

== Links ==

I guess your problem is that [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment]] has no link to &quot;Environmental Evaluation&quot;? Such situation appears when there &quot;parent&quot; page does not exist. If you look at your TOC you'll see that you have [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Valuation]] chapter, whereas [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment]] is looking for page named [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation]]. You just need to fix one letter in one of these two pages title (you probably are able to use &quot;move&quot; function now so it would be easy).

When it comes to links - well, I don't know if it is possible to hide two first parts of link, I haven't heard of such possibility. You have two solutions: either link like: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment|Environmental Impact Assessment]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment|Environmental Impact Assessment]] (note pipe &quot;|&quot; sing dividing &quot;address&quot; and &quot;link text&quot;) or change names of these two paragraphs to &quot;flat&quot;. You don't have to name a chapter &quot;Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment&quot;. You can just call it &quot;Applied Ecology/Environmental Impact Assessment&quot;. Both conventions are correct, you can use the one you find more convenient. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:00, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Graphics_-_Drawing_with_Quartz|Previous Page: Graphics - Drawing with Quartz]] | [[../Implementing_Wikidraw|Next Page: Implementing Wikidraw]]

By now we have seen that Cocoa supports a &quot;document based&quot; multiple window type of application, which we will be basing our drawing program, Wikidraw, on. A better understanding of this will help us work through our design implementation.

A document is not itself a window. A window is used to ''view'' the contents of the document, and in many straightforward applications, there is a one-to-one mapping from NSDocument, the class that manages the document, and NSWindow, the window class. However, this is not the only approach - an application could offer several alternative ways of looking at a document, and therefore support more than one window per document. This is one reason why two different objects are used.

In Wikidraw, we will subclass NSDocument so that we have a place to store our drawing data as we draw it, and a place to place the various actions that we will need, such as Cut and Paste, etc. The view in our window simply provides a means of displaying the current state of the document. Ideally, we'd like to minimise the interdependence between the two classes, so that the internal workings of the document are not exposed to the view, and vice versa, in accordance with the principle of encapsulation. Because the view provides not just the drawing of the objects, but also the interaction with the user, the view will need to have some knowledge of the objects, so that it can pass on mouse clicks and so forth to them.

==Delegation and protocols==

Cocoa makes much use of a common design pattern called delegation. This is where an object relies on another object to supplement some of the details about its state, etc. The helper object is known as the ''delegate'' of the first object. Unlike subclassing, the delegate can be any other suitable object, and the runtime binding of methods means that the original object only needs to have the vaguest knowledge about the delegate to get information from it.

In Wikidraw, we can make the document a helper of our view. That way, the view can ask its delegate for basic information such as the list of objects in the drawing, or the list of selected objects, without requiring too much knowledge about the document object itself. Both objects agree to conform to a ''protocol'' for exchanging information. This is merely an agreed convention for some of the method names. Because the protocol is just a casual agreement, it's called an ''informal protocol''. Objective-C supports a stricter type of protocol, called a ''formal protocol'', using the '@protocol' keyword, but we won't be using that here.

==Implementing MyDocument==

In setting up our document-based application, Xcode and Interface Builder have already provided a starting point for us, a class called 'MyDocument'. This is a subclass of NSDocument that we will use to manage each Wikidraw document. If you find this file in XCode (Wikidraw-&gt;Classes-&gt;MyDocument.h) and select it, you'll see that it's an empty subclass of NSDocument. Select the .m file to show the current implementation. It contains a number of skeletal methods to get you started, though enough has been included to make the basics actually work, such as showing the window.

Now we need to add some data members and methods to MyDocument.h so that it can start to handle the task of managing our drawing.

&lt;pre&gt;
@interface MyDocument : NSDocument
{
	NSMutableArray*	_objects;
	NSMutableArray*	_selection;
}

/* drawing maintenance */

- (void)		addObject:(id) object;
- (void)		removeObject:(id) object;
- (NSArray*)	objects;

/* selection maintenance */

- (void)		selectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		deselectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		selectAll;
- (void)		deselectAll;
- (NSArray*)	selection;

/* clicks */

- (id)			objectUnderMousePoint:(NSPoint) mp;

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

We'll add more later, but these are the basic methods we'll need. There are two data members, each a mutable array. One contains all the objects in the drawing, the other just the objects in the selection. When we create a new object, it is added to the _objects list using addObject:, if we delete an object, it is removed using removeObject: We can make these actions undoable easily by recording the state of the _objects array before each of these operations. We'll come to that later, but for now it's only important to understand that to make Undo work simply, defining a couple of obvious places where the data is changed is needed. We'll do the same in our actual objects where they are edited, for example by having their size or position changed.

The selection works similarly. Objects are added to the selection array or removed from it. When the view comes to draw the drawing, it checks both arrays. If an object is found in both, it &quot;knows&quot; that the object should be drawn in its selected state. The object itself handles its own drawing, so all that is needed is for the view to request that it is drawn with selection highlighting or not. This way, the view simply acts as a mediator between the document, which maintains WHICH objects are selected, and the actual objects, which know HOW to portray the selected state. The view itself is not interested in what is selected. We'll see that this approach is quite straightforward and elegant, though it is not the only possible one. (A common alternative is for the selected state to be a boolean flag within each stored object, but that isn't usually the best approach in an application like this. Many document-level commands apply to the set of selected objects, so to implement these with our scheme involves a simple iteration of the _selection array. Using the flag approach, we'd have to go through the entire list, checking which objects had the flag set, and ignoring the others. In general this can hamper performance once the drawing gets large).

The 'objectUnderMousePoint:' method is provided as a simple way for the view to determine what was clicked. The view itself will handle the basic mouse events, such as clicking and dragging, and this method allows it to determine which object the operation is dealing with. Once it has that information, the view is able to implement the clicks and drags by simply handing them off to the object itself, which knows what to do (resize, move, etc). The document doesn't need to know what the user is doing, it just needs to track what's in the drawing. You'll see that we are pushing as much of the 'smarts' into the drawing objects themselves as possible.

==Saving and restoring from files==

A key ability of a document is to convert its internal representation to and from a file representation of the same data. You'll see in MyDocument.m that two skeleton methods to do this have been provided:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSData*)   dataRepresentationOfType:(NSString*)  aType
- (BOOL)       loadDataRepresentation:(NSData*) data ofType:(NSString*) aType
&lt;/pre&gt;

These are overrides from NSDocument, so are not declared in our class definition. The first is responsible for saving to a file, the second reading in a file. The 'type' string is used when we have more than one type of file we can read and write to&amp;nbsp;— many real applications will support different formats. Here we won't, we'll just have our own. The string passed is actually the file extension of the file, so if you opened a JPEG file, the type would be the string &quot;jpg&quot;.

So what do we do to make the file representations, or read from a file? It's easy. Cocoa supports this using something called an archiver. Most objects can be archived, meaning that they already know how to read and write themselves to a file stream. Doing this requires no more than writing values to a dictionary using a key, which we already know how to do. Each object in the drawing is asked to archive itself, so it must record as much information as necessary to completely recreate that object later&amp;nbsp;— its position, size, colour, etc. Each value is given a unique key, usually just a string. When the file is read back in later, each object is reinstantiated and given the opportunity to re-establish its data values from the stream. Using the same keys, the values are read back in, thus restoring the object to the saved state.

At the document level, all we need to do is to archive the '_objects' array. When an array is archived, all of the objects it contains are also automatically archived. We'll find that at this level, there is almost nothing to do&amp;nbsp;— all the hard work is, once again, done by the drawing object itself. The selection state is not saved, so we don't need to care about that.

Since the entire _objects array will be recreated from the file, MyDocument needs a way to set the whole array in one go. The obvious method would be one called setObjects, so let's add that to our definition.

 - (void)		setObjects:(NSMutableArray*) arr;

For now, this is enough to get started on our document implementation. We need to expand the methods we've declared in the implementation file. One way is to cut and paste them from the header, then add curly braces to turn them into actual methods. Do that now.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
@implementation MyDocument

- (id)		init
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self)
	{
		_objects = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
		_selection = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    }
    return self;
}

{
	[_objects release];
	[_selection release];
	[super dealloc];
}

    return @&quot;MyDocument&quot;;

    [super windowControllerDidLoadNib:aController];
}

	return YES;

	id				obj;
	
	while( obj = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ([obj containsPoint:mp])
			return obj;
	}
	
	return nil;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The implementation is pretty straightforward. In the init method, we allocate _objects and _selection. We need a dealloc method to make sure they get released when our document is deallocated.

addObject: and removeObject: simply map to the NSMutableArray methods, though we additionally check that we are not adding the same object more than once. When an object is removed, it is also deselected, to make sure that we don't leave a stale reference in the selection list to an object that has gone altogether. objects simply returns the array itself as a read-only type (this gets around Objective-C's lack of a 'const' operator.) setObjects: replaces the entire array, which we'll use in a moment when we read a file.

The selection methods work similarly. selectObject: merely adds the object to the selection list, first checking that it isn't already selected and is indeed part of the drawing. deselectObject: removes it from the selection list. selectAll makes the selection list match the entire drawing using setArray:, and deselectAll simply makes the list empty.

The objectUnderMousePoint: method gives us a chance to use an iterator. We iterate over the objects array, calling containsPoint: on each object. As soon as one of them return YES, the method returns that object. It is up to the object itself to implement containsPoint: in a sensible manner. Why do we iterate here in reverse? It's because in the drawing, objects can be placed such that they overlap. To the user, this will appear as if some objects are behind others. The view will draw the list of objects in forward order, meaning that objects at the end of the list will get drawn 'on top of' any earlier ones. By detecting clicks in reverse, we make sure that we find the topmost objects before any underlying ones, if the click occurs on an overlapping area. It means that the user gets the expected behaviour—they can click on what they can see. If nothing gets clicked, nil is returned.

The methods that implement archiving and dearchiving a file are straightforward. Most of the magic is hidden from us at this level. We use NSKeyedArchiver's factory method 'archivedDataWithRootObject:' to pass it our objects array. It does its magic and returns us an NSData object, which we return. That's all we need to do, Cocoa handles the rest, writing the data to the file. When we go the other way, we use NSKeyedUnarchiver's 'unarchiveObjectWithData:' factory method to reverse the process. What we get back is an autoreleased NSArray object (because we saved an NSArray object earlier). You may ask how the archiver and unarchiver know how to encode or decode WKDShape objects. The answer is simple: they don't. As usual in object oriented programming, the WKDShape object is responsible for encoding and decoding itself. The (un)archiver will try to call corresponding methods of WKDShape which are not yet implemented. This is done in the chapter [[Programming_Mac_OS_X_with_Cocoa_for_beginners/Archiving|Archiving]]. At this point you may save a document and open a saved document, but it will be blank and not contain any shapes.

However we need the array obtained from the unarchiver to be mutable, so we use mutableCopy: to make a mutable copy. This is passed to the setObjects: method replacing any objects we already have. Because we made an explicit copy, we must release the object here. setObjects: retains it anyway, so it still sticks around, but we don't want to let it remain retained twice, otherwise we'll have a potential memory leak. setObjects: also deselects everything, since we are starting with a new freshly opened document—this just makes sure that no stray objects are left selected. This could happen after a revert, for example.

==File types==

How does Cocoa know what type of file we are saving or reading? It doesn't yet - if we Build and Go now, choosing Open gives us the file picker but we won't be able to pick any files. To set this, in the left hand panel of Xcode, Drill down from Targets to Wikidraw. Select Wikidraw and choose Get Info. In the dialog that opens, select the 'properties' tab. In the 'Document types' area, edit the first and only item so that Name is 'Wikidraw drawing', Extensions is set to 'wkd', OSTypes is set to '.wkd' and class is MyDocument. This sets up a mapping between files of type'.wkd', which will be our drawing file type, and the MyDocument class, which knows how to handle that file type. (Please note: dataRepresentationOfType: is Deprecated in Mac OS X v10.4. Use dataOfType:error: instead. for save to work)

While we are here, lets also change a few other settings. Change 'Identifier' to 'com.wiki.wikidraw', and Creator to 'WIKD'.

Close the Get Info window, and Build and Go again. We still have no files available in the open dialog, because there are no files with an extension .wkd yet. So let's save one. Do a Save As and save the file as 'wikidrawtest' or something similar. The open window should change to the name you choose. Now when you try an Open, you should be able to select and open this file. If you locate the file in the Finder, do a Get Info, you should be able to check that it does indeed have an extension of '.wkd'. Note that the file will not contain anything yet, since we don't have enough of the application built to actually create any drawings.

We'll tackle that next.

So far we have managed to get a very long way with hardly any code. However, our application still doesn't do much, and doesn't look too much like a real drawing program. So now we'll write the code at the heart of the application, which implements the actual shapes we can draw. We have deferred a lot of functionality by design to this class, so this will be a moderately complex object. However, once we are done, we'll have something very close to a drawing program!

Up until now we have used Interface Builder to create skeletal code files for us. This time, we'll have to do it manually. In XCode, find the file 'WKDDrawView.m' and select it. Then choose File-&gt;New File... In the assistant, locate and select 'Objective-C class', then click Next. Change the filename to 'WKDShape.m', then click Finish. A new .h and .m file are added to the 'Classes' list. You'll see that WKDShape is a subclass of NSObject, which is ideal.

==Design of the shape class==

Each shape will be an instance of the WKDShape class, but each type of shape will be a subclass, for example WKDRectShape and WKDOvalShape. In the Shape class itself, we need to put as much functionality that is common to all shapes as possible. In fact we'll see that this is almost all of it.

What properties does each shape need? There are graphical properties such as the colours to fill and stroke the shape, and whether the shape has a stroke or fill, and what thickness the stroke should be. There are geometrical properties such as the location and size of the shape, and if we were implementing rotation, a rotation angle (for simplicity we won't be doing this, but you might like to consider how it could be added as a further exercise). What we don't need to include is state information such as whether the object is selected - it doesn't need to know and it's already taken care of by the document/view combination.

Cocoa embodies colours in the NSColor object, so we can specify our stroke and fill colours using these. We can use the absence of either (a value of nil) to mean not to perform a stroke or a fill, allowing us to have hollow as well as solid shapes. The stroke thickness is a simple floating point value. The position of the object can be specified using an NSPoint, and the size using an NSSize. We'll decide that the location of the object refers to the top, left corner of its bounding box. An NSRect contains both an NSPoint specifying the origin of the rect, and an NSSize for its width and height, which is exactly what we need. A shape is drawn so that it fits this bounding box rectangle.

So let's add these data members:

&lt;pre&gt;
@interface WKDShape : NSObject
{
	NSRect		_bounds;
	NSColor*	_strokeColour;
	NSColor*	_fillColour;
	float		_strokeWidth;
}

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

These immediately suggest the first set of methods we'll need, which simply set and get these properties. We also, for convenience, define some methods for setting the location and size independently. We also know from developing our document class that we need a 'containsPoint' method, returning a BOOL value:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)          bounds;
- (void)            setBounds:(NSRect) bounds;
- (void)            setLocation:(NSPoint) loc;
- (void)            offsetLocationByX:(float) x byY:(float) y;
- (void)            setSize:(NSSize) size;
- (BOOL)            containsPoint:(NSPoint) pt;

- (NSColor*)        fillColour;
- (void)            setFillColour:(NSColor*) colour;
- (NSColor*)        strokeColour;
- (void)            setStrokeColour:(NSColor*) colour;
- (float)           strokeWidth;
- (void)            setStrokeWidth:(float) width;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now let's think about what we need the shape object to do. The most obvious thing is to draw itself, so we'll need a 'draw' method. This will be called by the view for each object in turn. In addition, the view will inform us whether we are selected or not, so we need a way to pass this information in so we can draw accordingly.

The next thing is user interaction with the object. The view will pass us clicks and drags, allowing the user to resize or reposition an object directly. We can figure out ourselves which operation is intended from where the mouse point was initially clicked. A view handles mouse operations by implementing three methods for mouse down, mouse dragged and mouse up. We can follow the same model here, making it very easy for the view to pass these things on to us. We'll need to track what operation we are performing (resize or reposition) so that when we receive a drag message, we continue doing the right thing! We'll track this state in a simple integer data member.

When an object is selected, it is drawn with &quot;selection handles&quot; around its edges. If we drag a handle, we want the size of the shape to be altered. If we drag the object itself, it should remain the same size but move to a new position. When a handle is dragged, the opposite handle becomes an 'anchor point' for the resize, so we need a way to distinguish between handles to work out which anchor to use. We'll use the integer data member we already have for this - its value will be set to the number of the handle we originally clicked. We'll also need to record the original mouse click position so we can work out how far things have been moved. We'll provide a separate method for drawing the handles as sensible factoring of code, as well as a number of utility methods for drawing and hit testing each handle.

Finally we need to allow subclasses to actually provide the detail of the shape being drawn. We could rely on subclasses reimplementing draw as needed, but a better approach which keeps subclasses smaller and simpler is to ask for the shape's path as an NSBezierPath object, then implement everything else in the common shape object. All the subclass needs to do is to use the current value of bounds to return an appropriate path whenever asked.

So let's add these methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)            drawWithSelection:(BOOL) selected;
- (void)            drawHandles;
- (void)            drawAHandle:(int) whichOne;
- (int)             handleAtPoint:(NSPoint) pt;
- (NSRect)          handleRect:(int) whichOne;
- (NSRect)          newBoundsFromBounds:(NSRect) old forHandle:(int) whichOne withDelta:(NSPoint) p;

- (void)            mouseDown:(NSPoint) pt;
- (void)            mouseDragged:(NSPoint) pt;
- (void)            mouseUp:(NSPoint) pt;

- (NSBezierPath*)   path;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We also add an int data member, _dragState, and an NSPoint data member, _anchor.

When we begin to draw a shape, it will be created and added to the drawing at the point where we clicked. It will then be in exactly the same state as if an existing object were being resized, so there is no difference between creation and later editing - we just arrange things so that new objects get created under the mouse. The view will deal with this.

==Shape implementation==

Now we can implement the methods for WKDShape. We'll supply a default path method so that using an unsubclassed shape object works - in fact, we can make the generic shape object handle the simple rectangle case.

Cut and Paste the method prototypes into the WKDShape.m file. Here's a quick trick for expanding them, which will work at this stage since there is no code written yet. Expand one method by replacing the trailing semicolon with a pair of curly braces and an extra line. Select and copy just the braces and the extra line. Open the Find/Replace dialog and do a Replace All on a semicolon with the lines you copied (paste the lines into the Replace field). This replaces all semicolons with the empty method bodies and an extra line, thus expanding all the method prototypes to full methods.

Here is the implementation for the property methods and initialisation:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (id)			init
{
	if ((self = [super init]) != nil )
	{
		[self setFillColour:[NSColor whiteColor]];
		[self setStrokeColour:[NSColor blackColor]];
		[self setStrokeWidth:1.0];
		_bounds = NSZeroRect;
		_dragState = 0;
		_anchor = NSZeroPoint;
	}
	return self;
}


- (void)		dealloc
{
	[_fillColour release];
	[_strokeColour release];
	[super dealloc];
}


- (NSRect)		bounds
{
	return _bounds;
}


- (void)		setBounds:(NSRect) bounds
{
	_bounds = bounds;
}


- (void)		setLocation:(NSPoint) loc
{
	_bounds.origin = loc;
}


- (void)		offsetLocationByX:(float) x byY:(float) y
{
	_bounds.origin.x += x;
	_bounds.origin.y += y;
}


- (void)		setSize:(NSSize) size
{
	_bounds.size = size;
}


- (BOOL)		containsPoint:(NSPoint) pt
{
	return NSPointInRect( pt, [self drawBounds]);
}



- (NSColor*)	fillColour
{
	return _fillColour;
}


- (void)		setFillColour:(NSColor*) colour
{
	[colour retain];
	[_fillColour release];
	_fillColour = colour;
}


- (NSColor*)	strokeColour
{
	return _strokeColour;
}


- (void)		setStrokeColour:(NSColor*) colour
{
	[colour retain];
	[_strokeColour release];
	_strokeColour = colour;
}


- (float)		strokeWidth
{
	return _strokeWidth;
}


- (void)		setStrokeWidth:(float) width
{
	_strokeWidth = width;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

These should be straightforward. In our init method, we call our own set...Colour methods to set the default colours to a white fill and a black border, as well as setting a stroke width of 1.0 and setting the other data members to zero. NSZeroPoint, NSZeroSize and NSZeroRect are all handy constants in Cocoa representing those structures with all-zero members. Note that our set...Colour methods retain before release. We retain these objects because we are creating new references to them within the data members of our shape object.

The drawWithSelection: method comes next:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		drawWithSelection:(BOOL) selected
{
	NSBezierPath* path = [self path];
	
	if ([self fillColour])
	{
		[[self fillColour] setFill];
		[path fill];
	}
	
	if ([self strokeColour])
	{
		[[self strokeColour] setStroke];
		[path setLineWidth:[self strokeWidth]];
		[path stroke];
	}
	
	if ( selected )
		[self drawHandles];
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

First we call our own path method to get the path of the shape. Subclasses of WKDShape will be overriding this to provide us with other shapes, but the default one will give us a basic rectangle. Having got the path, we can stroke and fill it if we have colours for them - the absence of a colour means don't perform the operation. Finally, we use the selection flag we are passed to determine if we should draw the selection handles or not. Let's look at how the handles are drawn.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		drawHandles
{
	int h;
	
	for( h = 1; h &lt; 9; h++ )
		[self drawAHandle:h];
}


- (void)		drawAHandle:(int) whichOne
{
	NSRect  hr = [self handleRect:whichOne];
	[[NSColor redColor] set];
	NSRectFill( hr );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The method drawHandles iterates a short loop, calling drawAHandle for each one. We identify each handle using the numbers 1 to 8, with 1 meaning the top, left handle, number 2 the top centre handle, and so on round the edges of the shape in a clockwise direction. The numbering is arbitrary, but we need to be consistent. We did not use zero as a handle ID, because we use 0 elsewhere to mean 'drag the whole object' rather than drag a particular handle. This scheme is very simple, though other numbering schemes like it could be devised that could make the later handle code a little bit more compact. However, for this exercise this is entirely adequate and will function just fine.

The drawAHandle method calls handleRect: to obtain a rectangle representing the handle, then simply blocks it in using a bright red colour.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)		handleRect:(int) whichOne
{
	NSPoint	p;
	NSRect	b = [self bounds];
	
	switch( whichOne )
	{
		case 1:
			p.x = NSMinX( b );
			p.y = NSMinY( b );
			break;
	
		case 2:
			p.x = NSMidX( b );
			p.y = NSMinY( b );
			break;
	
		case 3:
			p.x = NSMaxX( b );
			p.y = NSMinY( b );
			break;
	
		case 4:
			p.x = NSMaxX( b );
			p.y = NSMidY( b );
			break;
	
		case 5:
			p.x = NSMaxX( b );
			p.y = NSMaxY( b );
			break;
	
		case 6:
			p.x = NSMidX( b );
			p.y = NSMaxY( b );
			break;
	
		case 7:
			p.x = NSMinX( b );
			p.y = NSMaxY( b );
			break;
	
		case 8:
			p.x = NSMinX( b );
			p.y = NSMidY( b );
			break;
	}
	
	b.origin = p;
	b.size = NSZeroSize;
	return NSInsetRect( b, -kHandleSize, -kHandleSize );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

HandleRect: consists of a big switch statement which sets up the position of the handle based on the current bounds of the shape. This is simple to understand but a bit dumb - we could have used bitfields to combine handles that share a side into a more compact function, but one that would be much harder to understand at a glance. This way is much easier. We use Cocoa's utility functions NSMinX, NSMinY, MSMidX, NSMaxY, etc to obtain particular corners of the bounding rect which is where we will locate the handles. Finally, we expand these points into a small rectangle and return it.

Now let's look at how we handle interaction with the mouse. The first thing that happens when the mouse is clicked is that the view determines which, if any, shape was hit, and passes the click down to its mouseDown method:

 &lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		mouseDown:(NSPoint) pt
{
	_dragState = [self handleAtPoint:pt];
	_anchor = pt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All we do is call handleAtPoint: to see if any of the handles were hit. If a handle was hit, its number is returned and stored in _dragState. If no handle was hit, 0 is returned. This means 'drag the whole object'. We can be sure that we were hit at all because this method wouldn't even be called if we hadn't been. We also record the initial mouse click point in _anchor. At this stage, we only determine what a subsequent drag is going to do - we don't need to actually do any more. Let's look at how handleAtPoint: works.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (int)			handleAtPoint:(NSPoint) pt
{
	int		h;
	NSRect	hr;
	
	if ([self bounds].size.width == 0 &amp;&amp; [self bounds].size.height == 0 )
		return 5;
	else
	{
		for ( h = 1; h &lt; 9; h++ )
		{
			hr = [self handleRect:h];
			
			if (NSPointInRect( pt, hr ))
				return h;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's quite straightforward. We loop through the handles, obtaining the rect of each one, using handleRect: that we used before for drawing. If the rect contains the point, we return the handle's index number immediately. Otherwise, if we can't find any handles that the mouse has hit, we return 0. So what's this other bit, that checks the size? This is a little bit of a hack which simplifies code elsewhere. When an object is initially created, it has zero size and is placed under the mouse. From then on, the creation of the object proceeds just the same as for editing an existing one. However, at the moment of creation, we need to trick the system into thinking that we are dragging the bottom right corner of the shape, so that the user gets the expected behaviour. The index number for the bottom right corner's handle is 5, so if we have zero size, we immediately return 5 as if it were this handle that had been clicked.

After the view calls our mouseDown method, it will continually call our mouseDragged method until the user lets go of the button, at which point it will call our mouseUp method.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		mouseDragged:(NSPoint) pt
{
	NSPoint np;
	
	np.x = pt.x - _anchor.x;
	np.y = pt.y - _anchor.y;
	_anchor = pt;
	
	if ( _dragState == 0 )
	{
		// dragging the object
		[self offsetLocationByX:np.x byY:np.y];
	}
	else if ( _dragState &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; _dragState &lt; 9 )
	{
		// dragging a handle
		
		NSRect nb = [self newBoundsFromBounds:[self bounds] forHandle:_dragState withDelta:np];
		[self setBounds:nb];
	}
}


- (void)		mouseUp:(NSPoint) pt
{
	_dragState = 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

mouseDragged: first calculates how far the mouse has moved since last time. _anchor is used to store the previous mouse position, as all we need to do is to subtract the co-ordinates of the new point from it, then update _anchor to the new point ready for next time.

Next we look at _dragState. If it's zero, we are dragging the whole object, so we can simply offset our position bodily using offsetLocationByX:byY: using our calculated delta. Otherwise if _dragState is one of the handle index values, we know we are dragging a handle, and which one it is. We defer to another method, newBoundsFromBounds:forHandle:withDelta: to calculate what our new bounding rectangle will be given the old bounds, the handle index number being dragged, and the delta offset of the handle. It returns the recalculated bounds, so we can simply call setBounds to make it take effect.

mouseUp: doesn't need to do much here - it just sets _dragState to 0. This isn't absolutely necessary, but we do it just in case someone else is using this information - since we've finished dragging, we forget about what handle, if any, we dragged.

The code for newBoundsFromBounds:forHandle:withDelta: does most of the hard work in determining how a handle drag affects the bounds. Here it is:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)		newBoundsFromBounds:(NSRect) old forHandle:(int) whichOne withDelta:(NSPoint) p
{
	// figure out the desired bounds from the old one, the handle being dragged and the new point.
	
	NSRect nb = old;
	
	switch( whichOne )
	{
		case 4:
			nb.size.width += p.x;
			break;
			
		case 6:
			nb.size.height += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 2:
			nb.size.height -= p.y;
			nb.origin.y += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 8:
			nb.size.width -= p.x;
			nb.origin.x += p.x;
			break;
			
		case 1:
			nb.size.width -= p.x;
			nb.origin.x += p.x;
			nb.size.height -= p.y;
			nb.origin.y += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 3:
			nb.size.height -= p.y;
			nb.origin.y += p.y;
			nb.size.width += p.x;
			break;
			
		case 5:
			nb.size.width += p.x;
			nb.size.height += p.y;
			break;
			
		case 7:
			nb.size.width -= p.x;
			nb.origin.x += p.x;
			nb.size.height += p.y;
			break;
	}

	return nb;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Similar to handleRect:, it uses a switch statement to figure out which edges of the rectangle get moved according to the handle index. It's straightforward - if a right or bottom edge moves, the delta can simply be added to the width or height. If a left or top edge moves, we need to adjust both the width or height and the origin position of the rectangle.

That's pretty much it. When we look at how our view works, we will find we need to add one or two additional minor methods here to help things along, but we'll worry about that later. The final thing to look at here is the implementation of path. You'll recall that this is what subclasses are intended to override to supply the particular shapes that we will be drawing. The default version looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSBezierPath*)	path
{
	return [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRect:[self bounds]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All it does is use NSBezierPath's factory method for making a path from a rectangle, in this case our bounds. The path returned is already autoreleased, so we can just use it and forget it, which is what our drawWithSelection: method does. Other shape objects can return any path that they want, provided they honour the one rule that we define here - that ''bounds'' fully encloses the shape.

We have our basic shape class in place, and a document structure to store them. The final main piece of the jigsaw is the view, which pulls everything together to allow the user to create drawings interactively. Let's consider its design.

==Design of the view class==

A generic NSView provides two main pieces of functionality - the ability to draw graphics in a window, which we have looked at already, and the ability to handle the user's mousing, which is something new. We've already discussed that this comes in three parts - a mouse down event, a series of mouse dragged events, and a mouse up event. Our shape class is all ready to handle these when they are passed along from our view.

The view will need to do more than just pass along these events however, since it will need to deal with other aspects of user interaction, such as the fact there will be many different shapes in the drawing, and the need to manage the selection of them as the user clicks.

In addition, the creation of shapes will depend on which tool is currently selected in the tool palette (which we haven't designed yet). Since shape creation is also accomplished by using the mouse and drawing in the view, it is the view that will need to provide a means of distinguishing between the various tools.

When it comes to drawing, the view needs to render the entire drawing, and also determine if an object is selected. While the shape itself handles the actual rendering of itself, the view must make sure that every object's drawWithSelection: method is called, and pass along the selection state.

Where does the view obtain the information from the document? We'll set things up so that the view is able to call upon the document as a delegate. We established the informal protocol for getting the objects and the selection using the document's objects and selection methods. Provided we set up a valid delegate, the view can call it using this informal protocol, and get the information it needs. NSView doesn't have a delegate by default, so we need to add that ourselves. Add a _delegate data member to the WKDDrawView class, with type 'id'. Then add methods for setting and getting this - setDelegate, and delegate. Note that the view doesn't need to retain its delegate in this case - it is an exception to the usual rule about creating new references to object. In this case it's OK because we know that the document and the view will always be created and destroyed together.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	setDelegate:(id) aDelegate
{
	_delegate = aDelegate;
}


- (id)		delegate
{
	return _delegate;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we need to make sure the delegate gets set to the document when the view is created. To do this, we'll create a link in Interface Builder so that the document can find the view, then call its setDelegate method, passing itself. This seems a bit roundabout, but it prevents too much interdependency between the view and the document.

In MyDocument.h, add a data member as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
	IBOutlet id	     _mainView;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then Save the file. What we've done here is create a reference to an object called _mainView. We've also flagged it as an IBOutlet. Earlier we saw how a return type of IBAction can be used to provide information to Interface Builder. This is similar. It tells IB that this particular data member can be an ''outlet'', that is, one end of a connection to another object, which can be accessed using the control-drag connection method. In Xcode, IBOutlet is defined as nothing, so it doesn't affect the code in any way.

Drag MyDocument.h to the MyDocument.nib window open in Interface Builder. It will reparse the file, and pick up the new outlet. Now we need to connect this outlet to the window's view (WKDDrawView).

You might be wondering how we can do this, since the MyDocument class doesn't seem to be respresented in Interface Builder. Indeed this class is created by Cocoa when we open a file or choose New, so how do we solve this one? This is where the mysterious &quot;file's owner&quot; icon comes in. The object that owns 'MyDocument.nib' is in fact, the MyDocument class. So file's owner represents it. Having dragged in MyDocument.h you'll notice a small exclamation mark on the File's Owner icon. This means that there are unconnected outlets in that object, which is true, since we just added the outlet _mainView, but haven't connected it yet.

Control-drag from File's owner to the view within the window. Make sure it is WKDDrawView that is highlighted, not the enclosing scroller. When you let go, the Inspector shows the Connections, and switches to Outlets. Select '_mainView' and click connect. Save the file and return to Xcode.

Now when MyDocument is instantiated, the data member _mainView will be automatically set up pointing to the WKDDrawView in the window. So all we now need to do is to use this reference to set the view's delegate. When MyDocument is instantiated, one of the last methods called as part of the initialisation is 'windowControllerDidLoadNib:'. At this point all conections declared in the .nib file, like the one we just made, are guaranteed to be in place, so we can simply add our code here:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		windowControllerDidLoadNib:(NSWindowController *) aController
{
    [super windowControllerDidLoadNib:aController];
	[_mainView setDelegate:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

From now on, whenever the view needs anything from the document, it calls its delegate method to obtain the document, and the informal protocol to obtain what it wants. The view doesn't otherwise know anything about the document, and vice versa - overcoupling has been avoided. Note that the view could be used in another application that used an entirely different object but implementing the same informal protocol to get its work done. This is one way that you can design classes for reuse among a variety of projects.

==Rendering the document contents==

The first job our view has to do is to render the contents of the document. Here's the code:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	drawRect:(NSRect) rect
{
	[[NSColor whiteColor] set];
	NSRectFill( rect );
	
	NSArray*		drawList = [[self delegate] objects];
	NSArray*		selection = [[self delegate] selection];
	NSEnumerator*	iter = [drawList objectEnumerator];
	WKDShape*		shape;
	
	while( shape = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( rect, [shape drawBounds]))
			[shape drawWithSelection:[selection containsObject:shape]];
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

As before, we start by erasing the part of the background that is to be redrawn. Next we ask our delegate for the objects and the selection using the informal protocol we designed earlier. Then it's simply a case of iterating over the objects and drawing each one. For efficiency, we also check whether the refresh rect intersects the bounds of the object, and if not we don't bother - this just avoids drawing anything that isn't visible or affected by the refresh, speeding up drawing. The selection state is determined simply by seeing if the object is in the selection array.

Sharp-eyed readers will notice that a method called drawBounds is being called on the shape object. We have not so far discussed this, but we need to. If we were to use the shape's bounds, we'd find that small parts of the things it draws will not always get erased when they need to, because some things are actually drawn outside of the area defined by bounds. The selection handles for example, are centred ON the bounds, so at least half of the handle is outside the bounds. Likewise, when we stroke the shape, the bounds defines the ''centre'' of the stroked lines. We need to take these into account so that we can correctly refresh the entire area that is drawn. the method drawBounds returns a rectangle that is based on bounds, but slightly expanded from it:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (NSRect)		drawBounds
{
	return NSInsetRect([self bounds], -kHandleSize - [self strokeWidth], -kHandleSize - [self strokeWidth]);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This takes into account both the size of the handles and the stroke width so that everything is guaranteed to fall within this area. Any drawing that simply repaints or refreshes an object will use drawBounds rather than bounds, but it must be remembered that bounds is the strictly mathematical boundary of the shape.

==Handling the mouse==

That's all there is to drawing. The case of handling the mouse is more involved. Let's look at that now.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=objc&gt;
- (void)	mouseDown:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	_dragShape = [[self delegate] objectUnderMousePoint:pt];
	
	if (_dragShape == nil)
	{
		_dragShape = [self shapeForCurrentTool];
		[[self delegate] addObject:_dragShape];
		[_dragShape setLocation:pt];
	}
	
	if (([evt modifierFlags] &amp; NSShiftKeyMask) == 0)
	{
		[[self delegate] deselectAll];
		[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	else
	{
		if ([[[self delegate] selection] containsObject:_dragShape])
		{
			[[self delegate] deselectObject:_dragShape];
			_dragShape = nil;
		}
		else
			[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
	[_dragShape mouseDown:pt];
}


- (void)	mouseDragged:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	NSRect update = [_dragShape drawBounds];
	
	[_dragShape mouseDragged:pt];
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:NSUnionRect([_dragShape drawBounds], update)];
}


- (void)	mouseUp:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	[_dragShape mouseUp:pt];
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:[_dragShape drawBounds]];
	_dragShape = nil;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Three methods are involved&amp;nbsp;— mouseDown, mouseDragged and mouseUp. Each is passed an NSEvent object, representing the mouse event that triggered the call. The first thing we need to do is to adjust the mouse coordinates from the window to our local view. NSEvent always stores mouse coordinates relative to the window, and this information is extracted using the locationInWindow method. NSView's convertPoint:fromView: will translate the coordinates, and a fromView: of nil means from the window itself.

In mouseDown:, once we are in local coordinates, we can query the document (the delegate) for the object under the mouse, using the method we wrote earlier. This either returns the topmost object hit, or nil meaning nothing was hit. We store the result in a data member called _dragShape. This keeps track of which shape we hit when later the mouseDragged and mouseUp methods are called.

If we hit empty space, we will (for now) use this to mean create a new object according to the current tool. Later we'll refine this so that we implement the ability to select objects by dragging a marquee (selection box) over them. So let's see what happens when we create a new shape object. First we call another method, shapeForCurrentTool, to make us the appropriate shape. This is a factory method so the returned object will be autoreleased. We immediately add the new object to the document, and set its location to be where our mouse point is. If we had hit an existing object, this step of creating the object and adding it to the document is skipped.

Next we test whether the shift key is down. If it is, we want to shift-select the item, which involves ''not'' deselecting everything first. Then we select the object we hit. Again, we use the shift key to add another refinement&amp;nbsp;— if shift is down, we toggle the selection state of an object, otherwise we simply select it and deselect everything else. Finally, we pass the click on to the object's own mouseDown method, which we've already looked at. Because we have changed the selection state of possibly any number of objects which could be anywhere in the drawing, we flag the need to refresh the entire thing to make sure that all these changes have an immediate effect on screen. Note that this approach is simple, but not necessarily optimum. Once the drawing gets complex, refreshing the entire thing every time can become very expensive and slow. Instead it can pay to track which objects are actually changed, and only refresh those areas. However for this simple tutorial, we won't attempt to complicate things by doing that.

mouseDragged: converts the coordinates as before, and passes the drag down to the current object as indicated by _dragShape, which we set up in mouseDown: Because a drag can move and resize an object, we need to refresh the area affected by both the new position of the object, and its old position. Thus we record the state of its bounds before and after the drag, combine them together and refresh that area. If we didn't do this, we'd find that objects would leave ugly trails behind them as they were dragged.

mouseDragged: doesn't currently attempt to deal with the situation where more than one object can be dragged. In most apps of this type, if there are two objects selected and one is dragged, both are dragged together. As an exercise, you might want to think about how mouseDragged: can be modified to achieve this.

Finally, mouseUp: cleans up by passing the call to the dragged object, refreshing the screen at that place, and then setting _dragShape to nil.

==Handling the tools==

As we saw, the shape to be added to the drawing is dependent on shapeForCurrentTool. This simply needs to look at which tool we have selected, and create the right sort of object. However, we don't yet have an interface for selecting a tool, so let's make one so that we can implement this. Since the tool palette is common to all documents in the application, we'll add it to MainMenu.nib.

One of the key design paradigms of Cocoa is its adherence to the model-view-controller (MVC) approach to object-oriented design. So far we haven't really encountered this directly, but we will have to say something about it now. MVC is a good method of separating functionality between the ''model'', which manages the actual meaningful data your application handles, and the ''view'', which is the visual representation onscreen of that data, and the controls that manipulate it. Sitting between them is the ''controller'' which does the job of mapping the view to the data and vice versa. So far we have used MyDocument as a combined model and controller, but with the tool palette, we'll be using a more strictly delineated MVC approach.

The tool palette itself will be the view. We'll need a controller to handle the selection of the tool button in the palette, and pass this along in the form of the selected tool. The model will be just a single variable, storing the current tool choice.

The view can be entirely created in Interface Builder. The controller can be partially set up in Interface Builder, supplemented by a little code we'll need to write. First let's look at our &quot;model&quot;. Because our WKDDrawView is going to take on the task of creating objects in response to the chosen tool, the obvious approach would be for the view to simply ask the tool controller what the current tool is whenever it needs to know. However, there is a snag. There is no easy way for the view (which is only one among many possible, given that we can have many documents open) to locate the tool controller without having an explicit reference to it. One solution would be a global variable which referred to the tool controller, and that is a viable approach. However, globals are discouraged in an object-oriented application, and besides, simply setting up this global would complicate things in a way that we'd rather avoid in this tutorial. Instead, we can declare a static variable in our view class which will store the ID of the chosen tool. Being a static variable, it can be accessed by any view (static variables are like globals that are only visible to code in the same file that they are declared in). This variable thus contains a COPY of the tool ID that the tool controller has. Normally we'd avoid this because copies of the same data need careful management to ensure they don't get out of step, but in this case it's fairly simple.

So how do we synchronise the tool ID when the user clicks the palette button? The answer is using a notification. A notification is Cocoa's way of passing information around without having explicit object references. The controller will post a notification every time the tool changes. Anyone interested in this can subscribe to the message and respond in a suitable way. In this case each view will subscribe to the message, but set the static variable in response. There is some overkill here - if there are two views, each will receive the message and the variable will get set twice to the same value. In this case we can tolerate this because it's only a single simple integer we are talking about.

What about when a new view is created, but the tool is set to some odd value? The view will still know about the tool, because it is a static variable, shared among all instances of the view. Thus we don't have to worry about the case of a new view never receiving a notification before it can use the correct tool, as we would if the variable was local to each view.

OK, let's make it happen.

Open 'MainMenu.nib' in IB. Select the Windows panel in the widgets palette (fourth button from the left) and drag a PANEL into the main window. Double-click the new icon to open the panel. In the Inspector, delete the window's title. Use the Size panel to set min w. to 60, and min h. to 100. Resize the panel to be narrow and tall, and position it at top left of the screen. Use the Attributes inspector to check 'Utility Window (panel only)' and 'Non activating panel (panel only)'. Make sure the 'Minimize' and 'Zoom' boxes are unchecked.

Switch to the Controls palette and drag a large square button to the window. Press the option key and drag the selection handle at the bottom downwards until you have four vertically organised buttons. Option-dragging a button creates what is known as a MATRIX of buttons, rather than a single button. With the matrix selected, use the attributes inspector to set the behaviour to 'Radio'.

In new versions of the interface builder you create the list of buttons option-dragging the buttons. Then select all of the buttons and use Layout-&gt;Embed Objects in-&gt;Matrix. This will create a Matrix encompassing all the buttons.

Double-click each button in turn and set the behaviour of each one to On/Off. Notice as you go through that the 'tag' field gives a different value for each button. This tag value is what will become our tool ID. Once done, we'll have a crude but functional tool palette interface. You can test its operation in IB by choosing File-&gt;Test Interface. Verify that the tool palette operates as a set of radio buttons with only one selected at a time, and that you can tell from the highlighting which one it is. To return to IB, choose 'Quit'.

Now we need a controller for the tool palette. IB again helps us by actually making this object for us, and creating skeletal .h and .m files that we can add code to later.

In the 'Classes' tab of the main window, locate the NSWindowController class (it is a subclass of NSResponder). Highlight NSWindowController and choose Classes-&gt;Subclass NSWindowController. A new name is added; name it ToolsController. Now we can ask IB to actually create this object, giving us an actual instance we can hook up to the view. To do this, highlight the new class, and choose Classes-&gt;Instantiate ToolsController. A new object is added to the main window, which looks like a box and has the name ToolsController. Go back to the 'Classes' view (a quick way is to double-click the new object). In the Inspector, use the Actions panel to add a new action: click Add, then type the action name selectionDidChange: (remember the colon!). This makes two actions, there should already be a showWindow: action.

Go back to Instances. control-drag FROM the ToolsController object TO the tools window (you can drag to the title bar of the actual window, or just to the icon in the main window). Connect this to the 'window' outlet. Next, control-drag FROM the NSMatrix (the four buttons - make sure you have the four buttons selected as a set not just one of them - the easiest way is to start the drag from a blank area just off the edge of one of the buttons) TO the ToolsController. Connect that to the action you just added, 'selectionDidChange:'.

Finally, we need a way to show the palette when we need it. Drag a new menu item to the Windows menu, placing it below Zoom item. Name it 'Show Tools'. control-drag FROM the menu item to the ToolsController. Connect it to the action 'showWindow:'

Save the file. With ToolsController selected, choose Classes-&gt;Create Files for ToolsController. Add the .h and .m files to Wikidraw. We're done in IB, so return to Xcode.

==Coding the controller==

Add an int data member to our ToolsController class, called _curTool. Add a method to return it, called currentTool. Your class definition should look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
@interface ToolsController : NSWindowController
{
	int		_curTool;
}

- (IBAction)	selectionDidChange:(id) sender;
- (int)			currentTool;

@end


extern NSString* notifyToolSelectionDidChange;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We also declare an extern string variable that will contain the name for our notification.

Now switch to the implementation. We don't have an 'init' method here, since the one we inherit from NSWindowController is fine, but we do need to do a little bit of set up after we've been created from the .nib file. We can do this by implementing an 'awakeFromNib' method. It's just a method (with no parameters) called when we are brought to life from the .nib file. Here's what we need:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	awakeFromNib
{
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setFloatingPanel:YES];
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setBecomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded:YES];
	_curTool = 0;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We need to tell our window to be a floating panel, and not to become key unless absolutely necessary. This is to prevent clicks in the tool palette taking focus away from the current document, which would be rather odd behaviour. We also take the opportunity to initialise _curTool to 0.

The main method of our controller is the action selectionDidChange;. Here it is.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	selectionDidChange:(id) sender
{
	_curTool = [[sender selectedCell] tag];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyToolSelectionDidChange object:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll recall that the sender of an action was an NSMatrix. The matrix will track the currently selected item and return it when we call selectedCell. Then we need to obtain the tag value associated with that item, so we call 'tag'. Then it's just assigned to _curTool.

The interesting thing comes next. We post a notification which tells any interested object that the tool selection was just changed by the user. We use something called the 'default notification center' to actually transmit this message. This is a global Cocoa object that exists for this purpose - to forward messages on to anyone who is interested. Because it's visible to all classes (in a way that our ToolsController isn't), it's an ideal way to pass information to objects we don't know about. The postNotificationName:object: method does the job. The notification name is just a string that we define which uniquely indicates what's going on, and object is the controller itself. The name is set up as a string:

 NSString* notifyToolSelectionDidChange = @&quot;toolSelectionChanged&quot;;

The string itself is really irrelevant, though it can be useful to give it a descriptive name because you later might want to log what notifications you receive somewhere as part of debugging - if the names are meaningful you'll be easily able to tell where it came from.

That's our controller in its entirety - all it does is to receive the change of the buttons and forward that as a notification.

==Receiving the notification==

Back in WKDDrawView.h, we need to declare a method to handle reception of notifications. We'll call it toolChange:, and it looks like this:

 - (void)		toolChange:(NSNotification*) note;

At the top of the.m file, outside the implementation, add:

 static int	sCurrentTool = 0;

This will be our local copy of the current tool ID. We declare it as static so that it's visible to any instance of our view class. Next we need to register for the notification. We do this as part of our init method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (id)		initWithFrame:(NSRect)frameRect
{
	if ((self = [super initWithFrame:frameRect]) != nil)
	{
		_delegate = nil;
		
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
											  selector:@selector(toolChange:)
											  name:notifyToolSelectionDidChange
											  object:nil];
	}
	return self;
}

- (void)		dealloc {
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
	[super dealloc];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We use addObserver:selector:name:object: to register an interest in this notification. When deallocation the object we have to deregister to avoid an exception for any notification sent after the deallocation.
When a notification matching the name is sent, the nominated method whose selector we passed is called:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		toolChange:(NSNotification*) note
{
	sCurrentTool = [[note object] currentTool];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All we do is ask the notification which object sent the message ([note object]), and since we know that it is a ToolsController, we can then simply ask it for the tool ID, which we store in sCurrentTool. Thus sCurrentTool should always match the current value of the actual selected tool. Should the view need to know at any time which tool is selected, it can simply look at sCurrentTool rather than trying to figure out where the ToolsController is and asking it.

Of course, for this to compile we need to #import the ToolsController.h file into WKFDDrawView.m:

 #import &quot;ToolsController.h&quot;

Before we continue, let's build and go and check that we are in business as far as it goes. You should be able to choose &quot;Show Tools&quot; from the Window menu to make the palette visible, and clicking on the buttons should select them. We can't tell yet whether it's doing anything useful, as we haven't written code that acts on the value of the chosen tool. We can however, log the reception of the notification. Logging this sort of thing is always handy when developing and.or debugging an application.

To log anything, use the NSLog() function. This accepts a NSString constant which will be written out to the log. The log itself is visible as the main window in Xcode when the application is running. The string passed to NSLog accepts printf-like formatting instructions, so let's add:

 NSLog(@&quot;tool changed to %d&quot;, sCurrentTool);

To the end of the toolChange: method. Build and Go again, and verify that clicking the tool buttons causes the tool ID to be written to the log.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Turkey/Ottoman Empire/دولتِ عَليه عُثمانيه (Ottoman Turkish)==

Leader at 1901: Sultan Mehmed V

Color: Yellow

Neighbors: Russia, Austria, and Italy

Home supply centers: Constantinople, Ankara, Smyrna

Turkey has obvious natural strength--any beginner will be able to point out Turkey's strong defensive position, both from land and sea.  Turkey has the greatest staying power of any on the board.  Turkey can stalemate her enemies with six well-placed fleets and armies.  Turkey's natural defensive strength, however, is the cause of its offensive weakness.  And Turkey's defensive position is not as powerful as it initially appears.  Russia has a fighting chance to wrest BLA from Turkey in the early years, and an alliance between Italy and Austria can land an Italian Army in SMY by Autumn 1902.  Either of these cases mean curtains for Turkey. Because of its defensive position, Turkey is nicknamed &quot;The Sick Man of Europe&quot; for many. However, using this &quot;weakness&quot;, and given some good fighting, Turkey can be the best man in Europe.

==18 Center Goal==
3 home supply centers, The Balkans (4), Austria (3), Russia except St. Petersburg (3), Italy (3), and Tunis makes 17.  If Turkey has built many fleets, usually as part of an alliance with Russia, the 18th center can come from the Western half of the Mediterranean--MAR and SPA are tough, but possible.  Otherwise, Turkey must mass armies and cross the stalemate line to capture MUN.  BER and STP are too easily held from the north to be included, though if even a single Turkish army breaks into Scandinavia, victory can almost be guaranteed.

==Opening Strategy==

Turkey has by far the smallest opening book out of any Great Power.  The army in CON always goes to Turkey's one natural SC, and the fleet in ANK almost always heads to BLA, whether Russia has agreed upon a bounce or not.  Turkey fundamentally has two choices: attack Russia immediately with A SMY - ARM, or attempt to gain two builds with A SMY - CON.

===A SMY - ARM: The Russian Attack===

Perhaps Turkey's best shot at winning, this opening aims at Turkey's most dangerous enemy--Russia.  Unfortunately, Russia is Turkey's only possibility for a long-term ally, so the attack on Russia can leave Turkey friendless and surrounded in the East.  The opening is quite deadly when Turkey takes the Black Sea, as an opportunistic Austria may be willing to offer Turkey assistance for a share of the Russian spoils.  Without a fleet in BLA, the opening loses a good portion of its teeth, as gaining SEV is going to be impossible.

===A SMY - CON: The Bulgarian Push===

Turkey's best shot at two builds in 1901 is a push through BUL, followed by either a move to GRE or SER, or RUM with Austrian support.  Although Turkey rarely gets two builds--most Austrias move to ALB and SER in S 1901, and thus can pick up both SCs, and are wary of giving support to Turkey, Austria's natural enemy, the opening is safe and allows Turkey to work with or against any of his neighbors.

===Unorthodox Openings===

Several unusual openings have also sprung up.  These are not as forceful as the main lines, and therefore require more diplomacy, more trust, better intelligence gathering, and stronger tactical skill.

====A SMY H with A SMY - SYR: The Syrian Sidestep====

Spring 1901: A SMY H, A CON - BUL, F ANK - BLA.  Fall 1901: A SMY - SYR, F ANK - CON, A BUL H (or other).  Very rarely played, this opening has decent surprise value (first played in game [http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/S.html 1977KJ], first discussed in [http://www.diplomacyworld.net/pdf/dw47.pdf Diplomacy World #47]).  Turkey delays choosing Austria or Russia as his ally and leaves both coasts open for a build.  Convincing Russia to stay out of BLA in Fall 1901 by suggesting or demanding F SEV - RUM or F SEV S A UKR - RUM is a major diplomatic victory.  If instead F SEV - BLA, a Russian unit (new or existing) in SEV virtually guarantees war and requires Turkey to build F ANK.

A SYR can be useful in several ways:
:1.  Moving to ARM against Russia.
:2.  Convoying to GRE against Austria.
:3.  Discouraging Italy from playing a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Diplomacy/Italy#A_VEN_H_or_A_VEN_-_TRI_and_A_ROM_-_APU:_The_Lepanto Lepanto].
This opening fails in the face of a determined Austro-Russian alliance, and should not be used if this alliance is expected.  The Bulgarian Push offers a safer and more direct counter.

====F ANK - ARM, A SMY - CON: Ship of the Desert====

Invented and first discussed by [http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/S.html Richard Sharp], this opening can be played as an attack on Russia, or to disguise a Turk-Russian alliance.  These approaches require essentially the same diplomacy:

:1.  Come to an arrangement with Russia over BLA.  Tell Russia that you want to bounce in BLA if you plan to attack him.  If Russia anticipates a bounce, he will be much less likely to play A MOS - SEV, which would spell curtains for you as A MOS - SEV is often part of an Austro-Russian anti-Turk alliance.  If you are working with Russia, tell him you want to shepherd his fleet through CON and into the Med (ordering it as you tell him, in return for doing the same for him with your A BUL).  You will temporarily trade CON for SEV, simulating a Turk-Russian war and taking everyone by surprise in 1902.
:2.  Tell Austria you want to partner with him against Russia.  Let him suggest who gets what Balkan territories, but demand GRE and justify yourself by saying you will need GRE as a springboard to force Italy out of ION once Russia is gone.  If he refuses, then demand he support you into RUM in F1901.  The idea is to get Austria firmly on your side if you plan to attack Russia, and to lull him into a false sense of security if you are working with Russia.
:3.  Tell Russia, Austria, and Italy (contact them all separately) that it will take them a long time to eliminate you if they are planning to attack, and that in the meantime they'll be open to a stab by anyone else.

You want the following in the first couple of years:

=====Anti-Russian=====

S1901
:Turkey: F ANK - ARM, A CON - BUL, A SMY - CON
:Russia: F SEV - BLA, A MOS - UKR, A WAR - GAL
:Austria: A VIE - GAL, A BUD - SER, F TRI H or F TRI - VEN (but expect F TRI - ALB)
:Italy: anything but a Lepanto.
:England, France, and Germany: infighting, but preferably EG vs. F

F1901
:Turkey: F ARM - ANK, A CON - ANK, A BUL - RUM
:Russia: F BLA - RUM, A UKR - SEV, A WAR - GAL (altough A WAR - UKR is more likely)
:Austria (assuming F TRI - ALB in S1901): A SER S A BUL - RUM, F TRI - GRE, A VIE - GAL (although - BUD or - TRI is also likely)
:Italy, England, France, and Germany: same as before

W1901: Hope like mad Russia didn't play F BLA S F ARM - ANK.  Build F ANK (or F CON if he played F BLA S A CON - ANK).

=====Russian Partnership=====

S1901 - Same moves as Anti-Russian.

F1901
:Turkey: F ARM - SEV, A BUL - GRE, A CON - ANK
:Russia: F BLA - CON, A UKR - RUM, A WAR - GAL
:Austria: A VIE - GAL, A SER S F ALB - GRE, F ALB - GRE
:Italy, England, France, and Germany: same as before.

W1901: Build F SMY, and sail into the Med. with Russia.

This opening has the advantage of allowing Turkey to justify keeping a fleet in BLA for at least a few turns.  When SEV and CON are swapped back (presumably in F1902), Turkey can argue that moving to BLA is the fastest way to get to the Med., and the best way to protect both BUL and RUM.  This allows Turkey a fair amount of protection against a delayed Russian stab.  Also, if you can lobby hard enough, Turkey would ideally like to see:

F1901
:Turkey: F ARM - SEV, A BUL - RUM, A CON - BUL
:Russia: A WAR - GAL, A UKR S A WAR - GAL, F BLA - CON

This can be justified by claiming Turkey needs to build an additional unit in ANK in W1901 to quickly secure ION.  Russia can always capture RUM in 1902 or 1903, by which time Turkey should have captured GRE, and probably SER too.  Meanwhile, securing GAL is a strong medium-term strategic blow to Austria, who soon be surrounded by units in GAL, RUM, BUL, and GRE.  GAL is then a stepping-off point for Russia's attack on Austria.  A direct Turk will tell Russia he knows Russia often gets the upper hand in a RT, and that Turkey needs to expand as quickly as possible (i.e., as fast or a little faster than Russia) in the beginning to compensate for the difficulty he will have in capturing additional centers later.

==Black Sea Strategy==
The Black Sea is an important sea space for Turkey--a Turkey that loses the Black Sea is usually gone within a year or two.  However, many Russias (both friendly and enemy) will demand that Turkey not enter BLA in S1901 as part of an alliance.  It is much safer for Turkey to arrange a bounce, but most Russias consider it advantageous to grab RUM as quickly and as surely as possible, which is facilitated by the lack of a Turkish fleet in BLA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==

The game of Diplomacy was developed by [[w:Allan B. Calhamer|Allan B. Calhamer]] while he was a student at [[w:Harvard Law School|Harvard Law School]] during the 1950's.  While only a minor commercial success, Diplomacy has a small, devoted fanbase. Many famous politicians have stated that Diplomacy was their favorite game.  [[w:John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] and [[w:Henry Kissinger|Henry Kissinger]] were both fans of the game, as was news anchor [[w:Walter Cronkite|Walter Cronkite]].

The major difficulty for playing the game is finding the seven players required.  The game also takes a very long time to complete--usually three to six hours, or even longer if time for diplomacy is not capped.  Although face-to-face diplomacy provides a more nuanced and exciting game, as players can actually see the [[../Negotiation|discussions]] between two powers, if not overhear them, the difficulty of finding seven players in one's area has made mail, and now e-mail, the two most popular ways to play Diplomacy.

There has been a push in the past decade for better Artificial Intelligence for the game.  Computers continue to improve, and have even become pretty good at no-press variants of the game, but cannot yet compete with humans in games with communication.

==Overview==

Diplomacy is a [[w:Zero–sum game|zero-sum]], turn-based, strategy wargame played by seven people, each taking the role of a Great Power in Europe during the World War I era.  The seven countries are [[../Austria/]] (or Austria-Hungary), [[../England/]], [[../France/]], [[../Germany/]], [[../Italy/]], [[../Russia/]], and [[../Turkey/]].  The game year is divided into five phases: Spring movements and retreats, Fall movements and retreats, and Winter adjustments.  Each power controls only two types of units: armies and fleets.  Fleets can occupy ocean spaces and coastal provinces, and can convoy armies across ocean spaces.  The board is divided into 75 spaces, 56 land and 19 sea.  34 land spaces are called supply centers.  Powers capture supply centers by having their troops occupy the territory after fall retreats.  Powers maintain ownership over every province they have conquered until another power is able to move one of his or her own units into the province during the fall (although keeping track of the ownership of non-supply center provinces is essentially irrelevant).  Owning more supply centers than units after the fall retreats allows a player to build a unit in one of his or her unoccupied home centers during the winter adjustments.  A player wins by taking 18 supply centers.  Achieving solo victory is extremely difficult, and most games end in draws ranging in size from two to four players. 

[[File:Diplomacy.svg|thumb|300px|right]] Diplomacy is played on the board showing the political map of Europe immediately prior to World War I. Diplomacy has a very subtle and complex [[../Geography|geography]], with criss-crossing stalemate lines from east to west, north to south, and in corners.  Geography is an important factor in determining a country's winning [[../Middle Game Strategies|strategy]]--Turkey will never view England as an objective for conquest except in extraordinary circumstances.  More important, however, is diplomacy.  A loyal [[../Alliances|ally]] will work around geographical conflicts to find a mutually satisfactory solution.

Before we can act upon the different tools, we'll need the classes that implement the different shapes. We have four tool buttons at the moment, so it would be nice to have one being a selection tool, and three being shape drawing tools. We already have the rectangle shape so we need two more. We'll create an oval shape and a slightly more complex polygonal shape. You can go on to create any number of additional shapes if you want, and just extend the tool palette to access them.

Select WKDShape.m and choose File-&gt;New File... Choose Objective-C class, and set its name to &quot;WKDOvalShape.m&quot;. By the way the only reason to select the WKDShape file before you do this is to make sure the new files go in the same group - unfortunately Xcode doesn't automatically subclass existing classes, so we'll have to do that by hand.

Open the WKDOvalShape.h file and add #import &quot;WKDShape.h&quot; to the top of the file. Then change NSObject to WKDShape. Your class definition looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
#import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;
#import &quot;WKDShape.h&quot;

@interface WKDOvalShape : WKDShape
{
}

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

The only method to be implemented is 'path', and we don't need to declare it. Just add it to the implementation, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
@implementation WKDOvalShape

- (NSBezierPath*)	path
{
	return [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithOvalInRect:[self bounds]];
}

@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now repeat the whole exercise again, this time making files for a class called 'WKDPolyShape'. Here's the implementation we need:

&lt;pre&gt;
@implementation WKDPolyShape

- (NSBezierPath*)	path
{
	NSBezierPath* path = [NSBezierPath bezierPath];
	NSRect	br = [self bounds];
	NSPoint p;
	
	[path moveToPoint:br.origin];
	
	p.x = NSMidX( br );
	p.y = NSMidY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	
	p.x = NSMaxX( br );
	p.y = NSMinY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	
	p.x = NSMaxX( br );
	p.y = NSMaxY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];

	p.x = NSMidX( br );
	p.y = NSMidY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	
	p.x = NSMinX( br );
	p.y = NSMaxY( br );
	[path lineToPoint:p];
	[path closePath];
	
	return path;
}
@end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now return to WKDDrawView.m. Add imports for both of these new files to the top of the file. Add the following to the method 'shapeForCurrentTool'.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (WKDShape*)	shapeForCurrentTool
{
	switch([self currentTool])
	{
		default:
			return nil;
	
		case 1:
			return [[[WKDShape alloc] init] autorelease];
			
		case 2:
			return [[[WKDOvalShape alloc] init] autorelease];
			
		case 3:
			return [[[WKDPolyShape alloc] init] autorelease];
	}
}


- (int)			currentTool
{
	return sCurrentTool;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's simple - depending on the current tool, we make one of the three different kinds of shapes. We return 'nil' as the default case, which we'll use to mean the selection tool. Build and Go and check that three kinds of shapes can be drawn. The tool with ID 0 currently will log an error because we haven't adjusted our mouseDown: method to handle the nil case as a selection yet. Let's fix that next.

==Selection marquee==

The idea of a selection marquee is very simple - the user clicks in the view with the selection tool, and drags a rectangular box over a set of objects. Any objects that the box touches are selected, and any others outside the box are deselected.

To make this work, we'll need a way to tell which objects are touched by the marquee and which are not. This is straightforward, as the utility function NSIntersectsRect, which we've already seen, will figure it out. We just need to iterate over our objects, retrieve their bounds (or more accurately, the drawBounds) and test for an intersection with the marquee. If it intersects, it's selected, if not, it isn't.

To draw the marquee itself, we'll need to track its original anchor point, and use this to form a rectangle. All of the required code goes in the view class. We also add a pair of NSPoint data members, _anchor and _marquee, to track the current size of the marquee.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		updateMarquee:(NSPoint) newPoint
{
	_marquee = newPoint;
	
	NSRect mr = NSRectFromTwoPoints( _anchor, _marquee );
	NSEnumerator* iter = [[[self delegate] objects] objectEnumerator];
	WKDShape* obj;
	NSRect		br;
	
	[[self delegate] deselectAll];
	
	while ( obj = [iter nextObject])
	{
		br = [obj drawBounds];
		
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( mr, br ))
			[[self delegate] selectObject:obj];
	}
        [self setNeedsDisplayInRect:mr];
}


- (void)		drawMarquee
{
	NSRect mr = NSInsetRect( NSRectFromTwoPoints( _anchor, _marquee ), 1, 1 );
	
	[[NSColor grayColor] set];
	NSFrameRect( mr );
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

updateMarquee: does most of the work. It sets the _marquee data member, and then uses this and _anchor to calculate the rectangle of the marquee. Then it deselects everything, and iterates over the objects, testing each one's drawBounds against the marquee rect. If they intersect, the object is selected.

drawMarquee also calculates the marquee rectangle, and frames it in grey. Both of these methods call the utility NSRectFromTwoPoints. In fact Cocoa doesn't provide this function, so instead we define it ourselves. Note that this is a plain C function, outside of the class implementation. It should be placed above the @implementation declaration in WKDDrawView.m.

&lt;pre&gt;
NSRect	NSRectFromTwoPoints( NSPoint a, NSPoint b )
{
	NSRect r;
	
	r.origin.x = MIN( a.x, b.x );
	r.origin.y = MIN( a.y, b.y );
	
	r.size.width = ABS( a.x - b.x );
	r.size.height = ABS( a.y - b.y );
	
	return r;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we need to modify our mousing methods to handle the marquee. All three methods are affected, but mouseDown: is the most complex. The logic of the method needs to be changed so that a more consistent behaviour is implemented, now we have a working tool palette. Rather than immediately locate the object under the mouse, we need to determine the current tool first - we only need to look for an object under the mouse if the selection tool is active. Otherwise, we are creating a new object. Thus the order of the logic at the top of the method needs to be altered. Here's the modified method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	mouseDown:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	_dragShape = [self shapeForCurrentTool];
	
	if (_dragShape == nil)
	{
		_dragShape = [[self delegate] objectUnderMousePoint:pt];
		
		if ( _dragShape == nil )
		{
			// marquee drag
			
			_anchor = pt;
			[self updateMarquee:pt];
			return;
		}
	}
	else
	{
		[[self delegate] addObject:_dragShape];
		[_dragShape setLocation:pt];
	}
	
	if (([evt modifierFlags] &amp; NSShiftKeyMask) == 0)
	{
		[[self delegate] deselectAll];
		[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	else
	{
		if ([[[self delegate] selection] containsObject:_dragShape])
		{
			[[self delegate] deselectObject:_dragShape];
			_dragShape = nil;
		}
		else
			[[self delegate] selectObject:_dragShape];
	}
	
	[self setNeedsDisplay:YES];
	[_dragShape mouseDown:pt];
}


- (void)	mouseDragged:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	NSRect update = [_dragShape drawBounds];
	
	if ( _dragShape )
		[_dragShape mouseDragged:pt];
	else
		[self updateMarquee:pt];
		
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:NSUnionRect([_dragShape drawBounds], update)];
}


- (void)	mouseUp:(NSEvent*) evt
{
	NSPoint pt = [self convertPoint:[evt locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
	
	if ( _dragShape )
		[_dragShape mouseUp:pt];
	else
	{
		[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:NSRectFromTwoPoints( _anchor, _marquee )];
		_anchor = _marquee = NSZeroPoint;
	}	
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:[_dragShape drawBounds]];
	_dragShape = nil;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the selection tool is current, we will have a nil dragShape, so we use that to subsequently detect the marquee case by testing if the mouse hit empty space or an existing object. For mouseDown:, we set the value of _anchor, then call for an update of the marquee. On mouseDragged:, we detect the marquee case and update it again, changing the selection as needed. On mouseUp:, we refresh the marquee area and set the marquee points to zero. This will erase the marquee, leaving anything it selected still selected. The only remaining task is to make the marquee visible. To do this, we simply add a call to drawMarquee to our drawRect: method.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	drawRect:(NSRect) rect
{
	[[NSColor whiteColor] set];
	NSRectFill( rect );
	
	NSArray*		drawList = [[self delegate] objects];
	NSArray*		selection = [[self delegate] selection];
	NSEnumerator*	iter = [drawList objectEnumerator];
	WKDShape*		shape;
	
	while( shape = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( rect, [shape drawBounds]))
			[shape drawWithSelection:[selection containsObject:shape]];
	}
	
	[self drawMarquee];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we'll find that when we compile and run the application, we have a much more standard behaviour for the selection tool.

There are some fairly serious inefficiencies here - every time the marquee size changes, the selection is recalculated entirely from scratch. For a few objects this isn't a problem, but if our drawing became complex it could well be. Once we add the inspector which will respond to selection changes, performance could suffer even more. We won't be worrying about this now, but perhaps you could think of a few simple ways to improve the efficiency?

This section won't really introduce anything new about Cocoa, but it will help consolidate what we've learned already. The idea is to provide an inspector type interface for Wikidraw so that we can set the properties of the objects we have drawn, such as the colours, stroke widths, etc.

From what we learned about notifications, we can see how we might achieve this. Whenever the selection changes, a notification can be broadcast indicating that fact. The inspector can listen for these, and find out what the current selection is, then simply update its interface to match the selected object's properties.

When the user changes the interface, the new properties are applied to the objects in the selection.

The process of creating the Inspector is similar to the one for the tool palette. A single global inspector is used, and so it can go in the 'MainMenu.nib' file. We'll need a new controller object to act as the go-between between the interface elements and the document. Now at this point it should be pointed out that in a real application, you would probably make separate .nib files for interface elements like this, simply to keep things manageable and even reusable in other applications. However, doing this brings in a number of complications that don't really help us get to know about Cocoa's features, so for now we won't do this. But bear in mind that there are better ways to do things than what we are about to do.

==Inspector design==

Most of the inspector design we can accomplish in Interface Builder, though this is a moderately complex piece of user interface.

The user is able to select different objects in the main document; the inspector is there to display the properties of the selected object and allow them to be changed interactively. However the user is also able to select more than one object, or none. What should we do in these cases? In this design, we take a simple approach - if there are no objects selected the inspector will hide the controls that edit the properties and display 'No selection'. For a multiple selection, we do the same thing, except display 'Multiple selection'. Only if there is only one object selected do we display the edit controls. This is not as sophisticated as some applications - perhaps you would design a real application so that multiple objects could be edited at once. However, this approach is simple and makes it clear how to go about handling the different cases.

A good way of arranging sets of controls to appear and disappear  in the described fashion is to use a tabbed interface, but without actually having the tabs themselves. As we detect each case, we switch to the appropriate pane of the tab which we have already set up with our desired controls. This way, we do not have to worry about individually hiding or showing particular controls, which is certainly possible, but requires more complex code.

To detect each case, we need only look at the count of objects in the selection array. If the count is zero, we know there is nothing selected. If it is one, we have a single object, and if it is any other number, we have a multiple selection. Thus the code to determine the selection state is very simple indeed.

==Building the interface==

In IB, open the 'MainMenu.nib' file. Add a Panel window to the file and use IB's inspector to make it a utility window with the title 'Inspector'.

Drag an NSTabView to the window. Initially it will have visible tabs, which makes it easier to handle. Later we will hide these. We need three tabs - use the inspector to set this. Size the tab view so that it is comfortably within the window. The first tab will be for the 'No selection' case, so select this tab and drag a text item into the window. Change the text to 'No selection', and set its colour to light grey. Change the ''identifier'' of the tab to the string 'none'. In our code we will be selecting the displayed tab using these identifiers.

Switch to tab 3. This will be the multiple selection case, so drag a text item as before and set its text to 'Multiple selection'. Set the identifier for this tab view to 'multi'.

Switch to tab 2. This will be our actual edit controls tab, and we need quite a few. Set the identifier for this tab to 'std'. As shown in the screenshot, I divided it up into two sections, ''stroke'' and ''fill''. Each section contains a radio button selection and a colour well. The stroke section also contains a slider control used for setting the stroke line width. Find all of these controls and drag them in. Arrange them neatly. The stroke width slider is set to have a range of 0.3 to 20.0 - this will eventually become the line width value. Set the number of markers to 21 and to be above the slider. Also check the 'send action continuously while sliding' and make sure the 'stop on tick marks only' is unchecked.

Finally, select the tab view again and set it to have hidden tabs. Position and size the tab view so that it fills the panel window and that each tab looks as you want it, and that you can see all of the controls and they are positioned neatly.

Now we need to create a controller for the inspector panel. Switch to the 'classes' tab in the main window, and select the NSWindowController class. Choose Classes-&gt;Subclass NSWindowController. Give the new class the name of 'InspectorController'. We need to add all of our actions and outlets now. Double-click the new class name to display the actions and outlets editor in the IB inspector. Add the following actions:

* fillColourButtonAction:
* fillColourDidChange:
* strokeColourButtonAction:
* strokeColourDidChange:
* strokeWidthDidChange:

Switch to the outlets editor. Add the following outlets:

*panelTabControl
*fillColourButtons
*fillColourWell
*strokeColourButtons
*strokeColourWell
*strokeWidthSlider

Now we can generate the code files for the InspectorController. Choose Classes-&gt;Create files for InspectorController. Accept the defaults and click Choose in the subsequent dialogue.

Next, instantiate the controller. Select the new class and Choose Classes-&gt;Instantiate InspectorController. A new instance is added to the main window.

Finally, we need to hook up all of the outlets and actions. Switch to the 'Instances' tab in the main window. First the outlets: control-drag FROM the box representing the InspectorController instance to the various controls in the panel. It should be clear from the names which controls are meant to be connected to which outlet. The tab pane itself might be tricky - you may need to show the tabs again temporarily to be able to highlight the tab view as a target. It is important that the 'panelTabControl' outlet connects to the NSTabView and not to the NSView that is inside it. Also, connect the outlet 'window' to the panel window itself.

Next connect the actions. Control-drag FROM each of the active controls TO the InspectorController instance. Again, the names should indicate which actions go with which controls. Only active controls need an action - the text you added to the other panes in the tab view are passive and have no actions.

Finally, add a menu command to the main menu bar under 'Window' for the 'Show Inspector' command. Its action should be the showWindow: action in the InspectorController.

Once you are satisfied that you have connected every action and outlet correctly, SAVE the file and return to Xcode.

==Coding the inspector==

The first thing we need to do is to add a notification to our document so that when the selection changes, any interested objects get to know about it. The inspector will listen for this notification, and respond accordingly. There are four methods that affect the selection state in MyDocument:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		selectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		deselectObject:(id) object;
- (void)		selectAll;
- (void)		deselectAll;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We will need to make a small modification to the code of all four to make sure that the inspector 'keeps up' with selection changes. Since a notification needs a name, let's define one.

 extern NSString* notifyObjectSelectionDidChange;

This goes outside of the class definition, below the '@end' statement in MyDocument.h

In MyDocument.m, add the following:

 NSString* notifyObjectSelectionDidChange = @&quot;objectSelectionDidChange&quot;;

This goes before the '@implementation' statement. All we are doing is declaring a global string that represents this particular event. By declaring it 'extern' in our .h file, we allow other code to know about this string without having to care where it actually is. Our .m file actually gives the string its real substance.

Now, change the selection methods as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		selectObject:(id) object
{
	if([_objects containsObject:object] &amp;&amp; ![_selection containsObject:object])
	{
		[_selection addObject:object];
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
	}
}

- (void)		deselectObject:(id) object
{
	[_selection removeObject:object];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
}

- (void)		selectAll
{
	[_selection setArray:_objects];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
}

- (void)		deselectAll
{
	[_selection removeAllObjects];
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange object:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

All we have done is add a line to each that posts a notification with the name we declared whenever the selection changes. Note that we don't bother trying to notify what sort of change was made, only that it has changed. The receiver of the message can call us back to get further information if it needs to.

At this stage, it may be worth compiling and running the application to check that it still works OK. So far we haven't added any visible new functionality.

The code for the inspector itself will be added in InspectorController.m. This is one of the files that IB made for us in the last section. If you select this file, you will see that it has already expanded the action methods for us. We do need two other however, so set things up initially and tear them down properly. Here are the awakeFromNib method and the dealloc method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)	awakeFromNib
{
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setFloatingPanel:YES];
	[(NSPanel*)[self window] setBecomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded:YES];
	
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
										selector:@selector(selectionChanged:)
										name:notifyObjectSelectionDidChange
										object:nil];
										
}

- (void)	dealloc {
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
	[super dealloc];
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

As with our tools palette, we first just make sure that the panel window floats and doesn't become key unless absolutely necessary. Then, we subscribe to the notification from MyDocument that we set up above. In order for this file to know about our notification name and the methods of MyDocument, also add '#import &quot;MyDocument.h&quot;' to the top of the file.

Switch to InspectorController.h and add this method to the class definition:

 - (void)		selectionChanged:(NSNotification*) note;

Back in the .m file, expand this method as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		selectionChanged:(NSNotification*) note
{
	MyDocument* doc = (MyDocument*)[note object];
	NSArray*	sel = [doc selection];
	NSString*	tab;
	
	NSLog(@&quot;selection changed, objects selected = %d&quot;, [sel count]);
	
	switch([sel count])
	{
		case 0:
			tab = @&quot;none&quot;;
			break;
			
		case 1:
			tab = @&quot;std&quot;;
			break;
			
		default:
			tab = @&quot;multi&quot;;
			break;
	}
	
	[panelTabControl selectTabViewItemWithIdentifier:tab];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is where the notification of selections changing gets actually responded to. It is called every time the selection state in the main document changes. The first thing it does is to find out which document the message came from. The sender of the message is part of the notification itself, obtained using the doc = [note object] message. Next, we need the selection, so we ask the document for it, sel = [doc selection]. Then we can simply count the number of objects to figure out which pane of our inspector we need to display. According to whether 0, 1 or more objects are selected, we set up the string 'tab' with the required identifier (which you will recall we established in Interface Builder - if this doesn't work check that the identifiers match). Finally, we simply set the tab using the identifier. We have a reference to the tab view because it's one of our outlets, and it was set up automatically.

Now we can test this. Compile and run the application. Show the tools palette and the inspector palettes using the menu commands. Create a few objects in the main document. Use the selection tool to select different objects, more than one object and no objects - verify that the inspector displays the appropriate controls according to the selection state.

The next step is to hook up the edit controls to the selected object so we can edit the object's properties. First we write some code to set the state of the controls to match the selected object's state. Then we fill in the action methods so that the object's state can be changed.

In the InspectorController.h file, add the following method definition:

 - (void)		setupWithShape:(WKDShape*) shape;

Now, because we declare this to take a WKDShape* parameter, we'll need this file to 'know about' that class. We could #import WKDShape.h here, but that would mean that any file that only needed to know about the inspector would also pull in the shape file, which it might not need. So instead, for efficiency and to reduce interdependency, we 'forward declare' the class at this stage. This is simple:

 @class WKDShape;

Add that line above the '@interface' statement. All it says is that there is a class, somewhere, called WKDShape. At this point it doesn't need any internal details of WKDShape, so it avoids the inefficiency of importing the entire file.

Back in the .m file, we flesh out this method as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setupWithShape:(WKDShape*) shape
{
	NSColor* fill = [shape fillColour];
	NSColor* strk = [shape strokeColour];
	
	if ( fill )
	{
		[fillColourButtons selectCellWithTag:0];
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[fillColourWell setColor:fill];
	}
	else
	{
		[fillColourButtons selectCellWithTag:1];
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}

	if ( strk )
	{
		[strokeColourButtons selectCellWithTag:0];
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[strokeColourWell setColor:strk];
	}
	else
	{
		[strokeColourButtons selectCellWithTag:1];
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}
	
	[strokeWidthSlider setFloatValue:[shape strokeWidth]];

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's quite obvious really - it simply gets the fill and stroke properties of the shape object passed in, and uses them to set the states of the controls via the outlets in the controller. If there is no colour associated with the stroke or fill, this is used to select the 'none' option by using the tag of the radio button. In that case, the colour well is also disabled.

Because this code does need the internal details of WKDShape, the .m file does need to #import WKDShape.h, so add that line to the top of the file.

Now, hook up this method by modifying the 'selectionChanged:' method:

&lt;pre&gt;
		case 1:
			tab = @&quot;std&quot;;
			[self setupWithShape:[sel objectAtIndex:0]];
			break;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Because in this case we know that the selection contains only one object, it must be the object at index 0 in that array. We can set up the controls before the tab panel actually switches to them without any problems.

Compile and run the application and verify that now when an object is selected, the inspector displays the default colours which are black stroke and white fill.

Finally, let's make the inspector interactively edit the selected object.

==Editing the shape==

There are a couple of things we'll need to do first. We have a bunch of different action methods all hooked up to various inspector controls, but they all affect the same selected object. We'll therefore need to track which object this is so that we can edit it at any time, as long as it remains selected. To do this, we'll add a reference to it as a data member of the inspector class. So in InspectorController.h, add:

 	WKDShape*	editShape;

as a data member. For safety, we'll also add a method called setShape:, which handles the usual retain/release of a shape as the selection changes. We could set this up so that a retain isn't required, but then we'd have to be careful that there could never be any circumstances that a stale reference could exist. This way is more straightforward, safer and 'the Cocoa way'. So expand setShape as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setShape:(WKDShape*) shape
{
	[shape retain];
	[editShape release];
	editShape = shape;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add a call to [self setShape:shape] at the top of the setupWithShape: method. Now we can simply refer to editShape safely at any time.

One more thing we need to do to prepare. You'll recall that the view that displays the shapes is responsible for drawing them, but we will be editing the shape's properties directly. In order for the changes to be visible immediately, there needs to be a way to tell the view to refresh the shape's bounds rectangle whenever something changes. We don't want to encumber the inspector with this task, as it then sets up an unnecessary dependency between the inspector and our view class. Instead, the shapes themselves need to be able to flag the necessary refresh of the view that is drawing them. To accomplish this, we need another notification. When a shape's state changes, it posts a notification. The view responds to this by obtaining the shape's bounds and refreshing that region of the screen. Because the view originally created the shape, establishing the notification is very straightforward, and the inspector plays no part.

In WKDShape.m, add the method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		repaint
{
	[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:notifyShapeRequiresRefresh object:self];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

in the .h file, declare this method and also an extern NSString* for 'notifyShapeRequiresRefresh'. In the .m file, make this string take some suitable value - I used the string @&quot;repaintMe!&quot; - but it can be anything unique.

In each method that changes a property, we need to add a call to [self repaint]; so that the notification gets posted.

Now in WKDDrawView, we need to add a responder for this notification. Add the following method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		repaintNotification:(NSNotification*) note
{
	WKDShape* shape = (WKDShape*)[note object];
	[self setNeedsDisplayInRect:[shape drawBounds]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, add a line to the initWithFrame: method of WKDDrawView so that it subscribes to these notifications:

&lt;pre&gt;
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
											  selector:@selector(repaintNotification:)
											  name:notifyShapeRequiresRefresh
											  object:nil];
&lt;/pre&gt;

This allows the view to respond to a refresh request from any shape object whenever that shape's properties are changed. There is a small flaw in this scheme as written; sharp-eyed readers may have noticed it. It has to do with multiple documents. At present, a view can't tell whether the shape really belongs to it or not. The effect is however, harmless - it just means more refreshes going on than really necessary if there are multiple documents. You might like to think about how to solve this problem.

Back to the inspector. Now a shape can refresh itself when needed, and we have a way to track the object we are editing, it's a simple matter of hooking up the action methods for each control so they do the right thing.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	fillColourButtonAction:(id) sender
{
	int tag = [[sender selectedCell] tag];
	
	if ( tag == 1 )
	{
		[editShape setFillColour:nil];
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}
	else
	{
		[fillColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[editShape setFillColour:[fillColourWell color]];
	}
}

- (IBAction)	fillColourDidChange:(id) sender
{
	[editShape setFillColour:[sender color]];
}

- (IBAction)	strokeColourButtonAction:(id) sender
{
	int tag = [[sender selectedCell] tag];
	
	if ( tag == 1 )
	{
		[editShape setStrokeColour:nil];
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:NO];
	}
	else
	{
		[strokeColourWell setEnabled:YES];
		[editShape setStrokeColour:[strokeColourWell color]];
	}
}

- (IBAction)	strokeColourDidChange:(id) sender
{
	[editShape setStrokeColour:[sender color]];
}

- (IBAction)	strokeWidthDidChange:(id) sender
{
	[editShape setStrokeWidth:[sender floatValue]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This should be clear - we extract the value of the sender and pass it along to the relevant property. For the radio buttons, we pass along nil if the 'none' button is selected (tag == 1), otherwise the current well colour. We also implement some UI state here, disabling the colour well if the 'none' option is chosen.

Compile and run to test - you should find that the inspector is now fully interactive. The selected object refreshes itself using the repaint notification, so the inspector is free to simply set the relevant property without caring how it handles the display. This is the correct separation of functionality - the controller (inspector) changes the data model (shape) which flags the change to the view which obtains whatever it needs from the data model to update the screen. This is how MVC is meant to work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you still have your finger exercise up, do a File New. Don't bother to save the tooth, unless you really want it. Now let's build a dog house.

Start with a primitive cube. Select the lower and upper edge on one of the sides. Then Connect them (remember to right click to bring up the Edge menu). Hit the Space Bar to deselect the new edge. Repeat the operation on the opposite side of the cube. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.a.

Select the three vertical edges on one of the sides. Connect. Hit the Space Bar to deselect the new edge. Repeat on the other side. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure
10.b. 

Move the horizontal mid-edges up in the Y direction on both sides by 0.50 units. Then Move the vertical mid-edges forward in the Z direction on both sides by 0.50 units. You can see the units change in the Status Bar at the bottom of the Wings window, below the Icon Bar. Simply stop dragging when the value reads 0.50 and left click the mouse. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.c.

Figure 10. Roughing in the basic form. The top and bottom edges have been Connected in (a). The new edge and the two side edges were then Connected in (b). Do this on both sides of the model. In c the edges have been Moved. Do both sides of the model at the same time to ensure symmetry. In (d) the sides have been Extruded. The vertices on the front face have been Connected in (e). In (f) the new edge and the bottom edge were Cut by 3 and the resulting vertices then Connected.

Select the two large faces, one on each side, and Extrude Normal by 1.0. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.d. Then Select the two vertices on the front face and Connect them as shown in Figure 10.e. Select the two long edges on the front face and Cut by 3. Connect the resulting vertices. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 10.f.
Select the front faces of the side sections and Inset some windows as seen in Figure 11.a Move the front three edges that run horizontally across the front of the main cube down in Y by 0.50 to square up the door as shown in 11.b. Then select the two windows and Scale them down in Y by 0.50 units to square them up as well. You should have something similar to that shown in Figure 11.c. Select the door, windows, and the three floor faces as shown in 11.e. Now Intrude to hollow out the shell of the dog house. Figure 11.f shows the results of the Intrude operation. The thickness of the walls is determined by how much you move the mouse while Intruding. Figure 11. More basic construction. New faces have been Inset in (a). The three edges on the front face were then Moved down in Y (b) to resize the door face. The windows are then resized in c. Select all the faces that will be used for the Intrude command in (e) and Intrude. The results of the Intrude are shown in (f).

Select the two edges that go from the side sections to the main roof and Dissolve them (Figure 12.a). Switch to Vertex Mode. Select the two left over vertices on the roof lines and Collapse them (Figure 12.b). Then select the top face and Inset by 75% (Figure 12.c). Now Move the inset roof face up in the Y direction for 0.50 units (Figure 12.d). Now Inset the top face outward by 30% then Extrude it up in Y by 0.25 units (Figure 12.e) and then Scale it down Uniform by 90% to form a little roof cap. The house should resemble that shown in Figure 12.f.

Figure 12. Building the main roof. Dissolve the edges (a) and Collapse the vertices (b) that disrupt the roof face. Then Inset the roof c. Move the center face up in Y (d) then Inset outward and Extrude Y to form the roof cap(e). Then Scale the top of the cap (f).

Select the top faces of the side sections and Inset outward by 40% (Figure 13.a). Then Extrude Normal up by 0.10 units (Figure 13.b). Switch to Edge Mode. Deselect the front and back edges with the mouse. This will leave the inside and outside edges still selected as in Figure 13.c. (I just rotated the house so you can see the back side and see that four edges remain selected.) Connect the side edges (Figure 13.d). Move the new edges up in Y 0.53 units to form gables. Hit the Space Bar to deselect everything and switch to Vertex Mode. Then select the vertices on the outside of the two gables and Scale X by -25% to bring them in as seen in Figure 13.e. Then Connect the vertices on the top outside edges on the sides of the gables.

Figure 13.The side roofs. Select the two side roofs and Inset outward (a) and then Extrude Normal up (b). Select the four edges (two on each roof) and Connect (c). Move the new edges up (e). Switch to Vertex Mode and Scale the two outer most vertices in X to form the gables (f).

Connect the front side top edges (Figure 14.a). Then select the two lower edges of the front top and Connect them (Figure 14.b). Switch to Vertex Mode (Figure 14.c) and Scale the vertices down in Y to bring the two lines close together and then Move them down in Y to bring them closer to the door (Figure 14.d). Select the two edges we just positioned (Figure 14.e) and Cut them by 3, then do a Connect on the resultant vertices (Figure 14.f). Scale them apart in X by

Figure 14. The porch overhang. Connect the side edges of the top front face (a) and then Connect the lower set again (b). Select the vertices and scale them down in Y to bring the edges closer together c. Then Move them all down closer to the door (d). Cut the edges by 3 (e) and Connect the resulting vertices (f) and scale them apart (g) to form a face that will become the porch roof (h). Then Extrude that face (i).
40% (Figure 14.g). Select the new face (Figure 14.h) and Extrude it Normal by 0.5 (Figure 14.i).
Select the top back edge of the porch roof (Figure 15.a) and Cut it by 2. Connect the resulting vertex with the two front top corner vertices as show in Figure 15.b. Move the back center vertex up in Y by 0.5 (Figure 15.c). Now dolly the camera so that you can see the underside of the porch (as in Figure 15.d).
Connect the bottom side edges of the porch roof (15.e). Move it forward in Z by 0.15 units (15.f). Select the front and back bottom edges of the porch roof too. Cut all three edges by 3 (15.g). Connect the vertices (15.h). Scale them apart in X 130% to form small square shaped faces at the front bottom corners of the porch roof (15.i). Now select the two intersecting vertices and Bevel to 0.07 units (15.j).

Select the resulting edges and Cut by 2 (15.k). Scale the resulting vertices from one side Uniform by 40% to form a roundish face (15.l). Now select the four vertices on the other side and do an Edit | Repeat Drag to form an exact copy of the rounded face on the other side of the porch. Select the two round faces and Extrude Y by -1.10 units which will make them even with the bottom of the house.

Figure 15. Under the porch. Cut the back edge of the porch roof by 2 (a) and connect that vertex up with the two at the top front corners (b). Then Move the center vertex up in Y (c). Now roll the house over so that you can see the underside of the porch (d). Connect the two side edges (e) and Move the new edge towards the front. Select the three long edges (g) and Cut by 3 and then Connect the resulting vertices (h). Bevel the intersecting vertices (i). Then select the edges of the new boxes and Cut by 2. One one side only, Scale the new vertices Uniform to form a circle (j). Then use Repeat Drag (k) to create another circle (l) on the other side of the porch.

Switch to Body Mode and select the house by clicking on it. Then switch to Edge Mode and all the edges will be selected. Right click to bring up the Edge Operations menu and set Hardness to Hard. Pick faces and set materials to your liking. Select all the roof top faces. Right click for the Face Operations menu and choose Set Material. You will be prompted for a material name. Call it Roof. The Material Editor will come up. Change the settings until you get a roof color you like on the preview globe on the left. Then click OK.

Figure 16. Completing the project. Select the two circles (a) and position your model so that you can see it from the front with all the bottom edges lined up (b). Then Extrude Y to create the columns. After assigning materials your model should resemble the one depicted in c. Remember to hit the Tab key to see the colors in Smooth Shaded mode.

While you can see the materials on the shaded wireframe in Workmode you can get a better idea of how things will look in Smooth Shaded Mode.To see the results deselect the roof faces and hit the Tab key for a shaded preview. You should see the new roof color. Now repeat material assignments as you did for the roof until your dog is happy (Figure 16.c).
Save the model. Optionally, Export the model into one of the formats your renderer can accept and render the dog house to see how it turned out. Here is mine (Figure 17)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

User blocking is perhaps one of the most heavy-handed things you can do as an administrator, and the one that can cause the most damage.  An administrator must therefore be cautious in using this power.  Often a user will spend quite a bit of time building up a reputation under a particular user name, and by blocking that user they will not be able to edit from their account. Blocked users can still edit their user talk page (and user talk sub-pages?) unless these pages are protected and the user doesn't have sysop or higher privileges.

It is also possible to block IP addresses from being able to edit text.  This does not stop a registered user on that IP address from being able to log in, but only stops anonymous users from using the edit functions.  If there is a problem where a registered user is unable to access the Wiki due to an anonymous IP block, then the user must unblock that IP and reblock with ''anonymous users only'' checked.

== Performing the Block ==

The actual process of performing the block is rather straight forward.  You can either go directly to [[Special:Blockip]] and get the page, or you can use your administrator's tools on the sidebar and then clicking on the Block User link.  This is only visible when you are viewing either a user page or a user talk page.

[[Image:BlockUser2.png]]

All this does is simply fill in the name of the user account or IP address so you don't have to worry about misspellings or getting the wrong IP address.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There's nothing here on iterating over dictionaries, and I'm a Python beginner, so I'm throwing this out for discussion:

&lt;nowiki&gt;for key in dict:
    print key, dict[key]&lt;/nowiki&gt;


How to add things to an existing dictionary is not mentioned. In my specific example: I want to add a key and definitiond for every member in a specific class, but this article makes it look like I'd different dictionaries for every member and only after that could I, in the darkness, bind them.--[[User:Hakusa|Hakusa]] 09:45, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

:As far as I can see, adding is as simple as the_dict['some key'] = value. If you wanted to merge a dictionary:
 for key in old_dict:
     merge_dict[key] = old_dict[key]
:But obviously keys using the same name are overwritten. [[User:Ragzouken|Ragzouken]] 23:57, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

This file contains DNA markers for virtual gels.
You can add your own in the following form:
: Name:amount,bp:amount,bp:amount,bp:amount,bp: ...
: *Name is the name of the marker.
: *bp is the number of base pairs in that band.
: *amount is the amount of DNA in that band if 500 ng of the marker is loaded per lane (ng).
: &quot;:amount&quot; can be omitted. The default amount (20) is then used.
Markers you enter will be used in the next GENtle release!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tenses ==

Finnish verbs have present, imperfect, perfect and pluperfect tenses.

=== Present ===

Present: corresponds to English present and future tenses. For the latter, a time qualifier may need to be used to avoid ambiguity. 

&lt;b&gt; Verb type 1&lt;/b&gt;

'''asua''' - ''to live, reside''

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called 24. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name 24~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The [[w:Koran|Koran]] is the [[w:Islam|Islamic]] holy book, and contains extensive descriptions and claims regardings &quot;Sunnatullah&quot;, which roughly translates to the English &quot;Law of Nature&quot;. The Koranic Law of Nature expounds the Islamic view of the universe and how it was notionally created and is maintained by [[w:Allah|Allah]], the Islamic supreme being.

Many scholars of Islam assert that the Koranic Law of Nature states properties of the universe that have only recently been discovered by the modern scientific process, predating some discoveries by up to 1400 years. Furthermore, many scholars will go as far as to claim that the Koranic version is more correct than the versions found in alternative religions' texts. The Koran, like many religious texts, is open to varying interpretation, and therefore one cannot simply state the veracity or fallacy of the claims therein.

This book aims to demonstrate how the Koran presents these claims and discusses the various interpretations that have been made over the centuries by Islamic scholars, and relates these discussions to the counterparts from other religions, as well as the standings of the claims relative to modern and historical scientific and philosophical opinion. The relationship between the Koranic Law of Nature and the Christian and Jewish Laws of Nature is of particular interest, due to these Abrahamic religions having much common ancestry.

The apparent agreement of certain interpretations of the Koran to modern science is also of interest, however one should bear in mind that it is easy to find the interpretation that fits current opinion and ignore others. Likewise it is easy to formulate an interpretation ''a posteriori'', picking only the parts that appear in agreement and claiming flawless prediction when, in fact, the correlation is bound to occur because it has been created by the interpreter to meet that precise end!

It is the aim of this book to present the claims of the Koran with a neutral point-of-view, that is, neither endorsing nor condemning any side of any argument, unless that argument can be shown to be unequivocally right or wrong. Contribution to this book is encouraged, but vandalism (such as removing passages that you do not agree with) and false or unsubstantiated additions will be removed. The subject matter of this book is highly sensitive to some people and contributions should be measured and verifiable. If in doubt, ask on the [[Talk:Koranic_Law_of_Nature|discussion page]] before making edits.

== The Creation of Universe ==
=== Gaseous Mass to Heavens &amp; Earth ===

''Then He settled to the heaven, while it was still '''smoke''', and He said to it, and to the Earth: &quot;Come willingly or unwillingly.&quot; They said: &quot;We come willingly.&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/41#9-18 | 41:11]])

Koran claims that this universe was a gaseous mass before it forms planets and galaxies.

=== Fusing &amp; Separating, Big Bang ===

''Did those who reject not see that the heavens and the Earth were '''one piece''' and We '''tore them apart'''? And that We made from the water everything that lives. Will they not believe?'' ([[s:Quran/21#30-41 | 21:30]])

the Koran claims that the universe was fused into one piece before expanding and separating.

=== Avoiding the Mistake of Genesis ===

The universe is not created in sequence, as mentioned in the Bible in the Book of Genesis. Book of Genesis believes that the Sun was created in the fourth day. This is strange because vegetables/plants which need the sun were created earlier. Koran does not support such sequence.

=== 6 Days or Periods of Creation ===

''And We have created the heavens and the Earth and what is between them in '''six days''', and '''no fatigue''' touched Us.'' ([[s:Quran/50#30-45 | 50:38]])

The Quranic vocabulary used to describe the length of time is nearly identical in pronunciation to the Hebrew word for day, &quot;yom.&quot;
However, the Arabic context in which it is used in the opening chapter of the Islamic scripture denotes an indefinite period of time. Contemporary English does not place a definitive upper bound on such temporal terminology; for example, the well-known colloquial phrase &quot;back in my day&quot; isn't intended to mean some twenty-four hours. In conclusion, the creation of our planet may have taken a thousand or 50,000 human years or neither.  

''God is the One who created the heavens and the Earth, and everything between them '''in six days''', then He settled to the Throne. You do not have beside Him any Lord, nor intercessor. Will you not then remember? 	He arranges matters from the heaven to the Earth, then it ascends to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''one thousand of the years''' which you count.'' ([[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:4-5]])

''The Angels and the Spirit ascent to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''fifty thousand years'''.'' ([[s:Quran/70#1-35 | 70:4]])

All of the preceding verses are infused with God's natural names, attributes and methodology which never change. He is the Creator, the Ever-Living, the All-Knowing, Irresistible, etc. A comparative analysis with the book of Genesis demonstrates a contrast with the Qu'ranic description of the Creator and the Creation's nature. The second chapter of Genesis alludes to God rested after the creation of the heavens and the earth which is against his/her&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; nature according to the Qu'ran.  

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Note: Since God is genderless in the Qu'ran, any generic pronoun is irrelevant. Regardless, &quot;He&quot; is typically the chosen one in translated scriptural texts used by religions that revere Moses; in Islam, it is out of respect since the Creator is an active force. Academic speculation regarding the English usage of the pronoun &quot;he&quot; in reference to the Almighty Lord holds that it may stem from many hundreds of years past in which women had very few rights in religious matters and society as a whole.

=== Organization of the Universe ===

''The sun and the moon are '''perfectly calculated'''.'' ([[s:Quran/55#1-25 | 55:5]])

''For you (God) subjected the sun and the moon, both diligently '''pursuing their courses'''.'' ([[s:Quran/14#28-34 | 14:33]])

''And He committed for you the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, and the stars are '''committed by His command'''. In that are signs for a people who comprehend.'' ([[s:Quran/16#10-21 | 16:12]])

the Koran claims that this universe is perfectly organized.

== The Earth ==  
=== What Shape is the Earth? ===

''Have you not seen that God merges the night into the day and '''merges''' the day into the night, and that He has committed the sun and the moon, each running to a predetermined term; and that God is expert of everything you do?'' ([[s:Quran/31#20-30 | 31:29]])

''He created the heavens and the Earth with truth. He '''rolls''' the night over the day, and He '''rolls''' the day over the night. And He committed the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. Absolutely, He is the Noble, the Forgiving.'' ([[s:Quran/39#1-9 | 39:5]])

the Koran implies that the Earth is a rolling/round sphere.

=== Expansion of the Universe ===

''And We constructed the universe using matter, and We will '''expand''' it.'' ([[s:Quran/51#47-60 | 51:47]])

the Koran claims that the Universe is currently expanding.

=== How Many Earths are There? ===

''God who created seven universes and '''the same number of Earths'''. His command descends between them, that you may know that God is capable of all things, and that God has encompassed all things with His knowledge.'' (65:12)

the Koran claims that currently there are many Earth-like planets.

=== The origin of life in water ===

''Did those who reject not see that the heavens and the Earth were one piece and We tore them apart? And that We made '''from the water''' everything that lives. Will they not believe?'' ([[s:Quran/21#30-41 | 21:30]])

''And God created every moving creature '''from water'''. So some of them move on their bellies, and some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. God creates whatever He wills. God is capable of all things.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:45]])

the Koran claims that all living things where created out of water as a component.

=== What Holds up the Sky? ===

''And He '''raised the sky''' and He established '''the balance'''.'' ([[s:Quran/55#1-25 | 55:7]])

''... And He '''holds the sky''' so that it would '''not collapse''' upon the Earth, except by His leave. Indeed, God is Kind towards mankind, Merciful.'' ([[s:Quran/22#65-72 | 22:65]])

''He created the skies '''without pillars''' that you can see....'' ([[s:Quran/31#1-11 | 31:10]], also [[s:Quran/13#1-7 | 13:2]]) 

The Koran claims that God supports the sky from falling, without visible pillars.

== The Sky == 

=== Difference between the sun and the moon ===

''&quot;And He made the moon to '''illuminate''' in them, and He made the sun to be '''a lit flame'''?&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/71#1-20 | 71:16]])

the Koran claims that the sun is the source of light in relation to the moons illumination or reflection.

=== Astronomy ===

''And the sun runs to a '''specific destination''', such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable. And the moon We have measured it to '''appear in stages''', until it returns to being like an old curved sheath. The sun is '''not to overtake''' the moon, nor will the night precede the day; each of them is '''swimming in its own orbit'''.'' ([[s:Quran/36#33-50 | 36:38-40]])

the Koran claims that the sun and the moon are swimming in their own orbits. The Koran claims that the &quot;swimming&quot; has ups and downs and the sun has limited timespan.

=== 'Comets Of Ice' ===

''Do you not see that God '''drives the clouds''', then He '''gathers''' them together, then He '''piles''' them upon each other, then you see the soft '''rain coming''' out of them? And He sends down hail from the sky from the mountains to afflict whomever He wills, and He diverts it from whomever He wills, the brightness of the snow almost blinds the eyes.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:43]])

the Koran claims that rain is formed from the clouds through several stages. But where did the water came from to this Earth originally?

''...He sent down '''from the sky''' water...'' ([[s:QQuran/2#21-29 | 2:22]], also [[s:Quran/14#28-34 | 14:32]] and [[s:Quran/16#61-65 | 16:65]]) 

the Koran claims that originally the water came as a hail or ice comets from the space.

=== Two Easts and Two Wests ===
''...the Lord of the '''east''' and the '''west'''...'' ([[s:Quran/70#36-44 | 70:40]])

''...the Lord of the '''two east''' and the '''two west'''...'' ([[s:Quran/55#1-25 | 55:17]])

''...the distance of the '''two easts'''...'' ([[s:Quran/43#36-45 | 43:38]])

the Koran implies that the sun does not rise and set on single location throughout the season.

=== Interstellar Galactic Material ===

''To Him is what is in the heavens and what is in the Earth, and what is '''in between''', and what is underneath the soil.'' ([[s:Quran/20#1-24 | 20:6]], also [[s:Quran/25#45-60 | 25:59]], [[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:4]] and [[s:Quran/50#30-45 | 50:38]]))

the Koran claims that there are some materials in between galaxies.

=== Sun is swimming in orbit ===
&quot;...the sun and the moon, each swimming in an orbit.&quot; ([[s:Quran/21#30-41 | 21:33]], also [[s:Quran/36#33-50 |  36:40]]).

the Koran claims that the sun is not fixed in its place.

==Aliens?==

''...and of his signs, the creation of the skies and the earth and the animals that are divided between them, and he can call upon them whenever he wishes.'' ''Shora, ayeye 29''

claiming that there is life spread between the skies (probably space) and the earth.

== Biology ==  
=== The ongoing process of creation ===

''... And He creates what you '''do not know'''.'' ([[s:Quran/16#1-9 | 16:8]])

''... God creates '''whatever He wills'''. God is capable of all things.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:45]])

the Koran implies that God does not stop creating.

=== Embryological &amp; Fetal Development ===

''&quot;While He created you '''in stages'''?&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/71#1-20 | 71:14]])

''And God created you from '''dust''', then from a '''seed''', then He made you into pairs. And no female becomes pregnant, nor gives birth, without His knowledge. Nor does anyone have his life extended, or his life is shortened, except in a record. This is easy for God.'' ([[s:Quran/35#8-14 | 35:11]])

Koran claims that the first man is created from dust and the rest is created from a seed.

''You'' might also mean life and god is referring to Evolution, Bacteria in the earth being ''the earth'', ''seeds'' referring to mushrooms and plants, and ''pairs'' meaning the evolution of males and females. 

''Was he not a seed from '''sperm put forth'''?'' ([[s:Quran/75#31-40 | 75:37]])

''He was created from '''water that gushes forth'''. It comes out from between the spine and the testicles.'' ([[s:Quran/86 | 86:7-8]]) 

''Was there not a time in the past when the human being was nothing to even be mentioned? We have created the human from a '''seed that is mixed''', We test him, so We made him hear and see. '' ([[s:Quran/76#1-22 | 76:1-2]])

''The One who perfected everything He created and He began the creation of the human from mud. Then He made his offspring from a structure derived from a '''lowly liquid'''. Then He evolved him, and blew into him from His spirit. And He made for you the hearing, the eyesight, and the hearts; rarely are you thankful.'' ([[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:7-9]])

the Koran claims that man are created from a small drop of sperm.

''Was he not a seed from sperm put forth? Then he was a clot, so he was created and developed.'' ([[s:Quran/75#31-40 | 75:37-38]]) 

the Koran claims that the first stage of embryological development is comparable to a clot, in shape, in how he clings and in how it draws substance from his host.

''Then We created the seed into an '''embryo''', then We created the embryo into a '''fetus''', then We created the fetus into '''bone''', then We covered the bone with '''flesh''', then We brought forth a '''new creation'''. So glory be to God, the best of creators.'' ([[s:Quran/23#1-22 | 23:14]])

''... then from an embryo, then from a fetus developed and undeveloped so that We make it clear to you. And We settle in the wombs what We wish to an appointed time, then We bring you out a child... '' ([[s:Quran/22#1-10 | 22:5]])

the Koran claims that second stage of embryological development looks like a ragged piece of meat to the naked eye. The later stages is organs development starting with bones. In this stage the development could be uneven.

=== Pollution &amp; wasting natural resources ===

'''''Pollution''' has appeared in '''the land and the sea''' '''by the hands of mankind''' for what they earned. He will make them taste some of what they have done, perhaps they will revert. Say: &quot;Roam the Earth and see how the end was for those before. Most of them had set up partners.&quot; '' ([[s:Quran/30#41-53 | 30:41-42]])

''O Children of Adam, dress nicely at every temple, and eat and drink and '''do not indulge'''; He does not like the indulgers.'' ([[s:Quran/7#26-31 | 7:31]])

the Koran claims that mankind polutes the earth and it is possible to be more environmentally friendly.

=== Clouds Formation ===

''Do you not see that God '''drives the clouds''', then He '''gathers''' them together, then He '''piles''' them upon each other, then you see the soft '''rain coming''' out of them? And He sends down hail from the sky from the mountains to afflict whomever He wills, and He diverts it from whomever He wills, the brightness of the snow almost blinds the eyes.'' ([[s:Quran/24#41-50 | 24:43]])

the Koran claims that clouds can form  mountain-size piles in the sky. This gigantic clouds formation creates a supercooled hail which causes electron flows that could produce lighting. This is the first clouds formation capable to produce rain.

''God Who sends the '''winds''', so they '''raise''' clouds, and He '''spreads''' them in the sky as He wishes, then He turns them into '''joined pieces''', then you see the '''rain''' drops come forth from their midst. Then when He makes them fall on whomever He wills of His servants, they rejoice!'' ([[s:Quran/30#41-53 | 30:48]])

the Koran claims that there is a second clouds formation that capable to produce rain which might not capable of producing lighting.

''And if they see a '''spectacle''' from the sky, they will Say: &quot;'''Piled clouds'''!&quot;'' ([[s:Quran/52#29-49 | 52:44]])

the Koran claims that clouds are '''not''' solid as some might think.

=== The Water Cycle ===

''And We '''sent down''' from the sky water in due measure, then We let it '''reside''' in the land, and We are capable of '''taking it away'''.'' ([[s:Quran/23#1-22 | 23:18]])

the Koran claims that rainfall can be absorbed in to the ground and that it can eventually be removed (drained). 

''He '''sent down''' water from the sky, so valleys '''flowed''' according to their capacity...'' ([[s:Quran/13#8-18 | 13:17]])

''Do you not see that God '''sends down '''water from the sky, and causes it to become '''streams through the land''', then He produces with it plants of various colors...'' ([[s:Quran/39#10-21 | 39:21]])

the Koran claims that water moves through surface or underground rivers.

''Have you noted the water you drink? Did '''you''' send it down from the clouds, or was it '''We''' who sent it down?'' ([[s:Quran/56#39-74 | 56:68-69]])

the Koran implies that even the most sophisticated rain-control techniques depends on presence clouds in vicinity and its readiness to produce rain.

''And He is the One who '''merges''' the two bodies of water. This is fresh and palatable and this is salty and bitter. And He made between them a '''partition''' and an '''inviolable barrier'''.'' ([[s:Quran/25#45-60 | 25:53]])

the Koran claims that large rivers has invisible barriers between salt water and fresh water.

=== The diversity of mankind ===

''And from His signs are the creation of the heavens and the Earth, and the difference of your '''languages''' and your '''colors'''. In that are signs for the world.'' ([[s:Quran/30#20-27 | 30:22]])

''O mankind, We created you from a male and female, and We made you into '''nations''' and '''tribes''', that you may know one another. Surely, the most honourable among you in the sight of God is the most righteous. God is Knowledgeable, Expert.'' ([[s:Quran/49#11-18 | 49:13]])

the Koran claims that variation in language, nations and races are inevitable and better to be embraced.

=== The Cerebrum ===


:''Have you seen if he lied and turned away? Did he not know that God can see? Alas, if he does not cease, We will strike the frontal lobe. A frontal lobe which sees and hears.''
::&lt;sub&gt;[96:15]&lt;/sub&gt;

This translation of the Koran appears to claim that the front part of the brain, the [[w:frontal lobe|frontal lobe]] controls the eyes and ears of a man.

:''Seest thou if he denies and turns away? Knows he not that Allah sees? Nay, if he desist not, We will seize him by the forelock - a lying, sinful forelock!''
::[[s:Quran/96 |96:13-16]] The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)

This translation, however, refers to a &quot;forelock&quot;, a lock of hair at the front of the head, rather than a lobe of the brain, and does not make any claims to the function of the lock, but rather the characteristics of lock as an extension of a sinful person.

====Modern scientific evidence====

The regions of the brain responsible for various functions of the human body are relatively well known, due to extensive research and modern imaging techniques which can map activity in the brain for a given action.

The [[w:auditory cortex|auditory cortex]] is the primary centre of the brain responsible for sound processing. It is located in the [[w:temporal lobe|temporal lobes]] on the sides of the brain. It is known to interact with various other areas of the brain, mostly also in the temporal lobe or in the [[w:parietal lobe|parietal lobe]], towards the top of the brain, but one of them, [[w:Broca's area|Broca's area]], is located in the frontal lobe. This area is known to be involved in speech interpretation and production.

The [[w:visual cortex|visual cortex]] is located at the back of the brain, in the [[w:occipital lobe|occipital lobe]]. It strongly interacts along two pathways. The &quot;dorsal stream&quot;, shown in green below, sends the information to the parietal lobe, when the responses to the stimulus, such as movements of the arms or legs, are co-ordinated. The &quot;ventral stream&quot; (purple) sends data to the temporal lobe, where the meaning of the visual data is decoded and objects are recognised. This stream is also associated with the long-term memory of the information.

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|[[File:Brain_Surface_Gyri.SVG|300px|thumb|The primary auditory cortex is shown here in pink. It is known to interact with the other shaded areas. Broca's area, in blue, is located at the rear of the frontal lobe.]]
|[[File:Ventral-dorsal_streams.svg|300px|thumb|The primary visual cortex is shown here in blue. The two arrows show the two paths of information through the brain: to the temporal lobe (purple), and to the parietal lobe (green).]]
|}

The frontal lobe of the brain is mostly involved in the ability to recognize future consequences resulting from current actions, to choose between good and bad actions (or better and best), override and suppress unacceptable social responses, and determine similarities and differences between things or events. Therefore, it is involved in higher mental functions, and if frequently implicated in the formation of personality.

====Discussion====

In contrast to the Koranic assertions, modern scientific opinion does not place much value on the function of the frontal lobe with respect to vision and hearing, although some areas of the frontal lobe are used to help process language. However, the argument could be made that &quot;vision&quot; in the Koran refers metaphorically to the foresight of an individual rather than the literal meaning of visual processing.

The function of the frontal lobe in formation of social response could also be seen to be referenced by the &quot;lying and turning away&quot;, in which case the Koran obliquely notes this relationship.

== Physics ==
=== Relativity of Time ===

''He arranges matters from the heaven to the Earth, then it ascends to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''one thousand of the years''' which you count.'' ([[s:Quran/32#1-11 | 32:5]])

''The Angels and the Spirit ascent to Him in a day which is equivalent to '''fifty thousand years'''.'' ([[s:Quran/70#1-35 | 70:4]])

the Koran implies that time is relative to the speed of moving subject.

== Conclusion ==
The Koran claims that God does exist and actively interacting with humankind through Nature, His Creation. Koran claims that only knowledgable people can recognize it and take advantage of it. 

There are doubts about it, thanks to poor translations and limited number of scientists collectively improving the interpretation of the Koran. Such efforts are possible due to preservations and wide distributions of the original Arabic manuscripts. This book serves as a collection point of their efforts.

Averroës (ibn Rushd) declared, &quot;Truth does not contradict truth but rather is consistent with it and bears witness to it&quot;, thereby dispelling any concerns about the issue of a double truth, one for religion and one for philosophy/science. Where conflict between religion and reason arises, particularly concerning scriptural interpretation, reason's method of demonstration of truth is primary in determining the need for allegorical interpretation of otherwise conflicting explanations.

If God exists, what to do about it? There are at least three alternatives:
# I don't care
# Let's serve Him. Believe in Him and doing good acts is enough. More on this ancient, inclusive and fundamentalist point-of-view in [[Islam Way of Life]].
# Let's worship Him. God is Love. Koran is Guidance. Prophet Muhammad is the most perfect human. More on this modern, exclusive, idealist and official point-of-view in [[Islam Way of Life]].

=== Disclaimer ===
''He is the One who sent down to you the Scripture, from which there are '''firm verses'''; they are the essence of the Scripture; and others which are similar to each other. As for those who have disease in their hearts, they will follow what is '''similar''' from it seeking to '''confuse''', and seeking to derive an '''interpretation'''. But none know its interpretation except God and those who are '''well founded in knowledge''', they Say: &quot;We believe in it, '''all''' is from our Lord.&quot; And none will remember except the people of understanding.'' ([[s:Quran/3#1-9 | 3:7]])

Koran disclaims that it can be used for good intention only, contrary to some people believes. Koran claims that it can be used for bad intentions as well. Fortunately, this bad intention, or to lesser degree bad interpretations and translations, can be exposed overtime by the experts via a consistent and holistic approach. The [[Islam Way of Life]] book is a summary of all '''firm verses''', the essence of the Scripture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arimaa strategy involves straightforward concepts which overlap in complex ways. Very different styles of play remain popular; some players are very aggressive, quickly attacking enemy territory with the aim of taking over one or both of the enemy's home traps. Others prefer to play a &quot;home game&quot;, and try to capture enemy pieces mainly by pulling them down. It is not yet clear what is the optimal balance between offense and defense.

First, familiarize yourself with all of the basic concepts.  After gaining experience with various strategies, you can revisit this material for a closer reading, and perhaps even bring it up to date.

Wings is probably the only 3D application (besides Nendo that was big inspiration for Wings developers) where you can learn just by using it, because the tools are accessed by right click menus rather than being spread out in toolbars. Only the tools you are currently able to use will be in the right click menu, depending on what selection mode your in. Wings is a box modeling application, which means polygonal modeling that grows out from a primitive object (usually a cube, hence box modeling) where you use four basic actions: move, extrude, scale and rotate. The geometry you create from these actions can be further refined by things like beveling, cutting edges, etc. Wings also has a smoothing function more popularly known as subdividing or sub-d. This not only gives you more geometry by dividing faces in half, but also smooths the shape of your model by rounding corners depending on closeness of edges.

===[[Second Life]]===
Wings can be used to make ''sculpties'' (also known as &quot;sculpted primitives&quot;) in Second Life.  Currently, the best information is in the [http://www.secondlife.com  Second Life] forums. If it becomes wider used, information specific to Second Life should be developed here.

This WikiBook needs a '''table of contents'''. Without it, nobody knows what this WikiBook will encompass. To see an example of how a table of contents should be laid out, see the WikiBook [[Mac OS X Tiger]].

In addition, this WikiBook needs an introduction (in plain english) and needs to be less dense.

See the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Macintosh|WikiProject Macintosh]] oage for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">David, some good thinking here.
Another component to this is the harsh reality of survival. The human race will be extinct within another 500 years simply because it is rapidly destroying it's host, planet Earth.

A part of the moral redevelopment of the human race needs to take into account the behaviors we have exhibited to create this situation - and then provide an antidote. The keys behaviours that have created such a problem revolve primarily around selfishness and greed. As you have correctly stated elsewhere, our drive to produce more and more personal wealth and accumulation is causing much of our problems. Nature will eventually create balance if we do not take responsibility. The difficulty is getting the incredibly stupid and de-evolving human race to understand, or care about, the long term effects. This must begin by teaching the cause and effect at a very early age in schools and having children take it upon themselves to make a difference.

I put this in discussion because it really does need some discussion on methodologies before it is enshrined in the book. Garyj

* Yes, Garyj: teaching children at a very early age will certainly help to indoctrinate beliefs and behaviours.
* However, adults must first agree that this is a desired thing to do, then decide what to teach. I think that an adult-formed, long term goal comes first; then what practices to follow may come second. (A goal provides a guiding focus, can help to formulate strategies toward reaching that gaol, and then help to decide what behaviours to follow. Many of which, I assume, would include teaching the behaviours The Fellowship of Peace endorses.) [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 18:23, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

Absolutely! The trick is to develop a group of parents that has the ear of governments and the education authorities. The project will unfortunatly need to be presented to governments pretty much as a business plan, since it will be the money involved in educating populations that will carry the day. Strong lobbying of political parties (and or starting a party) will be necessary?

Gary

*Yes, Gary. I think that strong lobbying (and lots of finance) will be needed! [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 21:39, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Welcome Again==

Welcome, and I mean this sincerly, welcome to Wikibooks.  It is fantastic to see somebody like you to come here and try to take on the incredibly huge task of trying to write a textbook.  And to take on a subject like Algebra!  This is something that really does need to be accomplished.

Take some time to poke around here on Wikibooks as well.  Excuse some of the messes that you will find, and it is still a little bit confusing to people not quite familiar with Wikimedia projects.  While Wikibooks is over three years old now, we have recently experienced a huge increase in just about every sort of number you can use to measure websites like this, and we are showing those growing pains as well.  If you need some advise, feel free to contact any one of [[Wikibooks:Administrators|the project administrators]] for some help.  They are all experienced users and are here to help people like you to succeed.

One reason I'm dropping a line to you is that you recently deleted a page by removing the content.  Don't worry, I understand that you are new here, but for future reference I would like to encourage you to instead use a special markup symbol that we call a template tag.  The specific tag for removing content is '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', where you replace the word reason with the justification for removing the content.  The bracket symbols (&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;) indicate a special command or a template that the Wiki software will insert into the text at the point you put this into text you are editing here.  All content on Wikibooks and similar project must be manually deleted as we don't trust a computer to be able to make accurate judgement calls to remove content like this, and only an administrator can really delete content.  The reasons for this is to keep potential mischief makers from really messing things up, but allow some trusted individuals to help keep things under control.

I hope that your experience here on Wikibooks is productive and I also hope to see more of your contributions soon!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:50, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sean. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sean~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Management Is The Key To Success ==

If you give yourself a goal or objective and you want to seriously contribute towards it, then the first thing you'll want to do is manage what to do first. Management is the key to success, no matter what you are trying to achieve. Management in simple terms is a noun that is related to the word &quot;manage&quot; which means:

''1. To direct or be in charge of.''

''2. To handle or control, to force.''

''3. To succeed at an attempt.'' 

In a computer, you sometimes defragment your hard drive in order to arrange the data so it can be accessed easily. This is similar to management. Project management is another type of management and so on. Management is not always on the same scale, sometimes at a bigger level there will be times when certain tasks become increasingly difficult, especially in such demanding environments such as the workplace. You may find that you will spend a large amount of your life worrying about these issues. Effective management can greatly reduce this stress.

Management for students is different from management for working adults. Students manage not only their routine but their behavior and many other responsibilities. Fortunately, these things are not as demanding as they are for adults, and a student has ample time to sort out a plan.

== Types and Methods of Management ==

There are various kinds of management:

'''1.) Crisis Management'''

Management done at a critical moment with quickness and accuracy.
e.g. If somebody attacks you, your body will need to quickly react by taking in the surroundings and deciding on a course of action. This type of life-threatening problem will probably not occur too often, but there are other types of crises which may provoke similar reactions out of your body, even if they are not needed. Do you ever feel that sinking feeling in your heart when you have a lot of assignments due at once? That is a type of problem which your body will react to in a similar way to a life-threatening danger. Your body's reaction is rarely needed when this happens, so it is best to avoid it altogether. Stress management and also long-term management will help to prevent this.

'''2.) Life Management'''

A form of long-term management which occurs on a daily, weekly, or even yearly basis. Some people refer to this as a 'routine', and that's the general idea behind life management. Organizing events into a predictable schedule may not sound very exciting, but it makes it easier to tackle one problem at a time. For this kind of management you may want a calendar which you can write on so that you can mark all of the important obstacles in your life, and work around them.

'''3.) Project/Task Management'''

Management done to complete a certain task. In your school you may be required to write an assignment on a certain topic, which may be due by the end of the week. When you are working on it, you will need to figure out what to do, what order to do it in, and the amount of time you should allocate to each smaller task.

Management becomes much easier when you are relaxed and able to sit back and outline what should be done. If you are tired you may find this difficult, so remember to get lots of rest at night, and also practice those relaxation techniques we showed you earlier. Your mind works much like a computer. It prefers information to be in an orderly fashion, this is why your brain rearranges itself while you sleep. You can make things a lot easier for your mind if you order things before you put them in. This is why planning is so useful for getting work done.

===1. Project/Task Management===
In order to produce an exceptional Project, it's helpful to ask these six questions. If you want, you can put them on a piece of paper to use as your plan.

'''1. &quot;What is the task I need to complete?&quot;'''

If you don't know where you're going, you won't arrive where you need to be.  For example: I need to write a 5-page paper on Environmental Pollution. Write this at the top of your paper.

'''2. &quot;What information do I need?&quot;'''

If your paper is on Environmental Pollution, you need to find out what types of pollution there are and collect details about the subject. Now would be a good time to plan subheadings for your plan so that you know exactly what areas of the topic you are going to cover. For example:


''What is pollution?''

This will introduce your topic in general. Normally you would want something more catchy than this.


''What kinds of pollution are there?''

This will make your topic more specific, and zoom in on what you want to cover. This is where you will introduce 'Environmental Pollution'.


''Dealing with environmental pollution.'''

One of your focus questions. There may be thousands of possible focus questions for each topic. Choose the ones that interest you most. Here are some other focus questions:

''  The future impacts of environmental pollution.''

''  The impact of environmental pollution on animals.''

''The impact of environmental pollution on global warming.''


If you are lucky, a teacher will let you choose these focus questions yourself, but sometimes you will be given a list that you must choose from. In this case it is not a good idea to go for the most interesting one, as everyone else will go for that. Instead, go for the most difficult one. I assure you, the teacher will appreciate reading something different after reading twenty essays on the same topic, and will award you with good grades, even if your essay wasn't as good as the others.

'''3.  &quot;What are the resources I have at my disposal to complete my task?&quot;'''

You might use the Internet, library, magazines, or go to a book store.  Maybe one of your friends works at a water treatment Plant. You could interview this friend.  Many other sources of help are usually available: teachers or supervisors may be able to direct you to helpful sources. Remember, teachers will reward creativity, and an essay with quotes from your friend who works at a water treatment plant will most definitely get very good marks, as it will be something different from all of the other essays that teachers are forced to sit through.

'''4.  &quot;What is the end product going to look like?&quot;'''

Is it a presentation, a written paper, a website, a physical construction like a model?  What were the teacher's / supervisor's guidelines on this assignment?  If the directions were not clear, this is the time to go back and ask questions.

'''5.  &quot;Now that I have the information, what do I do with it?&quot;'''

Take notes, make a chart, highlight, collect citation information. In essence, you have everything you need. Anything from now on will just build on from what you have collected.

'''6.  Evaluate the product before turning it in / presenting it.'''

&quot;Does it meet the requirements that were given to me?&quot;  If something was left out, fix it before submitting it. Remember to proof-read your work. I assure you that you will have made at least a couple a spelling errors somewhere in your work. Reading over your work, even just skim-reading, will help you to find and remove those small errors.

For more information and tips on studying, have a look at the [[Study_Skills]] Wikibook.&lt;br&gt;
That's enough management for now as a student. Now let's learn to help others and advise them next.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I did some formating to the learning objectives to make them more consistent with the other courses. One of the things I am noticing is that we are getting some variations in the enabling objectives across the courses. We may want to think of a way to standardize these. Great job on creating them. Our next step is to do an outline.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 14:55, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">First remove at least the seconds and minute hands, the hour hand if desired.  

Timex dials are usually held with tabs that bend over the movement plate.  Lift the tabs as little as possible. 

Some inexpensive pinlevers have tiny screws on the edge of the face. 
[[Image:BwcDialScrew02678.jpg]]

Most good watches will have two dial feet or posts with some sort of screw to retain them.  

A common method on Swiss watches is a cam screw--this will have a very tall head, and a sharp ridge between the threads and the head.  There is a flat removed from the ridge.  These will be screwed in until almost snug, with the flat lined up with the dial hole.  The dial is installed, then these screws are backed out--The ridge will bite into the dial foot, and backing the screw out will tighten the dial. To remove, turn clockwise until the flat aligns with the post.
[[Image:BwcDialscrew2676.jpg]]

The screws may be simple setscrews around the edge--Sometimes straight in towards the center, sometimes at an angle.

A third, commonly found on Japanese watches is a cam near the edge.  This will be pried away from the foot. (Picture will come later)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hexadecimal==
*[[/Questions#Hexadecimal|Questions]]
As you know, the number system we normally count in is '''base 10''', and the number system that computers use, binary, is '''base 2'''. '''Hexadecimal''' is a '''base 16''' number system. In hexadecimal, the numbers 0-9 are used, just like in denary, but the letters A-F are also used to represent the numbers 10-15. The table below shows the numbers 0-16 in denary, and their binary and hexadecimal equivalents:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Hexadecimal !! Binary !! Denary
|-
| 0 || 0000 ||  0
|-
| 1 || 0001 ||  1
|-
| 2 || 0010 ||  2
|-
| 3 || 0011 ||  3
 |-
| 4 || 0100 ||  4
|-
| 5 || 0101 ||  5
|-
| 6 || 0110 ||  6
|-
| 7 || 0111 ||  7
|-
| 8 || 1000 ||  8
|-
| 9 || 1001 ||  9
|-
| A || 1010 || 10
|-
| B || 1011 || 11
|-
| C || 1100 || 12
|-
| D || 1101 || 13
|-
| E || 1110 || 14
|-
| F || 1111 || 15
|-
| 10 || 10000 || 16
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

You may notice from the table that one hexadecimal digit can represent exactly 4 binary bits. Hexadecimal is useful to us as a shorthand way of writing binary, and makes it easier to work with long binary numbers.

===Converting Between Bases===

Since 4 binary bits are represented by one hexadecimal digit, it is simple to convert between the two. You can group binary bits into groups of 4, starting from the right, and adding extra 0's to the left if required, and then convert each group to their hexadecimal equivalent. For example, the number 110110011110101 can be written like this:

0110 1100 1111 0101

and then by using the table above, you can convert each group of 4 bits into hexadecimal:

6 C F 5.

So the binary number 0110110011110101 is 6CF5 in hexadecimal. We can check this by converting both to denary. First we'll convert the binary number, since you already know how to do this:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!32768 ||16384 ||8192 ||4096 ||2048 ||1024 ||512 ||256 ||128 ||64 ||32 ||16 ||8 ||4 ||2 ||1
|-
|0 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||1 ||0 ||1
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

By multiplying the columns and then adding the results, the answer is 27893.

Notice that the column headings are all 2 raised to a power, &lt;math&gt;1 = 2^0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2 = 2^1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4 = 2^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;8 = 2^3&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. To convert from hexadecimal to denary, we must use column headings that are powers with the base 16, like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!&lt;math&gt;16^3=&lt;/math&gt;4096 ||&lt;math&gt;16^2=&lt;/math&gt;256 ||&lt;math&gt;16^1=&lt;/math&gt;16 ||&lt;math&gt;16^0=&lt;/math&gt;1
|-
||6 ||C ||F ||5
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;math&gt;5 \times 1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;15 \times 16 = 240&lt;/math&gt; (You should memorize the values A-F)

&lt;math&gt;12 \times 256 = 3072&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;6 \times 4096 = 24576&lt;/math&gt;

Totalling them all up gives us 27893, showing that 0110110011110101 is equal to 6CF5.

To convert from denary to hexadecimal, it is recommended to just convert the number to binary first, and then use the simple method above to convert from binary to hexadecimal.

:''NOTE: Hexadecimal is used as it is easier for people to understand than pure binary.  It '''DOES NOT''' take up less space in memory, only on paper!''

==Negative Binary Numbers==
*[[/Questions#Negative Binary Numbers|Questions]]
A computer works purely in binary. That means that it only uses ones and zeros, and there's no - or + symbol that the computer can use. The computer must represent negative numbers in a different way.

===Twos Complement===
We can represent a negative number in binary by making the most significant bit a '''sign bit''', which will tell us whether the number is positive or negative. The column headings for an 8 bit number will look like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!-128 ||64 ||32 ||16 ||8 ||4 ||2 ||1
|-
|1 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||1 ||0 ||1
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Here, the most significant bit is negative, and the other bits are positive. You start with -128, and add the other bits as normal. The example above is -67 in denary. -1 in binary is 11111111.

Note that you only use the most significant bit as a sign bit if the number is specified as '''signed'''. If the number is '''unsigned''', then the msb is positive.

===Converting Negative Numbers===
To find out the value of a two's complement number we must first make note of its sign bit (the most significant, left most bit).  If 0 then the number is positive, if 1 then the number is negative. 

 '''0'''000 0101 (positive)
 '''1'''111 1011 (negative)

To find the value of the negative number we must find and keep the right most 1 and all bits to its right, and then flip everything to its left.  Here is an example:

 1111 101'''1''' find the right most one
 
 '''1111 101'''1 
 '''0000 010'''1 flip all the bits to its left

We can now work out the value of this new number which is:

 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1 
   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   1
                       4   +   1 = &amp;minus;5   ('''remember the sign you worked out earlier!''')

How about a more complex example?

 1111 1'''1'''00 find the right most one
 
 '''1111 1'''100
 '''0000 0'''100 flip all the bits to its left

 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1 
   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0
                       4         = &amp;minus;4   ('''remember the sign you worked out earlier!''')


So we know how to work out the value of a negative number that has been given to us.  How do we go about working out the negative version of a positive number?  Like this, that's how...

Take the binary version of the positive number

 0000 0101 (5)
 0000 010'''1''' find the right most one
 
 '''0000 010'''1 
 '''1111 101'''1 flip all the bits to its left

So now we can see the difference between a positive and a negative number

 '''0'''000 0101 (5)
 '''1'''111 1011 (&amp;minus;5)

===Binary Subtraction===
When it comes to subtracting one number from another in binary things can get very messy.
 X (82 denary) 0101 0010
 Y (78 denary) 0100 1110 &amp;minus;

An easier way to subtract Y from X is to ''add'' the negative value of Y to the value of X
 X&amp;minus;Y = X+(&amp;minus;Y)

To do this we first need to find the negative value of Y

 0100 11'''1'''0 find the right most one
 
 '''0100 11'''10 
 '''1011 00'''10 flip all the bits to its left

Now try the sum again
    0101 0010     X( 82 denary) 
    1011 0010 +   Y(&amp;minus;78 denary)
    0000 0100
 (¹)¹¹¹   ¹       the one carried over the bit 9 is ignored

Which comes out as
 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1 
   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0

==Binary Fractions==
*[[/Questions#Binary_Fractions|Questions]]
Up until now, we have only been working with whole numbers, or '''integers'''. We need a way to store '''real numbers''' on a computer system.

===Fixed Point Numbers===
First, we should have a look at one of the ways that we can represent fractions in denary:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!10 ||1 || ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{10}&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{100}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|1 ||2 ||. ||7 ||5
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

As you can see, the column headings have been extended to &lt;math&gt;10^{-1}=\frac {1}{10}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{-2}=\frac {1}{100}&lt;/math&gt;. We can do the same thing in binary with the column headings &lt;math&gt;2^{-1}=\frac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2^{-2}=\frac {1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. The number 12.75 in binary is therefore:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| Border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!8 ||4 ||2 ||1 || ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|1 ||1 ||0 ||0 ||. ||1 ||1
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Notice that for the same number of bits after the point, the binary number is less accurate. It can only take 4 different values, whereas the denary number can have 100 different divisions with two digits.

===Floating Point Numbers===

If you study other subjects such as Physics or Chemistry, you may come across Floating Point numbers like this
  &lt;math&gt;6.63_{10} \times 10^{-34}&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Planck's constant|Planck's constant]])
The first bit defines the non-zero part of the number and is called the '''Mantissa''', the second part defines how many positions we want to move the decinal point, this is known as the '''Exponent''' and can be positive when moving the decimal point to the right and negative when moving to the left.
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \underbrace{6.63} \\ Mantissa \end{matrix} \times \begin{matrix}  \underbrace{10^{-34}} \\ Exponent \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If you wanted to write out that number in full you would have to move the decimal point in the exponent 34 places to the left, resulting in:
 &lt;math&gt;0.00\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;663_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
Which would take a lot of time to write and is very hard for the human eye to see how many zeros there are.  There for, when we can accept a certain level of accuracy (6.63 = 3 significant figures), we can store a many digit number like planks constant in a small number of digits.  You are always weighing up the scope (or range) of the number against its accuracy (number of significant bits).

The same is true with binary numbers and is even more important.  When you are dealing with numbers and their computational representation you must always be aware of how much space the numbers will take up in memory.  As we saw with the above example, the non floating point representation of a number can take up an unfeasible number of digits, imagine how many digits you would need to store.
&lt;math&gt;0.00\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;000\;663_{10}&lt;/math&gt; in binary?  (don't worry this question is rhetorical)

A binary floating point number may consist of 2, 3 or 4 bytes, however the only ones you need to worry about are the 2 byte (16 bit) variety.  The first 10 bits are the Mantissa, the last 6 bits are the exponent.

&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\overbrace{0}^\text{sign bit} \cdot 101010101}_\text{mantissa} \times \underbrace{010101}_\text{exponent}&lt;/math&gt;

Just like the denary floating point representation, a binary floating point number will have a mantissa and an exponent, though as you are dealing with binary (base 2) you must remember that that instead of having &lt;math&gt;\times 10^{xy}&lt;/math&gt; you will have to use &lt;math&gt;\times 2^{xy}&lt;/math&gt;



Fixed point binary allows a computer to hold fractions but due to its nature is very limited in its scope. Even using 4 bytes to hold each number, with 8 bits for the fractional part after the point, the largest number that can be held is just over 8 million. Another format is needed for holding very large numbers. 

In decimal, very large numbers can be shown with a mantissa and an exponent. i.e. 0.12² Here the 0.12 is the mantissa and the ² is the exponent. the mantissa holds the main digits and the exponents defines where the decimal point should be placed.

The same technique can be used for binary numbers. For example two bytes could be split so that 10 bits are used for the mantissa and the remaining 6 for the exponent. This allows a much greater scope of numbers to be used.

There are several stages to take when working out a floating point number in binary.  In fact it is much like a disco dance routine - known on this page as the Noorgat Dance, Kemp variation (but you wont be tested on name but it should help you to remember)
#'''Sign''' - find the sign of the mantissa (make a note of this)
#'''Slide''' - find the value of the exponent and whether it is positive or negative
#'''Bounce''' - move the decimal the distance the exponent asks, left for a negative exponent, right for a positive 
#'''Flip''' - If the mantissa is negative perform twos complement on it
#'''Swim''' - starting at the decimal point work out the values of the mantissa.  Now make sure you refer back to the sign you recorded on the sign move.

Lets try it out.  We are given the following 16 bit floating point number, with 10 bits for the mantissa, and 6 bits for the exponent.  Remember the decimal point is between the first and second most significant bits
 &lt;math&gt;0100\;0000\;0000\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
The first action we need to perform is the '''sign''', find out the sign of the exponent
 &lt;math&gt;\underline{0}.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 It is 0 so the mantissa is positive
The second step in the Noorgat dance is the '''slide''', we need to find the value of the exponent, that is the last 6 bits of the number
 &lt;math&gt;0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;\underline{00\;0001}&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 32 &amp; 16 &amp; 8 &amp; 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
 So we know that the exponent is of size positive one and we will have to move the decimal point 
 one place to the right.
The third step in the Noorgat dance is the '''bounce''' that is moving the decimal point of the Mantissa the number of positions specified by the slide, which was one position to the right.  Like so:
 &lt;math&gt;0.\vec 1 00\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;01.00\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
The fourth step is the optional '''flip'''.  Check back to the sign stage and see if the Mantissa is negative.  It isn't? Oh well you can skip past this stage then as we only flip the number if the mantissa is negative.

The fifth and final step is the '''swim'''.  Taking the mantissa on its own we can now work out the value of the floating point number.  Start at the centre and label each number to the left &lt;math&gt;1, 2, 4, 8, 16&lt;/math&gt; and so on.  The each number on the right &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{8}\frac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt; and so on.
 &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; . &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{4} &amp; \frac{1}{8} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; . &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} = 1 = 0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0001&lt;/math&gt;
 
 Voila! the answer is 1

==Normalising Numbers==
When dealing with Floating point numbers in binary you must make sure that the first two bits are different.  That is:
 &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;1.0&lt;/math&gt;
And most definitely '''NOT'''
 &lt;math&gt;1.1&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;0.0&lt;/math&gt;
This is because we must make sure the space we are using is being used the greatest efficiency.  For instance if we take a denary floating point number such as
  &lt;math&gt;6.63_{10} \times 10^{-34}&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Planck's constant|Planck's constant]])
If we were to rewrite it as:
  &lt;math&gt;0.0663_{10} \times 10^{-32}&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Planck's constant|Planck's constant]])
Then you can see the representation takes up an extra 2 characters, the two extra 0's, even though it represents exactly the same number.  This may be acceptable when you are not worried about how many characters a number makes up, but in binary and with computers the space that numbers take up is very important, and we need the most efficient representation we can. With a fixed number of bits, a normalised representation of a number will display the number to the greatest accuracy possible. '''You must make sure that your normalisation does not change the sign of the mantissa. '''Taking a binary floating point number:
 &lt;math&gt;0.010\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0011&lt;/math&gt;
We can see that the number starts with &lt;math&gt;0.01&lt;/math&gt;.  We need to change this to &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt; for it be normalised.  To do this we need to move the decimal place one position to the right, and to retain the same number represented by the unnormalised number we need to change the exponent accordingly.  With a movement one place right to normalise the number we need to change the exponent to move the decimal point one place left to compensate.  Thus negating one from the current exponent.
 &lt;math&gt;0.010\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0010&lt;/math&gt;
To make sure you have normalised it correctly, check that
 &lt;math&gt;0.010\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0010 = 0.100\;0000\;00\;\mid\;00\;0011&lt;/math&gt;
Lets try a more complicated example:
 &lt;math&gt;1.110\;0000\;00\;\mid\;11\;1110&lt;/math&gt;
To get the mantissa normalised we need to move the decimal point two places to the right.  To maintain the same value as the original floating point number we need to adjust the exponent to be two smaller.
 &lt;math&gt;1.000\;0000\;00\;\mid\;11\;1100&lt;/math&gt;
Now check that the new normalised value has the same value as the original.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey John...

I agree that my story on the Mac OS X Tiger page wasn't as good as it could have been... no offense taken that you reverted it (I helped write the original one). However, I think the original one has a bit too much info in it. I'm going to write another new one and over the course of a few days, try to get it up to snuff. So don't re-revert it until, say, February. 


Thanks,

Np. Go ahead and edit the story, but make sure you keep it short and to-the-point. I just want it to be concise, well-balanced, and jargon-free. [[User:Hyperpasta|Hyperpasta]] 16:34, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

When developing training materials, the critical element is the learning objective. The ''learning objective'' defines the outcome or the result of the training or lesson. If you were to think of a course as a bicycle wheel. You have components of it: the tire, the rim, the spokes, and the shaft. All must work together for the wheel to turn. However, everything is centered around the shaft of the wheel. In this analogy, the shaft is the learning objective. No matter how well the other parts work, if the shaft doesn't work then the wheel is ineffective. Much like the bicycle shaft, the learning objective is critical and imperative to the rest of the training. Understanding this, we look at how to develop a learning objective.



== Types of Learning Objectives ==

There are two primary types of learning objectives we will be working with:

*Terminal Objective: The outcome or the final product. What should the student &quot;look like&quot; when the training is complete? What should they be able to?
*Enabling Objective: Defines the steps to accomplishing the terminal objective. How is the terminal objective going to be accomplished?

== Components and Developing a Learning Objective ==

Working on the assumption that we are utilizing the [[w:Instructional Systems Design|Instructional Systems Design]] model for course development, creating learning objectives does not have to be a complex process. While there are many models to follow, and one should look for one that best suits their style, the simplest to work with is the C-B-S model. The C-B-S model follows the format:

*(C)Condition- Under what circumstances or ''conditions'' should the student perform the task.

*(B)Behavior- Specifically explains what task the student should be able to do.

*(S)Standard- To what level of proficiency should the student perform the task.


Utilizing an example from the [[Wikiversity:School of Fire and Emergency Management/Fire Officer IV|Fire Officer IV]] course:

''Terminal Objective: Given appropriate community demographic data, appraise the department's human resource demographics to determine if the recruitment, selection, and placement of human resources is effective and consistent with law and current best practices.''


Our objective is sectioned as follows:

*Condition: ''Given appropriate community demographic data...''

*Behavior: ''...appraise the department's human resource demographics...'' 

*Standard: ''...to determine if the recruitment, selection, and placement of human resources is effective and consistent with law and current best practices.''

== Conclusions ==

Developing learning objectives does not have to be complex nor a complicated process. However, consistency and comprehension is important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Rules ==
In all subjects, please add a 'Scope' section with a legal disclaimer.  Also, add links to the 1L study guide, wikiversity school of law, and a link to US Law.

The preliminary work should be in outlining the topic.  In depth discussion of the topics of the outline should be limited and very broad.  

Also, a request for legal accuracy is requested.  Proper citation formatting according to ALWD is requested.  Thus, it is recommended that a copy of ALWD, a reliable reference on the topic of law is in front of you (computer screen or book) as you are writing.  Try to avoid broad, over-reaching statements like &quot;past consideration cannot be used as consideration&quot;.  This is true, in general.  There are exceptions such as promises to pay a past debt.  A more correct statement would be &quot;past consideration is generally not part of an enforceable contract, however, there are exceptions&quot;.

Contributions are appreciated, but please be accurate and precise.  If there is a dispute on the subject matter, please discuss prior to changing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==England/British Empire/United Kingdom (English)==

Leader at 1901: Prime Minister Marquess of Salisbury and King Edward VII

Color: Dark Blue or Pink, in some versions (webDiplomacy.net, etc.)

Neighbors: France, Germany, Russia

Home supply centers: London, Liverpool, Edinburgh

England's defensive position is the strongest in the game besides Turkey, and landing an army on the British Isles will usually require at least three units--one convoyed army, one fleet to convoy, and one fleet to support the convoy.  England's &quot;back door&quot; in the North Atlantic is, however, much more difficult to defend than Turkey's back door in Syria.  England's position as an island means that it will have to maintain a large navy in order to achieve victory.  England's position causes a bottleneck similar but less severe than the one Turkey faces, because sea routes can get troops quickly from the home centers to the Mediterranean, to Germany, and to St. Petersburg.

England has a limited choice of centers to make 18.  Most simply, three home, Bre and Par, Bel, Hol, Den, Swe, Nwy, StP, Kie, and Ber are the 13 easiest, leaving 5 centers to get out of Spa, Por, Tun, Mun, Mar, Mos, and War.  Mos and War are very difficult to get without German or Turkish help, and any centers further south are possible only with an extremely committed French ally.

==Opening Strategy==

England can choose between commitment to an attack against France or to calmly pick up builds from Norway and possibly Belgium, and wait for 1902 to choose a side.

==18 Center Goal==

3 home centers, Scandinavia, St. Petersburg, The Low Countries, Kiel, Berlin, Brest, Paris, and Iberia makes 15.  Then three out of Munich, Marseilles, Tunis, Moscow, and Warsaw are required to convert to a victory.  Any other supply centers are much too far away to be part of a normal victory--although once in a while, England will break into Italy or capture Sevastopol.

England's main choice is where to send her two fleets.

===F LON - ENG, F EDI - NTH (Southern Opening)===
Provides the best anti-French possibilities.
====Wales Variation====
A LPL - WAL

Unequivocally anti-French. This move is risky, as failure to acquire the Channel in the spring will make this army useless in the autumn. Useful only when you expect to acquire the Channel, this move provides the strongest set of moves for a French campaign, as the army may be convoyed to Brest or Picardy (usually while NTH acquires Norway) OR may be used in a supported convoy to Belgium.

====Yorkshire Variation====
A LPL - YOR

A much safer prospect than the Wales Variation, and similarly less profitable as an anti-French maneuver. This opening is the opening of choice for an England only wishing to bounce in the Channel, as the army may then be convoyed to Norway or to Belgium. As an offensive opening, the Channel pressures the French homeland while providing support for a convoy to Belgium... or, perhaps, the opportunity to claim Norway with a convoy and Belgium with a fleet!

===F LON - NTH, F EDI - NWG (Northern Opening)===
====Yorkshire Variation ====
A LPL - YOR

The soundest opening from the classical perspective of maximizing minimum gains, this is the only English opening that guarantees a build against all opposition. In brighter times, one may convoy with support to Norway or convoy to Belgium and claim Norway with a fleet; if France, Germany and Russia are determined to stop you, Yorkshire can cover London when France moves to the English Channel, and Norwegian Sea can support North Sea to Norway despite a Russian move Mos -&gt; Stp -&gt; Nor (though a German in this case would seize the North Sea, F Kie -&gt; Den -&gt; NTH; whether or not this is desirable is up for debate).

====Edinburgh Variation (AKA &quot;The Churchill Opening&quot;)====
A LPL - EDI

In this Northern Opening variant, known simply as the Churchill Opening, and named after after Sir Winston's plan to invade Norway in World War II, the English army is sent to Edinburgh. This opening sacrifices the ability to cover London for more convoying options in the autumn. For an England looking for two builds in a favorable diplomatic situation, this allows for Norway to be captured with an army and Belgium/Holland/Denmark with a fleet. London may still be covered by the North Sea, but Norway cannot be secured against Russian resistance if this happens. This move is superior to the Yorkshire Variation if and only if one guesses correctly on French intentions; if they go to the Channel, a build isn't guaranteed, but if they don't, England's options are greater.

===F LON - ENG, F EDI - NWG (The Splits)===
====Wales Variation====
A LPL - WAL

The anti-French Split opening. If France goes to the Channel, England is in a very awkward position, having a useless army in Wales and facing the possibility of a German fleet standing it out of the North Sea in the autumn.

====Edinburgh Variation====
A LPL - EDI

The pro-French Split opening (or, at least, as pro-French as an opening to the Channel can be). Allows convoy to Norway, with England using the Channel fleet to influence Belgium or pressure Brest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== France/French Third Republic/La Troisième République (French)==

Leader at 1901: President of the Council of Ministers Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau

Color: Light Blue

Neighbors: England, Germany, Italy

Home supply centers: Paris, Brest, Marseilles

France is the easiest country to play.  While not as defensively sound as England or Turkey, France is able to move troops quickly through Europe without the burden of a long convoy chain required by Turkey or England. France also has better ''long-term'' survival prospects than either, since while England and Turkey are often forced into a corner and survive until midgame after a long, hopeless war, if France survives the initial possibility of attack from an England-Germany alliance (or, more rarely, an attack from Italy), they can do very well in the mid- and late-games (France has very high end-survival and draw records, as well as a fair amount of wins).  Iberia provides two quick and easy builds early, and profitable alliances can be undertaken with either England or Germany, or both. However, England is not suggested, since England has a better chance of stabbing than Germany or Italy does.

==18 Center Goal==

France has a much greater choice of winning combinations than England.  France is also stronger for being able to build fleets on both sides of the MAO bottleneck--although even this is sometimes not enough to break a stalemate in TYS necessary to grab TUN for a victory.

The most common French winning combination is: 3 home centers, Iberia (2), England (3), the Low Countries (2), Germany (3), Scandinavia (3), St. Petersburg, and one of WAR, MOS, and TUN.

However, France also has a good shot at conquering Italy, especially TUN, ROM, NAP, and possibly VEN if he strikes early.  This allows France to win without getting STP or SWE, and gives France a good foothold across the major stalemate line.

==Opening Strategy==

France has more safe and non-committing openings that can almost guarantee quite a few (usually two, sometimes three) builds during the winter of 1901.  France is the only power able to reach the centers in Iberia in 1901, and can choose to take them calmly, or expend less effort capturing Spain and Portugal to attack Germany or England.

France's major choice is whether to try for the Channel.  If France manages to occupy the Channel, he can almost guarantee himself BEL by force, as long as he has another unit in PIC or BUR.  However, forcing one's way into BEL is against most French theory, which says that France can (and should) play as docilely as possibly during the first year, playing England and Germany off each other, and choosing a side in 1902.  

===F BRE - ENG, The English Attack===
This move is more aggressive than the English move to the Channel in S1901, which, although pointing right into French territory, is usually just for support of F NTH C A YOR - BEL.

If you can guarantee a supportive Germany and a relaxed Russia, this move can kill England, who will suffer terribly if the move to the Channel does not work.  A French fleet in the Channel can support or be supported by a German fleet in Denmark into the North Sea, quickly ending England.

====A MAR - BUR, A PAR - PIC: The Northern Dash====
The most aggressive possible opening for France, it leaves Iberia completely untouched if the move succeeds.  Obviously anti-English and possibly anti-German, this opening may leave you with no friends in Western Europe, and a very hungry-looking Italy in the east.  It provides the maximum possible force on BEL, as well as the possibility of a convoy to WAL or LON.

====A MAR - SPA, A PAR - GAS: The English Defense====
The opposite of the Northern Dash, this opening guarantees two builds from Iberia, while allowing Germany to make a quick strike into BUR if he so desires.

===F BRE - MAO: The Atlantic Opening===

The calmer alternative to the Channel is MAO, which allows France great flexibility in befriending either England or Germany.  Although it gives up the Channel to England, many times England will try desperately to woo France during the opening years by opening to NWG and NTH.  The Mid-Atlantic fleet also gives France a chance for a quick break into the Med by sailing F MAO to Spain's South Coast, which borders WMS.  Adding another fleet with F MAR can mount a powerful early attack on Italy, who usually focuses on the East for the first few years.

====A PAR - BUR, A MAR S A PAR - BUR: The Maginot Opening====
By far the most common French opening, it allows France a finger in each of his three possible neutrals.  It protects against an early German incursion, and the three moves are guaranteed to succeed.  This is the most anti-German opening in France's repertoire as it guarantees a threat on MUN in the fall.  Germany is usually not an early threat to France, and angering him by forcing yourself into BUR may not be the best policy.  If England's friendship can be guaranteed, however, this opening can be extremely powerful by getting close to Germany rapidly.

====A PAR - BUR, A MAR - SPA: The Burgundy Variation====
Second in popularity only to the Maginot Opening is the Burgundy variation.  France claims SPA, and can guarantee himself POR, while still having a stake in the argument over BEL or at least keeping Germany out of BUR.  The Burgundy bothers England a little over BEL and Germany a little over the move to BUR, but antagonizes neither too strongly.  An extremely strong, theoretical opening.

====A MAR - BUR, A PAR - PIC: The Belgian Variation====
More aggressive than the Burgundy Variation, this opening guarantees France a shot at BEL in the fall, in addition to picking up an Iberian neutral.  Somewhat anti-German, this opening aims to get armies to the German border as rapidly as possible.

For time immemorial, humans have been intrigued by creation. Where did we, and the universe in which we live, come from? In the ''Rig Veda'', it was proposed that before creation there was &quot;neither existence nor non-existence.&quot; The Latin phrase ''ex nihilo nihil fit'' (&quot;out of nothing comes nothing&quot;) sums up current human beliefs about origins.

The Qur'an contains the following verse regarding
the origin of the universe:
“Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of Creation), before We clove them asunder?” [Al-Qu’ran 21:30]

Many possibilities have been considered by scientists over the millennia. Did the universe &quot;happen&quot; suddenly, was it created quickly by God, has it existed forever, or is it in a constant state of creation, even now?

Just as we can use size scales to make rough comparisons of the sizes of objects in the universe, we can also use '''time scales''' to compare the periods of time over which events occur. For example, Comet Halley takes about 75 years to complete its orbit around the Sun, so we can say that the period of Comet Halley's orbit has about the same time scale as the human lifespan.

[[Image:Montinari Milano.jpg|thumb|150px|right]]
== The Origin of the Universe according to the Big Bang theory ==

The universe is big in space, but it's also big in time. The age of the universe appears to be 13.7 billion years old. Like huge space scales, a span of 14 billion years is hard to imagine for a person who will have a much shorter lifespan than that. To better understand very long time scales, we can &quot;compress&quot; long periods of time like the age of the universe into shorter periods such as a human lifetime.

A typical person will live around 80 years. That means that the Earth will go around the Sun eighty times over the course of an average lifetime. The human life time scale and the time scale of human history are far smaller than the time scale of changes in the universe. Astronomers have learned about how the universe as a whole came to be the way it is by studying only an instant of its existence. To get a clearer picture of how the cosmological time scales fit together, let's consider an imaginary astronomer whose life is &quot;stretched out&quot; to fill the entire history of the universe.

If a human lifetime were vastly longer than it is, the orbit of the Earth around the Sun might be too fast to be a useful way to measure age. Instead, it might be more practical measure time from something slower. The Sun takes 230 million years to complete an orbit around the Milky Way Galaxy. That means that a &quot;Milky Way year&quot; will be 230 million times longer than an ordinary year.

Let's suppose our old astronomer has a lifespan of 80 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; instead of 80 normal years. That way, the astronomer will live long enough to see events that happen on cosmological time scales rather than human time scales. The astronomer's life happens in extreme slow motion. His growth and his actions are slowed by a factor of 230 million. At this rate, it takes four normal months for the astronomer just to ''blink''.

[[Image:Milky Way Year.png|thumb|360px|left|A year is defined to be the time it takes for the Earth to make a complete orbit around the Sun. We will define a new measure of time inspired by the year, which we'll call the &quot;Milky Way year.&quot; The &quot;Milky Way year&quot; is the time it takes for the Sun to make a complete orbit around the Milky Way, 230 million times longer than an ordinary year. If we imagine stretching a human lifetime 230 million times, a person born at the big bang would live long enough to see the death of the Sun.]]

Astronomers have theorized that the universe was very small, hot, and dense when it began. Since then, it has expanded and cooled. At first, the universe contained almost entirely hydrogen and helium gas. The universe was very uniform, with no galaxies, stars or planets. We'll place our protagonist's birth at the time of the big bang. 

Our astronomer was much too young to remember the early development of the universe after the big bang. By the time the astronomer was only two days old, atoms had formed in the universe and the universe had cooled enough for structure to begin forming in the gas that uniformly filled all of space. Remember, the imaginary long-lived astronomer measures time much more slowly &amp;mdash; what the astronomer sees as two days amount to a million years of time on a normal clock. While a million years seems like an extremely long time, that's only a tiny part of the history of the universe.

Our astronomer's earliest memories of childhood will include the first formation of stars and galaxies, which began to occur when the astronomer was around five &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old. Galaxies would continue forming and developing well into the astronomer's teenage years, when the universe was billions of years old. Today, galaxies continue to evolve and change.

There are two schools of thought on how the Universe formed: &quot;top down&quot; and &quot;bottom up&quot;. Top down theorists think that large clusters formed after the Big Bang, which later broke down into stars and galaxies. &quot;Bottom up&quot; theorists instead pose the theory that matter was originally dispersed fairly evenly by the Big Bang, later accumulating into stars and galaxies. Recent data from Hubble Deep Field photographs appear to support &quot;bottom up&quot; theories. The photos show young galaxies from up to 11 billion light-years away. These young, small galaxies, from early in the universe's history, support the theory that large structures formed out of smaller ones. The galaxies appear as faint blue blobs with vague spiral structures, 2000 to 3000 light-years across. 

An important necessity for the appearance of life is heavy elements. Since only hydrogen and Helium gas were formed during the big bang, everything heavier than that had to be made in stars later. These other elements &amp;mdash; all of the elements on the periodic table &amp;mdash; were made in stars.

Stars use light elements like Hydrogen and Helium as their fuel. Like nuclear bombs, they use the power of the atom for energy. Stars are unlike nuclear bombs, however, in that most nuclear bombs get their energy from heavy atoms like Plutonium and Uranium. In a nuclear bomb, the energy comes from converting heavy elements into lighter elements. This process is called '''fission'''. In a star, the energy comes from converting the light elements into heavier elements. This process is called '''fusion'''. All of the material in the universe heavier than Hydrogen and Helium were made by fusion in a star.

An ordinary star can make many of the elements, especially the most important ones for life. It can't make all of the elements, though; it can't make anything heavier than Iron. The heavier elements were made in '''supernovae'''. A supernova occurs when a massive star reaches the end of its life. Supernovae are extremely bright and extremely hot. This is where the heaviest elements in the universe are made. 

All of the material needed to make rocky planets was made in stars, and some of it was made in supernovae. This means that planets couldn't exist until there had been enough time for a star to completely go through its life cycle and become a supernova. The material would then be ejected back into space, and would form a new star, possibly with planets. It also means that everything in the world, including you, came from a star. As the astronomer Carl Sagan said, &quot;We are star stuff.&quot;

[[Image:Protoplanetary disk.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This illustration shows how the Solar System might have appeared while it was forming. The disk around the Sun contains gas and dust which will eventually be swept up by the gravity of the planets. Although the newborn Solar System resembles a galaxy, it is much, much smaller.]]

The Sun and the Earth formed about four and a half billion years ago, when our long-lived astronomer was 37 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old. A solar system forms relatively quickly, and ours probably took only about 100 million years. The Sun and the planets formed from a cloud of sparse gas in the Milky Way, which condensed down and coalesced. After this happened, the Earth was very hot. It was a completely molten ball of rock, and had melted so thoroughly that its consistency was similar to water. Certainly, no life could  have existed on the very young Earth.

Soon, however, the conditions on Earth became suitable for life. For our carbon-based type of life to develop, a planet needs to have
# organic matter (the material from which DNA is made),
# liquid water,
# a source of energy, and
# appropriate temperatures.
Earth had all of these fairly early in its history. Scientists aren't sure when life first appeared on Earth, but some evidence dates the earliest life at three and a half billion years ago, when our astronomer was 47 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old.

Evidence suggests that life appeared almost immediately once the necessary conditions were satisfied on the young Earth, but the first inhabitants of the new planet showed no strong predisposition for evolution to more advanced life forms. More than two billion years passed before primitive, single celled microbial organisms advanced to become multicellular life. Once it did, however, advanced life took rapid hold. This period of rapid development in the complexity of life is called the '''Cambrian Explosion'''.

The Cambrian Explosion occurred when our astronomer was 56 &quot;Milky Way years&quot; old. Ten years had passed on our slowed cosmological clock. This period of history was, in some sense, the most profound step in the development of intelligence on Earth.

[[Image:Allosaurus_skeleton_2.jpg|thumb|233px|left|The extinction of the dinosaurs was very recent by cosmological standards.]]

Since the Cambrian Explosion, things have become very interesting on Earth. The astronomer was barely a year older by the time the primitive multicellular creatures had developed to become the dinosaurs, which were unimaginably more complex and advanced by comparison. We have now come into recent times, as the appearance of the dinosaurs occurred only twelve months before this instant in our astronomer's life.

We can see now that we must occupy a tiny, tiny part of the cosmic timeline. By what standard could the time of the dinosaurs ''possibly'' be considered recent? By a cosmological standard. The dinosaurs had a short stay on Earth. They disappeared 65 million years ago, or four months ago by the astronomer's clock. This gave mammals the chance to rise to dominance.

The first humans appeared on Earth only ''eight hours'' ago by our astronomer's clock. Civilization accounts for only a small fraction of this time. The first system of writing, and the first evidence of civilization, dates to only 6000 years ago, or fifteen minutes ago by our astronomer's clock. In the lifetime of the universe, all of culture and all of written history could fit into a coffee break!

Periods more similar to the human life span become even smaller in our comparison with the cosmic timescale. It was only very recently that people first endeavored to learn about the world using science in the way we understand it today. These first scientists, who considered observation and experimentation to give the last word on the nature of the universe, lived only about four hundred years ago, or one minute ago on our cosmic clock.

As we come progressively closer to the present, our lives seem progressively more ephemeral and fleeting. How long will our society, our culture, and our ideas endure in the long run? Only time will tell. At the current rate, it does not appear to be long before something must happen to stop the downgrade of society.

We can say little about what might happen on Earth in the next thousand years, let alone the next million years or the next billion years. Meanwhile, the Milky Way will continue on its normal course, a course which happens to be headed straight for a collision with the nearest neighboring galaxy in about 12 &quot;Milky Way years.&quot; This is unlikely to be the disaster for Earth it might appear to be &amp;mdash; a collision between any stars during a galactic merger is actually extremely improbable. The Solar System will simply take up residence in the new galaxy created in the aftermath of the collision.

Five billion years from now, the Sun will have used up its fuel and will die. At this point, about 20 billion years after the big bang, the long-lived astronomer will be 80 years old. The Earth will no longer be able to support life after the Sun dies, and the Solar System will become rather desolate. The universe as a whole will continue long after the death of both the Sun and our astronomer, but it too will slowly die, eventually becoming cold and empty as it continues to expand.

Looking back over the scales of the universe and seeing humanity's role, unimaginably small in both space and time, one might wonder whether science has painted a bleak, depressing, and hopeless picture for humanity. Some would say so, while others find comfort in the majesty and grandeur of the universe, and the possibilities that the future might bring. For now, the future of humanity in this universe, as chaotic and vast as it is, remains uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tennis is a game played between two single players, in the singles game, or two teams of two players each, in the doubles game. To play, the players use a strung racquet to hit the tennis ball and send it over the net into the opponent's court. The purpose of the game is to either send the ball into the opponent's court in such a way that the opponent cannot return it fairly into your own court. This would include not being able to return it at all, causing the opponent to return it low and into the net, or returning it outside of the boundaries of your own court. The game is played all over the world, professionally and by amateurs. The simplicity of the game makes it possible for anyone who can hold a racquet, including those in wheelchairs and the very old and very young, to participate.

Remember, in order to have a nice clean house or life, you must always organize and prevent certain things from happening. as my parents were very clean, here is some general advice for staying clean. Also you have to diagnose what kind of cleaning problem you have.

Warnings: if you have any allergies to any cleaning products, do not use them.

Take off your shoes so the carpets stay clean,
Use newspaper when eating on the table,easy to clean up.
Keep all cleaning supplies in a safe place
Replace crayons with non-toxic, washable markers
Do not buy any soda with artificial colorizers (such as Sunny Delight, etc.)

'''5.1 The Main Menu Figure 33. The main menu bar.'''

The Main Menu consists of logically organized functions that are generally global in nature throughout Wings3D, that is they apply to vertices, edges, faces and objects or general environmental settings such as user preferences and camera manipulation. The exception to this general rule is the Objects Menu, which contains functions relevant to objects only. The Main Menu items include File, Edit, View, Select, Tools, Objects, and Help. Each of these will be covered in this section individually. 5.1.1 The File Menu File Menu – General The File Menu contains file handling options, most of which are common to almost all applications, but some warrant a little discussion. Each option is described in its own section below. File | New (Ctrl-N) Default when starting the program, giving you a clear workspace to work in. When invoked later Wings will ask if you want to save your changes with the standard Yes, No, Cancel options. If you answer No Wings3D will delete all objects in a current workspace. File | Open (Ctrl-O) Will load a previously saved .wings model into the workspace. When invoked, Wings will ask if you want to save your changes with the standard Yes, No, Cancel options. If you answer No Wings3D will present you with a File Open dialog box. You can then navigate to your file and load it by typing in the name or double clicking on it from the list of available models. If you cancel at this point, 46 DRAFT 1.6

Wings will keep what was in your workspace, otherwise all objects in your workspace will


'''File''' | '''Merge...''' (Ctrl-L) Adds the contents of another .wings file to your current scene. When invoked, the Windows file open dialog appears. By default, it is set to add a .wings file, but the option all files is available. The &quot;All Files&quot; option will only load a native Wings file such as one with the wrong extension (or no extension). Therefore, trying to bring in anything but a wings file returns the error message: 'Read failed: no such file or directory&quot; as this command is for loading native Wings files only. One handy use for the File | Merge command is to load up a previously saved set of lights. If you create a lighting environment you are particularly fond of delete all the non-light objects from the scene and do a Save As. Call it something like lights.wings. Then after doing a file new you can merge the lights into your current scene. Note that File|Import implicitly always merges if you want to add an non-native format model to your scene.

'''File''' | '''Save''' (Ctrl-S) Saves the current workspace as a .wings file. If the model is new, a Save File dialog box will come up allowing you to specify the path and file name to be saved. If it is a previously existing file, it will save to that file, permanently incorporating any changes you have made since loading it.

'''File''' | '''Save As...''' (Ctrl-Shift-S)

Allows you to save the current workspace as a .wings file under a new file name. A Save As File dialog box will come up allowing you to specify the path and file name to be saved. This can save hours of labor, being particularly useful whenever you either come to a point where undoing will become a problem if further work does not pan out, or at a point that you want to come back to, for expanding in a different direction altogether.

'''File''' | '''Save Selected...'''

Allows you to save the currently selected object or objects in the workspace as a .wings file under a new file name. A Save

be deleted before the requested file is opened. dialog box will come up allowing you to specify the path and file name to be saved.

'''File''' | '''Revert'''

Clears all work done since last save and restores last saved. It does not clear the Undo history. The idea is that you should be able to undo a Revert if did it by mistake. Thus there is no question asking for confirmation.

'''File''' | '''Import'''

Nendo® (.ndo)

3D Studio (.3ds) [import scale] [export scale] [ok] [cancel]

Adobe® Illustrator (.ai)

Wavefront® (.obj) [import scale] [export scale] [ok] [cancel]

Import files of selected format in current project. Wings supports the importation of Nendo® (.ndo), 3DS Max® (.3ds) Adobe® Illustrator (.ai) and Wavefront® (.obj) format files. Import has no limits on file size other than system resources. Import implicitly always merges therefore you can add nonnative format models to your scene without loosing your current work.

The 3DS Max® and Wavefront® import commands both have option boxes on the right of the menu item. The option boxes allow you to specify an Import Scale. This is useful since many models will be very small or absolutely huge when imported into Wings. By experimentation you can find the right scaling factor and then apply it each time you import models from another program. Simply apply the inverse scale upon export if you wish to take the model back to the originating program.

The Nendo® import works much better than the others because it is a one-to-one translation. This is because both Nendo® and Wings use winged-edge data structures. Import of other formats is trickier. The other formats contains triangle or polygon meshes. To import them, Wings must combine the polygons into one or more closed objects that can be represented by the winged-edge

==Section 5.1==
The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL structure. Combining gets tricky if the mesh contains defects, and many meshes do since the defects usually are not a problem in other modelers or renderers.

Also, if you import a model that has a texture associated with it you may get a Wings message box when attempting to modify it, telling you that the operation can not be performed on a textured model. This is because texture support in Wings is under development. In a future release of Wings, the question will be if you want to convert the texture to colors (just as in Nendo®). But currently, the workaround is to use the Strip Texture command in the Body pop-up menu. Or you can save the model as a Wings file and reload it.

One thing new users may find helpful is the knowledge that Wings and Nendo® work well in tandem since Wings supports both the import and export of .ndo files. So you can model in Wings, take the model into Nendo® to do color assignments, and save the model with colors. Then you can use Wings File | Import (.ndo) and bring the model in with all the color assignments intact. Some Wings operations still cannot work with color assignments but you can smooth the model to a greater degree than is possible in Nendo® for a smoother looking model while still retaining the colors.

Currently, Wings only import textures from the OBJ format, not 3DS. Acceptable file formats for textures are 24 bit BMP, TGA®, and TIFF.

FILE | EXPORT

Nendo® (.ndo) 3D Studio (.3ds) Hash Model (.mdl) Wavefront (.obj) VRML 2.0 (.wrl) YafRay (.xml)) Optional


Saves all objects in workspace in Nendo® (.ndo), 3D Studio (3ds), Animation Master (.mdl), Wavefront (.obj), or VRML 2.0 (.wrl) format. When YafRay rendering software is installed this option will appear. There are option boxes for .3ds, .and obj, exporters

which bring up sub-menus for specifying parameters. The option box for .3ds allows you to enter an export scale. The option box for .obj allows this and a check box to create one group per material. YafRay uses the options setup under the File &gt; Render &gt; Yafray panel.

Quick Tip: Rendering with YafRay

On the PC side you can send a file to render in YafRay right from wings, but on the mac side you are limited to exporting the model and rendering from the command line. See section 7.1 YafRay.

FILE | EXPORT SELECTED

Saves selected elements in one of the export formats (see FILE | EXPORT). Note that the selection can be of any type (e.g. face selection).

FILE | RENDER

Renders the workspace using either the default OpenGL® render routine or YafRay if you have installed it correctly. Support for other rendering engines may be added in the future. The Option Button on the right will bring up a sub-menu for several parameters you can set. Before you can send the file to render in YafRay make sure you have added at least one light or you won’t see anything. The image is rendered from the point of view of the camera

FILE | HISTORY

If you have opened files previously you will see their filenames listed below File | Export. Clicking one will open that file (provided it is still in the same location where you had it at the time). The history list is currently limited to 4 files.

FILE | EXIT (Ctrl-Q) Exits Wings3D. If changes have been made since your last save Wings will ask you if you want to save them before shutting down.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus 5.1.3 The View Menu Figure 40: The View Menu. VIEW MENU – GENERAL

The View Menu contains functions that set and control how you view your work; i.e.

camera and work environment settings.

VIEW | GROUND PLANE

Toggles the ground plane visibility on/off. Each grid cell of the ground plane represents one &quot;unit&quot; in Wings. A unit can be whatever you want it to be.

VIEW | AXES

Toggles axes visibility on/off.

VIEW | WORKMODE (Tab) Toggles the display between work mode and smoothed mode.


VIEW | SMOOTH PREVIEW (Shift- Tab)

Sets the view mode to shaded and performs one level of smoothing on a temporary basis so that you can see what your model will look like after smoothing. You cannot model in this mode.

VIEW | WIREFRAME

Sets the display mode to wireframe. If you want to extrude a face into the model, set your model to wireframe mode first and you will be able to see how far into the model you are going.

VIEW | SHADE

Sets the display mode to solid flat shading. Toggles between smooth shaded view and solid view on your model. In smooth shaded view the materials being used become visible. This is sometimes referred to as a Wings render.

VIEW | TOGGLE WIREFRAMED/SHADED (W) Toggles between wireframe and shaded

views of the model. This is a handy toggle to use in conjunction with the Tab key. Tab will show you a temporarily smooth-shaded version of your model which you can then overlay with the wireframe by hitting the W key. This wire on smoothed view can be helpful to see how edges affect the overall form of the subject while modeling.

DRAFT 1.6 55

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL VIEW | SHOW SAVED BB

Shows/hides the bounding box set in the Tools Menu. If set on, a dashed wireframe outline shows the extent of the box. Wings can save a single vertex or single edge as a bounding box. Bounding Boxes can be very useful for proportionally scaling and moving a large imported object to a desired volume and position, and can also be used as reference points with vector, magnet, and “snap-to” operations.

VIEW | SHOW EDGES

In flat shaded mode, toggles the edges on/off. This can be useful for very large models, as some otherwise fast graphics cards display edges slowly.

VIEW | SHOW NORMALS

A toggle that shows/hides the normals of every face, edge or vertex (depending on which selection mode you are in) of the model, as a short thick blue line. Handy for planning how things will be moved, as a visual aid if rotating faces around an edge, and to see the normals on an imported model which may have some or all of the normals inverted.

VIEW | SHOW WIREFRAME BACKFACES

Lets you see the wireframe from both front and back in wireframe mode. This can be very useful when trying to position edges to match up on the inside and outside of a wall, for example, prior to using Bridge to cut in a window.


VIEW | RESET VIEW (R) Resets the camera to default location and zoom. Great if you get lost.


VIEW | AIM (A) Points camera directly at selected objects, faces, edges or vertices. Then when you pan and zoom in on the selected the item, it will stay centered in the work space. If there is no selection, the aim point will be reset to the origin (0, 0, 0). This is very handy when doing detailed work and for doing high aspect ratio stuff, such as a giraffe. When working on the head, select a face on the head and Aim. Then all camera movement will be centered on the head. Then when working on the feet select a face there and Aim there, and the point of focus will be on the foot.

VIEW | FRAME (Shift+A) View | Frame works similarly to Aim except that it adjusts the distance to the selection so that the selection will be visible in the Wings window. If there is no selection, the distance will be chosen so that all objects will be visible.

VIEW | ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW (O) Toggles orthographic/perspective views on/off. Orthographic views are the same as those traditionally used for engineering or technical drawing purposes – i.e. front, side and plan views. Since there is essentially no single point of view (as in perspective) all lines and faces are seen in their true lengths and shapes - provided they lie on a plane that is at right angles to the viewing direction. This can offer an advantage when moving or editing geometry that, for example 'bulges out' towards the viewer. The use of Orthographic View is well married with the use of Move | Free, allowing you to freely move selected items while automatically constraining such movement to only two directions at a time.

VIEW | SCENE LIGHTS

Turns on any lights you may have added to the scene via the Lights primitive.

VIEW | ONE/TWO LIGHTS

Toggles one or two standard lights on in the scene. To avoid confusion consider this menu item as a request. That is, if the menu reads One Light, then two lights are currently on, and vice versa. Note that Scene lights negate the One Light/Two Light option.

VIEW | SHOW COLORS

Vertex colors can be imported on pre-existing models (such as from Nendo®). To see the vertex colors use this option.

56 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus VIEW | SHOW MATERIALS

Materials can be created and assigned in Wings per face with the Face | Set Material command. They can also be present on models you have imported. To show materials use this option.

VIEW | SHOW TEXTURES

Models with pre-existing textures can be imported into Wings. The textures are retained after import and can be seen via this option.

VIEW | VIEW ALONG (X, Y, Z, Shift-X, Shift-Y, Shift-Z)

+X X

+Y Y

+Z Z

-X Shift+X

-Y Shift+Y

-Z Shift+Z 

Sets the camera to view along the selected axis. It is recommended that you look at your model from various angles as you go, to get a good feel for how it is developing. Using the X, Y, Z (etc.) hot keys is a very quick and easy way to do this. It is also very handy to view along a major axis while scaling, as you can scale two vertices along a cross axis to spread them apart or move them towards each other. Useful in conjunction with orthographic mode for certain tasks where precise movement / alignment is required.

VIEW | ALIGN TO SELECTION

Turns the camera to point in same direction as selected elements. Wings then orientates the model such that you are viewing along the selected element's normal. This can be very useful if a single (flat) face is selected and Align to Selection is used. The face is then seen in its true shape, since the viewer is looking at it from a right angle. Selecting geometry forming that face (edges or vertices) and using Move -&gt; Free (for example) allows movement on the same plane as the face. This keeps the face flat, which is required for clean geometry.

This is also useful in situations where you want to maintain a reference face, so that other geometry not linked to that reference

face can easily be moved on planes parallel to the reference face. To accomplish further editing of this 'external' geometry, select the reference face, use Align To Selection, and the model re-aligns to the correct position. For example, Align To Selection can be used on a flat face, then an edge can be Cut by 2 to create a new vertex. It is then possible to 'slide' the new vertex along the edge to a new position. The edge can either be kept straight via vector moves (discussed later) or 'distorted' by moving the vertex accordingly to form a new apex. In either case, by first using Align To Selection, the face will remain flat. Similar operations can be preformed via other methods as well, such as the Slide plug-in which will be discussed later.

VIEW | AUTO ROTATE (U) This will fly your camera around the model, so that it appears to rotate. The angle and speed of rotation can be set via the Edit | Preferences menu. Rotating gives you a good overall view of the model, and can be used in conjunction with screen capture software to create an AVI to show off your model. Left click to stop the rotation. You can change the aspect of the camera with the middle mouse button during rotation and the rotation will continue.

Quick Tip: View Orthographic in Wireframe Mode.

Sometimes it is not all that obvious what the difference between Orthographic and Perspective views do for you. To see this graphically, create a cube and hit the X key to look at it straight on. Then hit the O key a couple of times. It does not seem to do much other than change sizes, right? Now hit the W key to put the cube into Wireframe Mode and repeat the exercise. You can definitely see the effects of perspective now, even when looking dead on. Now use the marquee select function (drag a box) to select the top left vertex of the cube while still in perspective view. You get one vertex selected. Clear the selection and go into Orthographic View. Select the top left vertex via marquee drag. Rotate the camera a little and you will see that you got both the front and back vertices because you were in Orthographic view. This can be very useful

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus 5.1.4 The Select Menu Figure 41: The Select Menu. SELECT MENU – GENERAL

The Select Menu is one of the most important items in Wings3D as it contains many operations that lead to fast and efficient modeling. By being able to quickly select the elements you need to work with, and even combine (or subtract) that selection with another selection set you can quickly achieve the results you desire.

SELECT | DESELECT (Space) Deselect all selected items.

SELECT | MORE (+) Grows the selection set to include all the adjacent items (vertices, edges, or faces) of

the same type on a given object. For example, if a face is selected all adjacent faces will become selected as well. If there are multiple objects in a scene, it will not cause more objects to be selected, however, each object with a selection set active will have it's selection set grow.

SELECT | LESS (-) Shrinks the selection set in reverse order of it's growth. If working with an initial selection set, this will cause nothing to be selected. As with More, selection sets on multiple objects can be manipulated at the same time.

SELECT | REGION (Shift-L) Select | Region works in conjunction with a properly selected closed edge loop. Given a properly selected edge loop, Select | Region will then select all the faces contained by that loop. If a single edge is selected, or if the loop is not closed, then all the faces become selected. Select|Region will also handle multiple loops. For instance, you can select both hands or both legs. Select|Region and Select|Edge Loop are the inverse of each other.

SELECT | EDGE LOOP (L) Selects edges that flow in a line until a pole is encountered. A pole is a non-4way intersection (i.e. it has 3 edges or 5 or more edges joining at a single vertex).

SELECT | EDGE RING (G) Selects a set of edges that run between two edge loops. These cross edges are sometimes referred to as &quot;struts&quot;. If you think of the lines of latitude on a globe as edge loops, then the lines of longitude between any two parallels would constitute an Edge Ring. In Wings, simply select one such &quot;strut&quot; then Select | Edge Ring, and the entire set of edges will become selected, until the model is completely encircled, or until a pole is encountered. This can result in big time savings when modeling.

This will &quot;step&quot; down the model from one closed edge loop to the next, deselecting the originally selected loop in favor of the next one it encounters. Repeated use of F3 continues on down the model until it no longer finds another loop to select, then it reverses order and comes back up the model. This is very powerful and when used in conjunction with other functions (such as Scale, Move, Rotate, etc.) and can greatly increase the efficiency of your modeling work flow.

SELECT | NEXT EDGE LOOP (F4) This will &quot;step&quot; up the model from one closed edge loop to the next, deselecting the originally selected loop in favor of the next one it encounters. Works just like F3, except it goes in the opposite direction, so that you can use the two function keys to toggle back and forth between two edge loops, or change directions at will.

SELECT | SIMILAR (I) Selects items similar to the currently selected item. Select | Similar is not that useful for organic modeling. Its main strength is in what Jakob Cederlund calls geometric art (i.e. objects that are highly symmetrical). It is good for selecting faces widely apart. The rules for similarity are as follows.

Faces - Same number of edges. Sum of edge lengths approximately equal. Sum of angles between each pair of edges approximately equal.

Edges -Approximate length of edge equal. Angle and length of the nearest four edges approximately equal.

Vertices - Angle and length of edges going out from the vertex approximately equal. This may be the least useful of the bunch, as it seldom finds many hits.

Note that Less does not deselect items selected via Similar; i.e. it does not revert to the original selection set.

SELECT | ADJACENT

VERTICES – selects vertices adjacent to the currently selected vertex/vertices.

EDGES – selects edges adjacent to the currently selected edge(s).

FACES – selects faces adjacent to the currently selected face(s). If you press the same key several times, the selection will grow each time. In vertex selection mode, pressing the &quot;v&quot; will grow the selection in exactly the same way as does SELECT | MORE. However, in edge selection mode, pressing &quot;e&quot; will grow the selection by selecting the four edges nearest each edge. SELECT | MORE, on the other hand, will select all edges that share a vertex with a selected edge. To see the difference, select one edge on an icosahedron or a grid and try both commands. In face selection mode, all faces that share an edge with a selected face will become selected. SELECT | MORE, on the other hand, will select all faces that share a vertex with a selected face. Try it out on a grid to understand the difference.

Note that if there is no current selection set the keys v, e, f (and b) simply change selection mode to vertex, edge, face and body, respectively.

Id

Select | By offers a wide variety of methodology to choose selection sets. These selections can be stored (as discussed later) and then used in conjunction with other selection sets via Union, Subtract, and Intersection (also discussed later).

Hard Edges selects all Hard Edges in the selected object.

Vertices with (2, 3, 4, and 5) selects faces that have the given number of vertices as designated by the number. This is helpful in trying to maintain quads.

Select | By | Faces With | 5 Or More has a hot key, F5, so that you can quickly find any non quad or tri sided polygons. Such polygons can cause problems in some 3D modeling and rendering packages and should therefore be resolved.

Material is used to select faces by their assigned materials. Any user-defined material will automatically be added to the Material sub-menu and become available for selection.

Random (10 – 90%) selects a random subset of the current selection type (vertices, edges, faces or objects) for manipulation.

Short Edges selects any edges that are too short, as determined by the option box to the right of the command. Short edges are often responsible for display anomalies and difficulties in continued modeling. Often these edges will be so short and located such that you can not see them, even after selecting them. You can Extrude them to find them, or simply Collapse them to eliminate them.

Id. You can also select any item (vertex, edge, or face) by its ID number, which can be gleaned from the Wings status bar when the item is selected. So, if you record an ID number you know you want to come back to, you can later Select it then Aim at it to continue working in that area.

SELECT | LIGHTS

Will select all the lights in your scene.

SELECT | ALL [Vertices, Edges, Faces, Objects] (Ctrl+A) Selects all the vertices, edges, faces, or


objects, dependent on the current selection mode. For objects, it selects all within the scene that have not been hidden or locked (via Object | [object name] | Hide or Lock (to be discussed later)).

SELECT | INVERSE (Ctrl-Shift-I) Inverts the selected set. That which was selected becomes unselected and vice versa.

SELECT | STORE SELECTION

Stores a selection set so that it can be used in conjunction with other selection sets.

SELECT | RECALL SELECTION

Recalls a selection set so that it can be used in conjunction with other selection sets.

DRAFT 1.6 61

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL SELECT | EXCHANGE SELECTION

Exchanges a selection set so that it can be used in conjunction with other selection sets. The current selection set becomes the stored selection set while the stored selection set becomes the active one.

SELECT | UNION WITH STORED

Creates a new selection set by combining the current selection set with one that has been stored.

SELECT | SUBTRACT WITH STORED

Creates a new selection set by subtracting the stored selection set from the current selection set. That is, all items in common

between the two sets are deselected from the current selection set.

SELECT | INTERSECTION WITH STORED

Creates a new selection set intersecting the current and stored selection sets. That is, only those items that are common to both sets remain selected. This can be used very effectively to add noise to an organic model. You can store all the vertices on a tree trunk, for example, then Select | By | Random | 30% which will select vertices on trunk, branches and leaves. Then do a Intersection With Stored and only random vertices on the trunk will remain selected which you can then Move | Normal to make knobs.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus 5.1.5 The Tools Menu Figure 42: The Tools Menu. Tools Menu – General

The tools menu contains some functions that will interact with other Wings commands.

TOOLS | ALIGN

All 

X Y Z Radial X (YZ) Radial Y (XZ) Radial Z (XY)


Aligns all selected objects based on the bounding box of the selection for each element. This can be useful to line things up once they have gotten off center. For example by using a series of Aligns, you could get wheels on a model that have become misaligned back into proper positions relative to each other. It does not align vertices, edges or faces to an axis on the same model.

TOOLS | CENTER

All 

X Y Z Radial X (YZ) Radial Y (XZ) Radial Z (XY)


Centers objects in the workspace based on the bounding box of all selected items. If you work on a large model that has sort of &quot;grown&quot; off in one direction, you can quickly center it in the workspace again. Also, if you have multiple objects in a complex model, and you've lost track of one of them, you can select it (via the Objects Menu – to be discussed latter) and then Center to find it again.

TOOLS | SAVE BOUNDING BOX

Saves the bonding box of selected items, from one or more objects, for later use. Use Save Bounding Box without any selection to clear the bounding box. An outline of the current bounding box is displayed if so chosen in the users' preferences.

TOOLS | SCALE TO SAVED BB

All 

X

Y

Z

Radial X (YZ)

Radial Y (XZ)

Radial Z (XY) Scales the selected object(s) to the bounding box that has been previously saved. This command will scale each selected object, along one, two, or three axes. The amount to scale could be different along each axis, meaning that this command can distort the proportions of the objects (i.e. a cube might no longer remain a cube). The scale factor for each axis is computed by comparing the saved bounding box with the bounding box for

DRAFT 1.6 63

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL the selection. To avoid distorting the objects, use Scale to Saved BB Proportionally.

TOOLS | SAVE TO SAVED BB PROPORTIONALLY

All 

X

Y

Z

Radial X (YZ)

Radial Y (XZ)

Radial Z (XY) Similar to Scale to Saved Bounding Box, but the idea with this one is that it should preserve the proportions of the selected objects, i.e. all axes will be scaled the same amount. This command will keep the scaled objects inside the saved bounding box.

TOOLS | MOVE TO SAVED BB

All 

X

Y

Z Will move the selected object(s) based on the center of their aggregate bounding box to the center of the saved bounding box.

TOOLS | SET DEFAULT AXIS

Sets the default axis for vertex commands.

TOOLS | VIRTUAL MIRROR

The Virtual Mirror tool puts you into a special modeling mode for creating perfectly symmetrical models. To use it select a face to mirror around and then select Virtual Mirror. The model will be mirrored from the selected face so that as you make changes on either side of the model they will be reflected on the other side of the model. This has the potential for cutting your modeling time in half and can be used to do some things that are otherwise sometimes difficult to achieve, such as rotating two surfaces in opposite directions. Note that if you want your model to stay centered in the workspace it is best to loop cut the model down the middle, delete half the model,

select the resulting face, and then start Virtual Mirror.

Create – Creates the virtual half of the model which mirrors the real half. Note that you can work with either the virtual or real half and actions will be reflected on the counterpart.

Break – Destroys the virtual mirror so that only the real half of the model remains.

Freeze – Makes the virtual half of the model into real geometry, thus creating a perfectly symmetrical full model.

TOOLS | TWEAK

Tweak is a special modeling mode that allows you to drag vertices freely for fine movements. It is a very useful and powerful tool that warrants getting used to. Most of the controls are clearly explained on the status bar at the bottom of the workspace, as outlined here:

(L) – Left mouse button; Drag vertices freely (R) – Right mouse button; Exit tweak mode (M) – Middle mouse button; Tumble (Shift-M) – Shift plus the middle mouse button; Track (Ctrl-Shift-M) – Control plus Shift plus the Middle mouse button; Dolly

(1) – Turns the magnets on or off. You can use Tweak with standard moves, or with magnetic moves. To turn on the magnets press the 1 (the number 1) key. Doing so will cause the status bar to change. While in magnet mode L will drag and R will exit Tweak mode. The + key will increase the fall-off zone while the – (minus) key will decrease the fall-off zone. The 2, 3, and 4 keys will change the type of magnet in use. Pressing the 1 key will turn the magnets off again.

These controls effectively turn Tweak into an interactive magnet with the area of influence for the magnet defined by the fall-off zone. Tweak was originally a plug-in designed by Howard Trickey and has since been incorporated into the Wings3D core.

64 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus Quick Tip: Additional Tools

Note that some very useful tools for Wings will appear in the Tools Menu if you have installed the available plug-ins. These include Draw Loop, Locked, Slide, and Tweak_s from Clacos. They are available at:

http://members.lycos.co.uk/clacos/ 

I highly recommend them. Apologies to any other tool makers if I'm missing any.

Quick Tip: Bounding Boxes

Don't overlook the usefulness of bounding boxes. You can use them to place an object at any given location, such as putting a hat on a hat rack. To do so select a vertex on the hook of the hat rack and do a Save Bounding Box. Then select a vertex on the inside of the hat and do a Move To Saved BB. The hat will snap right into place.

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.1.6 The Objects Menu Figure 43: The Object Menu. Objects Menu – General

The Objects Menu presents you with options limited specifically to whole objects.

OBJECTS | SHOW AND UNLOCK ALL

Pretty self explanatory. It shows all objects in the workspace, and if any of them were locked, unlocks them, making all objects eligible for further manipulation.

OBJECTS | HIDE SELECTED

Hides any object or multiple objects that are currently selected. This is handy to hide a large, easily selected object, so as to be able to get to and manipulated a smaller object that his mostly or completely obscured by the larger object. Once hidden, the objects are locked and therefore protected from any changes.

OBJECTS | HIDE UNSELECTED

Hides any object that is not currently selected. Hidden objects are automatically locked and protected from any geometry/orientation changes.

OBJECTS | LOCK UNSELECTED

Locks unselected objects, but leaves them visible in the workspace as reference objects.

OBJECTS | {OBJECT LIST} (object1 would be cube1 for the example shown above.) [] object1

Select

Hide

Hide Others

Lock

Rename [] object2

Select

Hide

Hide Others

Lock

Rename [] object3

Select

Hide

Hide Others

Lock

Rename and so on...

The bottom part of the Objects Menu shows a list of all the current objects in the workspace. They will initially have default names based on how they were created. For example, when a cube primitive is added to the workspace when Wings is first started, it will be named cube1. Note that if you do a File | New, the item numbers are not reinitialized. So if you then added a cube to the new workspace it would be listed as cube2. The open eye icon to the left of the name (represented in this document as [] brackets) will show if it is currently visible and change to a closed eye icon if it is hidden. Each object in the list has a sidebar menu from which you can do many handy things. From this menu an object can be Selected/Deselected, Hidden/Shown (note, if hidden Show is the only option in the side bar menu), Locked/Unlocked, and Renamed.

66 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus Objects retain the name assigned to them upon Save and Export, which is very useful in texture mapping applications later on. Hide Others (the middle option in the menu) does not work on the selected object. Rather, it hides all the rest of them. This is very useful when working in a multi object scene. As mentioned elsewhere, the Object Menu can be used to find objects you've lost track of, or

to recenter around a specific object. To do this simply choose Object | Select and then use Tools | Center | All to find/recenter on the elusive object. Currently this is a single column, non-scrollable list, so if your scene has a lot of objects in it, they may not all be accessible via this menu.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus The key to the Wings3D user interface is the use of context sensitive pop-up menus. These menus are accessed by right clicking in the workspace. There are a total of five context sensitive menus; the Primitives Menu, the Vertex Menu, the Edge Menu, the Face Menu and the Object Menu, not to be confused with the Objects Menu on the Main

Menu). Depending on what is selected, different menus will pop up presenting the user with operations that are applicable to the current situation only. In this way the interface is kept clean and simple, a joy to work with compared to many overly complex user interfaces found in some graphics and modeling packages.

5.2.1 The Primitives Menu Primitives Menu – General

Figure 45: The Primitives pop-up menu. To bring up the Primitives Menu, right click on the empty

workspace, or on a workspace where nothing is selected. You will be presented with a list of
available primitives to add to your workspace. Left click on one of the primitives to add it. It will be added to the center of the scene as an unselected object at it's default size. You may need to turn other objects' visibility off (via the Objects Menu) in order to find the newly added object. The complete list of standard primitives is given below. Notice that some primitives have a little box icon to the right of their name. This is the Options Box for that primitive. If you click on the primitive name you will add a default primitive, whereas, if you click on the options icon you will be presented with some options (number of sections, number of slices, etc.) that you can change.

Tetrahedron – a four sided object; a triangular pyramid. Octrahedron – an eight sided object. Octotoad – A twenty-six sided object, unique to Wings. Designed by Mike (roadtoad), the host of the Wings discussion forum, and added to the Wings primitives as a tribute to the great service this board provided in the further development of Wings3D. Dodecahedron – a solid object with twelve faces. Icosahedron – a solid object with twenty faces. Cube – Plain and simple. What most models start out as. Cylinder – Click on the options button (the little box on the right) for the Sections option. A Windows dialog box will come up showing the number of sections in the cylinder (16 by default). You may change this and then click OK, or click Cancel. If you do not click on the options button, but simply click on the name Cylinder, then a default cylinder will be added (with 16 sides). Cone – Sections (16 by default). Sphere – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default). Torus – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default).

*The '''Auto-Save''' feature can be turned on and set to the number of minutes the user desires between auto-saves and can be found in '''Edit|Preferences|Misc'''.  The default setting is 10 minutes between auto-saves.  Auto-save will only save that has been previously saved.  Auto-save creates a separate file from the one the user saved and overwriting the auto-save file for each iteration.  If Wings is closed during an auto-save session without the user saving changes manually, the next time Wings is asked to opens that file may prompt the query: [[Image:Auto_Save_Open.png|frame|left]]

'''2.4 The Toolbar'''

There are three sets of Icons above the workspace as illustrated here.

The two on the left determine what Display Mode your model is in. They are, from left to right, Wire-shaded on/off, and Perspective on/off. These are used to toggle on and off these features as you work. Perspective off, also called Orthogonal view, is useful for lining an object up to a reference image plane.

The next four icons display what Edit/Selection Mode you are in. They are Vertex, Edge, Face and Body. The red highlighting gives you a quick visual key as to just what elements are affected in each mode and the white outline box indicate which mode you are currently in. In the above illustration we are in Face selection mode. Your Edit Mode will be important when it comes to using any of the modeling tools, since most tools are presented in context sensitive menus within the Workspace. The context of those menus is determined by the current Edit Mode.

The last two are Ground Plane and Reference Axes. These icons are used to quickly toggle on or off these features as needed.

=== Reference ===
To use the commands in the menu, select one or more edges and press RMB.
==== Axes ====
Many commands require that you select an axis from the menu. This axis defines the direction or orientation for the command.

In addition to the three world axes—X, Y and Z—many commands work with edge normals, custom axes, default axes and most recently used axes.

If you specify edge normals as the axis (by selecting '''Normal'''), each group of connected edges uses the average normal of its vertices.

Custom axes can be specified only when advanced menus are enabled. For details about this feature, see [[/The Wings3D Command Reference Guide/Advanced Menus|Advanced Menus]].

A default axis is an axis that you define in advance to use later. To define the default axis, use the '''Tools''' | '''Set Default Axis''' in the main menu. This is done in two stages: first you specify the actual axis, and then the point of origin for that axis. A default axis is stored until you redefine it. To recall the default axis for an edge operation, such as '''Move''', select '''Default Axis''' from the edge operations menu.

The '''Last Axis''' menu item recalls the axis you used during your most recent operation.
==== Move, Rotate and Scale ====
Moving, rotating or scaling are straightforward operations.

To move the selection, specify the axis you want to move it along. For details about axes, see above.

To rotate the selection, specify the pivot axis. If you use custom axes, the pivot point (center of rotation) is set automatically as well.

'''Scale Uniform''' scales the selection in all directions at once. If you right-click the command, the secondary selection specifies the pivot point (scaling center).

'''Scale Axis''' scales the selection along the axis you specify.

'''Scale Radial''' scales sideways around the axis you specify, but not along it. Each vertex in the selection of stays on the plane perpendicular to the specified axis.

The effect of edge rotation and scaling depends on whether you let Wings set the center automatically or specify it with a secondary selection.

By default, each isolated edge and group of connected edges gets its own transformation center. This means, for example, that default scaling of multiple isolated edges is different from scaling their vertices. To see the difference, try scaling an edge ring, then undoing, converting the selection to vertices and scaling the vertices.

==== Slide ====
Slides the selected edges, shifting the border between the edges that they connect.

==== Extrude ====
Creates an edge loop that runs around the selected edges, and moves the selection along the axis you specify, creating a &quot;ridge&quot;. Use the + and - numpad keys to slide the new edges.

==== Cut ====
Splits the selected edges by creating vertices along their length. Click '''Cut''' to select a predefined number of divisions (2, 3, 4, 5 or 10) or specify a custom number. If advanced menus are enabled, you can right-click '''Cut''' to perform a precise split.

==== Connect ====
Creates edges that connect the centers of the selected edges.

==== Bevel ====
Creates a face in place of the selected edges, putting the vertices of the new face on the edges that were connected to the original edge. Drag the mouse to slide the face along those edges.

==== Dissolve ====
Removes the edge or edges and joins the faces that shared them.

==== Collapse ====
Collapses each isolated edge or group of connected edges to a single vertex; switches to vertex selection mode. This command can be used very effectively in conjunction with '''Select | By | Short Edges''' to remove microscopic edges that are interfering with your modeling.

==== Hardness ====
Makes the selected edge or edges '''Hard''' or '''Soft'''. Edge hardness affects two things: the way edges appear in the geometry window and the way the model is smoothed.

'''Soft'''
Edges are smooth by default. Soft edges do not look sharp in preview mode (when you toggle off work mode with Tab). In other words, Gouraud shading is used for soft edges—the normals of connected faces are interpolated smoothly across the edge.
Soft edges are fully affected by the '''Smooth''' operation.

'''Hard'''
Hard edges look sharp in preview mode, as if the faces they connect belong to different models.

The '''Smooth''' operation in Wings produces different results on smooth and hard edges. Smoothing actually happens in two stages: first, the model is subdivided; then the resulting vertices are displaced to make a smooth shape. Edge hardness does not affect the subdivision, but has an effect on the displacement.

Smoothing considers the surrounding geometry when vertices are displaced after subdivision. Hard edges mark boundaries for displacement. After a face is subdivided, displacement calculations ignore geometry beyond a hard edge.

You can use edge hardness as a modeling aid to retain sharp features when you perform smoothing. The effect is most pronounced when you harden edges that form a closed shape.

Note that it doesn't normally make sense to leave hard edges in your finished model. Not all file formats and renderers support hard edges, and they don't look natural when rendered. It's generally better to replace them with small bevels.

&lt;!--THAT'S A WEIRD TIP, I THINK IT SHOULD GO
Quick Tip: Creating round eyes from square holes.
You can create roundish eyes from the results of a Vertex | Bevel by using a combination of Edge | Dissolve and Face | Smooth commands. To demonstrate this, create a cube and connect the left and right edges of one of its sides. Then Connect the three horizontal edges of that side to form a square cross intersection in the middle of the face. Select the vertex of the intersection and Bevel it to form a diamond shape in the middle of the face. With the face selected do a Smooth. Now select the four edges within the smoothed area and Dissolve them. You now have a roundish single face in the middle of the cube from which you can now extrude and scale several times to create an eye.
--&gt;
==== Loop Cut ====
Use this command when the selected edges form one or more closed shapes on the surface of the model. '''Loop Cut''' splits the model into as many objects as these shapes divide the model into.

One obvious use case is to loop cut an asymmetrical model in half and mirror it.

==== Vertex Color ====
Opens a dialog box where you can specify a color for the vertices belonging to the selected edges. The specified color is strongest at the target vertices and fades out towards surrounding vertices.

'''Note:''' A vertex cannot have a color and a UV coordinate at the same time.

==== Intersect ====
Extends the selected edge or edges to the points where they intersect the specified plane. Requires advanced menus.

'''Intersect''' has three modes depending on which mouse button you click the command with:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;LMB—Intersect standard planes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;RMB—Pick plane&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MMB—Pick plane and ref point on plane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
===== Intersect standard planes =====
Extend the edges till they intersect with the plane perpendicular to one of the following axes:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;X&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Y&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Z&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Last Axis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;DefaultAxis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
For details on axes, see above.

Clicking an axis label with LMB specifies that the plane passes through the world origin. Clicking with RMB lets you specify the point that this plane passes through.

===== Pick plane =====
Extend the edges till they intersect with a custom plane. Specify the plane by selecting the components that define it.

===== Pick plane and ref point on plane =====
Extend the edges till they intersect with a custom plane passing through a custom point. First specify the direction of the plane's normal, and then the point that the plane passes through. This mode is a step forward from the RMB mode. It is useful when some components conveniently specify the direction of the normal, but the plane must pass elsewhere.

===Commands===

===Reference===
If one or more faces are selected, right clicking in the workspace will display the Face Operations Menu. This will allow you to perform functions unique to face manipulations.

====Move====

'''Normal''' – moves the selected face or faces along their normal(s).

'''Free''' – Will move the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.&lt;br&gt;
Since all movement takes place on planes that are parallel to the monitor screen, some care is needed to avoid problems when used in a general 'tumbled' view.&lt;br&gt;
This command is especially useful when used in conjunction with View | X,Y or Z, as it allows the user to keep moved faces on the 2D axial planes associated with the relevant viewing direction.&lt;br&gt;
If working with background reference images, Ortho should also be used (with View | XYZ) to eliminate perspective distortion issues.

'''X''' – constrains movement along the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains movement along the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains movement along the z axis.


====Rotate====

Connected faces (Regions) will rotate about their collective center of mass. Non connected, isolated faces will rotate about their individual centers of mass.

'''Free''' – Will rotate the selected faces in the direction of mouse movement.&lt;br&gt;
Note that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the monitor screen. 

'''X''' – constrains rotation about the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains rotation about the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains rotation about the z axis.

====Scale====

'''Uniform''' – Scales the face uniformly in all directions at once.

'''X''' – Scales the face in the x axis.

'''Y''' – Scales the face in the y axis.

'''Z''' – Scales the face in the z axis.

'''Radial X (YZ)''' – Scales the face radially from the x axis; i.e. The distances in y and z are effected while x remains constant.

'''Radial Y (XZ)''' – Scales the face radially from the y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

'''Radial Z (XY)''' – Scales the face radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.

====Extrude====

'''Normal''' – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s). By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils.

'''Free''' – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

'''X''' – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.


====Extrude Region====

'''Normal''' – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s) as a unit. By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils. By using Extrude Region on a group of faces rather than simply using Extrude, you keep the faces joined together into one coherent surface, which is often preferable to having distinct stems &quot;growing&quot; out of the object.

'''Free''' – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

'''X''' – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

'''Y''' – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

'''Z''' – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.


====Extract Region====

'''Normal''' – extract faces and then move the faces along the regions normal.

'''Free''' – extract faces and then move faces freely in all directions.

'''X''' – extract faces and then move them along the X axis.

'''Y''' – extract faces and then move them along the Y axis.

'''Z''' – extract faces and then move them along the Z axis. Extracts a region, or group of faces, from the parent object to create a completely new object. Note that the faces do not have to be contiguous. To create a new object that abuts the original object do an Extract Region and immediately left click without moving the mouse, to lock it in place. You probably will not be able to successfully select the new object due to the underlying original and may have to use the Hide function in the Object enu to hide the parent object so that you can work with the new object. If you have created a new object from non abutting faces and want to work with them as separate objects, then use the Separate command to break them into their component parts.


====Flatten====

'''Normal'''

'''X'''

'''Y'''

'''Z'''

'''Last Axis'''

'''Default Axis'''

Region Sometimes faces can become non-planar as you work with your model, especially if you Move vertices. This can cause problems latter. One way to fix a non-planar face is to Flatten it, i.e., get all of its vertices onto the same plane. Smoothing the model will also create planar faces, but if you do not want to smooth your model, you can Flatten offending faces. It is also good for setting up geometry for further manipulation, so that extrusions go in the direction you want them to go, for example.

If you have a default axis defined (see Tools | Set Default Axis) you can flatten to that axis or you can flatten to the last axis used. Flatten Region will flatten the edge loop, the boundary between selected and non-selected faces, of the selected faces. Note that the vertices on the edge loop become planar, not the faces contained therein.

====Inset====

This creates a new face, of the same shape, inside the selected face. It works on one or more faces at a time, creating a new face for each of the selected faces. This could be used, for example, to create a picture inside a picture frame. The inner face could then be extruded in the negative direction to cause the frame to stand out. You can also Inset and make the new face larger than the original face. See the Dog House Tutorial in Section 3 of this manual for an example of this in action.


====Intrude====

You can make some very cool models very quickly with the intrude function. It is especially handy for making lattice work type of objects, such as the Eiffel Tower or a bird cage. It works by creating an inverted copy of the entire object, then doing a Bridge on all pairs of selected faces. The thickness of the walls is controlled by how far you move the mouse during the operation. The Dog House tutorial in this manual demonstrates the Intrude function quite nicely.

====Bevel====

Bevels all the edges of the selected face or faces simultaneously, thus creating a smaller selected face and small surrounding faces.


====Bridge====

Causes two co-planer or nearly co-planar faces to snap together, thus fusing new geometry between them. Only two faces can be selected at a time for Bridge. The faces must have the exact same number of edges and vertices but can be shaped differently. This can be used to attach one object to another, one part of the same object to another part of the same object, or to create holes in an object if the selected faces are on opposite sides of the object.


====Bump====

Moves selected faces out along their normals while at the same time creating new faces that meld into the existing geometry via newly beveled faces that are created. This is great for building up muscle tone on a model.


====Lift====

The Lift Command is only available if Advanced Menus are activated. Therefore, Lift will be discussed in the Advanced Menus section.


====Put on====

The Put On command allows you to drop one object onto another, much like dropping a box to the ground. Select the face you want to put onto another object then select Put On from the Face Menu. The Icon Bar will change to show you that you can select a vertex, edge or face to put the object on. Select the vertex, edge, or face you want and then Right Click to execute. The first object will jump into place right on the vertex, edge, or face you selected on the second object. This can be very useful when you go to weld parts together with the Bridge command.

Quick Tip – Put On and Bridge

To perform a bridge-like function at the same time, select both faces prior to Put On and Store | Selection. Use Put On, then Recall | Selection, Bridge, Cleanup, etc. This is quite quick, especially if on hot keys.


====Mirror====

Mirrors an object around one or more selected faces. By choosing multiple faces to perform Mirror multiple mirrors are performed simultaneously in the direction each face points. Thus care must be exercised on complex models least self colliding geometry be created. The Mirror command is most effective for doing symmetrical modeling, wherein only half of a model is built, then a mid model face is selected and Mirror used to create the other half of the model. If you maintain a clean central edge loop while modeling you can model, Mirror, continue to model, select the middle edge loop and do a Loop Cut, Delete the half of the model that needs to be updated, and then Mirror again.

Quick Tip: Fix that mirror plane.

If you use the Loop Cut, model, and Mirror method described above you will sometimes find that the object does not Mirror back together properly. This is often caused by the mirror face getting out of kilter i.e. non- planar, while modeling. Mirroring in such cases will cause a real mess. To fix it up, select the mirror face and do a Flatten on the appropriate axis to make it planar again. Then do the Mirror to make a whole object from the half. Finally, select Tools | Center All to get the whole thing re-centered in the workspace.


====Dissolve====

Deletes inner faces in a region of faces. You can also slice an object into several parts with the Dissolve command by selecting the faces that would separate the parts and doing a Dissolve. The parts will still be grouped as one object until you use the Separate command (in Object selection mode) to separate them.

DRAFT 1.6 83

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL FACE MENU | COLLAPSE

Deletes the selected faces, replacing each face with a vertex. The selection mode will be changed to Vertex, and the newly created vertices will be selected, allowing you to apply further commands.


====Smooth====
Connects all the edges of a face and tightens up the vertices so as to form a smoother shape from the original face. You can make round eyes from square faces with Smooth.

Quick Tip: Smooth To Check For Anomalies.

To check for self colliding 'internal' geometry smooth once and eyeball in wireframe mode, as it won't usually be obvious as an unsmoothed wireframe.


====Set Material====

'''New''' – Will prompt you for a Material Name in a pop-up dialog. Type in a new name of your choice and click OK. This will bring up the Material Editor as pictured here.

Here you can custom design a material to be applied to the selected face by setting the properties Diffuse, Ambient, Specular, Emission, Shininess, and Opacity. The ball on the left will show a preview of your material design and starts out as a neutral gray. To change any of the first four settings simply click on the box to bring up a color mixer. In the color mixer you can type in the RGB values in the fields on the left or use the slider bars to interactively mix the color. Once satisfied, click on OK. The ball on the left will immediately change to reflect your settings. Click OK again when you have finished adjusting all the settings to your liking. The new material will be added to the list of materials along with Default and Hole, with the name that you gave it. This new material can then be applied to any face selection you choose with the Face | Set Material command. The materials are saved with the model. In order to see it properly you will need to look at your model as Smooth Shaded, which you can do by pressing the Tab key. Note that a File | New will purge the materials list.

'''Default''' – will set the selected faces to the Default material color.

'''Hole''' – will set the selected faces to the Hole material color.


====Tesselate====

'''Triangulate''' – Will convert all the polygons in the selected faces to triangles. Some programs, such as game engines, expect models to be triangulated before import.

'''Quadrangulate''' – Will fix n-gon faces by converting them to quads whenever possible or to triangles if necessary. An ngon is a polygon with more than four edges. These are generally considered bad things to have in your model. This is often useful following a Face | Smooth since that type of smooth operation can result in adjoining ngon faces.

'''Figure 52''': The Wings Material Editor. Materials are assigned to faces, and therefore initially defined with the Material Editor accessed under the Face Menu. They can later be edited via the Material Editor accessed under the Edit Menu. 84 DRAFT 1.6

OBJECT MENU | MOVE

Free – Will move the selected object or objects in the direction of mouse movement. This can be very useful when in Orthographic mode, since it allows you to use the mouse to move objects in two cardinal directions while &quot;locking&quot; out movement in the third.

X – constrains movement along the x axis.

Y – constrains movement along the y axis.

Z – constrains movement along the z axis.

OBJECT MENU | ROTATE

Free – Will rotate the selected object(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains rotation about the x axis.

Y – constrains rotation about the y axis.

Z – constrains rotation about the z axis.

OBJECT MENU | SCALE

Uniform – Scales the object uniformly in all directions at once.

X – Scales the object along the x axis.

Y – Scales the object along the y axis.

Z – Scales the object along the z axis.

Radial X (YZ) – Scales the object radially from the x axis; i.e. The size in y and z are effected while x remains constant.

Radial Y (XZ) – Scales the object radially from the y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the object radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant. Figure 53: The Body or Object Menu.

OBJECT MENU | FLIP

X – will flip the object on the X axis. Y – will flip the object on the X axis. Z – will flip the object on the X axis.

OBJECT MENU | INVERT

Invert will flip all the normals of the model, in effect turning it inside out. This can be useful if an imported model loads into Wings inverted, i.e., the normals all pointing inwards instead of outwards. Invert will fix the normals so that they all point outward. It can also be useful to fix model parts that are created via Extract Region on inward facing

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL regions, though it may take some getting used to working inverted.

Quick Tip: A way to create the juice object inside a glass and have it line up.

On the inside of a glass or jug create a loop that defines the height of the liquid. Then select the loop, do a Shift-L to select the region next to it (Ctrl-Shift-I if it selects the wrong side). Do an Extract Region, Normal, and click without moving. This will separate off that area and make it solid. Switch to Body Mode (B), then do an Invert, which will flip the normals to align correctly. You now have a separate juice object that fits the jug exactly.

Tip provided by Mestela.

Quick Tip: Invert vs. Intrude.

With Intrude you can create a hollow object but the inside will be the same shape as the outside. Invert, on the other hand, can be useful to create an object that has a different shape on the inside than on the outside, connected via a bridged tunnel. Using invert, can put a totally different object inside another, invert the inner object, and bridge a tunnel between inner and outer objects, to get different inner/outer volumes. Tip provided by PuzzledPaul

OBJECT MENU | TIGHTEN

This will move all the vertices of an object towards each other, or away from each other. The effect is to round out or &quot;soften&quot; the model with a slight Tighten, or exaggerate the angles if you &quot;un-tighten&quot;.

OBJECT MENU | SMOOTH (S) This smoothes the model by performing a Catmull-Clarke subdivision on all the faces. This will have the effect of smoothing out angles between faces if they have not been set to hard, and eliminates poles by creating clean quad topology. If you want to maintain sharp angles in your model be sure to set the necessary edges to hard, either via the Edge Menu Hardness command, or by first doing an Auto-Smooth.

OBJECT MENU | COMBINE

This will combine the selected objects into one object. Unlike Mirror, it does not actually fuse or change any geometry. This can be very useful if you have a model composed of several parts and want to Scale, or Rotate them as a single entity. If you scale such a model without first using Combine, the parts will either pull away from each other or collide with each other since they all have their own local origins. Combine will allow you to scale everything together as if it were all one object, because they do indeed become one object. Objects need not be touching or even near each other to be combined. Object names previously assigned are lost.

OBJECT MENU | SEPARATE

If two or more objects have been fused via the Combine command, this will Separate them into their component parts. Former names will not be reestablished. Bodies that were separated by a Face | Dissolve operation can also be separated into separate bodies.

OBJECT MENU | CLEANUP

This command will find all non-intersecting vertices in the model and Collapse them. Good for maintaining the topological integrity of the model.

OBJECT MENU | AUTO-SMOOTH

This command will find all edges formed by sharp angels and automatically set them to be hard edges. Then when you Smooth the object, it will retain much of the original form and detail. By default the edge will be set to hard if the angle between the faces is more than 60 degrees. However you can set the crease angle by clicking on the parameters box to the right on the menu to suite your own needs.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus OBJECT MENU | DUPLICATE

Creates a copy of the selected object. Moving the mouse before doing another click will move the copy in the desired direction as chosen in the sub-menu; Free, X, Y, or Z.

Free – Moves the newly created object in the direction of mouse movement.

X – The newly created object will move in +X or -X directions only.

Y – The newly created object will move in +Y or -Y directions only.

Z – The newly created object will move in +Z or -Z directions only.

OBJECT MENU | DELETE (Bksp or Del)

Will delete one or more selected objects. They can be recalled via Undo.

OBJECT MENU | MODE

This lets you shift from Vertex Color mode to Material mode on selected objects. Note that objects that have UV Texture coordinates cannot be shown with vertex colors.

OBJECT MENU | STRIP TEXTURE

This will strip the textures from an imported model.

OBJECT MENU | UV MAPPING (experimental)

This brings up the AutoUV utility, a subprogram to Wings3D. To execute AutoUV select the whole object you want to map and then choose UV Mapping (experimental) from the Object menu. The Wings geometry window will change to have only three icons at the top; Vertex, Edge, and Face selection icons. Furthermore, right clicking in the workspace will bring up a new menu (the AutoUV Menu). It is not immediately apparent what you need to do to work with AutoUV, so this and the next several posts will explore what the AutoUV options are and how to use them. Since AutoUV is experimental, all of this is, of course, subject to change. The next section will explain the use of this complex tool.

� Section 5.3 Advanced Men WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.3 Advanced Menus We have put off discussion of advanced menus because it is generally agreed that new uses are best off leaving them alone until they have a firm grasp of basic Wings operations. However, I strongly recommend that you become proficient with the basic operations quickly and turn Advanced Menus on, and then leave them on forever since they offer so much additional modeling capability. Here we will discuss the Advanced Menu system, explain the mechanics of their use, and detail the advanced menu options available to you.

You can turn on the Advanced Menus by selecting that option in the Edit | Preferences Menu. After doing so you will see some changes to the Wings pop-up context sensitive menus. Most notably, the small sub-menu indicators on the right side of the menus change from small arrowheads to

small dots. This is your visual clue that Advanced Menus are enabled. Also, the Lift command becomes available in the Face Operations menu.

What Advanced Menus do for you is enable secondary selections. This does not sound all that significant at first, but it is. Just what a &quot;secondary selection&quot; is may need a little explanation. After making your primary selection, say you select an edge, normally you will be given options to manipulate that edge along its normal, free, or along the positive or negative X, Y, Z axis only. Sometimes you would like to use another axis, or vector, to work from. This is what enabling secondary selections does for you. It allows you to define just about any vector as the axis of operation for a given command. Consider the simple example presented in Figure 54.

88 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.3 Advanced Men Figure 54: Standard vs. Advanced Menus.

In the top two panels are screen shots taken with the standard menus on. In 54.a you can see that we can move the selected vertex along its Normal, Free, or in the X, Y or Z directions only. 54.b shows the result of moving the vertex along X by 0.5 units. Now take a look at panel 54.c, where Advanced Menus have been turned on, and compare it to panel 54.a. Notice two things

immediately. First the arrowheads in 54.a have become small dots in 54.c. Second, the messages on the status bar have changed dramatically. Be sure to pay attention to the status bar when modeling in Wings, especially when you have Advanced Menus on, for very important instructions are given there. In this case the status bar is telling you that a Left mouse click [L] will allow you

DRAFT 1.6 89

� Section 5.3 Advanced Men WINGS3D USER MANUAL to move along the standard axis, just like normal, but that a Right mouse click [R] will allow you to select a user defined axis to move along. In panel 54.c we have clicked the Right mouse button and are now presented with a new interface which will allow us to make our secondary selections,

meaning that you can define virtually any vector with a bit of set up. It is also handy to note that if you only need one selection to define your vector you can use a single right click to select it and then drag to execute all at once.


Figure 55: The Wings magnets.

which in turn, will define our new axis (often referred to as a vector). Notice that the icon bar has changed to indicate that you can select vertices, edges or even faces to define this vector and the status bar is giving you new instructions (Panel 54.d). Make your selections (you can use more than one element to define the vector) with the Left mouse button and then Execute with the Right mouse button. Panel 54.e shows the newly defined axis as a thick blue line passing through the vertex we chose as the vector. Finally panel 54.f shows the result of a move along that axis, also by 0.5 units. As you can see, you get very different results. Note that you can use another object completely on which to make your secondary selections,

But that is not all that Advanced Menus do for you. By enabling Advanced Menus you also get access to the magnets in Wings. Remember in the example above we Right clicked on the Move command to enable secondary selections. We said if we left click we would get to work on standard axis only. But we also would see the magnets suddenly appear, as seen in Figure 55 below.

With Advanced Menus enabled, on many of the commands a Left click will reveal the Wings magnets as seen in Figure 55.a above. If you click on the actual command (Normal, Free, X, Y, or Z) you will work as normal without the magnets. But if you click on the little magnet icon to the right of the

90 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.3 Advanced Men command, then you will enable the magnets. Also notice that important instructions are being passed to you via the status bar once again.

In panel 55.a we have a vertex selected that we want to move but we want the movement to affect some of the surrounding vertices as well. So we left click on Move, which brings up the Move menu with magnets enabled. Then we hover over the magnet icon next to the X option and read the status line. The status bar tells us that we must use the left mouse button to define an area of influence, or fall off zone, for the magnet to affect, that a Middle mouse button click would allow us to enter a numeric radius as seen in Figure 56, and that a Right mouse button would use the last radius used. We then use the Left mouse button and select a set of vertices not too far from the initial selection, in this case three (one hidden from our current view) which results in a big blue dot as seen in panel 55.c. This dot indicates the center of the extent of our fall off zone. Now the status bar is giving new instructions, specifically, that you can begin the magnetic move with the Right click of the mouse. Panel 55.d shows the result of doing a magnetic Move. Keep in mind that you can use of the Middle mouse button to dolly around during this operation to get a good look at things as you go.

Further more, you can combine these two types of operations. You can define a vector and then Alt-Right Click to bring up a Vector+Magnet operation. Doing so bring up this little gem:


Figure 57: Vector Magnets revealed.


Just click on the little magnet icon and set up magnets as described before. You get the power of both vectors and magnets combined. Note that for users of Maya camera mode, Hold Ctrl instead of Alt while right-clicking. (This is shown in the help prompt in the status line.)

Finally, there is the new Face command, Lift, that becomes available when Advanced Menus are activated. The reasons Lift is only available with Advanced Menus is that it requires a secondary selection to use as the pivot for performing the lift. And secondary selections is what Advanced Menus are all about. Lift is explained in more detail in the following section.


Figure 56: The Influence Menu. Numeric entry of the magnetic fall off zone is accessed via the Middle mouse button.

� Section 5.3 Advanced Men WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.4 A little tutorial. The first thing you need to do is make sure that you have Advanced Menus activated. Under Edit | Preferences make sure the Advanced Menus option (near the bottom of the form) is checked. Then click OK to return to the workspace.

Create a cube and select the top face. Then right click in the workspace to bring up the Face Operations Menu. Now hover over Move. Don't click anything!

Read the status bar and notice that a left click will use the standard axes whereas a right click will use custom vectors. I hope you have realized by now just how important the message passing in the status bar is. I cannot emphasis it enough. Click the Right Mouse Button to begin using vector operations.

At the right of the status bar Wings will tell you to Select Axis for Face Move. This is how you will define the vector. Click on the positive Z face and notice the appearance of a blue vector. Now click on the positive X face and notice that the direction of the vector changed. You can continue to select and deselect faces until you get the vector going the way you want it to. You can even use a remote object for this vector definition process.

Once you are happy with the direction of your vector then click the Right Mouse Button. Now you can move the mouse and watch the face move along the vector you just defined. Notice the instructions on the status bar as you are dragging. It now tells you that you can constrain the movement by holding down modifier keys while dragging. Dragging with the Shift key depressed will cause movement to be constrained to whole units, while the Ctrl key will cause movement to be constrained to tenths of units. That's it. You now know how to use Wings vector operations. Just try doing this a couple of times then try a few of the other commands. You'll have the routine down in no time.

Now let's practice a little with magnets.

Delete your cube and bring up a Grid primitive; right click to bring up the Primitives menu and look for Grid in the list of primitives. Don't click it, instead, click the option box on the right to specify how big we want our grid to be. A little pop-up box will ask you to specify the number of Rows/cols. Enter 20 and click OK. Grids are great for seeing the effects of magnets.

Select a vertex four in from the +Z/+X corner as shown below (Figure 58.a). Now Right Click to bring up the Vertex Operations menu. Then Left Click on Move to bring up the options sub-menu (Figure 58.b). Click on the little magnet icon to the right of Normal. Now read the status bar and notice the icon bar has changed. At the right of the status bar Wings is telling you what you need to do while to the left it is telling you how to do it. Right now it is telling you that you need to select the magnet influence (fall-off zone) for the move operation and that you do this by Left Clicking some elements. The Icon bar is telling you that those elements can be vertices, edges or faces (with vertices being the default).

The fall-off zone is defined as a radius from the initial selection point, so we only need to pick one other vertex to define it. Pick one that is four vertices away from the initial selection (Figure 58.c). It shows up as a big blue square on the +X edge of my grid in this case.

Notice that the status bar is still telling us that a Right Click will execute the command. So let's Right Click now and see what happens when we move the mouse around. As you move the mouse around watch the status bar again. It will tell you by how much the original vertex is moving, but it also tells you the radius of the fall-off zone. But we already defined the radius, so what is that for? Well, you can change the fall-off zone radius interactively as you drag by using the plus and minus (+ -) keys as indicated on the right side of the status bar. Go ahead and press the Plus key a couple of times and see

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6 AutoUV Mapping Section 6.3 UV Mapping


The UV Mapping Segmenting Mode window. Note the new menu available in this mode. Here you will divide up your model into slices called charts which will be laid out on a texture map. You can hand create the charts or have wings do it for you.

UV MAPPING | SEGMENTING MODE

There is a new step in the autoUV, called 'segmenting'. You use the segmenting step to create charts and cuts. A chart is an area (a set of connected faces) of your model that will be mapped to a 2d surface as a separated area. You can let Wings do the work for you by clicking continue or if you want more control you can do it yourself in this window. This sections explains how.

When you enter the segmenting step, you'll have the model’s materials as your charts, you can use them as your charts by pressing 'continue'. You can also do it by hand to have more control over how the charts are

created. Select faces and choose one of the AuvChart[1-9] charts. If two, or more, groups of selected faces use the same AuvChartX they will treated as two, or more, charts if they share no edges. In this way you can create more than 9 charts.

Continue

Despite being on top of the list Continue will be the last thing you will do. When your satisfied with your charts (and cuts if your are going to use the unfold algorithm). Press 'continue' and choose the 3d to 2d mapper; method. Projection or Unfolding.

DRAFT 1.6 103

� Section 5.2 6 AutoUV Mapping WINGS3D USER MANUAL Continue | Projection

Projection computes the weighted normal for the chart (larger faces contribute more to the normal than smaller faces) and projects the 3d to chart on a 2d plane (This was the method used in the old autouv). Projection needs almost flat charts (2d planes) to be able to create a good 2d mapping. It will also use your materials as a guide to breaking up your model into smaller charts.

SEGMENT BY | PROJECTION

Continue | Unfolding

Unfolding computes a 2d drawing by unfolding the model mathematically, this method should be used when your charts isn't flat (close a 2d plane). If you have bad charts and cuts the unfolding algorithm may produce strange results, but provided good charts and cuts in the right places, the result should be acceptable.

When the mapping 3d to 2d is done you end up in the autouv window, which works as before.


There are basically three ways you can segment (or cut up) your model for UV mapping. Two of them are so fast and easy as to truly merit the name AutoUV. The third method is not much harder, once you get the feel for it, and much more suited for complex models. We will discuss the first two methods first, and save the third for last.

If your model is fairly simple in nature (such as my smoothed cube) it is a good candidate

for using one of the truly automated methods of segmentation. If you choose Segment By you will be given the choices of Projection or Feature Detection. Choosing Projection will segment the model so that faces are chosen based on which of the six primary axes they most closely approximate. Below you can see that my smoothed cube has been assigned six materials based on their orientation. This should minimize stretching in the UV map.

104 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6 AutoUV Mapping SEGMENT BY | FEATURE DETECTION

This option will automatically segment your model into the minimum number of charts necessary; often just two. Below you can see that my smoothed cube has been assigned two materials, breaking the model into two nearly equal sections. While this is very fast and easy, it could lead to layout and/or stretching problems later, when trying to paint the texture on the resulting map.

AuvChart1~9

Charts should be created with care, they should be used to minimize the stretching and still contain something that you are able to paint. Fewer charts is better from a user perspective because they are easier to paint on, but more charts will lay flatter so they will have less texture stretching. You will have to deside how best to divide the surface so that it is as flat as possible.



Note that I picked up where I left off, that the smoothed cube starts out here projected. You can switch back and forth between the two as long as you do not choose Continue.

DRAFT 1.6 105

� Section 5.2 6 AutoUV Mapping WINGS3D USER MANUAL Creating Cuts


The Segmenting Right Click Menu

The third option is to segment your model by hand. The task is to break up your model into as many charts as you need in order to make your model lay flat. A flat model will not have texture stretching, but if you make too many charts you will not be able to easily paint your textures. The art of proper chart number to ease of painting is a skill learned with practice. Once you have finished making your charts and appropriate cuts you click Continue | Unfolding

Mark edges for Cuts

A 'Cut' is used to simplify a chart for the UV Mapper to correctly spread out your charts on the texture. If you want to unfold a cube in one chart, you can do that by cutting the correct edges, or if you want a spherical or cylindrical mapping you must have cuts. A spherical mapping is done by making a cut between the poles of the sphere. And a cylindrical mapping is done by making three charts, two discs, one with a cut. See the image on the right.

Quick Tip: Using Cuts

In the cube example, there is only one chart. I selected the edges that are green and used


the command &quot;Mark Edge for Cut&quot;. I then choose &quot;Continue | Unfolding&quot;.

In the cylinder example, there are three charts. To have the middle part of the cylinder unfold properly, I have marked a single cut along one vertical edge. In this case I simply used &quot;Segment by | Feature Detection&quot; which created the charts and the cut automatically. I can keep the layout it gave me or do some minor edits. Once done I click the Continue | Unfolding.

106 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6 AutoUV Mapping SEGMENT BY | FEATURE DETECTION

Once you have decided on how to segment your model (via Projection, Feature Detection, or by hand) then you can use the Continue option. This will bring up a new window titled AutoUV, which will contain the

Quick Tip: Is having more charts better

I think the general rule is that fewer charts gives more stretching per chart but are easier to paint. Both these ops gives the user an initial suggestion, which they can alter, but feature detection shouldn't be used together with projection parameterization. Projection segmentation often gives more charts than feature detection.

Quick tip: Updating the UV Maps after edits to the mesh

Here is a tip that might not be obvious.

Let's assume that you have done some changes in the segmenting phase. You might have recolored faces or cut edges. You then do &quot;Continue | Unfolding&quot; and find that the

layout for your texture map. In the example above you can see that I had done my segmenting by Projection (left image) and then by selecting Continue an AutoUV map comes up (right image) with the model nicely laid out.

result is not quite what you expected. For instance, you might want to have chart cut or split in two.

Currently, there is no way to go back to the segmenting phase directly. But the following trick will work:

1) Quit and save all changes. 2) Use the &quot;UV Mapping&quot; command again. 3) You will be asked whether you want to edit the current UV mapping or discard the current UV mapping and start over. 4) Choose the second alternative -to DISCARD the UV mapping. The texture and UV coordinates will be discarded, but before they are discarded, AutoUV will use them pre-color faces and insert cuts according to the UV coordinates. 5) Do the needed changes.

DRAFT 1.6 107

� Section 8: Plug ins WINGS3D USER MANUAL AUTO UV WINDOW


Once you have your charts in the Auto UV window you can further tweak the position of your charts to make it easier to paint them without getting stretching. You have a small selection of tools with which to edit the charts. All edits affect the entire chart. Currently there is no way to reposition vertices directly in this window.

|cat=Algebra (book)}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The '''''Order of Operations''''' is used when doing expressions with more than one operation (e.g., &amp;times;, +, -). These are rules so you only get one answer all the time.

Example: When faced with &lt;math&gt;4+2 \times 3&lt;/math&gt;, how do you proceed?  

There are two ways:

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = (4 + 2) \times 3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 6 \times 3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3= 18&lt;/math&gt;
 
'''or'''

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 4 + (2 \times 3)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 4 + 6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;4 + 2 \times 3 = 10&lt;/math&gt;

This is confusing, so which is correct? (Parentheses, &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; are used to show what to do first)

In order to communicate using mathematical expressions we must agree on an ''order of operations'' so that each expression has only one value.

For the above example all mathematicians agree the correct answer is 10.

You're probably wondering what this order is.

==The Standard Order of Operations==

Evaluate expressions in this order.

*Parentheses or Brackets (evaluate what's inside them)
*Exponents
*Multiplication and/or division from left to right
*Addition and/or subtraction from left to right

===An Easy Way of Remembering===
Use this memory tool to help remember the order! 
'''''P'''lease '''E'''xcuse '''M'''y '''D'''ear '''A'''nnoying '''S'''ister
It is also commonly called by its acronym, PEMDAS.

An alternative form of this is; 
'''B'''rackets 
'''I'''ndices 
'''D'''ivision or '''M'''ultiplication 
'''A'''ddition or '''S'''ubtraction 
(BIDMAS).

Yet another way of remembering this is 
'''B'''rackets 
'''O'''rders 
'''D'''ivision 
'''M'''ultiplication 
'''A'''ddition 
'''S'''ubtraction (BODMAS)&lt;br /&gt;

== Playing with Mathematics ==

To get yourself thinking about this, try this simple mathematical game:

Take the numbers 1 through 10 on the left side of an equation, and pick a number for the right side.

Example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 = 1

Now put operators between those numbers.  Only use parentheses when necessary. 

Example:
1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9 - 10 = 1

Change the number on the right-hand side. Can you generate an expression for this number?  If not, can you prove why not?

Does this change if you change the order of the numbers?</text>

== A Quick Review... ==

What is the Cartesian Plane?

Named for &quot;the father of analytical geometry,&quot; 17th century French mathematician [[w:Descartes|René Descartes (Cartesius)]], uniform regular grid (Cartesian) coordinates is one system used for graphing.  Many algebraic expressions lend themselves to graphical analysis. The location of a point's [[w:Cartesian_coordinate_system | Cartesian]] plot is found by indexing numerical values (coordinates) along numbered grid lines. The trivial single '''R''' number line comprises a one dimensional, single ordinate, system  with all locations existing &lt;u&gt;only on&lt;/u&gt; that line. This study begins with graphing in two dimensions (see the two diagrams below).  Plots and points are located and labeled with the offsets of their 'projections' from two number lines ('''R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' axes) anywhere on the page and plane.  

[[Image:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|324px|thumb|left|The four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system. The arrows on the axes indicate that they extend forever in their respective directions (i.e. infinitely).]]

We choose the values or ordinates for points on the Cartesian plane using two perpendicular numbered axes.  By convention the point where the two axes cross is labeled as 0 on each axis, making the ordinate for their intersection a special point called the origin and labeled (0,0). Generally, the horizontal axis is labeled ''x'' and the vertical axis ''y''.  An ''ordered pair'' (x,y) specifies the location of a point P on the plane.  If we don't want to talk about ordered pairs as x and y we can refer to the first variable in the ordered pair as the abscissa and the second as the ordinate.  The axes cross where the abscissa is 0 and the ordinate is 0.  We can generalize about the signs of the abscissa and ordinate in ordered pairs because the two axes form four ''quadrants'' when they cross. Moving counter clockwise, starting in the upper right quadrant, the quadrants are labeled I, II, III, and IV. In quadrant I, all x- and y-values are positive, in II, x is negative and y positive, in III, all values are negative, and only x is positive in IV. The ordered pair (0,0) represents the '''origin''' where the axes intersect.

We use the axes to define relationships between two sets of numbers for which we substitute variables.  A relationship implies that changing the value of one variable determines the value of the other. We call the variable that is changing the independent variable and the variable whose value changes the dependent variable.  Generally we let ''x'' represent the independent variable, ''y'' represent the dependent variable so that we can model the relationship between x and y with mathematical symbols.  The set of numbers represented by the independent variable is called the domain.  The set of numbers represented by the dependent variable is called the range.  A special kind of relationship is called a function.  A function is a relationship where any value in the domain maps onto one and only one value in the range.  

When we graph the points of a relationship on a Cartesian plane then we can determine if the relationship is a function--'''all''' vertical lines of the plane cross our graph once and only once.  Functions are useful for modeling cause and effect relationships - where the cause is the independent variable and the effect is the dependent variable.
{| align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;

|- align=center
| I || Positive || Positive
|- align=center
| II || Negative || Positive
|- align=center
| III || Negative || Negative
|- align=center
| IV || Positive || Negative
|}

Note that the only thing unique about the Cartesian plane is that it contains a point that we call &quot;the origin&quot; and have labeled (0,0)  If we draw another axis perpendicular to the two dimensional graph through the origin we can graph 3 dimensional objects ('''R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''').  Imagine a thin extensible numbered wire through the origin of the two dimensional graph.  By using a 3rd coordinate this line (X, Y, Z) we can locate points that are above or below the page in space. This idea can be expanded to higher dimensions (including time) and is the basis for a field of theoretical physics called [[w:String_theory| string theory

==Determining Points==

Continuous sets of points can be represented by lines or curves on a graph showing how continuous paired quantities relate to each other.  Such numbers or quantities are called '''variables'''.  A function, relation, or equation can define how, as an input quantity varies, a related output quantity can vary. A graph can then illustrate  how these variables are related to each other. The '''independent variable''' is one which is sent to the function because a person can control or vary it at will. The dependent variable is the one that comes out of the function.  The definition of the function determines the value of the dependent variable depending on the value of the independent variable. 

Any equation which has two variables can effectively define a relation between the two variables and the relation can be plotted on a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate graph.  In  any particular equation, relation, or function definition, numbers which stay the same, i. e. which are not variables, are often called '''constants'''.  Even if someone does not know much fancy algebra, a person may start getting an idea of what a function or a two-variable equation or relation looks like in a graph by choosing various numbers for one of the variables from the domain and calculating corresponding numbers of the other variable (in the range) to determine as many ordered pairs as practical and plotting those points on a graph.  After enough points are plotted, one may be able to estimate what a continuous relation looks like by connecting the calculated points by a straight or curved line, depending on the situation.  


'''Exercise''':  For the function y = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1, set up a table so that you pick values for x (the independent value) and then calculate the value for y (the dependent variable)


&lt;center&gt;'''Table for various values of x and y : ''' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cell padding = &quot;2&quot;
 !width=&quot;30&quot;| x !!width=&quot;30&quot;| y 
 |- align=center
 | 0 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | 1 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | -1 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | 2 || ? 
 |- align=center

 |- align=center
 | 3 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | -3 || ? 
 |- align=center
 | ? || ? 
 |- align=center
 | ? || ? 
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;etc. &lt;/center&gt;


Determine as many points as you feel comfortable to make a plot of this equation on a graph.  Then on graph paper draw x and y axes on a grid of squares.  Then plot the (x,y) ordered pairs as points on the graph.  Finally, when you think you have plotted enough points to get a feel for the shape of the function, connect the points to see what the function graph looks like.  If you are not sure in a part of the graph, you can always calculate more points to fill in that place.

==Plotting Points on a Graph==
A formula, equation or inequality that is solved for just a single instance of one variable is an '''implicit relation''' of, and '''dependent''' in, that variable in terms of the remaining and '''independent''' variable(s). An '''explicit''' relation is one noting which variable(s) is(are) independent. A '''point''' solution is a group of values (one for each independent variable) together with a corresponding calculated dependent value. Consensus-notation comma-separates these with the dependent variable's value last in an '''ordered group''' (parenthesis are optional '''iff''' there's no ambiguity). The independent variable's(s') valid-values solution '''set(s)''' constitutes the relation's '''domain''' and the dependent's its '''range'''. &lt;u&gt;A '''function''' is a relation restricted to independent value(s) which generate '''unique''' dependent values&lt;/u&gt;.

[[Image:Point_in_2D_Cartesian_coordinates.PNG|300px|left|thumb|In this plot the locus for (''x'',''y'') is the point (3,4).]]

A complete plot depicts all possible point solutions to a relation. 'One' independent variable plus 'the' dependent variable presents a 'two' dimensional map (graph) with 'two' '''perpendicular''' ('''orthogonal''') number lines ('''axes''') which cross ('''intercept''') at the '''origin''' ('''O'''). By consensus the first coordinate relates to offset along the horizontal axis and the second to the vertical (an '''ordered pair''').

This '''Function Graphing (section)''' uses a two-dimensional '''rectangular''' Cartesian coordinate system, the first coordinate is [[Wikipedia:abscissa|abscissa]] and commonly references an '''''x''-axis''' and the second is [[Wikipedia:ordinate|ordinate]] for a '''''y''-axis'''. The axes values are numbers and are elements of and '''closed''' to '''R''' and together constitute '''R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The origin point is the number pair '''0,0'''. Positive numbers increment to the right and up and negative numbers decrement to the left and down. The notation '''''x'',''y''''' is the common form/formula of an ordered-pair point and is plotted on/in the following graph.  

To remember the '''order''' of coordinates think of a roller coaster--&quot;If you do it '''RIGHT''', you might throw '''UP'''&quot;; or if the graph were a street with tall buildings--you have to go along the street (RIGHT/LEFT) before you can enter and go '''UP''' the stairs; or you crawl (RIGHT/LEFT) before you walk (Stand '''UP''').



The axes and '''plane''' '''field''' extend out as close to infinity (positive and negative) as is necessary for any analysis. In practice graphs are abbreviated to areas of examination. In our example the generic point ''x'',''y'' is assigned to number values (x = 3, y =4) by plotting it at point 3,4. A line and a dotted line show that this position is located by starting at (0,0), moving 3 '''units''' in the positive ''x'' direction (right), and moving 4 units in the positive ''y'' direction (upwards).</text>

{{wikipedia|Courtship}}
[[Image:Daniele da Volterra 004.jpg|right|200px|&quot;Don't cry, love. He's really not worth all that.&quot;]]
&quot;'''Courtship''' or '''dating''' is the process of selecting and attracting a mate for [[w:marriage|marriage]], [[w:sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]], or other [[w:intimate|intimate]] activities.&quot; So claims Wikipedia.

In some parts of the [[w:United States|United States]], at least, the &quot;dating&quot; concept is very important. Dating is commonly featured in US music and movies, and is also a major feature of bars serving [[../Alcohol|alcohol]]. Some persons who give much attention to dating give almost no attention to other social activity.

The phrase &quot;[[wikt:getting|getting]] a [[wikt:date|date]]&quot; (and variants like &quot;getting a girl&quot;) has a variety of meanings in English. This text attempts to document the process of courtship, which is sometimes described (well or not) as the getting of a date.

=== Disclaimer ===
Though drawn from thorough research and established authorities, this module is at best a rough guide, and any courtship situation will be highly specific to both the courting party and the courted.  No single piece of advice will be appropriate for all people under the relevant circumstances.  Everything contained herein should be taken in with a good dose of scepticism as most of the advice when carried out ''will'' have unexpected results.  Any advice carried out without the exercise of good judgement could have harmful or undesired effects.

So you have a girl that is compatible. You know she likes you, or was attracted to you at some point in time, but things just went sour at some point and it is now awkward to talk to each other. Even though two people like each other, it can still be awkward if there isn't clear communication.
You are either not reading her signal to approach, not approaching her right away (taking too long), not starting with a leading comment (not saying the right thing). 

The simplest mistake and easiest to correct is taking too long. Use the three second rule. As soon as you know she's sending you a signal approach her right away and start with the right comment. Of course you'll need to know how to read signals and what to say. That is what we talk about next.

== Pick Up Her Signals ==

She will be giving out flirting signals. She will look at you, make an open circle with her girlfriends or brush her hair when you look at her. She might walk by you or loosen her blouse when you are around. Other less direct signals are when she stands alone and not busy and makes herself captive (captive audience).

She will go somewhere where she's alone and not doing anything in particular. It is somewhere in an open space where you can easily approach her. She might be looking at a board, or looking out the window or standing at the door, or sitting by a table in the middle of the room, or sitting in a sofa in the middle of the room. The area is very accessible. If no one is approaching her, that means it's for you. She shouldn't be busy with anything, only something trivial as an excuse to stand in that place. If she's really busy and still in a central location, just look at her and make eye contact instead of approaching her all the way.

She will make herself captive. Girls want you to come on to them to see your intentions and you have to do this or else she will not feel appreciated enough. But she doesn't want to look like a slut for being with you, or talking to you so forward. So what she will do is put herself into a situation where she can not leave, so that she has an excuse to listen to you. The key here is to not chase her away. Stop doing your spiel before she has a chance to leave and disengage before your time is up.

For example. This girl likes you, she moves into a cubicle next to yours in the office. She's made herself captive because now you can talk to her in between tasks. Let's say you work a nine to five day. You get off at lunch and at five o'clock. Lay off the lingo half an hour before lunch and half an hour before five. All the other time you are going to be flirtatious, forward even mischievous. Remember, she moved next to you to make herself captive. It's up to you to make a move. She will be calling you fresh and bad and calling your comments annoying and inappropriate which is ok as long they are flirtatious and not rude and as long as you cool off before you leave, half hour before lunch and half hour before five.

Girls make themselves captive in all sorts of ways. When they do, that means they want you to approach them and be a little too forward and use her being captive. Being too forward is ok as long as you keep it flirtatious and sexual as opposed to obnoxious or anything rude, no put downs. And as long as you disengage before your time is up, as a cool off. If you chase her away she will not come back, but if you cool off before the time is up, the cool off will make is seem ok to come back and she will make herself captive for you again.

Some examples of girls making themselves captive: sitting next to you during a class, sitting next to you in church during a sermon, sitting next to you during a bible study, sitting next to you during a shift at work. Two things. First she is the one who set's up the situation, she is the one who comes near you and sits with you no the other way around. Second, there is a particular duration so you know when your time is coming close so you know when to cool off.

Girls also crouch, they sit down on steps, or sit in an open space to read a news paper for fun. Psychologically it is harder to stop doing something to get up and walk away. As long as she's not actually busy with an assignment on the article in the newspaper, she's making herself captive. Use that opportunity, because if you don't she will feel neglected and not come back again.

Sometimes a girl would be on her way to walk past you, and just as she's next to you she kneels down to tie her shoes. Make a witty remark to be flirtation, something about how the thicker the show laces the harder it is to get them in the holes. And turn away to disengage before she has a chance to leave. This way you are not chasing her away and she will come by you again.

==Approach Right Away==

The next thing to know is once you have detected those signals from her, to move in right way and start talking. as long as you know that you have to respond right away, it shouldn't be a problem. If it doesn't go smooth just walk away. As a matter of fact it will not go smooth the first couple of times: you will have to approach a girl several times before she's comfortable. Move in right away and leave right away to give her personal space. Move out of her territory and turn away from her to cool things off. Mean while keep glancing back at her every couple of minutes or so for another signal. When you see the signal, you move in again and so on.

== Say The Right Thing ==

Sometimes things get awkward just because you are not saying the right thing. What ever the reason is, if it's awkward leave and wait for your signal again. It helps a lot knowing what to say. One of the worst mistakes is with a yes or no question. The only time you start with a yes or no question is when you approach her first without her giving you a signal, such as at a party when you first see her. If she already gave you a signal to move in, that is your yes, ask open ended questions.

One of the best things to say is a leading phrase. A leading phrase implies that there is move information and it directs where the conversation will go. For example: how awesome is this party? That is a leading question because it directs you to talk about the party being awesome. It doesn't ask are you enjoying this party? It verifies with confidence that this party is awesome.

Even better than a leading question is a leading phrase. A leading phrase is based on what you know about one word or one thing that the girl is doing at the present time. If a girl is next to you tying her shoes she is thinking one thing: shoe laces. Of course she's also thinking about work, dinner, the next assignment dues date, what ever. But at this point right now the one thing in her mind is shoelaces. Say one line, what ever you know about shoelaces.  Some of them are too thick and it's hard to get them into the holes. Add a little sexual connotation and you have got your self pick up line.

To figure out what to talk about look at what she doing. She might be stretching, eating, drinking etc. If she's not doing anything in particular notice what she's looking at. She could be looking at a picture on the wall, a puppy, a rose. Do not talk about this one particular rose, it's not an opinion. Say something what ever comes to mind that you know about flowers because that is her connection with you.

If she's not doing anything in particular, and she's not looking at anything in particular, notice what she's doing with her hands. She might be holding something, like playing around with a pen, then talk about that.
So the ingredients are to find the one thing that's on her mind right now at the present time. Some trivial simple little thing. Talk about what ever you know about those things, nothing related to the actual thing, but something from your own knowledge. Add sexual connotation. The whole process puts her and you together with sex involved and you've got the recipe for attraction.

It's not really that hard to approach women. Once you have figured out the formula for coming up with one liners breaking the ice will be easy. The hardest step is to do it right away, as soon as you get the signal from the woman. And the solution for that is off course to leave right away so you can wait for the signal and try again.

=== Complexity of dating ===
Men and women are remarkable creatures, and in some respects, easily predictable. The one most important thing they want, trumping all other concerns, is ''[[wikt:proximity|proximity]]''.

Or is it?

Generalisations are dangerous here. To suggest that persons are predictable or are seeking &quot;only one thing&quot; is to underestimate the complexity of modern dating.

From the anthropological or historical perspectives, courtship ought not to be difficult. After some initial tough competition, the male wins a female and their joining forms the basis of future progeny. Arranged marriages, marriages of convenience, inter-tribal relationships designed to seal a political connection (as with the Campbells and MacDonalds on the eve of the [[w:Glencoe Massacre|Glencoe Massacre]]) all suggest a time when the matter was out of the hands of the young man or woman.

On the basis of many of the greatest writings in the history of English literature, some claim that courtship should be natural, free and almost dreamlike, as fate guides two uplifted hearts together breathlessly. Others suggest that dating in contemporary society has become mechanical and deterministic.

=== Example process ===
Here is an example process:
# Locate a man or woman
# Get within ten metres
# Smile, make eye contact
# Prepare for the consequences

This oversimplification might not result in dating, but only social contact.

For the purposes of this text, the term '''partner''' is applied to each of the two persons that are dating. If the two partners remain in courtship after the first meeting, then they enter a day-to-day phase. For some partners, this is a time to explain their love to each other while investigating how or why the other person loves them. That is, you investigate the mystery of why your partner loves you. Also, you be honest and explain how, when, where, and why you like your partner. This means talking about oneself, and not what one does. (FIXME is there a difference?)

Both persons should maintain their extraneous interests, such as friends, careers, etcetera, but should also enjoy themselves together. The maintenance of these other interests supplies new topics to discuss with a partner, but the cessation of these activities can limit potential conversation topics, and appear needy and insecure. By making oneself available ''all'' the time, one removes the element of scarcity that is a component of attraction.

=== Where To Meet Women ===

To attract women takes exposure. Where ever you are, to get a woman to like you and to spend time with you will take time and work getting to know one another. That is why most places where people meet are where men and women frequent automatically because they don't have a choice. Women have no choice about going to work. The work place is the number one area where people meet often.
Everyone has to work. Even the most beautiful women have to make a living somehow. They go to work and they have to talk to the people that are there. At work you will encounter women as you carry on with the tasks of the day.  This brings us to the number one spot to meet women:

'''1. At Work'''

Statistics show that some 70 percent of married people got together at work. The key ingredients are time, getting to know each other and similar interests. Women search for men with similar talents to their own and none of the flaws in what is called compatibility. We all have flaws, but we try to limit those by meeting a person with different flaws of our own. When it comes to aptitudes and natural talents women look for men similar to themselves. This insured the dissolution of bad genes and concentration of good genes. At the same work place people tend to have similarities in their abilities, especially when is comes to the same lines of work. Combined with time and the opportunity to get to thoroughly know one another, the right people automatically click together. That is why it's so important to work at something you are good at and really enjoy.

'''2. Church'''

Church is supposed to be a spiritual place and not a dating service and yet it's a known fact that a lot of people meet and get married through church. The kind of church to join is one with similar background to yourself as well as your faith. The more similar people are the more chances there are for compatibility. Even in one denomination there are different locations. Join the one with people the most similar to yourself. The more you like the people there the more you will be eager to help out and as a result you will get noticed.

'''3. School'''

Studies show that people build special emotional bonds at an early age. The girls you have met in high school, especially near the age of sixteen usually will have a special memory of you. People were not meant to get married and have kids as late as they do in today's day and age. In the old times, girls used to get pregnant in their teens. Nature equipped girls with a special imprinting during those early years. Keep in touch with a girl you knew in high school. She probably has deeper feelings for you than you knew.

'''4. Friends'''

Needless to say, every group has their own spots they like to hang out at. It's different for every group of friends, but the facts are that a lot of people meet through a friend or a friend of a friend. It could be a buddies ex or a friend of your ex girlfriends friend, whatever the case. Most people consider it immoral to date your friends ex girlfriends, but look at it this way, statistically most people end up doing it anyway. Just don't hit on your friends current girlfriend or somebody that he is currently dating. Chances are she is more interested in him, and in this case jeopardizing the relationship is more than it's worth. 

The way to get access to your buddies girls is to be facilitating with you own female friends. This does two things. It makes you popular with the ladies because they want to meet guys just as much as we want them. Second, it gets your buddy to be less possessive. When he's involved with someone, she's not going to like him being jealous over someone else. This is when all of his female contacts become fair game.

'''5. Sports Teams'''

Gym memberships are increasing world wide. However, it's not in the gym or the wait room where couples tend to meet. Instead consider joining a team that gets together once or twice a week on a regular basis. Good sports are volleyball, soccer and Frisbee. These are usually stand alone organizations you just have to find them. The idea is that team sports set the tone for interaction. Also, body smell such as from sweating during physical activity helps females determine genetic compatibility from pheromones and Androstenone smell. To recap, yes most successful marriages do start off in the work place or from the high school years. However, with the right ingredients of time, compatibility and interaction other places could be an opportunity for meeting women as well.

'''6. Grocery Stores'''

As with work, everyone has to go to the grocery store or supermarket.  Again, this includes even the most beautiful women.  One advantage of supermarkets is that single men and women, as well as single parents, must shop there.  Also, visits to the supermarket are likely to be very frequent, as frequent as for example going to church services.  It is thus possible to meet and get to know men or women by regularly visiting your local supermarket.  In the UK, Sainsbury's stores are particularly good for meeting potential partners.

So can you meet a woman just about anywhere? Successful pickups have happened at bars, clubs, coffee shops, mall, elevator you name it. It's not a question of getting a date. To find the right woman takes time with her and getting to know her.  Meanwhile, all those other places are great practice.

== The History of the Bicycles ==

[[File:Oxford bikes.jpg|thumbnail|350px|right|Welcome to the Bicycles Wikibook!]]

Bicycles are one of the most ubiquitous forms of transportation in the world. Most children remember their first bike; with it came the chance to explore their world with more freedom than ever before.  As we grow, however, bicycling becomes more than just a childhood rite of passage. 

Wind in our hair and feet on the pedals, we have several good reasons to climb on and take a trip. Much of the world uses bicycles as a primary form of daily transportation. 

What would take several hours of travel on foot becomes faster and more efficient on two wheels. Some cyclists take trips across entire states or cross-country solely on a bicycle. Reaching speeds of 15-19 miles an hour(24-30 km an hour) is achievable by even beginning cyclists, while more experienced riders can reach speeds equivalent to automobile travel. 

&quot;Century riders&quot; travel 100 miles or more within a typical day. Not to be constrained by simple transportation, bicycles (stationary and otherwise) have helped people become healthier by losing excess weight and improving cardiovascular fitness. The exercise benefits of cycling are well known. Using the largest muscles in the body, bicycling allows riders to reach aerobic heart rates that drive up metabolism, and give a good workout. With the relative newcomer in the bicycle world, mountain bikes, this form of transportation is taking us on rugged terrain once thought impassable by anything other than hiking boots or pack animals. 

Extreme sport enthusiasts have adapted the bicycle to perform gravity defying stunts, such as flips and mid air acrobatics, in a style known as BMX (Bicycle Motocross). In short, bikes remain a popular way to get people between points A and B, whether those destinations are found on a map, from one state of health to another, or to explore the unknown.

Bicycles have become an important part of the landscape. Most people understand the saying, &quot;as easy as riding a bike.&quot; Or we understand that some dormant skill is easy to pick back up if it's &quot;just like riding a bike.&quot;  Likewise, many immediately think of bicycles when we make an allusion to &quot;coasting&quot;, &quot;picking up speed&quot;, or &quot;going downhill&quot;.

==''Wikibook'' Bicycles==
This wikibook will examine bicycles from various perspectives. The book aims to appeal to the complete beginner, the potential cyclist, and budding or seasoned bicycle mechanics. We will look at choosing the &quot;right bike&quot; for what you want. 

We will also examine the kind of gear you might want for your bike. Then we will see how to maintain and repair your investment. Unlike automobiles which require knowledge of the internal combustion engine, electrical systems, and a series of other intricate assemblies, bicycles are relatively easy to diagnose and (oftentimes) fix.  Many road riders include a small mechanic's kit that fixes many roadside mishaps. Likewise upgrading a bike is relatively pain free, with the exception of some more exotic parts. Many bikes can be upgraded by changing out a few key components such as brakes or shifters. Furthermore, many bicycles can be modified by the owner to better fit their cycling needs.

== New Page ==
I'm new to WikiBooks but I just created my first page on accidentals. I do not know if it fits the WikiBook format but I tried my best! 
-Sage Jim

==Purpose==
What is the intent of this wikibook? Is the Piano wikibook, as it is, aiming for a more informative angle - telling readers ''about'' the piano? If so, we wouldn't need chapters on improvisation and practice. 
I want the book to slant toward teaching readers how to actually play the instrument, eventually going into deeper music and complicated techniques. I don't think duplicating the 'structure of the piano' and 'how it works' is really necessary, because that's already on Pedia.
I'm new to Books, so I'd appreciate if someone could clean up the Pedal page I've started as well.
--[[User:Zen.|Zen]] 10:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
:Yeah, I would like it if this book teaches how to play it as well, just like the language wikibooks. --'''''&amp;nbsp;[[User:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:125%;color:#00CC00&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#AAAAAA&quot;&gt;YSON&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;1991&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;''''' 03:40, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

==Chords==
The chords are wrong. They all should be in same inversion, or otherwise it will be confusing for the beginners.

[[User:Masahiko|Masahiko]] 11:18, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

In Response:
Actually, the author is trying to show a simple chord progresson. This is one of the basic chord progressions. He/She is also showing that chords don't always have to be the same three notes in the same basic pattern. But I do agree with you Masahiko, this would be very confusing for beginners and the chords should be shown in their &quot;natural&quot; state and not in a inversion until the inversion has been taught and explained. 
--[[User:CherryT|CherryT]] 00:40, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

==Improv?==
How about chapters on basic and intermediate improvisation techniques, the pedals and pedaling techniques, stylistic concerns (like... not using pedal in baroque pieces). Maybe we could even include simple drills for learning chords and getting the hands comfortable on the keyboard? Fun ways to play with scales? Learning piece suggestions? I could make some basic animations, given time. But I think this book needs a lot of work. :)
--[[User:Akashayi|Akashayi]] 18:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

Great Ideas! I need to do something for them! I will begin to work now. But I will not do anything related to improvisation, because I am myself dull and boring in it.
[[User:Masahiko|Masahiko]] 20:59, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

Improvisation can be applied if some theory is known by using pentatonic scales. I think the scales section needs some work as well. you can introduce the dorian, frigian or locrian scales but i don't see the notes that you play for them. i would first explain the basic scales (major and minor) and then go onto intervals and making people see the relationship and importance of intervals for identifying scales and the construction of chords. Then I could move onto playing some chords and then we can come to augmented and diminished chords, adding &quot;blue notes&quot; to some of them and such. The problem is that piano usually is the basis for musical theory and you have to introduce it wether you like theory or not.

== Sections for deletion? ==

i was confused about the categorizing of some well constructed chapters as part of the new &quot;categories to be incorporated or deleted&quot;. The titles seem to be worthy of their own page and i could not find another article which would easily mesh with them. does anyone know why they were categorized like this?

== techniques and other sections? ==

I think improvisation could be on this book, although if this book aims at beginers we must introduce music theory as well. You really cannot play piano without the theory. If you have your hands on theory your improvisational skills will surely improve. You can also listen to recordings and learn from them if you can pick out the pieces by ear, or even better to see notes separately, use midi. I have introduced most concepts into the intervals chapter but if this is aimed to play for the beginer then I don't see why we need to explain chord progressions and other stuff. Piano is really difficult to understand at length because the diversity of styles and how broad the music theory is. Many atempt to learn piano and want to play like proffesional pianists such as Michael Camilo or the more famous classical pieces by mozzart. Unfrtunately many will be frustrated because of lack of practice and mostly patience. I think we could separate books by levels: Beginners, intermediate and advanced. I still strongly suggest the addition to music theory as it makes the piano more suitable for mostly everything. If you do have the talent to improvise naturally and mix theory along with your playing (like I do) you will eventually find out that theory can help you when you don't have things on mind to call for improvisation. Learning classical music first is a really good basis to develop finger dexterity and will really help you playing many styles, especially montunos. In fact, playing such styles can be considered as a language that has to be spoken, but mostly felt. That is why music theory can sound really boring to many but knowing some theory and having experience playing really does help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Habitat creation as a distinct ecological movement can be traced to the choice of the topic of 'Ecology and the Industrial Society' by the British Ecological Society for its fifth symposium, held at the University College of Wales, Swansea, on 13 - 16th April, 1964 (Goodman, Edwards and Lambert, 1965). It was a time in the 1960s when ecologists became aware of the contribution they could make to solve the special environmental problems created by urban and industrial living.  Academics were stepping tentatively out of their ivory towers into the real world.  Ecologists emerged into a decade when it had became clear on many fronts that the United Kingdom had passed through the 'industrial revolution phase' of economic development.  Unwanted side effects of the use of land and water for mass production had become obvious, such as the disposal of industrial and urban wastes, and had clearly brought about land dereliction on a scale and severity that was previously unknown. These impacts serious created large-scale problems of pollution, erosion, flooding, loss of wildlife, and unsightliness.

The organisers of the Swansea conference felt that ecologists had something important to offer in the recognition, analysis and solution of these problems.  In applying ecological thinking that was traditionally derived from investigating more &quot;natural&quot; communities, it is clear that ecologists can often forecast the likely outcome of a particular urban or industrial development on the local biological processes. This, in turn, may lead to ways of modifying further developments, and cleaning up past outcomes, so as to avoid any economically or aesthetically undesirable long-term side effects in the environment. It was recognised that although restoration of derelict land and polluted water was an important part of modern planning, applied ecology could produce new industrial operations aimed at solving the problems and at the same time create stable diverse habitats.

In his opening address, the botanist, A. R. Clapham, outlined the main theme of the conference as the solution of problems involved in shaping new ecosystems or restoring old ones. In other words it would involve the deliberate determination of a recipe for the correct floristic composition and structure as a starting point for producing a viable ecosystem.  This prescription had to meet a new objective for purposes other than agricultural.  In Clapham's view, these 'contrived ecosystems' would be needed more and more, as the principles of multi-purpose land-use become more widely understood and accepted, especially for recreation and amenity.  

The conference recognised that there would often be great difficulty in achieving a permanently satisfactory result, other than by prolonged trial-and-error, unless applied ecologists played a part in planning the operation and continued to give advice.   Otherwise there would be danger of a situation in which technological expertise might outstrip ecological understanding, or in which the technologist went ahead without prior consultation with the ecologist. What was needed for the future was a synthesis of an ecological technology, for which there would need to be some strategic preparation, and long-term conservation management systems.

Among the chief factors causing the formation of industrial wasteland are the production and disposal of industrial and domestic refuse and the creation of post-industrial barren land, such as unsightly heaps and pits by mining, and quarrying activities, and the sites of former factories and industrial infrastructure. 

Even in the 1960s, in many countries throughout the world, attempts were being made to prevent this misuse of land and, where it has happened, to reclaim it. Ecological studies had indicated that the absence of vegetation on this type of land was mainly due to either fresh disturbance by machines, or the detrimental effects of persistent site factors.  These factors were toxic ingredients, the unstable nature of the waste material, erosion, or air pollution.  Reclamation schemes were being undertaken in all European countries, from Hungary to the United Kingdom and also across the Atlantic Ocean, and in South Africa and Malaysia.  There was extensive forestation on American strip-mines; the Danish 'Desert Arboretum' was founded on lignite spoil banks, topsoil management was underway in Czechoslovakia, and there were rehabilitation schemes in UK county of Lancashire.   Some of the biggest projects involved forestation of colliery waste in the Ruhr basin, and the combination of mining, agriculture, and forestry to build up new land in the Rhineland. From these very beginnings, ecological principles and experimental evidence have been further developed to return wasteland to economic or recreational use.  The over riding objective was been the production of an ecosystem that restores a productive and visual amenity 

Since the 1960s ecology applied to habitat creation has been exended to intensive agricultural systems where it has encompassed meadows, ponds and wetlands.  The term ‘wilding’ has recently been given to large-scale projects to created contrived ecosystems on land previously used for agriculture or forestry. These schemes are taking place on a suck-it-and see approach with minimum interference except for controlling visitors. Wildings cannot replace primeval systems that have been lost through economic development, but they have the potential to act as more stable refuges for wildlife and offer the right scale for offering people spiritual and aesthetic contacts with ‘big nature’.  Most landscape architects regard ecological science as an important source of principles.  Planting native trees and shrubs on a housing or industrial estate is of more value than filling in with a collection of Japanese Cherries and ornamental-leafed Maples.  Applied ecology is also becoming a force in garden design, where urban gardeners are starting to care about what kind of an impact they have on the environment. For example, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection website advises gardeners to: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Use Native Plants: A built green landscape uses native vegetation that competes well with weeds and other pests. These plants are native to your region and climate. Emphasize plant diversity with a palette of plants that naturally grow together, are reseeding, and spread without much maintenance. This strengthens the ecology of your yard requiring less fertilizer and pest control. Native plants also attract more birds, butterflies and other wildlife.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since urban dwellers are now in the majority, the parks and gardens in towns and cities have major potential for increasing biodiversity, and what the town gardener decides to plant in a container or garden, is a very important factor in determining local biodiversity.  
 
The choice of Swansea for the Ecological Society's meeting in 1964 was significant in that a large area to the north, in the lower valley of the River Tawe, was one of the most extensive areas of industrial wasteland in Britain. Of about 300 ha of derelict land, around half was covered by almost bare waste-tips between 3-30 metres high.  These were composed of slags derived from ores after extraction for heavy metals.  A pioneer cross-disciplineary research project in the University, involving ecologists, microbiologists and conservators, had been investigating the area with a view to total rehabilitation.  These pioneer ecological studies have long since been applied to create a new, clean, and ecologically productive environment in the Tawe valley and have been duplicated in similar areas of industrial dereliction elsewhere. By and large knowledge and experience has been directed towards the following four approaches:

# Accepting the site conditions as they are after the wasteland has been left by industry, and planting the area with pioneer plants of low requirements.
# Changing infertile or polluted sites by re-shaping the contours and by adding soil amendments before or after planting.
# Planning the future land use before displacing the waste, and following this by restoring fertility to the site to a state that may easily become productive once more.
# Allowing former farmland and plantation forest develop as large contrived ‘wildings’, gathering information on the processes involved through surveillance with minimum habitat management.

The first three approaches are bound up with the flows of industrial and domestic waste through the human food chain.  All wastes are now a significant part of the planetary system.  Ecological knowledge is required for application at all levels of their disposal, from finding sites, coping with mining wastes, hazardous wastes, air pollution, water pollution, pesticides, waste heat, radioactive wastes, and coping with the greenhouse effect and breaks in the ozone layer. Sound scientific knowledge is required not only to minimise undesirable effects but also to get an accurate and balanced picture of threats and future risks.

The Human Head – a reference for 3D artists by Ron Lemen. This is not really a subdivision modeling tutorial but a drawing tutorial. But it will help teach you the proper proportions and shapes needed for modeling a head. Link: http://www.anticz.com/heads.htm

3D Animation Workshop by Robert Polevoi – An excellent series of lessons on all things 3D. The topics range from general 3D concepts to application specific techniques. Lessons 51, 52, and 53 deal with subdivision modeling with Nendo®, but take the time to read some of the earlier lessons (1 – 23) to get a grasp on 3D concepts in general. The VRML lessons are very good (Lessons 27 – 32 and 40 – 45). Lessons 101 – 104 take you through human character modeling, albeit via 3D Max, but they are useful. Unfortunately Mr. Polevoi is no longer producing this series, but it is still valuable reading. Link: http://www.webreference.com/3d/indexa.html

Subdivision Modeling Resource Page by Tamas Varga. It is Mirai centric but there are good discussions on topics fairly universal to subdivision modeling such as the concept of Edge Loops. Link: http://maxrovat.sns.hu/subdiv/

Subdivision Surface Modeling 101 by Erik Asorson, is a 3D Max web page but many of the concepts transfer nicely to other applications as well. Link: http://web.archive.org/20020214125643/www.geocities.com/fyer_starter/tut_1subd.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Current state of the book==

This wikibook project is in its first stage, which is to decide the chapters to be included and summarise what they should contain.  At the present time, editorial effort is directed towards the writing of introductions to each chapter. This is also a process of selecting the main subsections for each chapter.  These will eventually appear as ‘pages’ indented in the table of contents.  

Contributors are reminded that it is a textbook to provide an up to date review of important areas of applied ecological knowledge for advanced level university students and site managers.

==Definition==
Applied ecology is a framework  for the application of knowledge about ecosystems so that actions can be taken to create a better balance and harmony between people and nature in order to reduce human impact on other beings and their habitats.

==Scope==

===In situ and ex situ conservation systems===

With respect to scope, it is intended that the book should contain a body of knowledge about the use of ecological theory and principles to solve problems associated with the intensive human use of the environment.  It is beyond our capacity to return Earth to a primeval state, but what we can do is build a technological ‘ark’ to retain as much ecological integrity as possible. To achieve this, many aspects of ecology have to be applied to manage conservation systems where the maintenance, restoration, and creation of diverse and healthy ecosystems are principal objectives.  

Some conservation systems may be broadly classified as in situ operations.  These include:

*protection of rare species and habitats;
*restoration of industrial wasteland and the mitigative creation of new ecosystems;
*using wetland ecosystems for treating wastewater;
*environmental valuation in relation to the needs for conservation and development to go hand in hand;
*integration of sustainable ecosystems with commercial enterprises, such as agriculture and nature tourism;
* study of the ecology of human diseases in relation to their control.  

Other kinds of conservation systems are classified as ex situ. These include operations in zoos, botanical gardens, museums, and germ plasm stores.  The objectives are to provide breeding populations of plants and animals for reintroductions, and maintain a classified biodiversity inventory of specimens and genetic resources.

===Conservation management===

These conservation systems all overlap with each other, but they broadly define topics that most people would recognise as covering distinct applications of management practices to ecosystems, where the outcomes benefit humankind.  Each one could be developed as a chapter of this book, but it is important to think hard before initiating a new chapter, because its principles may fall into an existing one. The unifying principle that brings the topics together is that they all centre on the management of species and habitats. A common objective is long-term sustainability, and it is in this sense that the planning and operation of conservation management systems is the practical point of focus.

===The endangered resources===

In 1974 Norman Myers estimated the annual loss of tropical ecosystems to be about 240,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This was the outcome of commercial timber extraction, farming operations and fuel gathering; a combination of economic objectives and the subsistence behaviour of native peoples.  Biodiversity represents the very foundation of human existence.  Besides its profound ethical and aesthetic implications, a loss of biodiversity has serious economic and social costs.  As an essential resource, future changes should be tracked through the collection and dissemination of scientific knowledge on a global scale.  It was in this spirit that UNEP commissioned the Global Biodiversity Assessment (GBA) project, which reported in 1995 as a first step to assemble an inventory of Earth’s endangered biological resources.

===New societies and cultures===

The application of ecological principles and knowledge to environmental issues of world development is changing the way societies value natural resources.  This new understanding is having a cultural impact through changes in the behaviour of governments, communities and families.  This is mainly the result of a combination of publicity and legislation.  For example, in 1977 the Countryside Commission for England and Wales organised a national campaign to persuade farmers to enhance the wildlife and scenic value of agricultural land.  Although this particular campaign did not halt the destructive ecological outcomes of intensive agriculture, it marked the beginning of a process of change in agrarian culture.  This is now obvious throughout Britain, largely because of a shift in the system of farm subsidies away from production towards the creation of environmental goods.  

Education is another important factor in creating a culture of sustainable development. This requires the promotion of a knowledge system linking culture and ecology.  The aim is to present economic development alongside the work of organisations in society that are promoting the conservation of natural resources.

� Section 8: Plug ins WINGS3D USER MANUAL 8.7 Books 3D Modeling and Surfacing by Bill Fleming, © 1999 by Academic Press; 340 pp. This is the best general introduction to 3D Modeling I have found. Over half the book is dedicated to principles of polygon modeling in one form or another, plus he explains NURBS based modeling, and the principles that deal with texturing. This is not a tutorial, it is a general discussion of principals and practices. Well worth while.

Principles of Three-Dimensional Computer Animation by Michael O'Rourke, © 1998 by Michael O'Rourke; 285 pp. I found the modeling portion of this book to be too elementary to be of much use, but am finding the sections on Rendering and Animation very informative since I have little background in those areas. He explains the theories behind lighting, texturing, atmospheric effects, keyframing, and inverse kinematics among other things. It reads much more like a text book than I would like, but it is very informative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">YafRay is an external ray-trace renderer you can download from;

http://www.yafray.org

There is an article about Wings/YafRay integration on the YafRay wiki which you can access here: 

http://wiki.yafray.org/bin/view.pl/UserDoc/Wings3DMihnea

Follow the directions to install it to your hard drive. Once installed you will need to add it’s location to your path. The path is a list of locations that will be searched for software.

WINDOWS

In windows 98 you edit your autoexec.bat. in it you will see a line that reads something like Path=C:\; C:\windows; C:\windows\system; etc… At the end of this list of locations add a semicolon, a space and c:\yafray

When you restart your machine it will be added to the paths.

Windows 2000/Windows XP uses the same convention but in a different place. you right click on My Computer Click the advanced tab. Then click on the variables button. Here you will find two windows with various settings. Look in the lower one labeled System Variables. You should see a variable named path. Double-click it and it will open a property panel to change it. Add ; C:\yafray to the end of the list of paths (only use one ; between each path) If no Path variable is there add it by clicking the New button under system Variables.

Variable Name is Path Value is C:\yafray . A YafRay plug-in comes with Wings3D, when Wings3D starts the plug-in looks to see if the YafRay software is installed. If Wings3D can find YafRay in the path then it will add it as a render choice as shown in the image above.

Also, if Wings3D finds YafRay as noted above, you can go to the Wings '''''Edit menu -&gt; Plug-in Preferences''''' and '''''YafRay''''' will appear as an option.

Selecting the YafRay Plug-in Preferences menu results in the following dialogue box:

[[Image:Wings3D YafRay prefs.png]]

Dialogue dropdown list: ''later''

Executable: This should be where YafRay is installed on your system. If it is not correct, use the ''Browse'' button to navigate to it's actual location.

Options: This is where you can enter additional command line options for Wings3D to feed the YafRay command line renderer. They are as follows:
        -s Render using the specified strategy.  Valid values are
                &quot;threaded&quot;: Multi-threaded (default)
                &quot;mono&quot;: Single process
                &quot;fork&quot;: Multi-process

        -c N    Number of threads/processes to use
        -z      Use Net optimized

        -p PATH YafRay's installation path

        -r min_x:max_x:min_y:max_y      Render region, values between -1 and 1
                                        whole image is -r -1:1:-1:1

        -v      YafRay Version

In the above image you can see the ''-c'' option is set to the value of ''2''
This will cause the YafRay renderer to use both processors of a dual CPU system or both &quot;sides&quot; of an Intel HyperThreaded (HT) processor.

Be warned, however. Do NOT use this option unless you want to surrender any further use of the computer while it's rendering. Using this option will peg both processes to 100% CPU utilization while rendering, so forget about doing anything else while rendering. It's useful for speeding up quick previews, or for speeding up those long &quot;set it &amp; forget it&quot; renders, but if you want to get caught up on your e-mail or surf the 'net while rendering, stick with the default setting (put nothing in the &quot;Options&quot; field or the YafRay Options dialogue box).

The ''-p'', and ''-r'' options are set by Wings3D's YafRay render dialogue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus The key to the Wings3D user interface is the use of context sensitive pop-up menus. These menus are accessed by right clicking in the workspace. There are a total of five context sensitive menus; the Primitives Menu, the Vertex Menu, the Edge Menu, the Face Menu and the Object Menu, not to be confused with the Objects Menu on the Main

Menu). Depending on what is selected, different menus will pop up presenting the user with operations that are applicable to the current situation only. In this way the interface is kept clean and simple, a joy to work with compared to many overly complex user interfaces found in some graphics and modeling packages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">5.2.1 The Primitives Menu Primitives Menu – General

Figure 45: The Primitives pop-up menu. To bring up the Primitives Menu, right click on the empty workspace, or on a workspace where nothing is selected. You will be presented with a list of available primitives to add to your workspace. Left click on one of the primitives to add it. It will be added to the center of the scene as an unselected object at it's default size. You may need to turn other objects' visibility off (via the Objects Menu) in order to find the newly added object. The complete list of standard primitives is given below. Notice that some primitives have a little box icon to the right of their name. This is the Options Box for that primitive. If you click on the primitive name you will add a default primitive, whereas, if you click on the options icon you will be presented with some options (number of sections, number of slices, etc.) that you can change.

Tetrahedron – a four sided object; a triangular pyramid. Octrahedron – an eight sided object. Octotoad – A twenty-six sided object, unique to Wings. Designed by Mike (roadtoad), the host of the Wings discussion forum, and added to the Wings primitives as a tribute to the great service this board provided in the further development of Wings3D. Dodecahedron – a solid object with twelve faces. Icosahedron – a solid object with twenty faces. Cube – Plain and simple. What most models start out as. Cylinder – Click on the options button (the little box on the right) for the Sections option. A Windows dialog box will come up showing the number of sections in the cylinder (16 by default). You may change this and then click OK, or click Cancel. If you do not click on the options button, but simply click on the name Cylinder, then a default cylinder will be added (with 16 sides). Cone – Sections (16 by default). Sphere – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default). Torus – Sections (16 by default) and Slices (8 by default).

DRAFT 1.6 69

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Grid – Rows/Cols (10 by default). There is only one variable, so you must have the same number of rows and columns in your grid. After it is added you can change this by Dissolving some of the edges or by Connecting some of the edges to suite your needs. The default thickness of the grid is

0.2 units. Light – Adds a light to the scene. Wings supports four types of lights; Infinite, Point, Spot, and Ambient. Infinite lights act much as the sun, so that the light rays are essentially parallel as they pass equally throughout the workspace in the same direction. A point light is like a light bulb, radiating light equally in all directions from it's source. A spotlight casts light in a cone shape, in a general direction but spreading out so that the rays are not parallel. Finally, ambient light is the general background light present everywhere. It has no locational source nor direction. Since ambient light is everywhere from all directions it can cause your model to look completely flat if used by itself. So always use ambient lights in conjunction with other light sources.4 Lights in Wings are further explained in the Help Menu under Light Basics. Light parameters are adjusted by selecting a light and then right clicking to bring up the Light Operations Menu. Image – The Image Primitive is simply a plane that has an image pasted on it. The image can be a BMP, TIFF, or Targa file all of which must be 24 bits deep. Simply select Image, then select the type of image from the sub-menu, then navigate to the image file you want to use. Be aware that Wings works with images sized by powers of 2 (1024x1024 or 64x128 for example). This does not mean that Wings will not load your image if it is not so sized, but it will pad it to be powers of two prior to displaying it. This should be transparent to the user. Once you load the image a plane will appear centered on the screen standing up vertical on the Z axis. You can use this as a reference plane to assist you in your modeling. You can use two Image primitives to perform a modeling technique know as Rotoscoping, where one 4Principles of Three-Dimensional Computer Animation, Revised Edition; Michael O'Rourke; W.W. Norton &amp; Company, © 1998; pp. 89-92.

image is from the front and the other from the side of a given subject. You can then arrange the image planes into an L shape and use Orthogonal views to sculpt your model to fit the images. Text – Adds a text string as a 3D object. If you click on the box to the right of Text you will get a pop-up options box. Here you can enter your text string, the name of any TrueType font you have on your system, the directory where the font resides (C:\windows\fonts for example) and the number of edge bisections to make. The more bisections you make, the more complex the model will be. I recommend you leave it set to zero at least for starters. OK will create the text as a fully 3D model in your workspace. Cancel will abort the operation. MORE – This brings up a sub-menu of additional primitives available in Wings.

Torus Knot – Originally a plug-in by Anthony D'Agostino (scorpius) it is now included as part of the standard Wings distribution. This simple plug-in creates a torus knot with the absolute minimum possible number of faces and vertices. It is meant to be used as an input &quot;cage&quot; for the Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm. The knot was created with Blender by extruding a Bezier circle along the path of a NURBS curve.

Spiral – Loops (2 by default), segments (16 by default), Sections (8 by default). You can change the number of Loops, Segments and Sections by clicking on the Options Box on the right side of the menu.

Spring – Loops (2 by default), segments (16 by default), Sections (8 by default). You can change the number of Loops by clicking on the Options Box to the right.

UV Torus – A more sophisticated version of the torus. Here you can specify the U Resolution (80 by default), the V Resolution (16 by default), the Major Radius

(1.0 by default) and the Minor Radius (0.2 by default) by clicking on the box on the right of the menu. Lumpy Torus – A variant of the UV Torus that adds two more parameters; Lumps (8 by default) and Lump Amplitude (0.5).

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL 5.2.3 The Edge Operations Menu Edge Operations Menu – General

If one or more edges are selected, right

Figure 50: The Edge Menu. clicking in the workspace will bring up the Edge

Context Sensitive Menu. This will allow you to perform operations unique to edge manipulations.

EDGE MENU | MOVE

Normal – moves the selected edge/edges along their normal.

Free – Will move the selected edge/edges in the direction of mouse movement. This can be very useful when in Orthographic mode, since it allows you to use the mouse to move edges in two cardinal directions while &quot;locking&quot; out movement in the third.

X – constrains movement along the x axis.

Y – constrains movement along the y axis.

Z – constrains movement along the z axis.

EDGE MENU | ROTATE

Connected edges will rotate about their collective center of mass. Non-connected edges will rotate about their individual centers of mass.

Free – Will rotate the selected edge/edges in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains rotation about the x axis.

Y – constrains rotation about the y axis.

Z – constrains rotation about the z axis.

EDGE MENU | SCALE

Increases or decreases the length of the selected edges.

Uniform – Scales the selected edges uniformly in all three directions at once.

X – Scales the distance of the edges along the x axis.

Y – Scales the distance of the edges along the y axis.

Z – Scales the distance of the edges along the z axis.

Radial X (YZ) – Scales the length of selected edges radially from the x axis; i.e. The distances in y and z are effected while x remains constant.

Radial Y (XZ) – Scales the length of selected edges radially from the y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the length of selected edges radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.

EDGE MENU | EXTRUDE

As with vertex extrusions you can use the plus and minus (+ -) keys to increase or decrease the base area of the extrusion.

78 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus Normal – extrudes the selected edge or edges along their normal(s).

Free – Will extrude the selected edge/edges in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

Y – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

Z – constrains the extrusion along the z axis. When you extrude an edge, new faces are created to connect the line to the main body of the object it is being extruded from. That is to say, the result will have thickness, you cannot create a &quot;sheet&quot; that protrudes from the object.

EDGE MENU | CUT

2 – one edge is cut into two edges.

3 – one edge is cut into three edges.

4 – one edge is cut into four edges.

5 – one edge is cut into five edges.

10 – one edge is cut into ten edges. Cuts the selected edge(s) into the number of equally sized segments as specified by the number chosen from the side bar menu. Note that the number keys on the main keyboard can be used in lieu of the Cut command. The keys allow for an edge to be cut into 2 – 10 (0 being 10) segments by the simple press of a key.

EDGE MENU | CONNECT C

New edges are created that connect the selected edges together. Multiple edges can be connected at a time.

EDGE MENU | BEVEL

Creates a bevel, or chamfer, on selected edges. If used on an edge in the middle of a flat face, Bevel will open up a new face within the original face, on the same plane. Bevels interact with one another, so that if you have adjacent edges selected and then Bevel them, the new chamfered edges will join properly. Many renderers do not work well with large flat straight edged surfaces, causing artifacts to show up in textures and cast shadows. These side effects can be reduced, or even completely eliminated, if you apply a very slight bevel to all such harsh edges. Slight bevels will also help maintain

the objects shape when you subdivide the object with the Smooth command.

EDGE MENU | DISSOLVE (Bksp) Dissolve can be used to eliminate unwanted edges to refine your model or in preparation for other commands. Be careful in the use of Dissolve, for it can destroy the topological relationships between elements (and thus the model) very easily.

Quick Tip: Creating round eyes from square holes.

You can create roundish eyes from the results of a Vertex | Bevel by using a combination of Edge | Dissolve and Face | Smooth commands. To demonstrate this, create a cube and connect the left and right edges of one of its sides. Then Connect the three horizontal edges of that side to form a square cross intersection in the middle of the face. Select the vertex of the intersection and Bevel it to form a diamond shape in the middle of the face. With the face selected do a Smooth. Now select the four edges within the smoothed area and Dissolve them. You now have a roundish single face in the middle of the cube from which you can now extrude and scale several times to create an eye.

EDGE MENU | COLLAPSE

Collapse will eliminate an edge by snapping the vertices on each end together. This is the same effect of Weld Vertices found in many modeling programs. It can be used very effectively in conjunction with Select | By | Short Edges to remove microscopic edges that are interfering with your modeling.

EDGE MENU | HARDNESS

Hard

Soft Edges can be Hard or Soft. They are soft by default. Hard edges are not moved when a model is smoothed, and therefore are handy for maintaining sharp edges where they are needed in a model to maintain overall shape. To make an edge hard, select it then from the Edge Menu choose Hard. To set it back to soft, choose Soft. If you have a lot of edges you want to make Hard, you can use the Object Menu | Auto Smooth which sets

DRAFT 1.6 79

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL all edges at sharp angles to hard, then use the Edge Menu | Soft to set selected edges back to soft.

Quick Tip: Replace your hard edges with bevels.

Not all renderers or other modeling programs can handle hard edges. Therefore it is generally agreed that they should not be used, especially in the final model. But that does not mean that they can not be used effectively during the modeling process. It is sometimes useful to set some edges as hard to hold the local form on a given area of a model and the do a Smooth. You can then continue to work the model. Once you are done, do a Select By | Hard Edges and then apply a slight Bevel. If you find that your bevels do not hold the form true after a sample smooth it probably indicates an area of the model in need of more geometry. Try adding some additional edges near the bevels and do another test smooth. Now the bevels should hold the form of the model true while eliminating the hard edges from the final model.

EDGE MENU | LOOP CUT

This is one of the most important commands in Wings. If you have a complete edge loop that closes on itself you can cut the model in two with Loop Cut. For example, if you have an edge loop that completely encircles the

arm at the shoulder, you can select that edge loop, and do a Loop Cut to sever the arm from the model. Then you can work with both parts independent of one another or even save one part out as a separate model. This can also be useful in symmetrical modeling. If you create your rough model with a clean central edge loop, you can develop detail on one side of the model, then periodically Loop Cut the model, delete the non detailed side, and then Mirror the detailed side to quickly duplicate all the detail from one side to the other. This can be a great time saver.

EDGE MENU | TURN

This command is intended to be used on models that have been triangulated. It can easily destroy models made of quads, so be careful when and how you use it. Some programs, such as game engines, expect models to be composed entirely of triangles. But the overall shape of a model can be determined by how those triangles are laid out. Turn lets you create a better flow for the edges so that you can fine tune triangulated models.

EDGE MENU | OPTIMIZED TURN

Optimized Turn will triangulate your model by finding the shortest edges possible to create the triangles.

If one or more faces are selected, right clicking in the workspace will bring up the Face

Operations Menu. This will allow you to perform functions unique to face manipulations.

FACE MENU | MOVE

Normal – moves the selected face or faces along their normal(s).

Free – Will move the selected faces in the direction of mouse movement. This can be very useful when in Orthographic mode, since it allows you to use the mouse

to move faces in two cardinal directions while &quot;locking&quot; out movement in the third.

X – constrains movement along the x axis.

Y – constrains movement along the y axis.

Z – constrains movement along the z axis.

FACE MENU | ROTATE

Connected faces (Regions) will rotate about

their collective center of mass. Non connected faces will rotate about their individual centers of mass.

Free – Will rotate the selected faces in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains rotation about the x axis.

Y – constrains rotation about the y axis.

Z – constrains rotation about the z axis.

FACE MENU | SCALE

Uniform – Scales the face uniformly in all directions at once.

X – Scales the face in the x axis.

Y – Scales the face in the y axis.

Z – Scales the face in the z axis.

Radial X (YZ) – Scales the face radially from the x axis; i.e. The distances in y and z are effected while x remains constant.

Radial Y (XZ) – Scales the face radially from the y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the face radially from the z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.

FACE MENU | EXTRUDE

Normal – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s). By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils.

Free – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

DRAFT 1.6 81

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Y – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

Z – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.

FACE MENU | Extrude Region

Normal – extrudes the selected face(s) along their normal(s) as a unit. By extruding in the negative normal direction you can create indentations into the body of the object, such as a mouth or nostrils. By using Extrude Region on a group of faces rather than simply using Extrude, you keep the faces joined together into one coherent surface, which is often preferable to having distinct stems &quot;growing&quot; out of the object.

Free – will extrude the selected face(s) in the direction of mouse movement.

X – constrains the extrusion along the x axis.

Y – constrains the extrusion along the y axis.

Z – constrains the extrusion along the z axis.

FACE MENU | EXTRACT REGION

Normal – extract faces and then move the faces along the regions normal.

Free – extract faces and then move faces freely in all directions.

X – extract faces and then move them along the X axis.

Y – extract faces and then move them along the Y axis.

Z – extract faces and then move them along the Z axis. Extracts a region, or group of faces, from the parent object to create a completely new object. Note that the faces do not have to be contiguous. To create a new object that abuts the original object do an Extract Region and immediately left click without moving the mouse, to lock it in place. You probably will not be able to successfully select the new object due to the underlying original and may have to use the Hide function in the Object enu to hide the parent object so that you can work with the new object. If you have created a new object from non abutting faces and want to work with them as separate objects, then use the Separate command to break them into their component parts.

FACE MENU | FLATTEN

Normal

X

Y

Z

Last Axis

Default Axis

Region Sometimes faces can become non-planar as you work with your model, especially if you Move vertices. This can cause problems latter. One way to fix a non-planar face is to Flatten it, i.e., get all of its vertices onto the same plane. Smoothing the model will also create planar faces, but if you do not want to smooth your model, you can Flatten offending faces. It is also good for setting up geometry for further manipulation, so that extrusions go in the direction you want them to go, for example.

If you have a default axis defined (see Tools | Set Default Axis) you can flatten to that axis or you can flatten to the last axis used. Flatten Region will flatten the edge loop, the boundary between selected and non-selected faces, of the selected faces. Note that the vertices on the edge loop become planar, not the faces contained therein.

FACE MENU | INSET

This creates a new face, of the same shape, inside the selected face. It works on one or more faces at a time, creating a new face for each of the selected faces. This could be used, for example, to create a picture inside a picture frame. The inner face could then be extruded in the negative direction to cause the frame to stand out. You can also Inset and make the new face larger than the original face. See the Dog House Tutorial in Section 3 of this manual for an example of this in action.

FACE MENU | INTRUDE

You can make some very cool models very quickly with the intrude function. It is especially handy for making lattice work type of objects, such as the Eiffel Tower or a bird cage. It works by creating an inverted copy of the entire object, then doing a Bridge on all pairs of selected faces. The thickness of the walls is controlled by how far you move the

82 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus mouse during the operation. The Dog House tutorial in this manual demonstrates the Intrude function quite nicely.

FACE MENU | BEVEL

Bevels all the edges of the selected face or faces simultaneously, thus creating a smaller selected face and small surrounding faces.

FACE MENU | BRIDGE

Causes two co-planer or nearly co-planar faces to snap together, thus fusing new geometry between them. Only two faces can be selected at a time for Bridge. The faces must have the exact same number of edges and vertices but can be shaped differently. This can be used to attach one object to another, one part of the same object to another part of the same object, or to create holes in an object if the selected faces are on opposite sides of the object.

FACE MENU | BUMP

Moves selected faces out along their normals while at the same time creating new faces that meld into the existing geometry via newly beveled faces that are created. This is great for building up muscle tone on a model.

FACE | LIFT

The Lift Command is only available if Advanced Menus are activated. Therefore, Lift will be discussed in the Advanced Menus section.

FACE | PUT ON

The Put On command allows you to drop one object onto another, much like dropping a box to the ground. Select the face you want to put onto another object then select Put On from the Face Menu. The Icon Bar will change to show you that you can select a vertex, edge or face to put the object on. Select the vertex, edge, or face you want and then Right Click to execute. The first object will jump into place right on the vertex, edge, or face you selected on the second object. This can be very useful when you go to weld parts together with the Bridge command.

Quick Tip – Put On and Bridge

To perform a bridge-like function at the same time, select both faces prior to Put On and Store | Selection. Use Put On, then Recall | Selection, Bridge, Cleanup, etc. This is quite quick, especially if on hot keys.

Tip provided by puzzeled paul.

FACE MENU | MIRROR

Mirrors an object around one or more selected faces. By choosing multiple faces to perform Mirror multiple mirrors are performed simultaneously in the direction each face points. Thus care must be exercised on complex models least self colliding geometry be created. The Mirror command is most effective for doing symmetrical modeling, wherein only half of a model is built, then a mid model face is selected and Mirror used to create the other half of the model. If you maintain a clean central edge loop while modeling you can model, Mirror, continue to model, select the middle edge loop and do a Loop Cut, Delete the half of the model that needs to be updated, and then Mirror again.

Quick Tip: Fix that mirror plane.

If you use the Loop Cut, model, and Mirror method described above you will sometimes find that the object does not Mirror back together properly. This is often caused by the mirror face getting out of kilter i.e. non- planar, while modeling. Mirroring in such cases will cause a real mess. To fix it up, select the mirror face and do a Flatten on the appropriate axis to make it planar again. Then do the Mirror to make a whole object from the half. Finally, select Tools | Center All to get the whole thing re-centered in the workspace.

FACE MENU | DISSOLVE (Bksp) Deletes inner faces in a region of faces. You can also slice an object into several parts with the Dissolve command by selecting the faces that would separate the parts and doing a Dissolve. The parts will still be grouped as one object until you use the Separate command (in Object selection mode) to separate them.

DRAFT 1.6 83

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL FACE MENU | COLLAPSE

Deletes the selected faces, replacing each face with a vertex. The selection mode will be changed to Vertex, and the newly created vertices will be selected, allowing you to apply further commands.

FACE MENU | SMOOTH (S) Connects all the edges of a face and tightens up the vertices so as to form a smoother shape from the original face. You can make round eyes from square faces with Smooth.

Quick Tip: Smooth To Check For Anomalies.

To check for self colliding 'internal' geometry smooth once and eyeball in wireframe mode, as it won't usually be obvious as an unsmoothed wireframe.

Tip provided by puzzeled paul.

FACE MENU | SET MATERIAL

New – Will prompt you for a Material Name in a pop-up dialog. Type in a new name of your choice and click OK. This will bring up the Material Editor as pictured here.

Here you can custom design a material to be applied to the selected face by setting the properties Diffuse, Ambient, Specular, Emission, Shininess, and Opacity. The ball on the left will show a preview of your material design and starts out as a neutral gray. To change any of the first four settings simply click on the box to bring up a color mixer. In the color mixer you can type in the RGB values in the fields on the left or use the slider bars to

interactively mix the color. Once satisfied, click on OK. The ball on the left will immediately change to reflect your settings. Click OK again when you have finished adjusting all the settings to your liking. The new material will be added to the list of materials along with Default and Hole, with the name that you gave it. This new material can then be applied to any face selection you choose with the Face | Set Material command. The materials are saved with the model. In order to see it properly you will need to look at your model as Smooth Shaded, which you can do by pressing the Tab key. Note that a File | New will purge the materials list.

Default – will set the selected faces to the Default material color.

Hole – will set the selected faces to the Hole material color.

FACE | TESSELATE

Triangulate – Will convert all the polygons in the selected faces to triangles. Some programs, such as game engines, expect models to be triangulated before import.

Quadrangulate – Will fix n-gon faces by converting them to quads whenever possible or to triangles if necessary. An ngon is a polygon with more than four edges. These are generally considered bad things to have in your model. This is often useful following a Face | Smooth since that type of smooth operation can result in adjoining ngon faces.

Figure 52: The Wings Material Editor. Materials are assigned to faces, and therefore initially defined with the Material Editor accessed under the Face Menu. They can later be edited via the Material Editor accessed under the Edit Menu. 84 DRAFT 1.6

Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus&lt;br&gt; 
5.2.2 The Vertex Operations Menu –


Figure 46: The Vertex Operations pop-up menu.

'''General'''

If one or more vertices are selected, right clicking in the workspace will display the Vertex Operations Menu. Some of these operations are unique to Vertex selection mode and all operations are referenced to a single common datum.&lt;br&gt;(Compare rotating several isolated faces with rotating any type of vert selection.)


Enabling Advanced Mode (via Edit | Prefs.) provides the following additional features over the basic menu.

Magnet operations for supported commands (use Alt (+ any mouse button) to access magnets in the default Mirai camera mode)&lt;br&gt;
Greater functionality (specifying custom vectors / axes and origins) for all major commands.&lt;br&gt;
3 completely new commands:&lt;br&gt;
Bend&lt;br&gt;
Bend Clamped&lt;br&gt;
Shift


The underlying common feature which provides the extra functionality is that of 'secondary selections' - which allows the user to specify many 'custom actions' similar to the following examples:

Modify geometry as if with a 'magnet', to obtain smooth transformations.&lt;br&gt;
Moving in a direction that isn't parallel to the XYZ axes.&lt;br&gt;
Rotating around an axis that isn't parallel to the XYZ axes - and also to have that rotate axis pass through a particular point. (eg Having a door rotate around its correct hinge axis, rather than through the middle of the door)&lt;br&gt;
Scaling from a specified point (origin) rather than the default one that wings works out, based on the selected geometry.&lt;br&gt;
Specifying a particular location for a Flatten plane to pass through&lt;br&gt;


A typical workflow using secondary selections for a basic vector move might be -

Select geometry to be altered (some verts on a sphere, say)&lt;br&gt;
R - Clk to display menu (note new options on the lower info line, which weren't present for 'basic' menu mode).&lt;br&gt;
R - Clk to choose the 'Pick axis to move along' option.&lt;br&gt;
L - Clk on any edge to specify the move direction - note how wings displays a blue arrow, confirming this.&lt;br&gt;
R - Clk to execute the operation, drag as required.&lt;br&gt;
L - Clk to complete the move, once the object is where you want it to be.&lt;br&gt;

In the above example, the 'secondary' selection is the one done to specify the direction of movement, ie selecting the edge, whilst the 'primary' selection is that of choosing the geometry to be modified.

Wings will also let you use very complex selections when defining / specifying parameters for secondary purposes.




 





VERTEX MENU | MOVE

Normal – moves the selected vertex/vertices along their normal. A normal is a vector (line of direction) that runs out perpendicular to the reference element (applying View | Show Normals will display them if needed)

Free – Will move the selected vertex(es) in the direction of mouse movement.
Since all movement takes place on planes that are parallel to the monitor screen, some care is needed to avoid problems when used in a general 'tumbled' view.
This command is especially useful when used in conjunction with View | X,Y or Z, as it allows the user to keep moved vertexes on the 2D axial planes associated with the relevant viewing direction.
If working with background reference images, Ortho should also be used (with View | XYZ) to eliminate perspective distortion issues.

X – Movement is parallel to the X axis.

Y – Movement is parallel to the Y axis.

Z – Movement is parallel to the Z axis.


VERTEX MENU | ROTATE – Vertices will rotate about a single center for the entire selected set whether or not they are adjacent.&lt;br&gt; 
Note that this works fundamentally differently than how faces or edges rotate. At least two vertices must be selected for this to have any effect at all.

Free – Will rotate the selected vertices in the direction of mouse movement.

X – Rotation is around an axis parallel to the X axis.

Y – Rotation is around an axis parallel to the Y axis.

Z – Rotation is around an axis parallel to the Z axis.



VERTEX MENU | SCALE - Scales the dimension between each vertex and a common reference in accordance with the chosen option.&lt;br&gt;
The nature of the common reference used depends on the scale option chosen but is always located where Scale = 0%.&lt;br&gt;
Uniform - is a single point (selection center)&lt;br&gt;
Axis - is a plane (perpendicular to chosen axis) passing through the selection center.&lt;br&gt;
Radial - is a line (parallel to chosen axis) passing through the selection center.

Requires two or more vertices to have any effect.

Uniform – Scales the distance between each vertex and the selection center.

X – Scales the distance along the X axis between each vertex and the reference plane.

Y – Scales the distance along the Y axis between each vertex and the reference plane.

Z – Scales the distance along the Z axis between each vertex and the reference plane.

Radial X (YZ) – Scales the distance between the vertices radially from their local geometric x axis; i.e. The distances in y and z are affected while x remains constant.

Radial Y (XZ) – Scales the distance between the vertices radially from their local geometric y axis so that the y dimension remains constant.

Radial Z (XY) – Scales the distance between the vertices radially from their local geometric z axis; so that the z dimension remains constant.



Section 5.2 6&lt;br&gt;
The Context Sensitive Menus

VERTEX MENU | EXTRUDE

Can be performed on one or more vertices. During the extrusion process you can use the plus and minus (+ -) keys to change the size of the extruded spike's base.

Normal – a &quot;spike&quot; type feature is extruded from each selected vertex along the vertex normals, thus creating new faces.

Free – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created in the direction of mouse movement.

X – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created along the X axis.

Y – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created along the Y axis.

Z – the &quot;spikes&quot; are created along the Z axis.




VERTEX MENU | FLATTEN

Requires two or more vertices to have any effect.&lt;br&gt;
All selected verticies are moved parallel to the specified axis until they all lie on a single common axial plane, appropriate to the axis option chosen. By default, wings computes the position of this common plane but using advanced menus allows the user to specify a particular location for this plane to pass through (use RMB option).

Flatten and Scale | Axis &gt; 0% produce the same results. 

X – Flattens the selected vertices by averaging their position in the X direction. This has the effect of aligning selected vertices in the X plane.

Y – Flattens the selected vertices by averaging their position in the Y direction.

Z – Flattens the selected vertices by averaging their position in the Z direction.




VERTEX MENU | CONNECT (C)

Connects selected vertices with edges if they have a common face, or if the faces between vertices is contiguous. More than one set of connects can be performed at a time. Some applications require triangles, rather than quads on import. You can convert your Wings quads to triangles very simply by selecting the Body, then pressing V to switch to vertex mode. All vertices on the model will then be selected. Then just do a Connect, and all the quads will be turned into triangles.

VERTEX MENU | TIGHTEN

Tighten deserves a bit of explanation as it is not immediately obvious just what it does. Tighten looks at each vertex and works out the direction they need to move in so as to create the most tension-free surface. It then allows you to interactively move those vertices along that direction by dragging the mouse left and right.

Another way to think of it is as a tool to get all the edges as similar in length as possible. It will eventually smooth out your model into an amorphous blob.

You can use it to gently smooth out regions where you've made changes in the surface too harsh, by tightening select areas by small amounts.

You can get your model into a more UV- friendly paintable state by tightening a lot, thus avoiding areas where there's overhang or creases.

Alternatively, you can tighten in the opposite direction (un-tighten) by small amounts where your surface is too smooth. It will make differences in edge length more extreme. If you find a model is coming out too gooey when smoothed, un-tighten it a bit before smoothing, it might help.

Tighten may work slightly differently from Nendo®. Wings calculates all directions once, before the drag is started. Nendo® might recalculate all directions after every mouse move. (It would probably make a difference if adjacent vertices are selected, which they usually are.)

VERTEX MENU | BEVEL

Bevels corners at selected vertices, thus creating new faces. It has no effect on isolated vertices where two edges fail to intersect with any other (a single edge cut in two). Such vertices should be eliminated, by the way, via the Collapse tool.

VERTEX MENU | COLLAPSE (Bksp) Removes the vertex, adjusting the faces and edges associated with it accordingly and leaves you in Face Selection Mode.

VERTEX MENU | DISSOLVE

Removes the vertex. Unlike Collapse, Dissolve leaves you in Vertex Selection Mode so that you can continue to select and eliminate vertices without having to switch back from Face Mode.

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL VERTEX MENU | DEFORM

Wings3D has several deformation tools available, as listed below.

Crumple – moves selected vertices randomly. Good for adding &quot;noise&quot;.

Inflate – moves selected vertices along their normal out from the center of mass of the selection. If you have a hollow object and select vertices on the inside as well as the outside of the object, Inflate will cause the vertices on the inside and outside to move outward just as if you were inflating a balloon. In other words, the outside vertices move on their positive normals while the inside vertices move on their negative normals. This can be a very powerful modeling tool. Note however that Inflate can cause faces to collide with each other, and can therefore ruin a model rather quickly. Be judicious in its use, especially in areas of dense geometry that may be oriented towards other parts of the model.

Taper (X, Y, Z) – will evenly spread the vertices apart radially along the selected axis. Note that the reference point for the Taper operation is at the middle of the model.

Twist (X, Y, Z) – This twists the selected vertices around an axis parallel to the chosen major axis. The axis will be pass through the center of bounding box for the selected vertices. Note that the 'anchor / stationary' end of the model always faces the negative side of any axis chosen. To twist round the other way, the model has to be rotated 180 degrees first.

Torque (X, Y, Z) – This twists the selected vertices around the chosen major axis (X, Y, or Z). Note that as with standard Twist, the 'anchor / stationary' end of the model always faces the negative side of any axis chosen. To twist round the other way, the model has to be rotated 180 degrees first.

Some Examples:

In the image below, Twist|Y and Torque|Y will do exactly the same thing. Both will twist the cylinder around the Y axis, because the cylinder is exactly centered in the middle of the workspace.


Figure 47: Twist and Torque. A cylinder placed in the center of the workspace (a) exhibits exactly the same result (b) when subjected to either Twist|Y or Torque|Y.

74 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.2 6The Context Sensitive Menus In the image below, Twist|Y twists the off-around the workspace Y axis, yielding center cylinder around a vertical axis passing different results. through the center of the cylinder. Torque|Y on the other hand will twist the cylinder


Figure 48: Twist vs. Torque. A cylinder is moved off center in Z by 1 unit (a). Then a Twist|Y by 180 is applied. The result is exactly as in Figure 47. An Undo converts it back to a standard cylinder (a), and then Torque|Y by 180 is applied. The results are completely different.

You can achieve dramatically different results asymmetrical (a). In (b) we have applied a between Twist and Torque on asymmetrical Twist | Y by 180 degrees. You can see that objects. In the example below we have a it caused the cylinder itself to become bent. cylinder that is centered in the workspace. In (c) we have applied a Torque | Y by 180 One set faces has had an Extrude Region | degrees and get an interesting screw like Normal applied to make the object object with a straight shaft.


Figure 49: Other factors. If your object is asymmetrical, Torque can give you better results.

� Section 5.2 The Context Sensitive Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Quick Tip: Experiment with Deformers

Deliberately moving models off center and experimenting with Twist and Torque can give 'interesting' results. In my opinion, ensuring you have sufficient 'sections' along the length of your model is essential for producing satisfactory results. For non-organic / technical models, careful choice (and matching) of the number of linear and radial sectors can result in geometry that offers considerable scope for polygon reduction after twisting is complete. Experimentation and keeping away from prime numbers can pay dividends in this area if low polygon counts are needed. Rotating the model off a main axis and twisting at right angles to the models main axis can often prove an entertaining (and fruitful) exercise. If you

want to 'dirty up' an object that's been twisted (for maybe a more 'organic' look) try selecting sections of the twisted item (rather than the whole) and re-applying a bit more twist. Taper operates from the center of the selection set along the axis chosen. One end will Taper up while the other end Tapers down. Like twist, experiment with selecting parts rather than the whole of the model - it is quite easy to get useful shapes this way. Successive applications of taper should also be tried - e.g. tapering a multi-sectioned cylinder 100% in Y and then repeating the op will produce a concave spike, like a Chinese hat whereas, if you perform the second taper by -100% you get a beer barrel shape.

Examples of engineered wetlands are those currently constructed for remediation applications:  as surface flow systems for the removal of pollutants from liquid effluents such as sewage and petroleum wastes. The systems rely primarily on microbial communities, which grow as biofilms in the plant root zone. Their construction relies on an understanding of the relationship between the selection of vegetative species and soil, hydrology, grading/site preparation, and installation methods.  Construction of wetlands involves an understanding of the various scientific, legal, and technical components of wetland ecology.

An engineered wetland with areas of open water is similar to that of a natural marsh. These systems are typically designed to support the growth of emergent wetland plants, interspersed with lagoons.  These surface flow systems are more tolerant of wastewaters with high suspended solid concentrations than gravel-bed systems, and they support a higher biodiversity than subsurface flow water treatment systems.  They model the ecology of natural habitats such as salt scrub, pine savannahs, estuarine tidal marshes, forested wetlands, shrub-scrub wetlands, emergent wetlands, freshwater tidal wetlands, brackish tidal wetlands, and open marshes. Construction requires an understanding of the relationship between the selection of vegetative species and soil, hydrology, grading/site preparation, and installation methods. The management system involves an ecological rationale for maintaining a high clearance rate of pollutants.

Credibility refers to the trustworthiness of a witness.&lt;ref&gt; 
Raymond v. Bosanquet (1919) 59 S.C.R. 452 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1919/1919canlii11/1919canlii11.html 1919 CanLII 11] at p.460&lt;br&gt;
see discussion on credibility and reliability in R. v. C. (H.), [http://canlii.ca/t/225zl 2009 ONCA 56], at para. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Credibility evidence comprises evidence admitted for the purposes of strengthening or weakening the testimony of a witness or an accused. Credibility evidence that is used to impeach a witness can be submitted at any point from the time the witness takes the stand. The rule is that a witness always puts their credibility at issue whenever they testify and so it is open to attack. Evidence that bolsters a witness's credibility, however, is not admittable until the credibility of that witness has been impeached.

Whenever testimony is given the trier of fact must determine whether the testimony is to be believed. There is no presumption of honesty among witnesses in a criminal trial&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Thain 2009 ONCA 223 (CanLII), (2009), 243 C.C.C. (3d) 230 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several approaches to determining credibility. One school of thought believes that credibility is determined primarily by ''demeanour and conduct'' in trial.&lt;ReF&gt;
Raymond v. Bosanquet, supra &lt;br&gt;
R. v. White, [1947] S.C.R. 268 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1947/1947canlii1/1947canlii1.html] at 272
&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach says that demeanour and conduct are too subjective,&lt;ref&gt;
Tatarchuk v. Sidor (1951), 1 W.W.R. (N.S.) 435 at 448 (Alta. C.A.), &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. P. (R.) 1994 CanLII 6250, (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 571 (Que. C.A.); [http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qcca/doc/1994/1994canlii6250/1994canlii6250.html]  &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Norman 1993 CanLII 3387, (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 295 (C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1993/1993canlii3387/1993canlii3387.html] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Marzan (1982), 18 Man. R. (2d) 240 at 246&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Neary, 2000 NFCA 22 [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2000/2000nfca22/2000nfca22.html] at 27&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and so the best approach is to consider the ''consistency''  of testimony when compared to reliable facts.&lt;ref&gt;
Faryna v. Chorny [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (B.C.C.A.) at 357:
:In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.
Whitehouse v. Reimer, (1980), 116 D.L.R.(3d) 594 at 595
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oath-helping==
It is generally prohibited to adduce any evidence for the sole purpose of bolstering or increasing a witnesses credibility, suggesting they are more likely to be telling truth. Evidence that is adduced for another reason and also has the effect of bolstering credibility can be permitted. The judge must balance the probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effect.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Llorenz, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb75 2000 CanLII 5745] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reasons for adducing oath-helping evidence includes showing corroboration with other extrinsic evidence and narrative.

The Crown cannot introduce evidence showing that their witness has testified in court previously resulting in convictions.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Mallory, [http://canlii.ca/t/1qbmx 2007 ONCA 46]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defence cannot adduce evidence establishing that the accused passed a polygraph test.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Thorne, (1988), 82 N.S.R. (2d) 442 (S.C.A.D.)&lt;br&gt;

==Failure to Call Witnesses==
It is dangerous to draw an adverse inference from the failure of the accused to call evidence.&lt;ref&gt;

Privilege protects certain information from being revealed by a witness on the stand.

==Solicitor Client Privilege==
Solicitor-client privilege is a class privilege and are presumed inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;R v McClure, [http://canlii.ca/t/5228 2001 SCC 14], [2001] 1 SCR 445&lt;/ref&gt;

This privilege is the &quot;highest privilege recognized by the courts&quot; which is &quot;fundamental to the administration of justice&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Smith v Jones [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp9 1999 CanLII 674] (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 455, at para 44 and 50&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of this privilege can &quot;erode the public's confidence in fairness of the criminal justice system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Lavallee, Rackel &amp; Heintz v Canada (AG) [http://canlii.ca/t/51rj 2002 SCC 61] (CanLII), [2002] 3 SCR 209 at para 49&lt;/ref&gt; As accused persons must have confidential access to advice to make properly informed decisions.

The privilege exists where a written or oral communication is :&lt;ref&gt;R v Campbell, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp4 1999 CanLII 676], [1999] 1 SCR 565 at para 49 [also referred to as R v Shirose] Solosky v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mjtq 1979 CanLII 9] (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821 at p. 835 &lt;/ref&gt;
#made in confidence or be of a confidential in nature; 
#made to a professional legal advisor; 
#for the purpose of giving and receiving legal advice.

This privilege applies not only between and a lawyer and their retained client, but can also apply between a Crown attorney and a police officer seeking legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Caines,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2011/2011abqb660/2011abqb660.html 2011 ABQB 660]&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements taken by an investigator on behalf of the defence is privileged and cannot be subject of disclosure to the crown.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Peruta; R v Brouillette (1992) 78 CCC (3d) 350  [http://canlii.ca/t/1pf0f 1992 CanLII 3597] (QCCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following have been considered privileged information:
* Emails between counsel and clients&lt;ref&gt;

==Exemptions from Solicitor-Client Privilege==
There are three occasions when solicitor‑client privilege may be overruled, namely when innocence at stake is engaged, the client's communications are themselves criminal, or it is necessary to protect public safety.&lt;ref&gt;
Smith v. Jones, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp9 1999 CanLII 674] (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 45
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{reflist|2}}
===Innocence at Stake===

The threshold test for innocence at stake exemption from privilege was set out in R v McClure [http://canlii.ca/t/5228 2001 SCC 445]  and summarized in R. v. Brown, 2002 SCC 32 as a two-step process. The accused must establish that:
* the information he seeks from the solicitor-client communication is not available from any other source; and
* he is otherwise unable to raise a reasonable doubt.
* If the threshold has been satisfied, the judge should proceed to the innocence at stake test, which has two stages.
** Stage #1: The accused seeking production of the solicitor-client communication has to demonstrate an evidentiary basis to conclude that a communication exists that could raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
** Stage #2: If such an evidentiary basis exists, the trial judge should examine the communication to determine whether, in fact, it is likely to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
* It is important to distinguish that the burden in the second stage of the innocence at stake test (likely to raise a reasonable doubt) is stricter than that in the first stage (could raise a reasonable doubt).
* If the innocence at stake test is satisfied, the judge should order disclosure of the communications that are likely to raise a reasonable doubt, in accordance with the guiding principles discussed.

==Litigation Privilege==
The purpose of litigation privilege is to create a &quot;zone of privacy&quot; around documents that were made in &quot;relation to pending or apprehended litigation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [2006] 2 S.C.R. 319, at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Litigation privilege protects documents that were should be created in the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;
Kennedy v. McKenzie, [2005] O.J. No 2060 (S.C.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1kw6d 2005 CanLII 18295] (ON SC), per Ducharme J. at 20&lt;/ref&gt;
# where the dominant purpose of the document is for existing, contemplated or anticipated litigation; and 
## was created in answer to inquiries made by an agent for the party's solicitor; or
## was created at the request or suggestion of the party's solicitor; or 
## was created for the purpose of giving them to counsel in order to obtain advice; or
## was created to enable counsel to prosecute or defence an action or prepare a brief.
{{reflist|2}}

==Settlement/Negotiation Privilege==

The parties need the ability to have &quot;full and frank discourse&quot; in order for agreements to take place. Without protection these discussions may not take place.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pabani, [http://canlii.ca/t/231td 1994 CanLII 8723] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege protects the public interest in favouring settlement. It &quot;promotes the interests of litigants generally by saving them the expense of trial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Kelvin Energy Ltd. v. Lee 1992 CanLII 38 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 235 at para. 48&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The disclosure of &quot;without prejudice&quot; communications has a tendancy to promote litigation.&lt;ref&gt; 
Pirie v. Wyld (1886), 11 O.R. 422, [1886] O.J. No. 188 (QL) (Ont. H.C.), at para. 18 (“... letters written or communications made without prejudice, or offers made for the sake of buying peace, or to effect a compromise, are inadmissible in evidence. It seemingly being considered against public policy as having a tendency to promote litigation, and to prevent amicable settlements.”)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege applies where the following criteria are established:&lt;ref&gt;
Calgary (City) v. Costello, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6lz 1997 ABCA 281] (CanLII) at para. 60&lt;br&gt;
John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman &amp; Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 3rd ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2009) at para. 14.322&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# A litigious dispute must be in existence or within contemplation.
# The communication must be made with the express or implied intention that it would not be disclosed to the court in the event negotiations failed.
# The purpose of the communication must be to attempt to effect a settlement.

Where settlement fails the privilege is invoked and the communications cannot be used in the course of litigation.&lt;ref&gt;
Hansraj v. Ao, [http://canlii.ca/t/4zlp 2002 ABQB 385] (CanLII) at para. 13&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, if settlement is successful, the communications may be used to prove the existence of a settlement contract.&lt;ref&gt;
Hansraj v Ao at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege is possessed by both parties to the litigation and cannot be unilaterally waived by one party.&lt;ref&gt;
Hansraj v Ao at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term &quot;without prejudice&quot; alone is not determinative of whether settlement privilege applies.&lt;ref&gt;
TDL Group Ltd. v. Zabco Holdings Inc. et al., [http://canlii.ca/t/1wcht 2008 MBQB 86] (CanLII) at para. 30&lt;br&gt;
Flegel Construction Ltd. v. Cambac Financial Projects Ltd., [http://canlii.ca/t/27rg8&gt; 1983 CanLII 1019] (AB QB)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plea Negotiations===
Communications regarding plea negotiations fall under the category of &quot;public interest privilege&quot; and so cannot be used in court. This includes negotiations regarding bail hearing&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bernard, [2002] A.J. No. 1007, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m30l 2002 ABQB 747] (CanLII) (Alta. Q.B.)&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sentencing hearings.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Roberts, [2001] A.J. No. 772 
(Alta. Q.B.)) &lt;/ref&gt;

This privilege exists to permit &quot;frank and full discussions between counsel for the accused and counsel for the Crown.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Bernardo, [1994] O.J. No. 1718, (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para 16&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Delorme, [2005] N.W.T.J. No. 51 (N.W.T. S.C.), 2005 NWTSC 34 at para 18 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Roberts, supra, at para 60&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Griffin, [2009] A.J. No. 1455, [http://canlii.ca/t/274zn 2009 ABQB 696] (CanLII) (Alta. Q.B.) at para. 65&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of privilege cannot be waived by one party alone.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bernard, supra, at para 39 &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Griffin, supra, at para 54&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Informer Privilege==
Informer privilege is intended to protect informants and &quot;promote the giving of assistance to the police by citizens in the investigation and prevention of crime&quot;. It further encourages &quot;other persons to provide assistance which would not likely otherwise be provided because of the extreme risks associated with disclosure of the identity of the source of the information.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;R. v. X and Y, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqff1 2012 BCSC 326] at at 18, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally said that the prosecution does not need to disclose the identity of the police informer or provide information that may disclose the identity.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Grey, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jd5 1996 CanLII 35] (ON C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case in drug trafficking cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Scott [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsp3 1990 CanLII 27] (S.C.C.), (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The court will only order the disclosure of the identity if it is needed to show the innocence of an accused person, known as the &quot;innocence at stake&quot; exception.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. X and Y, 2012 BCSC 326 at 20&lt;br&gt;
Bisaillon v. Keable, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpdn 1983 CanLII 26] (SCC), [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Leipert, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr41 1997 CanLII 367] (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281&lt;br&gt; 
Named Person v. Vancouver Sun, [http://canlii.ca/t/1t55c 2007 SCC 43] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Basi, [http://canlii.ca/t/26mxq 2009 SCC 52] (CanLII) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. X and Y, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqfdv 2012 BCSC 325]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  
This can apply where the informer is a material witness to the offence. The determination requires balancing of the relevance of the identity of the informer and the prejudice to the informer and public interest in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Garofoli [http://canlii.ca/t/1fss5 1990 CanLII 52] (S.C.C.), (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts have permitted defence counsel to ask a witness whether they have been an informer in the past and details about any history as an informer to support the theory that the witness invented the allegation of a drug rip off against the accused in expectation of receiving money.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Toews et al [http://canlii.ca/t/1ld2q 2005 BCSC 727]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Interest Privilege and Investigative Techniques==

The following have been recognized as privileged as an investigative technique:
* simulated ingestion of controlled substances&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mueckon, (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* location of a surveillance or observation post&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lam [http://canlii.ca/t/1fngl 2000 BCCA 545] (CanLII), (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 379 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Richards [http://canlii.ca/t/6h8f 1997 CanLII 3364] (ON CA), (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* the location of tracking devices&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Guilbride, [2003] B.C.J. No.1245 (Prov.Ct.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* the location and methods of examining of secondary VINs &lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Boomer [http://canlii.ca/t/1f169 2000 CanLII 4176] (NS SC), (2000), 182 N.S.R. (2d) 49 (S.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Smith, [http://canlii.ca/t/22xks 2009 ABPC 88] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Spousal Privilege==
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Testimonial Evidence/Competence and Compellability#Spousal Immunity]]''

Spousal privilege is a class protection of certain communications between husband and wife. It is a protection that is separate and apart from spousal competency.&lt;ref&gt;
See McWilliams' Canadian Criminal Evidence, 4th ed., vol. 1, looseleaf (Aurora, ON: Canada Law Book, 2010) at para. 13:40.10&lt;/ref&gt;

A spouse who is found to be competent and compellable may still invoke privilege to protect their communications.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Zylstra, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jk6 1995 CanLII 893] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

This class of privilege does not exist at common law, but rather was created by way of s. 4(3) of the Evidence Act, which states:
{{quotation|
4 (3) No husband is compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their marriage, and no wife is compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during their marriage. 
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf5#sec4 CEA]
}}

Third parties may &quot;testify to communications between husband and wife that were overheard, intercepted, or otherwise discovered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. R.R.W. (No. 2), [http://canlii.ca/t/2c840 2010 NLTD 137] (CanLII) citing McWilliams’ at para. 13:40.50
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Case-by-Case Privilege==
A communication that does not fit into one of the class privileges may nonetheless be protected under the &quot;case-by-case privilege&quot; that can be applied to communications on an ad-hoc basis where the requisite criteria are met.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gruenke, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsjh 1991 CanLII 40] (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR 263
&lt;/ref&gt;

Case-by-case privilege can be invoked where:&lt;ref&gt;Gruenke&lt;/ref&gt;
#The communications must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed.
# This element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties.
# The relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered.
# The injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.

{{reflist|2}}
==Confidentiality==

===Journalist Sources===
Where appropriate, &quot;the courts will respect a promise of confidentiality given to a secret source by a journalist or an editor.&quot;However, where the public's interest in protecting sources is outweighed by other interests promises of secrecy cannot be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;R v National Post [http://canlii.ca/t/29l77 2010 SCC 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Confidentiality of journalistic sources can be measured on a case-by-case basis based on the &quot;Wigmore criteria&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
Confidentiality will be upheld if:&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# the communication originates in a confidence that the identity of the informant will not be disclosed;
# the confidence is essential to the relationship in which the communication arises; 
# the relationship is one which should be sedulously fostered in the public good; and 
# the public interest in protecting the identity of the informant from disclosure outweighs the public interest in getting at the truth. 
 
In R v National Post [http://canlii.ca/t/29l77 2010 SCC 16], the Court found that the fourth criteria was not made out where a journalist would not reveal a source who had potentially forged documents implicating a former prime minister in a illegal transaction.
{{reflist|2}}

==Waiver of Privilege==

Inadvertently disclosing privileged information does not automatically result in a waiver of privilege. Implied waiver could be established by knowledge of disclosure of the information and silence in response to disclosing the documents. The court must look at all the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Chapelstone Developments Inc. [http://canlii.ca/t/1jchb 2004 NBCA 96] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Solicitor-Client Privilege===
Only the client can waive solicitor-client privilege.&lt;Ref&gt;McClure at para 37&lt;/ref&gt; It must be waived intentionally.

The client cannot be compelled to waive privilege by answering questions in the course of litigation.
&lt;ref&gt; R v Creswell, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2000/2000bcca583/2000bcca583.html 2000 BCCA 583], 149 CCC (3d) 268&lt;/ref&gt;

A waiver of privilege can arise from an accused making allegations attacking competency of counsel using what would otherwise be privileged information.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Hobbs [http://canlii.ca/t/25jsm 2009 NSCA 90] at para. 21&lt;br&gt;
R v West [http://canlii.ca/t/25nf8 2009 NSCA 94] at para. 16&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The waiver of privilege only covers evidence concerning the issue alleged.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Dunbar [1982] OJ No 581 (ONCA) at 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Saya is not very formal everywhere, in Makassar we always used 'saya' as a child.

Unfortunately I'm not intimately familiar versions of Indonesian spoken outside Jakarta so I only put the variations I'm familiar with, feel free to add to the lesson if you have any corrections/additions. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 13:30, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

The '''''Deluminator''''', also referred to as a &quot;Put-Outer&quot;, is a small magical device that looks like a cigarette lighter. It captures and stores a light source, like a streetlight, and can later be used to restore the light to its original place.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Deluminator [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|was used]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] to &quot;put out&quot; the surrounding streetlights to make it harder to see the proceedings while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] was being delivered to the Dursleys. Once the wizards had left Privet Drive, Dumbledore released the lights from the Deluminator to restore the street to its normal night-time illumination. We note that the author refers to it three times as a Put-Outer; Dumbledore does not name it while he is using it.

It was later used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] to darken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] while the Advance Guard was landing in the square. Moody again restored the streetlights once all the wizards were inside the house, before closing the front door. The author here twice refers to it as a &quot;Put-Outer&quot;, though neither Harry nor Moody uses that term.

Again, the Deluminator appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows'']]. First named in Dumbledore's will, it is given by the Minister of Magic to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] once the Ministry has duly examined it. Ron later discovers that, as well as being able to remove and replace light, the Deluminator has the ability to track Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], despite their magical shields. It seems to key on the use of his name, picking up their conversation from the point at which they mention Ron. Having started tracking their conversation, it seems to be able to provide some sort of transport to their vicinity; it is never entirely clear how this is managed, exactly, but it produces a ball of light which, when it contacts Ron's chest, allows him to Apparate to Harry and Hermione's vicinity. Finally, in the basement of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Ron discovers that captured lights will simply float in the air, if they are released in a place distant from their original sources.

== Analysis ==

Dumbledore, as we can see by even a casual inspection of his office, is very fond of creating magical / mechanical hybrid devices. Given that Moody says he &quot;borrowed&quot; the Deluminator from Dumbledore, we can assume that it is a rare device in the Wizarding world; it is entirely possible that it is, in fact, a unique artifact, possibly an invention of Dumbledore's.

In the real world the closest analogue to the Deluminator is a device called the TV-B-Gone, which works on most, if not all, TV sets by generating a sequence of &quot;Off&quot; codes. This has been documented to also jam the light sensors on some street lamps. A hypothetical variant of this which has yet to be further developed uses a hybrid frequency detector to resonate with the 30-80 kHz ballasts used on many CCFLs and high pressure sodium street lights, and generates an inverse signal that causes a false event in the controller causing the light to go out as if the tube had quenched. Such a device would need to generate field strengths of several tens of kV per metre to travel up the (typically iron) pole and interfere with the ballast. Neither of these devices, however, has the ability to recreate the captured light source in a separate location, as the Deluminator does in the cellars of Malfoy Manor.

==Acids==
* Acids from animal and plant material are called Organic acids.
* Acids that chemists have found ways of creating are Mineral acids.
* Solutions of acids can be either dilute or concentrated.
* An acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions when dissolved in water.

Properties:
* Acids have a sour taste.
* Acids change the colour of indicators: Acids turn blue litmus paper red.
* Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen and salt of the metal.
: &gt; Some metals react slowly, for example copper, and some react very fast, such as sodium.
::Metal + acid -&gt; metal salt + hydrogen
::Zinc + Sulphuric Acid -&gt; Zinc Sulphate + Hydrogen
::Zn (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)
: &gt; Metal replaces the hydrogen contained in acid.
* Acids react with carbonates to give carbon dioxide, a salt and water.
::Magnesium Carbonate + Hydrochloric Acid -&gt; Carbon Dioxide + Magnesium Chloride + Water
::MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + 2HCl (aq) -&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* Acids neutralize bases to form a salt and water only.
* Acids have H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions which combine with OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions in bases to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a result of the neutralization reaction.

==Bases==

* A base is a substance that reacts with an acid to form a salt and water only.
::Acid + Base -&gt; Salt + Water
::Calcium Hydroxide + Nitric acid -&gt; Calcium nitrate + Water
* Alkalis are soluble bases
::Sodium Hydroxide + hydrochloric acid -&gt; Sodium Chloride + Water
::NaOH (aq) + HCl (aq) -&gt; NaCl (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)
::Limewater is an alkali (calcium hydroxide). It goes milky white when Carbon Dioxide is bubbled through it. The precipitate is Calcium Carbonate.
::Carbon Dioxide + Calcium Hydroxide -&gt; Calcium Carbonate + water

Properties:
* Bases neutralize acids to form salt and water only.
* Soluble bases change the colour of indicators (e.g. turns red litmus paper blue)
* Soluble bases feel soapy (they convert some oil on your skin into soap). Decreasing agents; convert oil and grease into soap.
* A solution of an alkali in water contains hydroxide ions OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (aq). Because most metal hydroxides are insoluble, an alkali added to a solution of a metal salt will precipitate an insoluble metal hydroxide.

=== Weak and Strong Acids ===
* Acids that contain more hydrogen ions (ionize to a larger extent) react faster (e.g. HCl)
* This is a strong acid (nearly all acid molecules form ions)
* In weak acids, only some of the acid molecules form ions
* Strong acids have lower pH numbers than weak acids of the same concentration

::{|
|''Strong Acids''   || ''Weak Acids''
|-
|Hydrochloric Acid  ||  Ethanoic Acid
|-
|Sulphuric Acid     ||  Citric Acid
|-
|Nitric Acid        ||  Carbonic Acid
|}

=== Weak and Strong Alkalis ===
* A strong alkali exists almost completely as ions in solution.
* A weak alkali, only some of the molecules will form ions in solution

::{|
|''Strong Alkalis'' ||   ''Weak Alkalis''
|-
|Sodium Hydroxide   ||        Ammonia
|-
|Potassium Hydroxide||
|-
|Calcium Hydroxide  ||
|}


== pH/Universal Indicator paper ==

* pH is the level of acidity or alkalinity in an aqueous solution or a liquid.
* Universal Indicator turns different colors in strongly acidic and weakly acidic solutions.
* It comes as both a liquid and as a solution.
* Acids have a pH value of less than 7.
* Alkalis have a pH value of more than 7.
* Neutral Substances have a value of pH 7.

=== Other Indicators ===

::{|
| ''Indicator'' ||  ''Acidic Colour'' || ''Neutral Colour'' ||  ''Alkaline Colour''
|-
|Litmus   ||      Red    ||             Purple    ||         Blue
|-
|Phenolphtalein || Colorless  ||        Colorless   ||       Pink
|-
|Methyl Orange ||  Red  ||              Yellow   ||      Yellow
|}

== Acidity in Soil ==
* Most plants grow best when the pH of the soil is close to 7.
* If the soil is too acidic, or too alkaline, plants will grow badly or not at all.
* Chemicals are added to the soil to adjust the pH level.
* Most often, soil is too acidic so it is treated with quicklime (calcium oxide), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate). These are all cheap bases.

 

== TYPES OF OXIDES ==

=== Metallic/Basic Oxides ===

* Basic Oxide + Alkali -&gt; no visible reaction
* Basic Oxide + Acid -&gt; Salt + Water Only
* Basic Oxide + Water -&gt; alkalis
* CaO, MgO, CuO, Na2O, K2O
* Oxides of P + K form peroxides on heating, others decompose.

=== Non-Metallic/Acidic Oxide ===

* Acidic Oxide + Alkali à Salt -&gt; water only [SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2NaOH(aq) -&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)]
* Acidic Oxide + Acid -&gt; no visible reaction [NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl -&gt; no reaction]
* Acidic Oxide + Water -&gt; Acid [2NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] *exception: mixed anhydride
* Exception: 2NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaOH -&gt; NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O *mixed anhydride
* SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (pentaoxide), P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Neutral Oxide ===

* Non-metallic oxides (but not acidic)
* CO (Carbon Monoxide), NO (Nitrogen Monoxide), N&lt;sub&gt;­2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Dinitrogen Oxide), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Water)
* No reaction with anything
 
=== Amphoteric Oxides (both basic/acidic) ===

* Ampho Oxide + Acid -&gt; Salt + Water only
* Ampho Oxide + Alkali (+ water) -&gt; Complex Salt
* ZnO (s) + 2NaOH (aq) -&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Sodium Zincate)
* Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaOH + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; 2NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Sodium Aluminate)
* PbO + 2NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Sodium Plumbate)

 
=== Preparation of Basic Oxides ===

* For Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe, Al, HEAT THE METALLIC nitrate, hydroxide or carbonate

(a)    2Cu(NO3)2 (s)  -∆-&gt; 2CUO (s) + 4NO2(g) + O2 (g)

*identifiable with brown nitrogen dioxide gas

(b) Cu(OH)2 (s) -∆-&gt; CuO (s) + H2O (g/l)

(c) CuCO3 (s) -∆-&gt; CuO (s) + CO2 (g)

== Salts ==

* Substance formed when either all or part of the hydrogen ions in an acid is replaced by a metallic or ammonium ion.
* Made when acid is neutralized by base (water is also formed)
* Anhydrous – salts with no water
* Hydrated – salts with a fixed % of water (water of crystallization or water of hydration) – important for shape and color of salt
* Soluble salts dissolve to leave a clear solution
* Insoluble salt precipitate

|-
|All chlorides ||                  Silver chloride

|}
 

=== Preparation of Soluble Salt ===

* Acid + Metal -&gt; Salt + Hydrogen

Warm acid, add metal in excess and wait till no more hydrogen is evolved

* Acid + Metal Oxide -&gt; Salt + Water

Add excess of metal oxide to acid. Wait till solution no longer turns blue litmus red

* Acid + Metal carbonate -&gt; salt + water + carbon dioxide

Add excess of metal carbonate to acid. Wait until no more CO2 evolved

* Acid + Alkali -&gt; Salt + Water

* Solid is added in excess to make sure no acid has been left over

After the above has been conducted, the excess solid in solution is filtered out. The filtrate is left to evaporate on the water bath. When crystals form on the rod, it can be taken off. Solution cools to crystals. Then solution can be separated by filtering, washing crystals with distilled water and then leaving crystals to dry.

=== Preparation of Insoluble Salt ===

* All insoluble salts will go through double decomposition reaction

* More reactive metals will displace less reactive metals in solution

Lead (II) Iodide, is an insoluble salt, will be prepared from Sodium Iodide. Lead (II) Nitrate is added to the solution (all nitrates soluble in water). A precipitate of Lead (II) Iodide forms as Sodium displaces Lead.

NaI (aq) + Pb (NO3­)2 (aq) -&gt; PbI2 (s) + 2NaNO3 (aq)

The solution with the precipitate is filtered and washed with distilled water to dissolve any NaNO­3 still present. Residue is dried with over or dessicator to obtain insoluble salt.

= (about this placeholder) =

Since there has been nothing written on this page for a while, I asked for some basic information on another forum.  I'll just quote what I learned from that forum, and this can be massaged into a real page of documentation over time.  I won't attribute the individual various quotes, but thank you all for helping out.  Remember, ANYONE can edit a Wiki, so create an account and make this thing better.

= The NLA Window =

== Forum Notes ==

It's quite easy and maybe that's why there's no specific tutorial. Let's say you want to make two actions, AC:Hit and AC:Kick. Start with posing Hit and an Action will automatically be created in the Action Editor consisting of all the Bones that use Action IPO's. That's done so return to Frame 1 which will be your default Stance of AC:Hit.
 
Now, in the Action Editor, click the X (delete) next to AC:Hit and the datablock menu will disappear. (If you Add New instead of deleting then it will copy selected bones to the new action and you don't always want that). If you want a new default pose for AC:Kick, then Pose it or the same stance will be used as was the default in AC:Hit. Pose and Keyframe your Kick action and name it.
 
Over in the NLA Editor you can now use Shift-A to add NLA-Strips of your Actions, Grab and Scale them and use the Transform Properties tab to input how they Blend.

If you select an Action with the dropdown menu, at first its name will appear in the NLA window along with its keys. To make this Action into an NLA strip, point at the Action's name in the NLA and press CKEY.
 
Close any open Actions by clicking the scary X in the Action Editor. If you don't do this, only this action will play. Now in the NLA editor, play the animation. 
 
If you see any keys (diamonds) in the NLA window, instead of strips (rectangles), you're still editing an action. It's so much easier if you have both the Action and NLA windows open so you can see whether an Action is open or not. (Edited by CD38 23 Feb 2006)

== Walkthrough ==

With no Actions selected, both the Action Editor and the NLA Editor appear empty.  Here, the NLA Editor window does list one Object called '''-Empty''' because that object is not an armature but it has some IPO curves attached.

[[image:action-1.jpg|none|thumb|300px|empty action window]]
{{clr}}

Select an Action you've already made.  Here, an Armature named '''Yui''' has bones involved in a one-frame action called '''-AtEase'''.

[[image:nla-2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|nla window with action]][[image:action-2.jpg|none|thumb|300px|action window with action]]
{{clr}}

Convert the listed Action to an NLA Strip in the NLA Editor by pressing the CKEY with the mouse hovering over the Action to be converted.  No change in the Action Editor; it is still available as an Action.

[[image:nla-3.jpg|left|thumb|300px|nla window converting to a strip]][[image:nla-4.jpg|none|thumb|300px|nla window after conversion]]
{{clr}}

Once converted, note the changes in the NLA Editor.  The Action icon appears next to the Armature's name: [[Image:toggle-nla-pose.jpg]].  This is actually a button though it does not look like it, and you can toggle it between the Action and NLA Strips icon by clicking on it: [[Image:toggle-nla-strips.jpg]].

More soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Internet access is everywhere, so this is pretty easy to take care of. Membership at the local library will give you some time of free Internet access. If you have the money to patronize the business, many coffee shops and delis will have one or two computers for their customers to use.

If you can afford it, a laptop computer with a WiFi card will guarantee you in most major cities. Hotel lobbies, many restaurants, and increasingly today some areas just out on the street have WiFi Internet access in them.  Purchasing a high gain directional wireless antenna can make it easier to acquire signals.  There is a recent (as of 20060528) case however of someone being arrested for connecting through someones wireless access point without permission.  I prefer to ask people first, but this complicates parking.  Some people have recommended that owners of WAPs add &quot;please use&quot; or something to the ESSID string that identifies the network in order to give explicit permission.

The ultimate solution is a laptop with a satellite modem, enabling you to connect from anywhere in the world. However, this can cost some money, particularly with an ISP to deal with.

There are also some cellular Internet options that are increasingly cheap and fast.

==Passive Subjunctive System==
Having examined Lessons 15 and 23, forming the passive subjunctive should be quite simple.
===Present===
Modify the verb stem appropriately with a vowel change (as learned in Lesson 15), then add the present passive endings (Lesson 23).

{| style=&quot;width:500px&quot; border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 
| parer || manear || regar || capiar || audiar
|-
| pareris || manearis || regaris || capiaris || audiares
|-
| paretur || maneatur || regatur || capiatur || audiatur
|-
| paremur || maneamur || regamur || capiamur || audiamur
|-
| paremini || maneamini || regamini || capiamini || audiamini
|-
| parentur || maneantur || regantur || capiantur || audiantur
|}

===Imperfect===
The passive endings added to the present active infinitive.

{| style=&quot;width:500px&quot; border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 
| pararer || manerer || regerer || caperer || audirer
|-
| parareris || manereris || regereris || capereris || audireris
|-
| pararetur || maneretur || regeretur || caperetur || audiretur
|-
| pararemur || maneremur || regeremur || caperemur || audiremur
|-
| pararemini || maneremini || regeremini || caperemini || audiremini
|-
| pararentur || manerentur || regerentur || caperentur || audirentur
|}

I'm very new to magic, but I'm going to build a bit of an outline and maybe add a little content in the hopes that someone smarter than me will fill in the blanks!

:I support that effort completely.  Have fun!

:As a suggestion, I would recommend that you enlist some help from some of the people who are working on the Magic Wikiproject at [[w:Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Magic]].  It would also help if you adding a link from the Wikipedia article at [[w:Magic (illusion)]] to this Wikibook, to see if anybody reading that article might be interested in some more in depth content about the topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

I read some of that stuff.  Controversy knows no bounds.  My position is that the contents of my head belong to me, and I may do with them as I please.  That said, I only intend to describe &quot;secrets&quot; that one may find in any large public library (or on Amazon.com!).  [[User:PeterHutnick|PeterHutnick]] 22:30, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

I'll try to help out where possible. I've been performing magic for about 13 years so far, and just plan on including the basics that are easy to find in common magic books, like the other people here. I primarily focus on cards, so that's where I'll try to do the most work. --[[User:essie|Essie]]  11 July 2007

      <text xml:space="preserve">The magician's duty is twofold.  First, he must create some ''effect'' that surprises and delights his audience.  Second, he must convince them to, at least superficially, accept a magical explanation for the effect. 

The superficial ''acceptance'' is not enough. Nor does one wish for the &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;. Magic will always be strong if one understands that emotions and intellect are separate things. 

''&quot;I do not believe in ghosts, yet I am afraid of them&quot;''

Misdirection provides the primary mechanism for hiding the true cause of an effect.  Novices often confuse simple distraction with misdirection.  Snapping the fingers of one's right hand while ''ditching'' a coin held in the left ''is'' an example of distraction as a form of misdirection.  Misdirection, however, covers a much larger class of actions and conditions.  A magician might wish to create the appearance that he has made a chosen card &quot;rise&quot; to the top of a deck.  He might riffle the pack and tap the top card creating the impression that these actions ''caused'' the card to rise.  The card was at the top of the pack for some time prior to this action, but the magician's actions ''cover'' the method used.

Misdirection, then, has everything to do with the magician influencing the audience member's state of mind or thought process.  ''This'' (and only this) form of ''mentalism'' is real!

==What is a Magician?==

A magician is anyone who entertains through the use of magic, illusion, sleight of hand, mentalism, or trickery. Although anyone can do tricks, a magician is more: he is skilled at the art of deception, a master of language, and an apparent manipulator of the laws of physics.

It takes more than knowing the secrets to the tricks to be an effective magician...it takes understanding the thinking of the audience. It takes practice and patience to master illusions and sleights as well as the patter used in tricks. Often, the patter itself is a major tool in the misdirection needed to accomplish a sleight or illusion.  The effective magicians has at least an elementary understanding of psychology. The magicians worthy of respect also treats his audience with respect. Performing magic effectively requires dedication. Anyone can buy a trick at a magic dealer and perform it without any practice; all they will succeed in doing is diminishing the art of magic. If you think that revealing how a trick is done doesn’t matter then you do not understand one of the basic tenets of magic: never reveal your secrets.  If a magician reveals her secrets either on purpose or by ineptitude, the audience loses respect for magic.  Magicians are not here to merely deceive people, but to inspire people that may have no other realm of hope to continue clinging to.

Also, a magician is frequently trying to make a living performing magic and entertaining people. Would-be amateurs who do not have the dedication to practice their craft can take the hope and belief away from the audience due to mishandling of their props, causing professional magicians to lose credibility. 

Magic entertains, which is something people want in their lives. You should always leave your audience wanting more.  Performing the same trick two or three times in the same show may reveal the secret behind the magic and can  cause the audience to lose interest. Give your audience a polished performance...make it entertaining, fun, energetic, exciting, and mysterious! Always give your audience their money’s worth, even if they aren’t paying for the privilege of seeing you perform. Your audience is investing their time to watch you, so make it count. 

==A magician's tools==
The beginning magician focuses on what his ''hands'' are ''doing''.....the experienced magician focuses on what his ''mouth'' is ''saying''. Never underestimate the power of verbal misdirection.

      <comment>/* Linking Rings */ typo fixes</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Beyond the arena of close up magic, magicians often performed 'Stand Up' magic (sometimes referred to as 'Parlor' magic) and 'Stage' magic for large audiences.


==Linking Rings==

Linking Rings are a standard effect within the magician's repertoire.  Modern sets of rings are available from nearly every magic dealer throughout the world.  Commonly, the set utilize a &quot;key ring&quot; which is a gimmicked ring allowing the various rings to link together. Magicians try again and again to improve this trick.

==Cups and Balls==

Within magic literature (and well before it's genesis), Cups and Balls were a hallmark of a magician.

==Knowing the Ropes==

Rope tricks come in many varieties some using normal rope, some using gimmicked or gaffed rope. If you plan to do rope tricks, you must choose the right rope for the trick. Cotton rope works best for most tricks, especially those that require the rope to be cut in any way, or for tricks where the ends need to be tight and not unraveled. Nylon works well if the rope is not going to be cut, as the ends can be heated to prevent them from raveling. Avoid stiff ropes such as ski ropes and hemp ropes.

===Cut and Restored Rope===

This version of the cut and restored rope uses a non gimicked rope. Hold both ends of the rope in the left hand between the thumb and fore finger, the middle of the rope dangling down below the hand. Bring the bottom, middle of the rope up into the hand holding the two ends, to hold the middle loop steady to cut. A magic pass and the rope is restored, well, except for the knot in the middle. Just a pull on the knot and it comes off, and wa la, the rope is restored.

It is a trick you have seen many times on television. How is it accomplished? For this we need to understand misdirection and sleight of hand. The misdirection is the patter, that is to say the words you use to describe what you are doing. The patter for this is simply &quot;I bring the center of the rope up to form a loop, take the scissors and cut the center of the rope making two pieces.&quot; Which is the truth, you actually do cut the rope into two pieces. The hard part is to make it look like the two pieces are the same or nearly the same length. In actuality, the pieces are very different in length, one is very short and the other is very long.

To do this, when you pick up the center of the rope at the bottom, you pick it up with the first finger of the right hand. As you are lifting the center to the left hand, your middle finger goes through the rope and grabs the far side while the first finger drops the rope that it held. When done at speed, it looks as if you just lifted the center of the rope to the other hand forming a loop to cut. What actually happens is that you form a second loop around the first one, a much shorter loop it is this loop that is cut. When the ends are dropped the short piece of rope is close to the center of the long piece of rope and your hand is covering the point where the two loops come together. Tie a knot with the short loop around the rope. Now all you do is slide the knot off the rope as you wind the rope up in your hand. You can also try to tie the knot around a loop of the rope, so you can pull the knot directly off the center of the rope.

==Stacks==

Stacking the cards is not in itself a magical effect; however with the right presentation you can perform some very cool tricks. As a simple example, a packet of cards is held in the left hand. The top card is removed and placed on the bottom; the next card is turned face up on the table. The card is the Ace. The next card is removed and placed on the bottom with the next card turned face up to the table. This card is the King. This continues until there are no more cards in the hand. On the table are the A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3, and 2 in order. Not impressive but adequate for an example. In order to perform this feat the cards must be in a particular order. In this case the order is as follows:
      8,A,3,K,7,Q,4,J,6,10,2,9, and 5.
The method for stacking a packet or the deck differs from trick to trick, however one thing is the same for all stacked deck tricks. It is the finished product that is of importance, so knowing what you are after in the effect and working backwards will give you an easy method for stacking the deck. The trick becomes more impressive if it appears that the deck wasn't stacked, so being able to stack a deck in front of the audience without them knowing it is a definite plus. With this in mind, let’s take our example above. If you look at the sequence of numbers above, you will notice that one half of the cards are in order and placed every other card (the Ace through the Nine.) The other half (OK you got me, 13 cards can not be evenly halved) are also divided into half, and they are inserted between every other card in the first half (Sort of.) The bottom 3 cards are shuffled before they are shuffled into this pack. Again if you work backwards this can be done in just three shuffles. First take the bottom three cards and shuffle them. Since there are only three, basically just take the top card of the three and put it between the others. Then take those three and the next four and shuffle the three cards between the other four. Next take those seven cards and shuffle the remaining six in between the shuffled seven, and you're now in the right order to perform.

This can get a little confusing until you have done it a few times, but once you learn to stack cards for a particular trick you are ready to move into doing a routine with the stack trick as a finisher. This can really blow people away as they are not expecting a trick that gives the appearance of such card control after having witnessed the deck being used for other things as well. For example if the above stack was expanded to include the entire deck of cards, a series of tricks that might include a lost and found card, a mentalist type trick and then the finale of rearranging the deck in order. Once the cards are stacked for the finale, the order of the cards is known (at least to the magician) and thus a card can be picked by the spectator from the deck, returned to the deck, lost and then miraculously found. The magician could name the card by prediction, and finally the cards could be handed over to the spectator to deal the cards out surprisingly in order.

That took a lot longer to write about than it would to perform, but that's ok: it's about to get longer! Let’s look at the sequence above and see how a routine can be formed from such a stack. First just as in the example above, start with the cards in the order you want them to end in, and work your way backwards to the starting order. Place this stacked deck in the card box and your ready to begin. When you perform a trick like this for a spectator, take the cards out and cut them. Don't draw attention to the cut by saying anything like &quot;Now I will cut the cards&quot; as the spectator seeing the cards cut will make the leap to the cards are now in an order that the magician couldn't know. (It’s all psychological.) Let the spectator choose a card (remember you actually know the order of the cards even though they were cut, so don't worry that you will mess up, because you have practiced this for hundreds of hour’s right.) When the spectator chooses the card, cut the deck at the point the card is at and place the top section (just above their card), on the bottom of the deck. As they look at their card, get a glimpse of the bottom card (the one that was just above theirs) and now you know what their card is by remembering the next card in the sequence (oh did I mention that you have to memorize the order of the cards?) Now comes the devilishly clever part. Have the spectator place the card back on the top of the deck, and simply cut the cards. This does two things, first it puts the cards back in their original order but shifted; second it &quot;looses&quot; their card. If I were performing this trick, I would use another spectator that the first one knows, and using the Magicians Force Mental Effect, have the other spectator reveal the chosen card. While you are doing the MFME, you have time to &quot;SEARCH&quot; for the chosen card. It is pretty easy to do since you already know what it is. Once you find the card, reverse it in the deck (make it face the other way i.e. face up in a face down deck) but leave it in the position that it was in. Once the MFME is complete, you can reveal the Face up Card in the Face Down Deck. Since the cards are still in order, reverse the direction of the card again, and looking at the face of the deck, cut the cards again to put them back in their original order. Hand the cards to the spectator and instruct them on how to deal the cards. The final magic happening in their hands, leaving the magician looking like.... well a magician!

When using stacked decks, the most difficult part is thinking of the ending. That is what you wish to accomplish, after that all you have to do is just work backwards to assemble the stack. After the stack is assembled, you might want to write down the order of the cards to make it easier to stack the next time, but once in order simply run through the deck as the spectator will and make sure that they fall where you want them to. Writing down the order will also help you to remember the sequence, which will help you in lost and found cards or mental effects. The only thing you must avoid when doing stacked decks is never drop the cards, or change the order by shuffling unless you are really good at reordering them in front of the spectators without them noticing. It really messes up the trick if you do.

Some of it looks like forked content, but in most cases they aren't direct forks, and I'm not sure if these just got lost in a renaming shuffle, or if they're not useful anymore at all, so I'll just list them:

The Urdu alphabet is derived from the [[Persian]] ([[Farsi]]) and the [[Arabic]] alphabet, where majority of the letters are borrowed from Arabic while only four alphabets are primarily borrowed from Persian. Very seldom, letters may be borrowed from [[w:Sanskirt|Sanskrit]]. Even though the letters actually are inherited from these languages, the names used for these letters differ in some cases, for instance, letters ‘bay’ and ‘tay’ in Urdu are called only ‘baa’ and ‘taa’ in Arabic.

Below is a table of all the Urdu alphabets along with their names and the phonetic pronunciation of their names. It is also specified as to which language the letter is borrowed from and the respective keys to press on a keyboard. For the purposes of following the text in this book, Latin alternatives are provided with the alphabet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structure of a civil action == 

'''1 - Advising a client'''

'''2 - Commencing an action'''
The plaintiff must submit an '''Originating Notice''' to the proper court.

'''3 - Pleadings'''

'''4 - Discovery'''
A &quot;discovery&quot; is where both parties perform their own investigations of the parties involved in the suit. This usually involves each side interviewing the opposing party under oath. Sometimes third-parties to the case will be interviewed as well. Once the investigations are complete the opposing parties must exchange their records so that both parties have the same knowledge of the facts.

'''5 - Settlement'''
At this stage it is required that both parties discuss the possibility of coming to a settlement. With the discoveries done, it is usually clear on what the trial would turn on and the outcome can often be anticipated. A majority of parties settle at this stage resulting in a &quot;disposition without trial&quot;.

In the unlikely event that the parties would like to continue with the lawsuit, the judge will set a trial date upon which the parties will be able to argue their case in front of the judge.

'''6 - Trial'''
The Trial process involves each side to present their evidence and argument in front of a judge. The exact ordering of events can vary on circumstances but typically the trial goes as follows:

# Plaintiff's opening statement
# Plaintiff calls evidence
# Possible motion to dismiss
# Defence's opening statement
# Defence calls evidence
# Defence closing statement
# Plaintiff's closing statement

'''7 - Decision'''
Once the judge had heard all the evidence, he or she will either give their opinion orally from the bench or else will &quot;reserve&quot; their judgement. A reserved judgement means that the judge will give the judgement in writing at a later date, within six months of the trial date.  

'''8 - Enforcement'''

'''9 - Appeal'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once a client has been properly informed of their options and they have elected to start a lawsuit they must make an official announcement of their intention by submitting the proper &quot;commencement of proceedings&quot; forms.  Invariably, the plaintiff must submit an '''Originating Notice'''. However, there are two classes of Originating Notice, it can be submitted as an '''action''', or as an  '''application'''.

==Application==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This text is divided into two types of immigration, temporary and permanent.  Temporary immigration consists of all categories of people who enter Canada on a temporary basis, be it a tourist, a visitor, a student, or a temporary worker. Certain types of temporary immigrants are able to extend their visits indefinitely which can effectively make them almost permanent.  Permanent immigration, however, are those who would like to settle in Canada and take advantage of government services. This includes those seeking permanent residency or citizenship.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This text is intended as a reference manual to help those seeking a guide to help in the process of immigrating to Canada. The Government of Canada provides for a variety of avenues to enter Canada which vary from simple applications to very complex procedures. Figuring out the application on one's own, especially for those who's first language is not english, can very daunting. A good clear handbook for filing government applications can be invaluable for those who are planning to uproot their lives. It is a big choice for any person and there is always a shortage of good information. The guides provided by the government are always a useful starting point, however, they can often be confusing and there are plenty of gaps in their coverage. 

With the introduction of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2001, much of the immigration process has been revamped. Of particular note to those interested in applying to Canada is that the immigration officials are given significant discretion on evaluating many types of applications, so for filling out sponsorship forms, for example, there is an added responsibility to be clear, consistent, and comprehensive in the application. Again, the hope of this text is to provide detail into the added requirements that will make a strong application.

Much of the inspiration of this text is from my work with immigrants in helping them navigate the many government forms. Even after months working with them, the process can still become overwhelming. So a good reference book will always come in handy even for the most experienced. I hope to keep adding to this as I continue to learn more about the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Council Makeup'''

The United Nations Security Council is the most powerful branch of the UN and is the only one with the ability to threaten a country with repercussions for disobeying a resolution passed by it. The Council is made up of 5 permanent members with veto power (United States of America, United Kingdom, Russian Federation, France and China.) In addition it also consists of 10 other countries elected by the General Assembly to serve two year terms without veto power.

'''Requirements'''

Members of the Security Council must have a representative on location at the United Nations building in New York at all times in case an issue arises and needs to be dealt with rapidly. If an official UN emergency is declared, all Security Council Member nation representatives are required to assemble within a period of three hours. It is for this reason that a representative must be at the UN building in New York at all times. 

'''Purpose and Powers'''

The Council's purpose under the UN charter is to maintain international peace and security. The Security Council also recommends the next Secretary-General to the United Nations, in addition to recommendations for higher-up staff of the Secretariat. The Security Council also has the power to admit or reject a country into the UN as an official Member State.

The Council has the power to implement many consequences against a country which has acted against the interest of the UN or international community. The Council can issue sanctions, deploy peacekeeping troops and recommend that a state be expelled from the United Nations entirely.

The five winning Allied powers of World War II, (the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the Russian Federation) were awarded the right of '''veto power''' in 1945 shortly after the founding of the United Nations and the ratification of the UN Charter. Veto power dictates that if one of the five powers finds a '''resolution''' (a UN declaratory document) to be unsuitable for whatever reason, the negative vote of any one of the five powers can make a resolution unusable. Veto power has been debated from the conceiving of the UN to present day, and has been the reason for the lack of UN reform and for some controversial issues such as the admission of Taiwan into the UN as a Member State. 

'''Other Notes'''

If a country is not currently on the Council but is effected by the issue being discussed the representative from said country is allowed to participate in the Security Council's discussion but not vote. This protocol is in place to ensure that all voices are heard in the discussion.

Under Resolution 2758, the United Nations General Assembly officially removed Taiwan from the UN. However, under the UN Charter it is under the jurisdiction of the Security Council to determine which countries are to be admitted or rejected. Only in the event when the Security Council cannot meet can the General Assembly have temporal jurisdiction over such a matter. Taiwan was removed by the General Assembly when the topic of Taiwan should have been transferred to the Security Council, in compliance with the articles on UN administration, found in the UN Charter.

Although common denotation of the five allied powers can be used casually, (such as referring to the United Kingdom as &quot;Great Britain&quot;), the five powers registered into the UN under official names:

 United States of America
 United Kingdom
 France
 China
 Russian Federation

I'd hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such thing as a &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot;. The &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; was a political idea which
has effectively gotten the boot after Croats' unrest in students' demonstrations in 1971.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Today's countryside has, worldwide, been shaped and maintained largely by farming activities, and most semi-natural areas are managed with agricultural production as a prime motivation. However, changes in farming practices have reduced the value to wildlife of many farms.

The first comprehensive national discussion on agri-ecological management to increase farm biodiversity in the United Kingdom was signalled by a conference organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group of Agricultural and Conservation Organisations.  This took place in July 1969 at the Silsoe Agricultural College, Bedfordshire.  For the first time farmers and conservationists met to make bridges between the two extremes of land management.  The weekend conference focused on the management of Pendley Grove Farm, a collection of farmed fields made available for delegates to suggest proposals to couple arable and livestock farming with management objectives in order to increase wildlife.  A report on the meeting, 'Farming &amp; Wildlife: A study in compromise', was published in 1971 (Barber, 1971). A most important event following the Silsoe weekend took place in Dorset on the 25th-26th July 1970. Here a 320-acre enterprise, East Farm, Hammoon in the Blackmore Vale, near Sturminster Newton, was surveyed in even greater detail than Pendley Grove, and the study in reconciliation between wildlife and farming widened to include forestry and hunting, as well as freshwater fishing interests.

At East Farm a fundamental issue, which arose at Silsoe, again came well to the fore in the Dorset discussions. It's an issue of applied ecology which relates to the 'strategy' of planning a farm for wildlife interests, in contrast to a series of ad hoc measures carried out by a farmer, which might suitably be referred to as 'tactics'.

There is a wealth of difference between a number of unrelated actions on a farm, such as leaving hedges for the sake of leaving hedges (however desirable the retention of any hedge might be) and the planting of an odd clump of trees to improve the view, and an integrated conservation plan for a farm based on a full understanding of how to provide the most valuable and varied habitats. For it is very desirable that there is a connection between the various physical features. Mammals, many birds - particularly game birds - and some insects need to use connecting lines, travel-ways, flyways, stepping stones, between isolated parcels of trees; and hedges in most instances, wild patches become much more valuable as habitats if they form uninterrupted links.

Reference was made at the Dorset meeting to the extraordinary amount of activity, which the Silsoe conference had triggered off and which coincided with all the publicity attaching to European Conservation Year in 1971. There was now, it was said, a steadily increasing interest in planting patches of woodland, shelter belts and field corners, and one prominent agriculturalist stated that he had no doubt that farmers would be planting thousands of acres throughout the country during the next decade.  However, the sponsors of the conferences were not so optimistic. It seemed pertinent to ask whether the trees would always be planted in the most appropriate place and whether full acknowledgement would be made of the need to ensure, farm requirements permitting, that this relatively new concept of providing connecting ecological links will be applied.

In many cases a series of unrelated actions on a farm was all that was hoped for, but the importance of this particular issue of integrating physical features was an important matter of applied ecology.  It was considered to be a vital part of the conservation message going out to the farming and land-owning community.

In fact it took another twenty years before the Silsoe proposals developed as an integrated government policy, which was set out in the 1994 UK Biodiversity Action Plan.  In the meantime pilot schemes had been organised and several national programmes were developed, but the loss of farmland habitats continued, with government subsidies for drainage and hedgerow removal. Between 1984 and 1990 there was a net loss of 23% of hedges (about 130,000 km) in Great Britain. The net loss of hedges was the result of a combination of hedge removal and hedge degradation, and it occurred despite the planting/ regeneration of about 50,000 km of hedges. In addition to the reduction in the extent of this important linear habitat, there was also a lost of quality. Between 1978 and 1990, on average one plant species was lost from each 10 metres of hedge, an 8% loss of plant species diversity.

Nevertheless, at the time the strategy was published, Silsoe and other initiatives had resulted in several integrated farming and conservation programmes initiated by government agencies.  These were initiatives in applied ecology to integrate agricultural and environmental objectives designed to conserve and enhance wildlife habitats in the farmed countryside. They were targeted at selected areas and habitats to help secure biodiversity objectives.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) were run by the territorial agricultural departments, this scheme was targeted on areas of high conservation value. It provided incentives to farmers and crofters to protect and enhance environmental features of their land and to prevent damage to landscapes and wildlife, which might result from some types of agricultural intensification.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A ‘Countryside Stewardship Scheme’ for England and ‘Tir Cymen’ a payment by results scheme being trialled in Wales (run by the Countryside Commission and the Countryside Council for Wales), were pilot projects offering a flexible system of incentives to farmers and land managers to conserve, enhance and in some instances recreate, selected important landscapes and their wildlife habitats in England and Wales.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Wildlife Enhancement Scheme’ aimed to develop a new and more positive working relationship with owners and occupiers of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and to make full use of their land management skills and experience of local conditions. English Nature launched this three-year pilot scheme in 1991. By the end of March 1993 the scheme had been extended to cover four areas. An essential part of the scheme required land managers to record what they had done on the land in a way that could be used by English Nature. This information was then used to fine tune management practices in the light of experience to achieve the best results for wildlife. Under the scheme a straightforward management agreement and management plan was agreed with English Nature in return for a fixed annual payment, which reflected the additional costs of managing the SSSI for wildlife. Provision was also made for fixed cost works such as fencing which are needed to allow grazing for conservation purposes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme’ was run by the territorial agricultural departments.  The scheme allowed grants to be paid to farmers for capital works, which have an environmental value including traditional field boundaries and shelterbelts, and heather management.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Farm Woodland Premium Scheme’ was also run by the territorial agricultural departments, this scheme offered incentives to farmers to plant and maintain primarily broad-leaved woodlands on farms, thereby contributing to biodiversity and providing other environmental benefits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ‘Hedgerow Incentive Scheme’ was run by the Countryside Commission, this scheme offered incentives to secure the long-term well being and environmental value of threatened hedgerows, through the re-introduction of beneficial management. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In addition to these economic incentives, free technical advice was made available for farmers on pollution and conservation issues, in the form of on-farm visits and Codes of Practice, for example on ‘Good Upland Management’ and on ‘Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water, Air and Soil’. Opportunities for enhancing biodiversity include encouraging the use of traditional, long established livestock breeds that are adapted to the climate and topography of each region. Where necessary, regulations were also used to provide essential environmental safeguards, in connection with, for example, the approval of pesticides and the storage of slurry and agricultural fuelled oil. Underpinning all these initiatives was the Government's R&amp;D programme, designed to improve understanding of the complex interactions between UK agriculture and the environment (it received £67 million in 1992/3).

All of these initiative appeared in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. This was an important outcome from the Rio Environment Summit of 1992 and in effect it set out how ecology should be applied and integrated with agricultural production. The strategy emphasised the significance for eco-agricultural systems in relation to the fact that almost 77% of the UK land surface is in farming use.   Agriculture is, therefore, a key determinant of the Nation’s biodiversity, and farmers and landowners are key partners in implementing measures to further biodiversity. 

Within the relatively small area of the UK there is a great diversity of farming types. This reflects a varied climate, geology, soils and local traditions. Each farming type makes its own contribution to biodiversity, and many habitats and species depend upon traditional agricultural practices for their survival. Agricultural habitats may be highly diverse at the local level. Others may have relatively low local biodiversity, but nonetheless support unusual assemblages of species, which are nationally or internationally rare, and therefore contribute to global biodiversity.

Maintaining biodiversity can have commercial benefits for agriculture. For example, biological pest control - which has been developed through an understanding of ecosystems and predator/prey relationships - has in some cases allowed a reduction in the use of pesticides. An attractive countryside, rich in wildlife, is also a basis for farm diversification through the growth in farm tourism, and can bring benefits to the wider rural economy.

Biodiversity has played a vital role in enabling agriculture to develop to its current productive state. Genetic variation has allowed plant breeders to select desirable characteristics and manipulate plant character and productivity. Maintaining genetic diversity will be a significant factor in the stability and future development of agriculture, while modern biotechnology is likely to lead to the cultivation of new crops and crop strains for food and industrial use. On the other hand, a reduction in the variety of crops and livestock may result in greater vulnerability to disease and pest attack.

With regards threats and opportunities, the UK biodiversity strategy singled out three main concerns:

* the continuing loss and fragmentation of habitats such as chalk grassland, heather moorland, hay meadows and wetlands, as a result of such factors as intensified farming practices, land drainage and abstraction of water and road construction;
* the loss of habitats, linear features such as hedgerows, field margins and ditches, and individual species resulting from neglect or abandonment, and from the decline of traditional forms of management as they become increasingly uneconomic and difficult to sustain;
* damage to soils, water and ecosystems caused by inappropriate use of fertilisers and pesticides and atmospheric pollution.

Biodiversity is enhanced by policies, which encourage land management practices, which produce benefits for wildlife. The aim of such policies is to: 

* protect and maintain existing wildlife features and habitats, which are important for biodiversity; 
* enhance the wildlife value of farmland, which is of low biodiversity at present;
* take advantage of opportunities to establish new, permanent areas of conservation value, especially when identifying alternative uses for agricultural land.

Opportunities for enhancing biodiversity include:

* recognising and strengthening those regional and local farming and land management practices that enhance the national diversity of flora and fauna, habitats, landscapes, historical features and character, and which will help to strengthen links between land use and local community identity;
* improving livestock management to minimise pollution from wastes and establishing stocking densities on moors, heaths and semi-natural grasslands which are related more closely to the environmental carrying capacity of the land;
* improving crop management to reduce the need for fertilisers and pesticides;
* encouraging the use of traditional, long established livestock breeds and crop varieties, which are adapted to the climate, and topography of each region;
* recognising the importance of those traditional skills and practices used by those who manage land, and upon which many valued habitats depend.
* introducing greater diversity on the farm, for example through the encouragement of reversion of arable land to pastoral use in appropriate areas and the wider use of rotations in arable farming;
* maintaining hedges, where possible and appropriate to the area concerned;
* withdrawing from productive agriculture altogether in selected areas and allowing natural succession to take its course.

This broad review sets out scope of the field of agro-ecological systems.  Updates are required from the 1994 baseline with regards, legislation, policy, strategy and examples of operational management.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book arose from a discussion point in the Ecology Wikibook, which pointed to the need for 'conservation management' to be included.  I have close contact with university students and land managers, where the need seems to be for a text book on applied ecology that centres on the long-term sustainable management of the outcomes of things like, reclamation of industrial sites, and reintroductions of rare species.  This would obviously grow into a big project, with distinctive subject matter, so I decided to start it as a separate book.  It is at a very early stage, and I must say I miss the availability of integral Wiki software for making mind maps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scale of action==
[[Image:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|400px]]
Biological conservation management applies ecological '''evidence''' and practical '''experience''' to formulate and implement actions to maintain or attain a specific '''ecological objective''', which is agreed upon by consensus and/or prescribed by legislation. 

On a global scale the concept of  Earth being a '''single system''' is easy to comprehend. The material resources are '''finite''', and significant amounts of matter are neither lost nor gained across the boundary between atmosphere and space. Our planet is essentially a closed system with respect to matter but an open one so far as energy is concerned (Phillipson 1975). Radiant energy from the sun enters the biosphere and is re-radiated to space as heat. The maintenance of global stability requires that the biospheric inputs and outputs of energy equal each other over time; if this equality is severely disrupted then unstable conditions will persist until the changed amounts of input and output equalize and a new equilibrium is achieved. 

'''Global warming''' is a clear indication of unstable, non-equilibrium conditions.  A new equilibrium will eventually be reached but the question is whether, when it is reached, will conditions be suitable for human existence and well being.

The '''biosphere''' provides the scale on which global conservation strategies and management operations function.  The natural resources of the biosphere are, in effect, assets; as such they can be categorized as either fixed or current. The fixed assets are the non-living (abiotic) components, exemplified by gases (the atmosphere), water bodies (the hydrosphere), and solid inorganic matter (the lithosphere); together these constitute the physico-chemical environment. The current assets are the living (biotic) components—a potentially renewable stock of plants (flora) and animals (fauna). Transfers within and between the two major types of asset can, and do, take place; for example, the daily exchanges of heat energy between atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere and also the biological processes of photosynthesis and decomposition which involve energy transformations and exchange of chemical elements between abiotic and biotic parts of the biosphere.  

The virtually closed biosphere is clearly a mosaic of many interacting smaller systems in which the sum of the parts is more stable than any one of the constituent parts. Biospheric stability and local ecosystem stabilities are inextricably linked; on these grounds alone a strong case can be made for protecting the Earth's natural ability to regulate its own stability by maintaining habitat diversity.  Management of the biosphere's present habitat diversity and natural resources is multinational.  In 1973 it was estimated that 174 nations each had a  share of global assets, which included 1841 thousand million metric tonnes dry mass of plant material (Phillipson 1973).

On a smaller local or regional scale every ecosystem—be it on land or in the ocean—is, like the biosphere, a functioning system. Unlike the biosphere, however, significant amounts of matter can be lost or gained across boundaries (which are frequently difficult to define). Ecosystems smaller than the biosphere are essentially '''open systems''' with respect to matter as well as energy. Left unperturbed over ecological or evolutionary time the constituent ecosystems of the biosphere will, as a result of interactions between organisms and environment, also reach a state of equilibrium; classical examples of this are mature tropical forests and well-established coral reefs. Because of the dynamic nature of the interactions between living and non-living components,  ecosystems smaller than  the biosphere rarely achieve a fixed and lasting equilibrium, and instead exhibit varying degrees of fluctuation (Phillipson 1989a).

Commitment to conservation, including sustainable development objectives, appears to be strongest when:

*an influential leader declares it should be so;
*non-government agencies actively promote conservation;
*local people become involved in conservation projects;
*local people benefit either financially or in kind as a result of conservation activities;
*the country itself makes a substantial contribution in cash or kind to conservation.

==Systems thinking==
[[File:Ecosystem Componants.jpg|right]]
Ecological thinking is about studying organisms in space and time, classifying patterns of distribution and describing the response of populations to physical/biological factors and the impact of human exploitation.  This basic ecological knowledge is '''applied''' to make conservation management plans in order to predict the consequences of a particular action in a conservation management system.  

A conservation management system is based on evidence about:

* boundaries (e.g. the study of species area relationships)
* distributions of species (e.g. the study of effects of local variations in light)
* classification of communities (e.g. vegetation analysis)
* inputs and flows of energy (e.g. analysis of food chains)
* inputs and cycling of nutrients (e.g. measurement of nutrient reservoirs)
* behaviour of populations in response to: -
**physical factors such as climate, geography and soils;
**biological factors such as disease and predation;
**human factors connected with the use of land and water; such as pollution; 
**the exploitative management of species and habitats; such as hunting. 
**experience from management systems for the same species in similar habitats

Conservation management implies the control of environmental and socioeconomic factors in order:

*to make more efficient use of materials, 
*to recycle materials and energy that are vital to human survival, 
*to restore derelict land 
*and to maintain the capacity of ecosystems, which are the basis of all economies, to renew and grow.  

This is a vast area of applied science and technology, which is developing alongside new social organisations that are changing cultural attitudes towards the value of natural resources.  

Over the years, particularly at a governmental level, conservation management has come to focus on biological resources such as:

*Agriculture and pastoralism
*Fisheries
*Forest ecosystems
*Water
*Tourism and recreation
*Wildlife
*Genetic resources

From this perspective the aim is to foster attitudes in community and industry to the use of biological resources, changing from the 'maximum yield' approach to one of ecologically sustainable yield.  This new attitude recognises the need for conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecological integrity.

==Strategies and operations==

Since the first Earth Summit in 1992, national strategies are now commonly in place to integrate conservation management within and between industries and communities to meet appropriate environmental, economic and social objectives.  The practical aim is now to turn these strategies into operational systems and so balance exploitative management of natural resources with their conservation management.  The goal is to provide the principles and tools to soften the clash between Earth’s ability to sustain life and the character of its human occupancy.  This means developing methods for biological conservation management alongside softer technological organisations for production (natural economy) and ‘green’ legislative actions for the organisation of people for production (political economy).  

The global educational topic-framework, which links conservation management with exploitative management, has been defined as ‘cultural ecology’.  It is within this area of knowledge that conservation management systems can be seen to require more than the scientific input of conservation biology.  The essential feature of conservation management programmes is that they are part of the linkages between environmental, social and economic progress; between peace and security; between productivity of environment and community; and between sustainability and the renewal and extension of democracy. In this sense, conservation management is about working on behalf of ecosystems to restore a culture where people are engaged with their place on the planet for the long term future.

It is commonplace to hear conservation managers stress that they are really naturalists who do their best to apply good science to ecosystems that are unique in each case history.  No two sites share the same history and factors limiting their biodiversity. They will differ with respect to time lags and non-linear responses to a given intervention.  From this point of view conservation systems have much in common with the management systems of farmers and gardeners with regards uncertainties of the effects of inputs.  Because of the internal complexity of ecosystems, science has yet to answer fundamental question that were posed by Darwin regarding the factors that control relative abundance of species, with respect to space, time, pattern, food chains and population dynamics. There are fundamental questions in ecological science that underpin all conservation management systems.

[[File:East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve map (en).png|right|400px|East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve map (en)]]

Every nature reserve is likely to have some or all of the following questions unanswered:

* How do organisms change with space?
*: e.g. What constitutes and adequate size and shape of a reserve?
* How do organisms change with time?
*: e.g. To what extent is the site a successional process?
* How do organisms exist in patterns?
*: e.g. How many states or ‘ways to be’ are there for a particular compositional state of a habitat?
* How do organisms exist in food chains?
*: e.g. What is the importance of keystone resources in maintaining community structure?
* How do organisms exist in populations?
*: e.g. What is a sustainable population size for a particular species?

Answers to these questions are embedded in the conservation management system.  All environmental systems are '''open systems''' with throughputs of matter and energy whilst maintaining structure and permanence in the medium term.  A conservation management system will become part of this ecosystem with linkages to several feedback mechanisms, some positive and some negative, so that feedback loops can be unpredictable.  This situation makes it virtually impossible to map the system as a whole, and usually the feedback is only revealed as an unexpected response, once management has commenced.  It is in this sense that a management plan can be considered as the first stage of a research project, and the plan is adapted in response to its outcomes. 

The aim of this chapter is to exemplify the application of the above five pillars of ecology to conservation management systems.

== Conservation management systems ==

A conservation management system is a procedure for maintaining a species or habitat in a particular state. It is a means whereby humankind secures wildlife in a favourable condition for contemplation, education or research, in perpetuity. It is an important topic in cultural ecology, where conservation management counterbalances the unchecked exploitative management of natural resources. Conservation management systems are vital for turning sustainable development strategies into successful operations.

=== The UK experience ===
As a British idea the concept of a national conservation management system may be traced to an upsurge of sentiment after the Second World War that the world should be made a better place. It was the botanist Arthur Tansley who pleaded for organised nature conservation on the double ground of scientific value and beauty. He had advanced the concept of the ecosystem in 1935, and a number of key ideas of relevance to nature conservation stem from this. In the immediate post-war years, he hoped for an ‘Ecological Research Council’, and a ‘National Wildlife Service’. In this context, the idea of national standards of conservation management can be traced to the formation of the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), and its great survey of habitats and species, the Nature Conservation Review, published in 1977. From this time there was general agreement that the common purpose of conservation management systems was to transform situations of ecological confrontation between humans and non-humans into a system of mutual accommodation. The NCC’s first guidelines for managing its national resource was a pro forma to accommodate a description of the site, the goals of management, and a prescriptive section, in which the objectives of management were to be interpreted in a practical manner. Central to the latter section were lists of codified jobs to help wardens abide by best practice. The major shortcoming of the guidelines was the lack of a business philosophy to track value for the inputs of effort and resources.

Britain’s first proper conservation management system (CMS), which tied objectives to practical interventions with feedback from monitoring outcomes, coalesced around Mike Alexander (Warden of Skomer Island National Nature Reserve), Tim Read (staff member of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee) and James Perrins (an environmental/IT graduate of York University). This initiative in the 1980s led to the setting up of the CMS Partnership by the UK’s main conservation agencies, which produced a relational database for linking management objectives with scheduled on-site operational inputs. The database recorded all actions, particularly the results of monitoring against performance indicators. Over the years the software has improved greatly with respect to the user/screen interface, but the data model is still very much the same as in the original programme, which was produced with ‘Advanced Revelation’. Although the NCC has been replaced by four country agencies, in terms of the widespread uptake of the CMS across the UK, the current version, mounted on MS Access, is now, de facto, a national conservation management system. As its use becomes more widespread CMS plans are beginning to function as an evidence-based library of best practice for exchanging practical know how between users.

=== Data model of a conservation management system (CMS) ===
A CMS is simply a recording and filing tool that aids and improves the way in which heritage green assets are managed and kept in a favourable condition. Its prime function is to keep track of the inputs, outputs and outcomes of projects to meet measurable objectives. The aim is to promote efficient and effective operations, and allow recording of the work that was done and reporting on whether or not the objective was achieved. A CMS also enables the exchange of information about methods and achievements within and between organisations. These are essential components of a CMS of any scale, whether a national park, or a village pond.

Technically, a CMS is a project-based planning and recording system aimed at managing conservation features within acceptable limits of variation. A feature is any component of the environment that has to be managed e.g. a footpath or a species. A 'project' is simply a programme of work leading to an output e.g. 'construct a footpath', 'patrol an area' or 'record a species'. Projects are work plans that control specific factors that help or impede the attainment of management objectives. Each project includes a description of a process, e.g. the work to be done, when and where it is to be done and the inputs of resources required. When a project is completed, what was actually done is recorded. This is an output. The outcome of a CMS is the state of the feature at the end of the project and is measured by performance indicators. Performance indicators are quantitative or qualitative attributes of the features e.g. numbers of a species, and they are measured by special monitoring-projects in order to gauge success in reaching the management objectives. Copies of all projects with their inputs, outputs and outcomes are retained in the CMS to provide a progress- register, and an archive to support managerial continuity.

In summary, the prime function of a CMS is to enable conservation managers to control the operational functions of a management plan as a feedback system or work-cycle by:-

identifying and describing, in a standard way, all the tasks required to control the key factors (positive of negative), which influence the condition of the features, and thereby maintain the features in a favourable condition; 
producing and budgeting various work programmes to control the factors, for example five-year plans, rolling- plans, annual schedules, financial schedules, and work schedules for specified categories of staff; 
providing a site/species monitoring system to check the effectiveness of the plan against the specified objectives; 
facilitating the exchange of management information by reporting, within, and between, sites and organisations; 
using feedback from monitoring to improve the management system. 
The sequence of identifying features, setting objectives, and then selecting the factors to be controlled by projects with scheduled work plans, comprises a management plan.

The most effective way of organising a CMS is to assemble it as a set of interlinked forms as a relational database. However, it is also possible to operate a management plan with a spread sheet or a collection of hyperlinked ‘to-do’ lists.

== Scope of conservation management ==
Conservation management implies the control of environmental and socioeconomic factors in order:

* to make more efficient use of materials, 
* to recycle materials and energy that are vital to human survival, 
* to restore derelict land 
* and to maintain the capacity of ecosystems, which are the basis of all economies, to renew and grow. 

This is a vast area of applied science and technology, which is developing alongside new social attitudes towards the values of natural resources.

Over the years, particularly at a governmental level, conservation management has come to focus on biological resources such as:

* Agriculture and pastoralism 
* Fisheries 
* Forestry 
* Water 
* Tourism and recreation 
* Wildlife 
* Genetic resources 

From this perspective the aim is to foster attitudes in community and industry to the use of biological resources, changing from the 'maximum yield' approach to one of ecologically sustainable yield. This new attitude recognises the need for conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecological integrity.

Since the first Global Environment Summit in 1992, national strategies are now commonly in place to integrate regimes of conservation management within and between industry sectors and communities to meet appropriate environmental, economic and social objectives. The practical aim is now to turn these strategies into operational systems and so balance exploitative management of natural resources with their conservation management. The goal is to provide the principles and tools to soften the clash between Earth’s ability to sustain life and the character of its human occupancy. This means developing methods for biological conservation management alongside softer technological organisations for production (natural economy) and ‘green’ legislative actions for the organisation of people for production (political economy). The global educational topic-framework, which links conservation management with exploitative management, has been defined as ‘cultural ecology’. It is within this area of knowledge that conservation management systems can be seen to require more than the scientific input of conservation biology. The essential feature of conservation management programmes is that they are part of the linkages between environmental, social and economic progress; between peace and security; between productivity of environment and community; and between sustainability and the renewal and extension of democracy. This is a roundabout way of saying that conservation management is about working on behalf of the wild to restore a culture, where people live and think as if they were totally engaged with their place on the planet for the long future.

== Fundamental scientific questions ==
It is commonplace to hear conservation managers stress that they are really naturalists who do their best to apply good science to ecosystems that are unique in each case history. No two nature sites share the same history and factors limiting their biodiversity. They will differ with respect to time lags and non-linear responses to a given intervention. From this point of view conservation systems have much in common with the management systems of farmers and gardeners with regards uncertainties of the effects of inputs. Because of the internal complexity of ecosystems, science has yet to answer fundamental question that were posed by Darwin regarding the factors that control relative abundance of species, with respect to space, time, pattern, food chains and population dynamics. Every nature reserve is likely to have some or all of the following questions unanswered. They are fundamental questions in ecological science that underpin all conservation management systems.

* How do organisms change with space?
*: e.g. What constitutes and adequate size and shape of a reserve? 
* How do organisms change with time?
*: e.g. To what extent is the site a successional process? 
* How do organisms exist in patterns?
*: e.g. How many states or ‘ways to be’ are there for a particular compositional state of a habitat? 
* How do organisms exist in food chains? 
*: e.g. What is the importance of keystone resources in maintaining community structure?
* How do organisms exist in populations?
*: e.g. What is a sustainable population size for a particular species? 

Answers to these questions are embedded in the management system. All environmental systems are open systems with throughputs of matter and energy whilst maintaining structure and permanence in the medium term. A conservation management system will become part of this ecosystem with linkages to several feedback mechanisms, some positive and some negative, so that feedback loops can be unpredictable. This situation makes it virtually impossible to map the system as a whole, and usually the feedback is only revealed as an unexpected response, once management has commenced. It is in this sense that a management plan can be considered as the first stage of a research project, and the plan is changed in response to its outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==High Level Languages==

High-level languages are usually problem-oriented. This means that most (but not all) high-level languages are written to solve problems in specific areas. As a result there are lots of different high-level languages available to the programmer - some sources on the Internet list over 2,000 of them. This can make the process of selecting the most suitable language a daunting task. 

There are several things which a programmer can use to select a suitable language. These include:
* Looking at the facilities offered by the language and comparing them to the problem
* How well the programme needs to interact with other existing programmes
* The suitability of the input or output to match the user's needs
* How experienced the programmer is with a particular language
* The cost of the necessary compiler/interpreter
* How long it will take to learn a new language if necessary

No programmer can have a good knowledge of all the current computer languages currently on the market. Existing languages are always being upgraded and added to and new ones are being developed to cope with new situations.

High level languages can be classified by the way in which they are organised. This method of organisation is beter known as a paradigm of which there are a recognised number.

===Imperative / Procedural Programming Languages===

An imperative is a command that must be obeyed and that is exactly how an imperative language works. Such a language consists of a long list of instructions that the computer will carry out. It will always carry out exactly the same process as long as exactly the same variables are inputted. The variables allow the user to exercise control over the programme but it will still be executed in a similar way.

Some examples of imperative languages include:
* '''Fortran''' - designed to help with mathematical and scientific products.
* '''COBOL''' (Common Business Oriented Language) - developed specifically to handle files of data and is supported by powerful search and report creation routines.
* '''BASIC''' (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) - originally created to allow students to create simple computer program. In recent years, Microsoft has derived Visual Basic from the original language and has taken it towards being object-oriented.
* '''Java''' - In recent years this language has become associated with the Internet and creating online applications but was originally used to programme the chips in mobile telephones and pagers. This language allows a developer to create standalone program called 'applets' which will run without the use of an interpreter.

===Logic and Declarative Languages===

A declaration is where a statement is made. In the context of programming languages, with a declarative you give facts and rules to the computer which can then be queried to give data back.

==Object-Oriented Programming==

Object-Orientated programs consist of a number of interacting objects. The objects each have properties and behaviours, much like physical objects. This similarity to the physical world is often used when modelling an existing system, or theorizing about the action of the program. The objects are similar to procedural programmes in that they have variables, methods and functions. 

A key difference between an object and a section of linear code is that the variables, methods and functions may have restrictions placed on their use. By not allowing direct access to the state but instead carrying out any changes itself the object can ensure the consistency of its own state. This property is called '''Object Encapsulation''', it is one of the primary reasons that object orientated programming is better suited to complex problems than linear code. In linear code it is common to store the state of the system in a series of global variables, accessible by any part of the program. Object encapsulation allows each object to be reasoned about without having to consider the problems of possible side-effects from code in another object. 

Objects have two parts, the state of the object and the behaviours. The state of the object is stored in a number of variables while the behaviour is defined within the methods and functions. An object is defined by a ‘class’. The ‘class’ is a definition of the variables needed and the code for the methods. When an object orientated program is running only a single copy of the class is required in memory, but multiple sets of state may be created. These sets of state are referred to as objects as the compiler, interpreter or runtime environment hides the sharing of class information.

When an object orientated program starts there are no objects, so how are objects created? The program loader is given an initial class to load into memory and an initial method to then start processing. This first method is then responsible for creating further objects, which may create more objects still.

Object orientated programmes also lend themselves to having one or more concurrent flows of processing within the collection of objects.

Instantiation, classes, inheritance, multiple inheritance, polymorphism.

Object-Oriented programming takes the idea of physical real life objects such as &quot;chairs&quot; and &quot;people&quot; and uses this concept within a programming language. It sets the basic foundation as the &quot;Object&quot; which can be assigned variables (e.g. a name, a persons age) and methods (e.g. a method to call to return the name stored within the object). These objects are then used together to build up a program.

==Declarative Programming==

In contrast to functional and object oriented languages a declarative language such as prolog contains assertions about the problem domain, often in the form of tuples.  The language runtime is most often interactive and allows queries to be entered.  The language then uses the declarations to deduce the answer.

==Data Structures==
Data Structures relates to Data Algorithms and Data Restructring for defining good data base management systems.

==Algorithms==

Algorithm is the step wise representation without any application of any particular logic .e.g.
in the programme to add 3 numbers
'''step1'''-start
'''step2'''-take numbers m1, m2, m3,temp.
'''step3'''-take m1=1,m2=2,m3=3.
'''step4'''- add the three numbers.
'''step5'''-temp=m1+m2+m3(value of addition goes to temp)
'''step6'''-print temp.
'''step7'''-stop

I'm definitely no expert on the subject, but it seems to me there is no real information in this chapter/how to. To me, it only says: &quot;first solve the center, then solve the rest&quot;.

A 2x2x2 is not solved the same way as a 3x3x3's corners would be solved assuming that 3x3x3's edges are solves. One must consider parity when solving a 2x2x2, which is not neccesary in a 3x3x3 whose edges are solved.&lt;small&gt;22:38, 23 October 2008 71.89.38.41&lt;/small&gt;

:This doesn't seem to tell how to pair the edges in a 4x4x4 or higher, just how to solve a 2x2x2 and 3x3x3, which I already know how to do &lt;small&gt;20:08, 27 October 2008 69.0.8.183&lt;/small&gt;

You are wrong on all accounts. I vote to remove your post here.

The guide (for solving a 3x3x3) is concise yet complete in a manner that a beginner could employ. So you're dead wrong there.

Your suggestion is horrid as well. The best way to teach how to solve an NxNxN cube is to teach the 3x3x3 solution, then to teach how to reduce the 4x4x4 to a 3x3x3 in a very general way. If you do it in a way specific to the 4x4x4 you will have to teach the 5x5x5 as well, if you teach center solving and edge pairing and the only two parity cases that can be forced in a general manner, then after the 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 are taught, anyone can solve any size of cube.

Again, you are incorrect. A 2x2x2 is indeed solved the same way as a 3x3x3's corners. There is no doubt about that. There is no parity on a 2x2x2. You are making an over generalization that parity occurs in all even-numbered cubes. That only holds for 4 and higher so you are completely wrong.

Olympic cubes only go up to 7 in size. Verdes might release 8 through 11 later on. It could be years.

I don't think you said one thing that was correct or true in any sense. &lt;small&gt;20:44, 31 March 2009 99.9.85.194&lt;/small&gt;

:My, my, my. Questions are not &quot;wrong.&quot; Asking for help or information is not &quot;wrong.&quot; And even incorrect answers, given in an attempt to be helpful, are not &quot;wrong,&quot; and correction of the errors then helps others who might have been under the same misapprehension. And we don't ordinarily remove discussion, even if &quot;wrong.&quot;

:I don't know who is correct here, on the substance, I don't know the Rubik's Cube, but I do know ordinary courtesy, and this wasn't it. This person, with all their knowledge (real or imagined), didn't take the opportunity to improve the page, at least not as IP. Maybe this was [[Special:Contributions/Tobad8]]? (Only one contribution, to the page, removing hints for solving a 2x2x2 cube. Too bad, but, I suppose, it takes all kinds. I'm restoring that, since it was removed without any discussion of it.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dessydes. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dessydes~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clear the rifle and make it safe. To avoid accidental firing, always look into the chamber after clearing the weapon to make sure it does not contain a round. Also, stick a finger into the ejection port and into the chamber (you may need to use your pinky if your hands are large) to feel if there is a round in the chamber. This is the method taught by the USMC: &quot;visually and physically inspect the chamber&quot;. This is a good habit to get into because the physical inspection acts as a nice check of the visual inspection, and it works when visibility is obscured (e.g. in the dark).

:1. Place selector level to safe (this can only be done when the weapon is cocked).
:2. Remove the magazine by depressing the magazine catch, and pull the magazine forward.
:3. Lock the bolt open by pulling the cocking handle to the rear and engaging the bolt catch.
:4. Ensure that the selector is at safe and check in the chamber to make sure that it contains no ammunition. With the selector still at safe, press the upper half of the bolt catch allowing the bolt to go forward.
:5. Place the selector to SEMI and squeeze the trigger to release the tension on the hammer spring.

== Stripping ==

:1. Remove the sling if attached.
:2. Stand the weapon butt upright on a firm surface and depress the slip ring at the chamber end of the hand guard.
:3. Remove both sections of the hand guard from the slip ring and pull down to unclip from the foresight sleeve.
:4. Use a pen to push out the two takedown pins located at the rear of the selector switch and the front of the magazine housing to separate the upper receiver from the lower receiver.
:5. Pull back the charging handle assembly to remove the bolt carrier assembly.
:6. Remove the charging handle by pulling back and down.
:7. Move bolt assembly forward to unlocking position and remove firing pin retaining pin. Do not lose the firing pin retaining pin.
:8. Push in the bolt assembly to put in the locked position.
:9. Catch firing pin as it drops out of the rear of the bolt carrier assembly.
:10. Give the square cam pin a quarter turn and lift out.
:11. Remove bolt assembly from the bolt carrier assembly.

It is possible to strip the weapon further by removing the extractor and spring assembly. The buffer spring can be removed from the butt, but this is not normally done during daily stripping. Reassembly is a straight reversal of the stripping steps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Controversy == 

I'm pretty sure that this article might cause a bit of a discussion, if not a controversy. Bear in mind that Wikibooks is a textbook guide for various practical applications, and there have been other articles that have been nominated for deletion, due to the question of when is something a textbook, and when is something written for it's own sake. 

That all being said, I would not at all mind if the article was deleted, but not for the sake of controversy, but for practicaltiy. Remember, it's an article on field stripping, not marksmanship or  how to fire such a weapon. [[User:Dessydes|Dessydes]]

*I Strongly support the keeping of this article, and particularly the improving of it with various pictures etc. Wikibooks is not censored to only tell you what the government wants people to hear, and there lies one of its significant merits.

I see that you are adding in a deletion tag (using the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template) in several modules.  It would be very useful if you added some comment either in the discussion section of the module or added a comment directly to the deletion tag itself such as this:

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|obsolete content that has been replaced by [[XML:Some New Page]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

This gives us a better idea about why the content needs to be removed from Wikibooks and makes it easier to judge pages with a deletion request.  BTW, thank you for your contributions to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:33, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beer is made from four ingredients: water, grain, hops, and yeast. Each of these ingredients can have tremendous affect on the flavor, aroma, alcohol content, and &quot;mouth feel&quot; of the final beer. Sometimes, ''adjuncts'' are used to add characteristic flavors, and often nutrients and agents are used improve the life cycle of the yeast.

==Water==
Water is the largest ingredient (by volume or by weight) in the brewing process.

===Water chemistry===
If you are using tap water, boil the water for five minutes before using it to brewing to remove any chlorine. This will not be sufficient to remove chloramines. Potassium Metabisulfite can be used to remove chloramine.  A simple carbon filter will remove chloramines as well as other contaminants that may affect brewing or flavor.

Various minerals may be added to excessively soft water (e.g. rain water) for those recipes that require it: In particular, calcium is an essential cofactor for the enzyme alpha amylase, which is needed to turn the starch in the barley into sugars. Minerals which are often added to water include:
#Gypsum (Calcium sulfate)
#Epsom salts (Magnesium sulfate)
#Calcium Chloride
#Salt 
#Chalk (Calcium carbonate)



==Fermentables==
Fermentable sugars make up the primary ingredients of any beer, and are primarily obtained from grain, usually malted barley grain. Depending on the complexity of your brew, you may use barley malt, malt extract, and/or adjuncts to obtain the desired amount of fermentables in your wort (which is a sweet, unfermented liquid that can become beer, and is pronounced ''wert'').

=== Barley Malt ===
[[Image:malt-types.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Examples of malted barley]]
Barley grain, or seeds, are allowed to sprout for a short amount of time and then dried to prevent further growth. This process is called ''malting'' and allows the grain to convert part of its stored starches to starches that can easily be converted to fermentable sugars, and to produce enzymes and nutrients that are important later in the brewing process. Malts are often described as ''under modified'' or ''fully modified'' and this simply refers to how long the grain was allowed germinate, and thus how well the starches have been converted and most importantly how well those nutrients have developed. Sometimes, this malted barley will be further processed by roasting, toasting, or even smoking, to allow the brewmaster to add special characteristics or complement other flavors expected in the beer.

There are two main types of barley used to make malt; two row and six row. These terms refer to the number of barley corns in the sheaf. Six row barley tends to yield a larger amount of grain per measured area of farmland, but two row generally produces larger barley corns and thus a better yield of convertible starch per measured amount of grain. However, it is generally held that six row barley will have a higher ''enzymatic power'', which is important when using adjuncts without (or with very little of) the needed enzymes to convert their own starches during the brewing process (such as rice or corn).

Malt also varies in colour and its capacity to convert starch to sugar (diastatic power). This variation is determined by the modification level of the malt (described earlier) and by the length of time that the malt is heated after it has been germinated. Lagers and Pilseners tend to use undermodified malt, that is malt which the starch grains are relatively intact such as pale malt, while ales use more modified malts, such as crystal malts. Stouts use heavily modified malts such as chocolate, or roast barley (which technically is not a malt as it hasn't been germinated).

'' '''A note on enzymatic and diastatic powers''': enzymatic power refers to the ability of the malt to convert adjunct starches, diastatic refers to its ability to convert its own starches, which are roughly the same damn thing.''

=== Malt Extract ===
Malt extract is wort which has been concentrated, either by boiling down to a syrup (LME or Liquid Malt Extract) or by being spray-dried to a powder (DME or Dried Malt Extract). Depending on the source, your malt extract may be a self-contained wort concentrate, a single grain extract, or it can be described as something in between. Mountmellick Famous Irish Style Stout malt extract is an example of a self contained concentrated wort in that by simply dissolving the syrup into an appropriate amount of water you will have a fully developed wort, ready to be fermented. It has already gone through a process to extract the sugars from the grain and develop needed nutrients and flavor characteristics. Such prepared kits are invaluable to the first time homebrewer, since they will result in an acceptable beer while allowing the brewer to learn about the processes outside of the actual brewing.

However, to have more control of the flavor, body, alcohol content, and a host of other factors, a malt extract brewer will eventually start to mix and match differing amounts of different malt extracts that have been concentrated from liquid rich in fermentable sugars from differing amounts of barley malts and adjuncts. These malt extracts come from batches with varying degrees of plain malted barley, of varying degrees of modification, roasted barley malt, wheat malt and flakes, rice, corn, many other forms of grain, and even cane sugar. Often these extracts are sold without much indication of what went into them, merely saying &quot;Amber LME,&quot; &quot;dark LME,&quot; &quot;Light DME&quot; and so forth. While most extract recipes will also use such vague terminology, it might benefit the brewer to request information regarding the ingredients, since certain types of sugars can impart unwanted flavors in a beer if present in too large proportions.

=== Adjuncts ===
Adjuncts are sources of fermentable sugars that are not barley. Adjuncts should be used to add unique flavors, aromas, and head retention and body characteristics to a beer. Adjuncts can also be used to increase alcohol content, lower production costs, and add &quot;blanding&quot; characteristics. Major commercial breweries use adjuncts such as corn and rice to reduce production costs and, in conjunction with other techniques and additives, create a consistent but boring tasting beer. This allows them to produce a beer that will be accepted by a wider range of people, and keeping them, while using a minimal amount of capital. While this is good for business, as a home-brewer you are not going to sell your beer, so you should be concerned with what ''you'' like. You will likely find that you prefer unique flavors of your own devising to the lower cost of a simpler beer.

'''Commonly used adjuncts:'''
*Barley - Unmalted barley can contribute to head retention.
*Cane Sugar - Yes, cane sugar can be used to increase fermentables, but can (and usually will) impart a &quot;cidery&quot; taste to the finished beer.
*Corn - Corn starch can lighten the flavor and body of the beer. Some brewmasters claim it has a stabilizing affect on the flavor.
*Honey - If added at the beginning of the boil, the sugars in honey will break down become fermentable, however the most potent parts of the honey flavor will then be lost.
*Oats - Oats can add a meaty, heavy body flavor to a beer. Yes it will taste like oatmeal.
*Potato - A relatively neutral adjunct that can increase the amount of fermentables in the wort at low cost.
*Rice - Like corn, rice can lighten the flavor and body of the beer.
*Rye - Unmalted rye contributes a dry, crisp character.
*Wheat - Wheat malt can impart a sour flavor, unmalted wheat flour or flakes can assist head retention

==Hops==
The use of hops is one of, if not the most, important differences in the production of beer from the production of other alcoholic drinks. Without the bittering effect of hops, beer would be nothing more than a low alcohol wine made from barley (in fact, with a more alcohol-resistant strain of yeast and a slightly higher amount of fermentables, it ''would'' be a wine). Hops are used for three basic reasons: bittering, flavouring, and aroma. They also have somewhat of a preservative effect, although the extent of this effect is debated. In the days before refrigeration, shipments of beer on long voyages would often sour or spoil, due to bacterial or fungal infection or simply due to aging. Breweries often would steep herbs and plants in the unfermented wort to inhibit this spoilage and stabilize the flavour of the beer. Hops simply won out due to the popularity of the flavor, and the benefits it provided, such as improved head retention, clarification, and the counteraction to the sweet, sticky taste beer had otherwise.

Some examples of hop varieties are Hallertau Mittelfrueh, Tettnang, Spalt, Saaz, Mt. Hood, Perle, and Cascade, and they are available in whole form and pellets.

=== Bittering ===
The bitterness in a beer comes mainly from the ''alpha acid'' resins present in the hop flower, or cone. Hops are usually labelled according to % alpha acid, which can be used to determine the amount of a given kind of hops to produce a given level of bitterness.

Brewing scientists use International Bitterness Units (IBUs) in their calculations of the bitterness of a given beer. The units describe the amount of alpha acids per liter of wort. However, IBUs do not completely reflect the bitterness ''perceived'' in a beer because a given IBU in a light bodied beer will taste much more bitter than a heavy bodied beer with the same IBU. The alpha acids counteract the sweet flavors of the sugars, so the more sugars available, the more alpha acids required to counteract them.

A simpler method used in recipes is the Homebrew Bitterness Unit (HBU), which is simply the % alpha acid × the ounces of hops. Since hops of the same variety can vary from year to year in % alpha acid, this measurement can be useful to maintain consistency in the bitterness of a given recipe. Another unit that can be used is Metric Bitterness Units (MBU) which is calculated exactly as HBUs, but using grams instead of ounces.

Bitterness is extracted by boiling the hops in the wort for an hour or more. The alpha acids require the high temperature for so long to allow isomerization to occur, which is just a fancy word to describe the chemical reaction that causes the alpha acids to dissolve into the wort. The longer this reaction is allowed to occur, the better the utilization of the alpha acids will be, since more of it will be extracted.

=== Flavouring and Aroma ===
Hops also contain ''hop oils'' that have strong tastes and smells that many home-brewers find quite desirable. These oils, unlike alpha acids, ''are'' water soluble, and can quickly be extracted. However, because they are soluble, they will also &quot;boil away.&quot; So, to get the desirable flavors and aromas into the beer, Flavoring and aroma hops are added near the end of the boil, sometimes in two stages, and less often a brew master may &quot;dry hop&quot; the fermenting beer.

==Yeast==
Yeast is technically an ingredient, but yet it really isn't. Yeast can be thought of as the machine by which wort is turned into beer. Before the discovery of yeast, this process was considered somewhat magical, and beer was often fermented by wild strains of yeast, and sometimes by a strain of yeast found on a family's stir stick or in previously used fermentation barrels. In fact, the Reinheitsgebot of Germany stated that the only permissible ingredients in beer were barley, hops, and water. Often, fermenting beer would get contaminated with bacteria and/or undesirable strains of yeast, and barrels would be burned - not because of the contamination but because the barrel was &quot;cursed.&quot; A &quot;stir stick&quot; that was used in successful batches of beer would be considered blessed and would be treasured by its owners, not realizing that it was just infected with a desirable strain of yeast.

There are two main types of beer yeast; Ale and Lager. Ale yeast is top-fermenting and prefers temperatures from 60–70°F (15 - 21°C).  Ales are typically more complex than lagers, with more flavour and aroma components. Lager yeast is bottom-fermenting and prefers cooler temperatures.  It typically results in a cleaner tasting beer, without the estery character common to ales.

Yeast comes in two main forms, dried and liquid.  Dried yeast can be of very good quality (avoid that which comes with tins of malt extract, though), and is often more quickly active in a beer. It can produce a limited range of ales—beware that no dried yeast is truly a lager yeast, nor will it provide the distinctive lager character.  Dried yeasts are generally more effective if rehydrated prior to use.  Liquid yeasts are harder to store as they must be kept chilled prior to use.  There are many more strains of liquid yeast, and thus one can much more exactly reproduce a particular beer or style.  Dried yeast is typically used by beginners and liquid yeast by more advanced brewers, although there are exceptions on either end of the scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you continue to homebrew you will gather a collection of homebrewing equipment. This collection will continue to grow and evolve as you continue to brew and you find what works for you.


==Basic Homebrewing Equipment==
The equipment described here should be considered vital to any homebrewing set up. These items should be purchased from a reputable homebrew supply store, since the quality of materials and construction of these tools is of absolute importance. A brewer can choose to use sub-standard ingredients, and/or less than perfect brewing practices (with the exception of sanitation procedures), and still produce a drinkable beer. Conversely, even with the highest quality ingredients, and the perfect application of brewing procedures, use of poor quality equipment will invariably lead to disaster. When choosing equipment, purchase equipment made from stainless steel, high quality tempered glass, and food grade plastics when possible.

* '''Brew Kettle''' - A brew kettle should always be used to boil wort (unfermented beer) before pitching yeast. Some beer kits may claim that boiling is not mandatory, such as pre-hopped extract kits, but experienced brew masters know that hopping even pre-hopped extracts will result in a fresher taste and boiling ingredients will help prevent unwanted microbial infections. The kettle should be made of stainless steel, or aluminum.  While a 3-gallon capacity can be sufficient a larger kettle, capable of holing an entire batch with adequate space to contain foaming will improve the quality of beer produced.  Many homebrewers prefer a kettle with a ball valve attached, allowing simple gravity transfer to the fermenter. 
 
* '''Stove or Burner''' - Some method of heating the wort to boiling is needed.  Small batches can be boiled on a kitchen stove, however propane burner are preferred by many, as they can reduce the time needed to bring wort to a boil, and allows larger volumes of wort to be boiled.  

* '''Stirring Spoon''' - It is important to stir the wort while bringing it to a boil and while boiling to keep from scorching the solubles. The spoon should be steel or food grade plastic; never use wood or porous materials. Flavors from previous boils can transfer via porous materials, but even worse, so can bacteria.

* '''Fermenters''' - Your fermenter must be made of high quality food grade plastics or tempered glass. There are two types of fermenters commonly used by modern homebrewers; glass carboys and plastic buckets. A few homebrewers use stainless steel conical fermenters, which are similar to the tanks large brewerys use, however these are not necessary to produce great beer.  Generally, for a five gallon (19L) batch of beer, the fermenter should have about a 6.5 gallon capacity. During fermentation, a layer of foam will form on the surface of the liquid, which is called ''krausen''. You will need an adequate amount of ''ullage'' to prevent the krausen from contaminating the airlock. (Ullage is the space between the surface of the contained liquid and the top of the container.) It is imperative to properly sterilize fermenters before and after use, and to be careful not to scratch or damage the inside surface. You should have at least one fermenter and an additional food grade bucket to serve as a &quot;bottling bucket.&quot; Some brewers choose to have two fermenters; one for primary fermentation and one for secondary.

* '''Bottling Bucket''' - A bottling bucket is a simple food grade bucket with a spigot attached.  The bottling buckets allows priming sugar to be added to the beer consistently without disturbing the yeast and trub layer at the bottom of the fermenter.  The spigot allows bottles to be filled easily and constantly using gravity.  

* '''Airlocks''' - There are several types of airlocks, the two most popular being the three-piece and the single piece airlocks. The goal of the airlock is to prevent foreign particles and oxygen from floating into the fermenting beer while allowing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to push it's way out. The one piece works similar to the drain trap under your sink, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pushes on the trapping water until it pushes slightly past the bottom of the J, allowing part of the interior atmosphere to escape. In the three-piece design, the escaping CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; actually pushes a plastic cap piece up until the gas can escape around the bottom of the cap. Another type of airlock used with carboys, is called a blowoff hose. A large plastic hose (1.5in for most standard carboys) is attached to the mouth of the carboy and the other end is placed in a container of water. Escaping gas simply bubbles through the water.  Blowoff tubes are frequently used for active fermentation.  The yeast matter can then escape through the tube into the bucket of water.  

* '''Syphon''' - Once fermentation has begun, and there is alcohol in the liquid, it's a good practice to avoid aerating the liquid. Yeast still in beer will oxidize and cause undesirable tastes. So, it's also good practice to carefully siphon the beer when transferring from container to container. A meter of hose will do the job, but if you purchase a kit from your local brew supply store, you will receive a ''racking cane'', a cane clip, and a tube clip, in addition to some hose. The racking cane is a rigid plastic, cane shaped tube that when clipped to the &quot;from&quot; bucket with the cane clip eases the entire process. The tube clip is will allow the syphoner to stop the flow of liquid by pinching the hose; when filling bottles, it's a good idea to have an &quot;off button.&quot;

* '''Bottles''' - A standard 5 gallon (19L) batch of beer will fill approximately two cases (48 bottles), depending on transfer loss.  Either swing top bottles (with the rubber gasket) or pry top bottles may be used.  Screw top bottles cannot be capped reliably using equipment available to the homebrewer.  

* '''Bottle Caps''' - Caps can be purchased from a brewing supply store, usually by the gross (144).

* '''Bottle Capper''' - There are two main types of cappers, as pictured to the right (someday). Description of pros and cons of each should go here :P

== Optional Brewing Equipment ==
The equipment and tools listed here can ease certain burdens of the brewing process, and/or can allow the brewer to employ complex techniques. Some of the tools can be home made, but they should be constructed using the highest quality materials.

=== Record Keeping &amp; Measurement===
log book, clock

* '''Hydrometer'''
A hydrometer is a device to measure the specific gravity (a measure of density) of a liquid.  For the brewer the specific gravity(SG) relates the amount of fermentables in a solution of wort or beer.  Taking Specific Gravity readings after boiling (OG) and at the end of fermentation (FG) the amount of alcohol can be calculated.  Hydrometers are relatively inexpensive equipment which will help to produce consistent beer.  A hydrometer should be verified before each use by placing in distilled water, the hydrometer should read 1.000 in distilled water, if slightly off adjust for the inaccuracy, if far off replace your hydrometer. 
The alcohol content is approximately  ABV=(OG-FG)/7.62

* '''Refractometer''' 
A refractometer is used to measure the refractive index of a solution.  A refractometer is used as a substitute for a hydrometer in brewing applications.  Refractometers have a few advantages over hydrometers, first they can be re-calibrated easily.  The second advantage of a refractometer is only a few drops of a sample are need to take a measurement.  The two main drawbacks to a refractometer are they are substantially more expensive than hydrometers and, the a correction is needed for alcohol content in a partially fermented sample.  

* '''Thermometer'''
Temperature plays an important role in the brewing process.  An accurate thermometer, which can be calibrated is important to ensure a consistent beer.

=== All Grain Brewing Tools and Equipment ===
Sparge equipment, Grain sack, iodine, etc.
==== Grain Mill ====
A grain mill is used to crush grain for steeping or mashing.  Crushing the grain breaks the husk and endosperm inside the kernel allowing access to the components inside the grain.  Most grain mills are roller mills, where the grain is run between two closely space rollers.  While having ones own mill allows more control over the crush of the grain, and allows brewers to purchase bulk grain keeping costs lower, most home brew shops will crush grain for you.  

==== Mash/Lauder Tun ====
A mash tun is a vessel where the biochemical processes of the mash occur.  Most home brewers use a combination mash/lauder tun.  The mash/lauder tun must hold the grain and water during the mash and allow the sweet wort to be drained from the vessel.  The most common mash tuns used by homebrewers are plastic beverage coolers, with a false bottom (stainless steel plate with holes in it) or a manifold on the bottom of the vessel.  The grain bed and the false bottom or manifold act as a filter only allowing the sweet wort to flow out of the mash tun to the boil kettle.  
Commercial breweries will frequently use a separate mash and lauder tun.  The mash tun is where the starch conversion occurs, the entire mash is then transferred to a lauder tun to be drained and rinsed in a process called a lauder or sparge.  This frees the mash tun for another batch to be mashed, while the sparge is conducted on the first batch. Separate mash and lauder tuns are unnecessary for smaller operations where a batch needs to be in the boil kettle as much of the time as possible.

=== Sanitation Equipment ===
Bottle washer, tree, brushes, bleach, oxyclean

=== Bottling/Finishing Equipment ===
bottle fill tube, bottling bucket, spigot, cooler, kegging, etc.

=== Other Useful Tools ===
Chiller, labeling

==== Hop Socks ====
Hop socks or hop bags are knitted bags. Hop cones or pellets are placed inside a sock to allow alpha and beta acids, and flavoring and aroma characteristics to be extracted from them during the boil, while allowing the spent particles to be quickly removed from the wort.  Use of hop bags is a controversial subject.  Some believe that hops should be allowed to freely move in the boil, while others use hop bags to reduce the sediment in the bottom of the kettle at the end of to boil.

==== Chiller ====
Chillers are used to cool wort to yeast pitching temperatures from boiling temperatures as rapidly as possible.  Rapid chilling of wort reduces the formation of DMS (a compound which contributes to off flavors).  There are two basic types of chillers, immersion chillers and counter-flow chillers.  
Immersion chillers are simply a coil of tubing, typically copper, which is placed in the wort.  A coolant, typically tap water is then run though the chiller exchanging heat with the hot wort. 
Counter-flow chillers work by the wort flowing through the chiller on the way to the fermenter, and  cool water flowing in around the wort line in the opposite direction.  Two varieties of counter-flow chillers are commonly in use. the concentric coil chiller with the wort running thought a metal tube which is surrounded by another tube which the coolant flows though.  The other type is the plate chiller, which is much more compact and smaller, however also much more difficult to clean after use. Cleaning and sanitation are very important with counter-flow chillers as the wort flowing though the chiller is not boiling after it leaves the chiller, and it is not possible to examine or scrub the inside of a counter-flow chiller.  
 
==== Whirlpool====
A Whirlpool is used to remove turb from the wort before entering the fermentor.  For homebrewers using a whirlpool the hot wort is pumped from the bottom of the kettle and then pumped back into the kettle such that the wort spins.  This causes the sediment to set in a pile at the center of the kettle when the pump is turned off and the wort allowed to settle.  Many homebrewers are experimenting with combining a whirlpool with an immersion chiller.  This has shown to decrease chilling time substantially as well as reducing the solids transferred to the fermenter.   

==== Water Filter ====
Filtration of brewing water can improve the flavor of a beer.  The removal of chlorine or chloramine (common disinfectants used in municipal water supplies) can greatly improve the flavor of a finished beer.  This is especially important for all-grain brewers.  A activated carbon filter will remove chlorine, chloramine and many organic compounds which are undesirable in the brewing process.  

==== Beer Filter ====
Many brewers wish to improve the clarity their beer thorough filtering.  Filtering of finished beer will remove haze in a beer, as well as any yeast left in suspension.  Depending on the degree of filtration a beer many need yeast reintroduced to be naturally carbonated.  Alternatively a beer can be force carbonated directly in a keg after filtration.  

==== Oxygen System ====
Oxygenation systems are used to reintroduce oxygen to the wort before the yeast has begun fermentation.  Yeast require oxygen to grow, however boiled wort will be nearly free of dissolved oxygen.  Stainless steel diffusion stones are frequently used to encourage the gas to enter solution.  Oxygen is either supplied through a pure O2 tank or a air pump using a sterile filter.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==In the Beginning...==
Making beer starts in the field where hardworking farmers raise acres of barley and wonderful hop bines. Barley is grown in winter and spring varieties, and barley for beer is grown in 2-row and 6-row varieties. Hop vines are an annual crop, harvested flower buds, or cones, being the fruit of the plant brewers have interest in. The vines may be trimmed back, and the core of the plant left in the ground for next year. Barley grain is then sent to the maltster, and hops are either immediately used, frozen and vacuum packed until use, or compressed into pellets and stored for future use.

==Grain Preparation==
Harvested grain is allowed to germinate for 1-3 days until the desired level of modification is achieved. Then the grain is dried using heat to varying degrees and drying times to produce the varying types and styles of malt. For some styles of malt, additional preparations are preformed such as smoking or roasting. The malted grain is milled using varied designs of grinders that attempt to break up the starch rich &quot;meat&quot; of the grain, while leaving the hulls as intact as possible.

==Mashing and Lautering==
The starches are broken down to fermentable sugars and extracted into water from the milled malt grains or grist by processes called the mash and the lauter. The mash uses heat at specific temperatures to activate certain enzymes that break starch chains down to sugars that can easily be consumed by yeast. Lautering is simply the straining of the spent grain from the sugar enriched water. Sparging is another process that rinses the spent grain, and is usually done as a part of the lautering.

===The Mash===
There are three major fashions in which the mash is preformed; Infusion, Temperature Controlled Step, and Decoction. The infusion mash is the simplest, in which grist and water are combined and held at a single temperature until the conversion of starches to sugars is complete. It gets its name from the &quot;infusion&quot; of hot water into the grist to obtain the initial temperature. The step mash gets its name from the manner by which the temperature of the mash is brought to an initial point, held there for a period of time, called a rest, and then raised to another rest, and sometimes again. If you plot the temperature with respect to time, the plot will appear to be &quot;steps.&quot; The Decoction mash is the oldest method and is done by infusing boiling water to the mash to achieve initial temperature rest. Sometime before the end of the rest, a measured amount of the mash (water ''and'' grist) is removed and brought to a boil. When added back in, the mash temperature raises to the next rest. This is usually done once more, and sometimes a fourth rest is used.

===The Lauter and Sparge===
Once the starches are converted to sugars, and dissolved into the mash water, the sweet liquid is drained away and sent to the boil. The sweet liquid can be filtered through a collander or a screen, but it is often more desirable to carefully drain the liquid away from the grain to avoid excessive aeration of the hot liquid, since this will cause oxidation. Usually the lauter and the sparge are done as one operation.

The mash is carefully put into a lauter tun, using some sparge water to keep the surface of the liquid above that of the grain. This allows the grain to form a &quot;bed&quot; where the spent hulls support each other and form a filtration structure, while the higher temperature of the sparge water stops further enzymatic activity. Sometimes the mash tun and the lauter tun are one and the same, in which case sparge water is added to the mash to maintain the surface while part of the mash is drained and cycled back into the mash. Once the mash is completely transferred, or the cycling liquid &quot;runs clear,&quot; or has no large particles, the sweet liquid is slowly drained to the boil kettle while fresh sparge water is carefully added to the top of the tun. When the volume of liquid from the mash is drained, lautering is considered complete. But, the process is usually continued, and is called sparging. The resulting liquid can now be called wort. 

==Malt Extract==
The sweet liquid that results from the mash, lauter, and sparge can be considered &quot;extract.&quot; The all-grain home brewer ignores this and proceeds to the boil. However, this liquid can be concentrated, by boiling down to a thick syrup, or cooked into a dry powder. These are the forms we usually refer to as &quot;malt extract.&quot; Bulk malt extract and unhopped extract kits are produced this way, and pre-hopped extracts are either obtained after the boil or simply mixed with hop extract.

When a brewer uses malt extracts to make beer, he must first &quot;unconcentrate&quot; the extract. This can be compared to making orange juice from frozen orange juice concentrate. An amount of water is brought to a boil, then removed from the heat source. The malt extract is stirred in, dissolving into the liquid, which then can be again called wort.

==The Boil==
Hops are then added to the wort, and boiled therein for an hour or more. This causes alpha acids in the hops to break down and dissolve into the wort. Some adjuncts that could not be added in the mash can also be added to the boil, as in the case of molasses, or if a mash was not performed at all (this is then called partial mash brewing). Near the end of the boil more hops may be added to impart flavors and aromas from the hops, certain fining agents may be added such as Irish moss, and certain other adjuncts may be added to pasturize them while leaving their starch chains intact.

Before pitching yeast, the wort must be cooled to a yeast friendly temperature. This can be done by immersing the brew kettle in a tub full of cold water, placing a special chilling coil into the wort, or special chillers that the wort actually passes through. Quick cooling lessens the potential for early bacterial contamination or oxidation of the wort. Slow wort cooling can allow dimethyl sulfide to build up in the wort, which will produce off flavors. Rapid cooling also aids in cold break formation, allowing a clearer beer to be produced.

==Yeast Farm?==
Professional and commercial breweries usually maintain a culture of yeast that they use in their beer. Many homebrewers do the same, and the science, or art as some might consider it, of maintaining a yeast culture is called zymurgy or, more affectionately, yeast farming. This process can be considered apart from the brewing process, since viable yeast cultures can be bought and quickly pitched to a cooled wort, but a wise brewer knows that understanding how yeast lives is very important to understanding how yeast makes beer. In fact, most experienced homebrewers will prepare what is called a &quot;starter&quot; to pitch instead of blindly tossing in the contents of the store bought vial.

A nurturing environment is produced that is rich in sugars and nutrients, into which yeast is pitched. The mixture is allowed to ferment for a day or two, or even a few hours, after which the sediment may be harvested and placed into cold storage. The yeast sediment may also be freeze-dried to produce the dried yeast that comes in packets with many shelf stored beer kits. The stored yeast, in liquid form, can be expected to have viable cells several months later, but a yeast farmer will repitch after no more than a month, both to keep the culture alive, and to revitalize the amount of viable cells.

A day or two before brew day, a smart brewer will create a starter by preparing perhaps a quart of wort, using a DME (dry malt extract) for simplicity and then pitching either a sample from his yeast farm, a stored bought vial of liquid yeast, or rehydrated dry yeast. The yeast will multiply in number until they reach an optimal threshold of yeast per volume of wort, and the fermenting starter will exhibit signs of primary fermentation and it is then ready to pitch to the wort. As an aside, professional breweries who ferment in large batches might make several starters, i.e., a quart to start a five gallon starter to start a 60 gallon barrel. By doing this, the brewer shortens the time it takes for primary fermentation to start, and thus minimizes the chances for unwanted microbials getting a foot hold and ruining the batch.

==Fermentation==
Fermentation is said to have two stages; primary and secondary. In primary fermentation, yeast is very active, reproducing itself and consuming the easily converted sugars. The process may seem violent, and a foam head will form, which is called krauesen. Once the krauesen &quot;drops,&quot; or settles to the bottom, primary fermentation is complete and some brewers will transfer the fermenting liquid off of the sediment and into a secondary fermenter. This is done to prevent the spent yeast cells from negatively affecting the flavor of the beer, however the benefit of doing this is somewhat debatable, and some brewers choose not to do this.

Fermentation can take a couple weeks to a month, or even longer depending on the amount of sugars in the wort and the difficulty of conversion. Light body beers can be quickly fermented with fast working ale yeast. Conversely, heavy body beers fermented with colder working lager yeast can ferment a lot longer. Primary fermentation usually is complete within the first week.

==Carbonation==
Before consumption beer is normally carbonated, and often aged for a week or more. Generally, longer aging produces a better beer, but too much aging can negatively affect the quality. Beer can be ''naturally'' or ''artificially'' carbonated. Natural carbonation capitalizes on the fact that even after fermentation is complete, yeast remains suspended in the beer. After transferring the beer into an intermediate &quot;bottling&quot; or &quot;priming&quot; bucket, additional fermentable sugar is added to the beer. The beer is allowed to sit for up to 24 hours, in which time the suspended yeast reawakens and begins to convert the new sugars. The beer is then put into a sealed container or containers, such as a keg or recappable bottles. Within a week the yeast will have converted the new sugars into a negligible amount of alcohol and an amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adequate to pressurize the container and carbonate the beer.

Aging becomes most important when the sugars added are different than the sugars present in the source wort. Priming corn sugar is quickly converted and so will result in larger bubbles and a thin head. Given time under pressure these bubbles will break down and allow better head development. Priming malt will perform better, but both priming sources will introduce flavors that may not have been present in the original beer. A process called krauesening is optimal, but requires slightly more work. Aging also allows the suspended yeast to settle, and allow the beer to clear, resulting in a cleaner looking and tasting beer.

Artificial carbonation is done by putting the beer into a keg and applying pressure from a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank for at least 24 hours to force carbonate.

==Consumption==
Artificially carbonated beer should be poured into a stein, to avoid sloshing the sediment while drinking. Steins should be washed using a diluted bleach solution, since dish soaps will leave a film on the glass that will destroy beer head. Homebrewed beer still has suspended yeast cells in it, which is a Good Thing(TM). When a human drinks alcohol, its body uses vitamin B complex and water to neutralize and rid itself of the alcohol. If it didn't do this, the human would remain perpetually drunk, which might sound good, but then the human would be unable to drink more beer since it would probably kill it. Now, when that human wakes in the morning after two cases of beer, a bottle of BaerenJaeger, and a few hours praying to a porcelain god, the human's body is depleted of vitamin b and is dehydrated from excessive gifts to the aforementioned god. Yeast cell walls contain vitamin b complex, so a homebrewer, after enjoying a few home brews with good friends will drink a glass or two of water before going to bed. NO HANGOVERS. (Well, at least less likely)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Operating System Classification==

There are several types of operating systems.

&lt;!-- No longer part of the spec?
===Batch===

In a batch operating system, instructions are given to the computer in '''Job control language''' and the task is carried out without any further user interaction.

The job control language tells the computer:

*The priority of the job,
*What to do on an error,
*The filenames of data files to be used,
*The owner of the job,
*The processor time to allocate to the job, and
*The maximum number of lines that can be printed out by the job.
--&gt;

===Interactive===

In an interactive operating system, the user interacts directly with the operating system to supply commands and data as the application program executes and the user receives the results of processing immediately.
The user is in direct two way communication with the computer.

===Real time===

A real time operating system will give guaranteed feedback within a predefined set period of time, therefore taking away the unpredictability of the operation being carried out. This allows for the system to be mathematically modelled to allow the time needed for operations to be carried out to be determined, even under the predicted maximum stress levels. It allows deadlines to be set on operations being carried so as to provide a &quot;best of&quot; result within the time period able to be given for an operation.

'''Example: '''If a real time operating system was used to control a planes rudders (via a RT application) it would need to set deadlines on the calculations used to calculate rudder movements. Without these deadlines a calculations results may be returned to late and cause to plane to crash. 

One very important factor to remember about real time operating systems and applications is that &quot;'''''the right answer late is wrong'''''&quot;. After all what is the point in having the correct answer to a planes rudder calculation if it comes too late and the plane has already crashed because the rudder angle was not changed earlier.

===Multi-programming system===

Multi programming is the apparent simultaneous execution of two or more programs. In a desktop computer, for example, several programs all seem to be running at the same time. What is really happening is that the processor is switching between each program, giving each one a small slice of processor time. This happens fast enough to create the illusion of several programs running at once.

===Multi-user system===

A multi user operating system allows two or more users to communicate with the computer at the same time. Each user has a terminal with a display unit and an input device, like a keyboard, which is connected to the computer system. The processor switches between each user's programs very quickly, and each user is unaware of anybody else using the computer from another terminal.


===Command Line Interface===

[[Image:bash_screenshot.png|thumb|300px|Screenshot of a sample 'Bash' command line session, taken on Gentoo Linux.]]
A command line interface or CLI is a tool for interacting with computers, often using a text terminal. Commands are entered as lines of text (that is, sequences of typed characters) from a keyboard, and output is also received as text. CLIs originated when teletype machines were connected to computers in the 1950s. In terms of immediate interaction and feedback, they represented an advance over the use of punch cards.

===Graphical user interface===
A graphical user interface (GUI) allows the user to interact with their operating systems via the use of windows, menus and a pointer. A typical GUI allows the user to click icons on screen and follow through hierarchical structures rather than having to type command lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not enough can be said about sanitation with beer making. Good beer comes about when you use the yeast that you want to without other yeast or bacterium coming in and having a party in your wort at your expense (and bad tasting beer). 

# Assume that everything has to be sanitized before it touches the wort
#* This is a good rule to live by and helps keep your wort from getting unwanted infections. 
#* Whenever you are brewing keep a pail of sanitizing solution available for anything you may want to sanitize
# Have a drying rack available
# Drop your equipment in to the bucket of sanitizer
#* all of it; hoses, spoons, air locks, etc.
# Leave it there for the prescribed time period (read the instructions on the side of the package)
# Remove from the pail, rinse (as necessary) and allow to dry

There is a difference between what is referred to as &lt;b&gt;clean&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;sanitized&lt;/b&gt;. Clean means the chunks, and debris and discoloration are removed from the equipment. Sanitized means that all of the bacteria that may be growing on the equipment is killed. When in doubt, sanitize.

===Yeast Management===

==Yeast pitching==
Yeast is added to the cooled wort as (or after it is added to the fermenter). It is important to get enough healthy yeast in to the brew to achieve a healthy fermentation.

When using a yeast slurry the pitching is adjusted for the amount of beer in the yeast.
The pitching rate is also adjusted for the number of dead yeast cells in the slurry

==Yeast cropping==
When yeast is recovered from a fermenter with the intention of re-using the yeast for a subsequent fermentation it is referred to as cropping of the yeast. The timing of the cropping is important to recover yeast with maximum nutritional reserves.

==Yeast storage==
It is inevitable that yeast will need to be stored between cropping and pitching. By keeping the yeast cold the yeast metabolism is slowed down so that nutritional reserves are available so that the yeast doesn't starve during storage.


===Primary Fermentation===
Primary fermentation takes place in a bucket or carboy, sometimes left open but often stoppered with the carbon dioxide gas produced venting through a fermentation lock. During this time, temperatures should be kept at optimum temperature for the fermentation process. For ale this temperature is usually 65-75°F / 18-24°C, and for lager it is usually much colder, around 50°F / 10°C. Starting within 12 hours and continuing over the next few days a vigorous fermentation takes place. During this stage the simple sugar maltose in the wort is consumed by the yeast. A layer of sediment, the trub, appears at the bottom of the fermenter, composed of heavy fats, proteins and inactive yeast. A sure sign that primary fermentation has finished is that the head of foam (krausen), built by bubbling of CO2, falls. 

===Secondary fermentation===
Often, the beer is then siphoned into another container, usually a carboy, for aging or secondary fermentation. The siphoning is done to separate the batch from the afore-mentioned layer of sediment so that it is not used as food, as this can give the beer a off-flavor. During secondary fermentation the heavier, more complex sugars and impurities are digested. Secondary fermentation can take from 2 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer, depending on the type of beer. Some homebrewers will keep the batch in the primary fermenter (called single stage fermentation) for secondary fermentation and simply put up with any off flavors. This eliminates the need for a second container, reduces labor, and reduces the likelihood of contaminating the batch with bacteria, or oxidizing it, during transfer to the second container. This is a good beginner strategy, especially for those not skilled with siphoning liquids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bottling &amp; Kegging ==
Before you will want to drink your beer you will want to carbonate it. There are two general ways you can do this; bottle conditioning and forced carbonation. Bottle conditioning is a generic term that refers to both natural carbonation and aging the beer, whereas forced carbonation refers to putting the beer under pressure with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a container such as a keg. Be sure to realize that natural carbonation can be done in a keg, and forced carbonation can be done before bottling.

== Natural Carbonation ==
When fermentation is complete, this only means that all the fermentable sugars have been consumed and converted by yeast; there are still yeast cells floating in the beer. You can take advantage of this, and the fact that a by-product of fermentation is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. All you need to do is introduce fermentable sugars into your beer to restart the fermentation process. There are two main ways to accomplish this; priming or kraeusening.

It is also important to note that if there is too much sugar available to the yeast when you seal the container, the yeast will continue processing the sugar until it is gone - even if the pressure exceeds the strength of the container. In other words, '''without careful attention paid, bottles can and will explode'''. The best way to avoid this is to first be certain fermentation is complete, and then avoid introducing too much sugar for priming. It is recommended to take at least three gravity readings, a day apart a piece; if the reading remains the same through three readings, you can be reasonably sure fermentation is complete.

=== Priming ===
The most common way to restart fermentation is to add a mixture of water and corn sugar or dry malt extract (DME) to the fermented beer. For a 19 Liter (5 Gallon) batch of beer, you will use 180 ml (¾ cup) of corn sugar '''or''' 300 ml (1¼ cups) of dry malt extract. More sugar can be used for a higher level of carbonation, but avoid using more than 240ml (1 cup) of corn sugar or 400 ml (1⅔cups) of DME. The measure of sugars should be dissolved into 0.5 l (1 pint) of boiling water, allowed to boil for a few minutes, and then quickly cooled to the temperature of the beer. Stir this mixture into the beer, carefully so as to avoid splashing and exposure to oxygen.

Some experts state that you should &quot;rack,&quot; or let sit, the primed beer for about 24 hours before bottling to allow fermentation to restart, however in practice, it seems that as long as the newly added sugars are sufficiently mixed into the beer, consistency will be fine, and the time from priming to enjoying will be the same. The most notable problem with priming beer is the introduction of new flavors that would not be in the original wort. This can impart a subtle flavor that will exist in beers that otherwise would be completely different. The best way to avoid this is to kraeusen your beer.

=== Advanced Priming ===

Priming Tablets (Carbonation Tablets) or &quot;Primetabs&quot; are an advanced method of priming beer in homebrewing,  They are small, sanitized corn sugar tablets which come in packages of usually 250 tablets per package, and are used when bottling your beer.  Some priming tablets also contain DME (Dried Malt Extract) in the tablet with the corn sugar.
When bottling your beer you usually add from 1 to 5 primetabs to a regular 12 oz / 330 ml bottle, depending upon how much carbonation you desire. 2 for lowly-carbonated beers like British Ales, and up to 4 or 5 for highly carbonated beers like Hefeweizen and others. There is typically no boiling or other handling required - simply put the desired number of tablets in the bottle, fill with beer, then cap, and that's it. Some priming tablets like Coopers Carbonation Drops only require 1 tablet per a 12 oz [345 -375 ml] bottle so be sure to read the package directions before using.  For example, Munton's CarbTabs are different in amount of tablets required verses Cooper's Carbonation Drops.  The tablets can be added before or after filling as there no difference either way.  However, once the bottle is capped it should be turned on-end 2 or 3 times until the tablets dissolve in the liquid.  After the bottle is capped in the first few hours, it is good idea to swirl or tip the bottle end to end to ensure a good mixture throughout the bottled beer.   This ensures that the added priming sugars are accessible to the remaining yeast in the bottle, then the bottles can be left in a dark 60F to 70F (15C to 20C) environment for the standard week or two, which is long enough for the carbonation to develop in the bottled beer..  For best results the bottle should sit for two weeks.  The only downside with priming tablets or &quot;Primetabs&quot; is their price tag, as they are usually more expensive than your regular run-of-the-mill corn sugar that is typically used to prime beer with.

=== Kraeusening ===
Kraeusening requires a bit of fore thought, before you pitch yeast to your wort. The idea is to save a portion of the unfermented wort from fermentation and then add it back to the fermented beer before bottling. This allows you to add more sugars for the yeast to consume without introducing unnatural (to that specific beer at least) flavors. If you use fining agents at boil time (such as Irish moss) this has the added effect of reintroducing some of those fining agents back to the beer and can help clarity and reduce haze.

The saved wort is called gyle, and due to the fact that worts will vary in fermentable sugar content from beer to beer the gyle will have a variable sugar content. Because of this you must calculate the amount of gyle needed at the end of the boil, just before pitching yeast. This requires the use of a hydrometer. First, take a gravity reading of the wort at pitching temperature, after adding any waters to bring the wort to the desired volume (usually 19l or 5 gallons). Subtract from this reading 1 and then multiply that number by 1000. In other words drop the 1.0 from the front of the reading, so that a reading of 1.065 becomes 65. Then divide the volume by this number, and then multiply this number by 3 to find the volume of gyle needed. For example, a 19l (5 gal) batch of wort has a gravity reading of 1.040: (19liters/40) x 3 = 1.425 liters of gyle or (5gal/40) x 3 = .375gal = 1½ quarts of gyle.

It is imperative to store this gyle in a sealed container to avoid contamination by bacteria or wild yeasts. Once you are prepared to bottle, you will use the gyle in the same fashion you use the corn sugar or DME and water mixture. It is not necessary to reboil the gyle, but be sure the temperatures of the gyle and beer are as close as possible to the same, so as to avoid shocking the yeast.

== Forced Carbonation ==
Beer can be put under pressure in a keg, usually higher than pressure required to dispense beer from the keg, and held there for a day or two. &lt;!-- I'm not an expert here so, I'll stop now. Perhaps I'll pick it back up after some research... --&gt;

==Bottling==
The two accepted ways of filling bottles is by siphoning into the bottles or using a special bucket with a spigot in the side. Many home brew supply stores carry a special bottle filling tube that has a valve which allows you to push the tube to the bottom of the bottle to open the valve and gently move the tube out of the bottle to stop flow. These tubes work both with spigots and siphoned bottling. There is another benefit of these tubes, in that by using one to fill the bottle to its brim, the bottle will have the perfect ullage once the tube is removed.

Ullage is an important consideration when filling bottles, to maintain consistency in levels of carbonation. Ullage is the small space between the surface of the beer and the cap. The ideal amount of ullage is about an inch.

If you are siphoning, use a siphon lock, that pinches the hose, to control flow. If you are using a spigot, attach a length of hose, so that filling starts at the bottom of the bottle. It's important not to splash the beer around, because doing you will aerate the beer. After filling, loosely place the caps on the bottles. Wait about 15 minutes before crimping the caps so that escaping and newly formed carbon dioxide can push the oxygen out of the top of the bottle.

==Kegging==
There are a variety of kegging systems, from tap and pump traditional beer kegs to soda-pop keg systems with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks to &quot;party pigs&quot;, which are 2.5 gallon plastic bottles which use co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridges to perform force carbonation and dispensing functions. &lt;!-- none of which I consider myself to be an authority on, so I will leave this as is pending research --&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dddstone. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dddstone~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Guitar book ==

Hi. You asked on the german wikibooks-discussion-site on the guitar-book if the images there are free to use and how to handle them. All pictures in this book are already uploaded on wikimedia commons. Thus, you only have to copy the link of a picture you might use from our german guitar-book and place it on your own site. The image-links will work without any change or modification. The only thing you have to change could be the picture prefix. On german wikibooks two prefixes are working: &quot;Bild:&quot; and &quot;image:&quot;. At the english wikibooks the prefix has to be &quot;image:&quot;, so you have to change that in the copyed links if you want to use them.

All pictures on the guitar book are free to use on every wikimedia project, so feel free to use it for your own projects. You only have to create new images if there are german words in our images. In this case copy them, fix the words and upload them under another name (on wikimedia commons, of course).

== German sources ==

My English isn't the best, but I writhe the guitar-course and some work-shops of the german wikibooks. 
for pictures and midis look at

I've prepared a [[Template:Crd]] for you. Please go into the template and correct my spelling and style, ant take an English song. But you can see: it works.

:{{crd|C}} Alle meine Entchen {{crd|F}} schwimmen auf dem {{crd|C}} See {{crd|F}} schwimmen auf dem {{crd|C}} See

:{{crd|F}} Köpfchen in das {{crd|C}} Wasser {{crd|G7}} Schwänzchen in die {{crd | C}} Höh'.

Another tip: use not only the bablefish-translation. Take the link from the original-page, or better: copy the source-code. 

if you will have any question, send me an E-Mail at mjchael@gmx.de. I don't recognize the changing of the english wikibooks. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] 11:44, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

rehi: Ok , I makes a suggestion for you... You see the German text. I think, you can recognize which could be interesting for you. I assume that you will see the tabs and pictures. If you'll find something, (maybe you want to write an article over something, then I will translate you the German article into a halfway readable English. But I can better translate the pages that were made by me. (Diploma, Workshops..) But I can work only step by step. So I will translate step by step, and I need a person who can translate and correct and make same advices. You can use the texts, or a part of it, or you will only use the Information. It can be that you need only individual components, or only the pictures and left. I will not care about it. Everything that is written by me, I can translate. I for my part hope to catch some stuff from your page. I'm looking for example for songs without copyright. But I have no idea whether the words are correct, and whether the chords were at the correct places. You will find many examples like: [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gitarre:_Jazzworkshop#Lektionen jazz-workshop] or [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gitarre:_Diatonischer_Quintfall_in_Am_mit_Samba-Rhythmen samba-rhythm with a standard-jazz progression] with tabs, songs '''and''' midi. Or I have powertabs for the midi-example like [[commons:Category:Guitar_picking|Guitar picking]] and you can make an English version of the PDF. Even the Pictures of the cords can be &quot;translated&quot; in an English version. I am a simple guitar-teacher. But I make it just as hobby and not for my living. So I am a hunter and collector and look, borrow and steal wherever I coud find something new. Changing and translating is more simply than to develop it completely  new. And the most difficult is to find the information (examples) at all. When you (the English wikibooks, not you alone) start to work on the guitar-book I will have more chances to borrow something from your wikibooks. [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Mjchael mjchael(de)]

== Guitar Wikibook ==

Hello NickPenguin, I think your changes should be fine, and if it's not, it's just an edit away.

Right now, I am focusing upon the first section (guitar parts and amplifier), as that's the section I feel safe about. The thing I am wondering if the order the book should proceed: Do we jump right into open string chords, or go into melodies first? Should power chords be at the first? When should we introduce styles, or keep it as a seperate section? Problem is that different instructors have different idea - The instructor in my community center starts with some basic melody first, then to open chord and strumming, while my jamming club teaches power chord first.

As for German wikibook, I cannot understand the language, but what I can understand impressed me enough, so I think it culd be a good idea to translate them into here.

Another thing I worried is whether it became too much; it was definitely more than most book that I had even read, and could be overwhelming. So we may need to figure out whether it's design to be accomodating for beginners, or be as detail as possible.
Anyway, thanks for the message, and happy editing! [[User:George Leung|George Leung]] 05:39, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

Please don't blank pages that you want to delete.  It causes us no end of grief here and with other Wikimedia projects.  If you can, please use the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|comment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' markup template on the page if you want to delete something from here.  We will find the page sooner and be able to deal with the deletion without having to fight through other pages first.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Tsivion. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Tsivion~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In many old stories, folk tales, and even fantasy games, many mystical figures from sages to witches to elves used odd concoctions of strange liquids and plant distillates to produce magical effects.  Even though these are purely children's stories, all myths are in some way rooted in fact.  Perhaps you can't bring the dead to life with a concoction of wolf's bane and mandrake; but you can cure a stomach ache with a light tea made from steeped ginger root.

The Field Remedies Wikibook is the documentation of just that.  Any distillates, teas or other herbal remedies may be documented here, offering the valuable knowledge of simple remedies for a range of potential conditions.  The information here should be generally useful, enriching, and enlightening to the serious study or casual Wikibooks browser.

Originally the title &quot;Potionology&quot; was chosen for this Wikibook for entertainment value; we also wanted to avoid the term &quot;medicine,&quot; which implies greater authority than we care to claim.  You should definitely seek medical attention for anything worse than a minor cold; don't try fixing that spreading green infection on your hand with a few herbs that you found listed in some online site.  That being said, there is some valuable information contained within.

Once again, the Field Remedies Wikibook is meant to provide practical knowledge, not medical training; it is not a scientific or medical journal, and should not be taken as such. Factual accuracy and sometimes even safety are suspect throughout this Wikibook; although we'd like to try to keep things at least menially correct here.  These remedies are likely not effective in treating serious conditions, and in some cases may be downright ''dangerous''; please be mindful.

==How to Add Entries==
When adding entries, be mindful of the following:

*'''Use a lot of references'''.  If you claim something, make a reference to something else, such as Wikipedia.  Use w: links, such as [[w:Green tea]], to reference Wikipedia.  Any claims made by your own experience should be noted, such as &quot;in the experience of [[User:Bluefoxicy]]...&quot;
*'''Be realistic'''.  Don't put down that a mixture of garlic and wolfsbane will keep vampires away.  That's just immature.
*'''Place warnings on dangerous pages'''.  Certain things will cause nasty side effects, such as dangerous blood pressure increases from excess Licorice; this is '''dangerous''' and it '''needs''' to be noted that you can kill yourself this way.  Don't tell someone to mess with [[w:Mandrake|Mandrake root]] without warning that just uprooting the plant can release a fatal cloud of narcotic gas, or that small doses can cause irreparable cases of death.
*'''Notate works in progress'''.  It's perfectly okay to note that ingredient X has desired effect Y, but that you need another ingredient you can't yet find, or haven't found the right potency, or whatnot.  Concoctions of various herbs are interesting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many '''healing remedies''' which can be sought by distilling certain plants.

==List of remedies==

===Nausea===
Mild to severe stomach aches and nausea can be easily corrected.

* [[Field Remedies/Healing remedies/Ginger tea|Ginger tea]]



While mild nausea may be corrected with small sips of ginger tea (or flat ginger ale), You should give it in tablespoon size amounts every five mnutes. This is important to minimize the chance of vomiting. Continue clear liquids only for 4 hours. If vomiting continues despite this regimen, evaluation by a health care professional is advisable. Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance could occur and have dire consequences.

Mild stomach pain can often be managed at home especially if it is intermittent and associated with nausea or diarrhea. However it can also have a more serious cause. If stomach pain interferes with your normal activity, is constant rather than intermittent, or lasts more than than two hours, you need to be evaluated by a medical professional. Sooner then two hours if very painful. Possibilities include but are not limited to: infection of almost any abdominal organ, appendicitis, pancreatitis, liver disease, severe constipation (NEVER attempt to self treat severe somach pain with laxatives!) plus many other possible diseases. Seek a professional's advice or care and do not risk your life or well being by attempting to treat severe pain at home.

===Infections===
There are certain configurations that may help heal from infections.  These may increase immune response or simply dampen certain diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ginger tea''', made by steeping crushed [[w:Ginger|ginger root]] in hot water, can be used to cure some digestive issues.

==Background==
Ginger has many beneficiary properties.  It contains many [[w:Antioxidants|antioxidants]], which may help prevent [[w:Cancer|cancer]] according to medical studies.  It is also known to effectively cure all forms of nausea including [[w:Motion sickness|seasickness and carsickness]] as well as [[w:Morning sickness|morning sickness]]; do note, however, many physicians recommend against the use of ginger to combat morning sickness, although pregnant Chinese women traditionally use it for exactly this purpose.

According to the PDR &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101230.shtml pdrhealth.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, ginger has been shown to promote production of saliva, digestive juices, and bile.  It also tends to boost the pumping action of the heart, prevent the formation of blood clots, lower LDL cholesterol, and decrease inflammation.  It may have a stimulative effect on the immune system; this has not been concluded.  Ginger also has mild laxative effects due to stimulation of the [[w:GI tract|GI tract]].

The anti-inflammatory properties of ginger has lead some to use it for the treatment of diseases such as arthritis and bronchitis; one study of 261 participants showed that ingesting ginger twice daily significantly reduces the pain experienced by sufferers of osteoarthritis, versus those being administered a placebo.

As ingesting ginger ''may'' lower LDL cholesterol levels and prevent blood clotting, it may be helpful in preventing [[w:Atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis]], [[w:Heart attack|heart attack]]s, and [[w:Stroke|stroke]].  Ginger also has [[w:Analgesic|pain relieving]], [[w:Sedative|sedative]], [[w:Antipyretic|fever reduction]], and [[w:Antibacterial|antibacterial]] effects.

===Precautions===
Ginger root should not be consumed in doses exceeding 6 grams per day.  This may damage the lining of the stomach and cause stomach ulcers.  '''Large overdoses may lead to [[w:Central nervous system|CNS]] depression and heart irregularities''' and you should '''seek medical attention ''immediately'' if you suspect a large overdose'''.

Avoid ginger if you are at risk of internal bleeding or have gallstones.  The PDR also recommends against using ginger to treat morning sickness, although there is no evidence that ginger is harmful during pregnancy.

Do not take large doses of ginger if you are also taking a blood-thinning drug.

===Notes===
It is notable that ginger will not cure the underlying cause of any disease, especially nausea; it will only allieviate some of the symptoms associated.  Mild cases of food poisoning, for example, can be easily waited out; but severe cases can be fatal, and you should always seek medical attention if you suspect a dangerous infection.  If your doctor tells you it will go away on its own, or just perscribes simple antibiotics such as [[w:Penicillin|penicillin]], ginger tea is a good way to quell the symptoms in the meanwhile.

Ginger root has a strong and spicey flavor; chewing on a small piece of the root may be quite painful and difficult for many individuals, somewhat in the way chewing on a [[w:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] would be, as the active constituent is a compound similar to [[w:Capsaicin|capsaicin]].  A diluted tea, however, should be easily drinkable by most; and for those who enjoy the flavor of ginger root, can even be a pleasant beverage.

==Preparation==
For ginger tea, you will need a small slice of [[w:Ginger|ginger root]] and 250mL (''about 8oz'') of hot water; the PDR recommends 0.5-1g[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101230.shtml] of ginger be used.

To prepare the tea, [[Field Remedies/Preparation/Crush|crush]] the ginger and pour hot water (''recommended: 85C'') over it.  Fill the vessel with approximately 175-250mL (''6-8oz'') of hot water and steep for about 5 minutes.  [[Field Remedies/Preparation/Strain|Strain]], if desired.  Honey may be added to sweeten the tea to taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Licorice''' has several beneficiary properties, although '''can be quite dangerous''' as well.  High doses of licorice increase blood pressure a lot.  '''The increased blood pressure and clotting risk can lead to strokes and other ill effects'''.

==Background==
Licorice has many beneficiary properties.  It is a highly effective [[w:Cough medicine|cough medicine]], and in this is present its very interesting historical use.  Licorice also may have uses related to [[w:Mouth ulcer|mouth]] and [[w:Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcer]]s.  It also presents itself as a mild [[w:Laxative|laxative]].  Licorice has also been noted to help with liver disease and reduce the risk of liver cancer; and increases T-Cell count and interferon production, boosting immune response to viruses such as hepatitis and influenza.

In Asian medicine, licorice root has been used for boils, dehydration, diarrhea, eye diseases, headache, sore throat, and swellings from infections.  its effectiveness for these disorders has not been scientifically verified.[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/101700.shtml]

Licorice has been mentioned in 63 readings by [[w:Edgar Cayce|Edgar Cayce]][http://www.meridianinstitute.com/echerb/Files/1licoric.html].  Cayce notes the benefits of Licorice on the intestinal tract, the liver, and the healing process in general; and describes (''without medical training'') how and why this works.  Cayce also has recommended licorice to soothe minor cardiac arhythma problems.

===Tentative===
It has also been said that [[w:Licorice|licorice]] stimulates excess red blood cell production, which can have a similar effect to [[w:Blood doping|blood doping]], where blood is drawn and then later re-injected to increase red blood cell count in the body.  The blood doping procedure is a disqualifying infraction in most sports events for this reason; it is detected by checking for elevated red blood cell count.

Increased red blood cell count allows you to supply more oxygen to muscles, leading to efficient removal of waste carbon and thus mildly increased strength, muscular endurance, and stamina.  Unfortunately, it also leads to increased platelets, which leads to increased blood clotting and risk of stroke.

Licorice has also been said &lt;!--by Edgar Cayce if [[User:Bluefoxicy]] recalls correctly--&gt; to increase the general rate of healing.

==Special Precautions==
Licorice has some unfortunate negative side effects.  Large doses of licorice can lead to [[w:Hypokalemia|hypokalemia]], a potentially fatal potassium deficiency, as well as severe increases in [[w:Blood pressure|blood pressure]].  These dangerous side effects make highly concentrated licorice distillates extremely dangerous.

The PDR notes that dosages of more than 20 grams of Licorice Extract or 50 grams of licorice root daily for an extended period of time will lead to excessive loss of salt from the blood, water retention, high blood pressure, and heart irregularities, sometimes accompanied by fatigue, headaches, and muscle cramps.  It further recommends to limit use of Licorice preparations to 6 weeks, noting that the side effects disappear after the drug is discontinued.

The PDR also describes drug interacitons.  Licorice increases potassium loss associtaed with other drugs such as diuretics. This potassium loss ca cause increased sensitivity to the heart medication digitalis.  Other heart drugs such as quinidine and procainamide can increase licorice-induced potassium loss, leading to a dangerously rapid heartbeat.  Licorice may also increase the effects and unwanted side effects of steroid medications such as prednisone (Deltasone).

The PDR specifies quite directly to '''not take licorice when pregnant'''.

==Preparation==
For those who enjoy licorice, a licorice tea can be a soothing and beneficial drink.  A tea can be made by using 1-1.5g (1/2tsp) of licorice root.  The root must be crushed, possibly utilizing a [[w:Garlic press|garlic press]]; and boiled in water.  The root can be added to cold water and boiled, or be placed in a vessel and have boiling water poured over it.  In either case, steep in the boiling water for 15 minutes; strain; and drink.

''Based on the method given in the PDR''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cold resistance? ==

In Dragon Quest 8, there's an herb called &quot;Nook Grass&quot; that when distilled into tea or consumed causes the body to warm, and increases cold tolerance.  Interestingly enough, ingesting niacin (nicotinic acid) does exactly the same thing.  Is there a plant that's safe to make a concentrated distillate or a mild tea from to help with this?

The concentrated distillate would (just like popping a 500mg niacin pill) cause extreme flushing and help if you're outside for too long in the cold and starting to freeze (''run to the house now that you can move!''); while a mild tea would QUICKLY warm you up after being outside in the cold.  Continued ingestion of this B vitamin in fair amounts is completely safe; it takes a LOT to overdose on niacin, although it can be done and the consequences are deadly.  Also continued ingestion will lead to lasting cold tolerance, even if it stops sudden flushing you hot.

== More PDR stuff ==

The PDR has a few good herbal pages.  Here's a few more we could use.

*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/100980.shtml Echinacea]&amp;mdash;2 effective varieties, sweet/bitter taste.  Relieves colds and shortens the lifecycle of the flu; increases white blood cells, spleen cells, T-helper cells, and interleukin (all immune system agents); has an effect on viruses similar to interferon.
*[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/herbaldrugs/102120.shtml Parsely]&amp;mdash;Kidney/bladdar stones, urinary tract infections.

== The Bilinear Transform ==

The '''Bilinear transform''' is a mathematical relationship which can be used to convert the transfer function of a particular filter in the complex Laplace domain into the z-domain, and vice-versa. The resulting filter will have the same characteristics of the original filter, but can be implemented using different techniques. The Laplace Domain is better suited for designing analog filter components, while the [[Digital Signal Processing/Z Transform|Z-Transform]] is better suited for designing digital filter components.

The bilinear transform is the result of a numerical integration of the analog transfer function into the digital domain. We can define the bilinear transform as:

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{2(1-z^{-1})}{T(1+z^{-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

The bilinear transform can be used to produce a piecewise constant magnitude response that approximates the magnitude response of an equivalent analog filter. The bilinear transform does not faithfully reproduce the analog filters phase response, however.

As example, the phase response for the bilinear equivalent to an analog system is shown next, using a sampling frequency of 40 rad/sec.  Compare the phase responses in the plot, realizing the limit is Ws/2=20 rad/s - the clear divergence is evident.
* num = [1 11.21 116.242 372.601 561.589 363.528 ];
* den= [1  26.489 340.47 2461.61 10433.1 23363.9 19049. 4981.82 ];
* C=tf(num,den); % GNU Octave command
* D=c2d(C,2*pi/40,'bi');  % A/D via Octave

&lt;center&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;Phase_discrep.jpg|Phase discrep approaching Ws/2 &lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== W Domain ==

The bilinear transform is a one-to-one mapping, that is that a unique point in one domain will be transformed into a unique point in the other domain. However, the transformation is not a linear transformation, and is not an exact equivalency between Laplace and Z domains. If a digital filter is designed and transformed into an analog filter, the resulting poles and zeros are not located on the s-plane, but instead on the w-plane that has similar properties, but with a nonlinear correspondence.

In the bilinear transform, the positive imaginary axis in the s-domain is transformed into the upper-half unit circle in the z-domain. Likewise, the negative imaginary axis in the s-domain is transformed into the lower-half unit circle in the z-domain. This mapping is highly nonlinear, however, resulting in a phenomina known as &quot;frequency warping&quot;.

== Prewarping ==

Frequency warping follows a known pattern, and there is a known relationship between the warped frequency and the known frequency. We can use a technique called '''prewarping''' to account for the nonlinearity, and produce a more faithful mapping.

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_p = \frac{2}{T}\tan\left(\frac{\omega T}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The ''p'' subscript denotes the prewarped version of the same frequency.

== Phase ==

The bilinear transform does not maintain the phase characteristics of the analog filter, and there is no way to correct the phase response to match.

== Filter Design Steps ==

When designing a digital filter using an analog approximation and the bilinear transform, we follow these steps:

#Prewarp the cutoff frequencies
#Design the necessary analog filter
#apply the bilinear transform to the transfer function
#Normalize the resultant transfer function to be monotonic and have a unity passband gain (0dB).

Alternatively, if we have an '''inverse bilinear transform''', we can follow these steps:

#use the inverse bilinear transform on the filter specifications in the digital domain to produce equivalent specifications in the analog domain.
#Construct the analog filter transfer functions to meet those specifications.
#use the bilinear transform to convert the resultant analog filter into a digital filter.

== The Inverse Bilinear Transform ==

The inverse bilinear transform can be specified as such:

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{1 + \frac{s} {2*f_s} } {1 - \frac{s} {2*f_s} }&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sample rate &lt;math&gt;(f_s = \frac{1}{T})&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Sonorus''''' is a spell that is used by a wizard to make his voice louder, used when he needs to address a large gathering.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Sonorus spell is first seen used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] when he is called upon to commentate the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. Having charmed his own voice, it then is loud enough to reach every one of the hundred thousand or so wizards in the stadium. When the game is finished, Ludo ends the spell by invoking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Quietus|Quietus]].

Ludo uses this spell again when commentating the events in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]].

== Analysis ==

From a simple viewpoint of physics, one has to wonder about how this charm actually works. Specifically, if Quidditch matches are anything like football (soccer) matches, the fans will be loudly singing their team's songs, and so sound that would reach them would have to be extremely loud. Muggle stadiums have multiple sound sources, set up in the air well away from the spectators, so that they can be made arbitrarily loud without deafening anyone in particular. Yet Ludo is in the top box, along with all the dignitaries; sound loud enough to reach the cheap seats at the far ends of the pitch, over all the shouting that the fans are going to be doing, would have to be literally deafening to other occupants of the Top Box, and rendering the Minister for Magic deaf, along with the Minister's Bulgarian opposite number, cannot be good for any wizard's employment prospects. On that basis alone, it is most likely that the spell works partly by boosting the Charmed wizard's volume, and partly by selectively sensitizing the onlookers' ears to his voice, so that they hear him partly through the air, partly by direct mental impression. This would explain both the ability of Ludo's voice to reach the entire Quidditch World Cup stadium, and also be dimly audible to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] while he is waiting to enter the arena for his First Task – in the latter case, Harry was not in the area where Ludo had chosen to make his voice audible, so could only hear the amplified audio portion.

\gamma =  \frac{dx^0}{d \tau} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{\mathbf{v}^2}{c^2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and of course

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v} = \frac{d \mathbf{x}}{d t }.
&lt;/math&gt;

The proper velocity is unimodular

:&lt;math&gt;
 u \bar{u} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

==Spacetime momentum==

The spacetime momentum is a paravector defined in terms of the proper velocity

:&lt;math&gt;
 p_{{}_{}} = m c u
&lt;/math&gt;

The spacetime momentum contains the energy as the scalar part

:&lt;math&gt;
 p = mc ( \gamma  + \gamma \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} ) = 
 \frac{E}{c} + \mathbf{p},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{{}_{}} = \gamma m c^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

The shell condition of the spacetime momentum is

:&lt;math&gt; p \bar{p} = (mc)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation that maintains the length of paravectors. Lorentz transformations include rotations and boosts as proper Lorentz transformations and reflections and non-orthochronous transformations among the improper Lorentz transformations.

A proper Lorentz transformation can be written in spinorial form as

:&lt;math&gt;
p\rightarrow p^\prime = L p L^\dagger,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the spinor &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; is subject to the condition of unimodularity

:&lt;math&gt; L \bar{L} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

In &lt;math&gt;Cl_3 &lt;/math&gt;, the spinor &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; can be written as the
exponential of a biparavector &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{{ }_{ }} = e^{W}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Rotation==

If the biparavector &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; contains only a bivector (complex vector in  &lt;math&gt;Cl_3 &lt;/math&gt;), the Lorentz transformations is a rotation in the plane of the bivector

:&lt;math&gt;
R  = e^{ -i \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\theta} }
&lt;/math&gt;

for example, the following expression represents a rotor that applies a rotation angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; around the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt; 
according to the right hand rule

:&lt;math&gt;
R  = e^{-\frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_{12}}=e^{ -i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 },
&lt;/math&gt;

applying this rotor to the unit vector along &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1&lt;/math&gt; gives the expected result

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e}_1 \rightarrow  e^{ -i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 } \mathbf{e}_1
e^{ i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 } = \mathbf{e}_1 e^{ i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 }e^{ i \frac{\theta}{2} \mathbf{e}_3 } = \mathbf{e}_1 e^{ i \theta \mathbf{e}_3 } =
\mathbf{e}_1 ( \cos(\theta) + i \mathbf{e}_3 \sin(\theta) ) =
\mathbf{e}_1 \cos(\theta) + \mathbf{e}_2 \sin(\theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

The rotor &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has two fundamental properties. It is said to be unimodular and
unitary, such that

* Unimodular:  &lt;math&gt;R \bar{R} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* Unitary: &lt;math&gt;RR^\dagger = 1&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of rotors, the bar conjugation and the reversion have the same effect

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{R} = R^\dagger. &lt;/math&gt;

==Boost==

If the biparavector &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; contains only a real vector, the Lorentz transformation is a boost along the direction of the respective vector

:&lt;math&gt;
R  = e^{ \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\eta} }
&lt;/math&gt;

for example, the following expression represents a boost along the 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt; direction

:&lt;math&gt;
B  = e^{  \frac{1}{2} \eta \, \mathbf{e}_3 },
&lt;/math&gt;

where the real scalar parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the rapidity.

The boost &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is seen to be:
* Unimodular:  &lt;math&gt;B \bar{B} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* Real:  &lt;math&gt;B^\dagger = B &lt;/math&gt;

==The Lorentz transformation as a composition of a rotation and a boost==

In general, the spinor of the proper Lorentz transformation can be written
as the product of a boost and a rotor

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{{}_{ }}  = B R
&lt;/math&gt;

The boost factor can be extracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
B = \sqrt{L L^\dagger}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the rotor is obtained from the even grades of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
R = \frac{L + \bar{L}^\dagger}{2 \langle B \rangle_S}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Boost in terms of the required proper velocity==

The proper velocity of a particle at rest is equal to one

:&lt;math&gt;u_{r_{ }} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Any proper velocity, at least instantaneously, can be obtained from an active Lorentz transformation from the particle at rest, such that

:&lt;math&gt;
u = L u_{r_{}} L^\dagger,
&lt;/math&gt;

that can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
u = L L^\dagger = BR (BR)^\dagger = B R R^\dagger B^\dagger = BB = B^2,
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;
B = \sqrt{u} = \frac{1+u}{\sqrt{2(1+\langle u \rangle_S)}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the explicit formula of the square root for a unit length paravector was used.

==Rapidity and velocity==

The proper velocity is the square of the boost

:&lt;math&gt;
u = B^{2^{ }},
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma(1+\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}) = e^{\boldsymbol{\eta}},
&lt;/math&gt;

rewriting the rapidity in terms of the product of its magnitude and respective 
unit vector

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\eta} = \eta \hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}&lt;/math&gt;

the exponential can be expanded as

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma +  \gamma\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} = \cosh(\eta) + \hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}\sinh(\eta),
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{{ }_{ }} = \cosh{\eta} &lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}\sinh(\eta), &lt;/math&gt;

where we see that in the non-relativistic limit the rapidity becomes the velocity divided by the speed of light

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} = \hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}} \eta &lt;/math&gt;

==Lorentz transformation applied to biparavectors==

The Lorentz transformation applied to biparavector has a different form from the Lorentz transformation applied to paravectors. Considering a general biparavector written in terms of paravectors

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle u \bar{v}  \rangle_V  \rightarrow \langle u^\prime \bar{v}^\prime \rangle_V  
&lt;/math&gt;

applying the Lorentz transformation to the component paravectors

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle u^\prime \bar{v}^\prime  \rangle_V = 
\langle L u L^\dagger \,\, \overline{ L v L^\dagger} \rangle_V=
 \langle L u L^\dagger\, \bar{L}^\dagger\bar{v} \bar{L} \rangle_V =
  \langle L u \bar{v} \bar{L} \rangle_V = 
 L\langle u \bar{v}  \rangle_V\bar{L},
&lt;/math&gt;

so that if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a biparavector, the Lorentz transformations is given 
by

:&lt;math&gt;
F \rightarrow F^{\prime_{ }} = L F \bar{L}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The electromagnetic field is defined in terms of the electric and magnetic fields as

:&lt;math&gt;
F = \mathbf{E} + i c\mathbf{B}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the fields  can be derived from a paravector potential &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
F =  c \left\langle \partial \bar{A}  \right\rangle _{V + BV},
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;
\partial  =  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^0}  - \nabla 
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
A  =   \phi/c + \mathbf{A}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Lorenz gauge==

The Lorenz gauge (without t) is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \partial \bar{A} \rangle_S = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The electromagnetic field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is still invariant under
a gauge transformation 

:&lt;math&gt;
A \rightarrow A^\prime = A + \partial \chi,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is a scalar function subject to the following condition

:&lt;math&gt; 
 \bar{\partial} \partial \chi = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where


:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\partial}  =  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^0}  + \nabla 
&lt;/math&gt;

==Maxwell Equations==

The Maxwell equations can be expressed in a single equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\partial} F = \frac{1}{c \epsilon} \bar{j},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the current &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
j = \rho c + \mathbf{j}
&lt;/math&gt;

Decomposing in parts we have
* Real scalar: Gauss's Law
* Real vector: Ampere's Law
* Imaginary scalar: No magnetic monopoles 
* Imaginary vector: Faraday's law of induction

===Electromagnetic Lagrangian===
The electromagnetic Lagrangian that gives the Maxwell equations is 

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} \langle F F \rangle_S - \langle A \bar{j} \rangle_S
&lt;/math&gt;

===Energy density and Poynting vector===

The energy density and Poynting vector can be extracted from 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\epsilon_0}{2} F F^\dagger = \varepsilon+ \frac{1}{c}S,
&lt;/math&gt;
where energy density is
:&lt;math&gt;
\varepsilon = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2}( E^2 + c^2 B^2 )
&lt;/math&gt;
and the Poynting vector is
:&lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} E \times B
&lt;/math&gt;

==Lorentz Force==

The electromagnetic field plays the role of a spacetime rotation with

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{e}{mc} F &lt;/math&gt; 

The Lorentz force equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d p}{d \tau} = \langle F u \rangle_{V}
&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently 

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d p}{d t} = \langle F (1+v) \rangle_{V}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Lorentz force in spinor form is 

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{ d \tau} = \frac{e}{2mc} F \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;

===Lorentz Force Lagrangian===
The Lagrangian that gives the Lorentz Force is

:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{1}{2} m u \bar{u} +  e \langle \bar{A}u \rangle_S
&lt;/math&gt;

==Plane electromagnetic waves ==

The propagation paravector is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;
   k = \frac{\omega}{c} + \mathbf{k},
&lt;/math&gt;

which is a null paravector that can be written in terms of the unit vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
   k = \frac{\omega}{c}(1 +\mathbf{\hat k} ),
&lt;/math&gt;

A vector potential that gives origin to a polarization|circularly polarized plane wave of left ''helicity'' is

:&lt;math&gt;
A = e^{i s \mathbf{\hat k}} \mathbf{a},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the phase is

&lt;math&gt; s=\left\langle k \bar{x} \right\rangle_S = \omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; 

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be perpendicular to the propagation vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;. This paravector potential obeys the Lorenz gauge condition.
The right helicity is obtained with the opposite sign of the phase

The electromagnetic field of this paravector potential is calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;
F = i c k A_{{}_{}},
&lt;/math&gt;

which is nilpotent

:&lt;math&gt;
F F_{{}_{}} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The proper velocity can be expressed in terms of the associated Lorentz transformation spinor called ''eigenspinor''. 

The proper time derivative of the eigenspinor can be expressed in terms of the
spacetime rotation biparavector &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{d \tau} = \frac{1}{2} \Omega \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;

The spacetime rotation biparavector contains the information of the interaction that the particle is subject to. 

The dynamics of a classical particle can be expressed in terms of a differential equation involving the eigenspinor.

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d p}{d \tau}  = mc \frac{d }{d\tau} 
( \Lambda   \Lambda^\dagger ) =
mc ( \frac{d \Lambda }{d\tau} \Lambda^\dagger 
+ \Lambda \frac{d \Lambda^\dagger}{d \tau}   ),
&lt;/math&gt;

using the definition of the spacetime rotation biparavector

:&lt;math&gt;
mc \frac{1}{2}( \Omega \Lambda \Lambda^\dagger + 
\Lambda \Lambda^\dagger \Omega ^\dagger ) =
mc \langle \Lambda \Omega \rangle_{\Re{ }},
&lt;/math&gt;

that finally gives the dynamic equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d p}{d \tau } = mc \langle \Omega \Lambda \rangle_{\Re{ }},
&lt;/math&gt;

where the role of the force is now played by the spacetime rotation biparavector.

Once the spacetime rotation is identified with the electromagnetic force,
the result is the spinorial form of the Lorentz force.

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{d \tau } = \frac{e}{2 m c}  F  \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;

==Constant Electric Field==
The eigenspinor form of the Lorentz force can be solved analytically in many interesting cases. One of the simplest is the case of the constant electric field. If the electric field is directed along the z direction, the equation to solve is
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \Lambda}{d \tau } = \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \Lambda
&lt;/math&gt;
and the solution is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda = e^{ \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau }\Lambda_0.
&lt;/math&gt;
The proper velocity is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;
u = e^{ \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3  \tau} u_0e^{ \frac{e}{2 m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau}.
&lt;/math&gt;
If the particle starts at rest, the proper velocity is simply
:&lt;math&gt;
u = e^{ \frac{e}{m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau}. 
&lt;/math&gt;
An additional integration gives the spacetime position
:&lt;math&gt;
x = x_0 +  \frac{m c^2}{e E} \mathbf{e}_3 ( e^{ \frac{e}{m c}  E \mathbf{e}_3 \tau}-1) 
&lt;/math&gt;

This appendix page is going to take a deeper look at the units of decibels, it will describe some of the properties of decibels, and will demonstrate how to use them in calculations.

== Definition ==

Decibels are, first and foremost, a power calculation. With that in mind, we will state the definition of a decibel:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The letters &quot;dB&quot; are used as the units for the result of this calculation. dB ratios are always in terms of watts, unless otherwise noted.

== Voltage Calculation ==

now, another formula has been demonstrated that allows a decibel calculation to be made using voltages, instead of power measurements. We will derive that equation here:

First, we will use the power calculation and Ohm's law to produce a common identity:

:&lt;math&gt;P = VI = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we plug that result into the definition of a decibel, we can create a complicated equation:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{ \left[\frac{ \frac{V_{out}^2}{R} }{ \frac{V_{in}^2}{R} }\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can cancel out the resistance values (R) from the top and bottom of the fraction, and rearrange the exponent as such:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{\left[ \left(\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}\right)^2 \right]}&lt;/math&gt;

If we remember the properties of logarithms, we will remember that if we have an exponent inside a logarithm, we can move the exponent outside, as a coefficient. This rule gives us our desired result:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 20 \log{\left[ \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \right] }&lt;/math&gt;

== Inverse Calculation ==

It is a simple matter of arithmetic to find the inverse of the decibel calculation, so it will not be derived here, but stated simply:

:&lt;math&gt;P = 10^{dB/10}&lt;/math&gt;

== Reference Units ==

Now, this decible calculation has proven to be so useful, that occasionally they are applied to other units of measurement, instead of just watts. Specifically, the units &quot;dBm&quot; are used when the power unit being converted was in terms of milliwatts, not just watts. Let's say we have a value of 10dBm, we can go through the inverse calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;P = 10^{10dBm/10} = 10mW&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, let's say we want to apply the decibel calculation to a completely unrelated unit: hertz. If we have 100Hz, we can apply the decibel calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;dB = 10 \log{100Hz} = 20dBHz&lt;/math&gt;

If no letters follow the &quot;dB&quot; label, the decibels are referenced to watts.

== Decibel Arithmetic ==

Decibels are ratios, and ''are not real numbers''. Therefore, specific care should be taken not to use decibel values in equations that call for gains, unless decibels are specifically called for (which they usually aren't). However, since decibels are calculated using logarithms, a few principles of logarithms can be used to make decibels usable in calculations.

=== Multiplication ===

Let's say that we have three values, '''a''' '''b''' and '''c''', with their respective decibel equivalents denoted by the upper-case letters '''A''' '''B''' and '''C'''. We can show that for the following equation:

 a = b c

That we can change all the quantities to decibels, and convert the multiplication operations to addition:

 A = B + C

=== Division ===

Let's say that we have three values, '''a''' '''b''' and '''c''', with their respective decibel equivalents denoted by the upper-case letters '''A''' '''B''' and '''C'''. We can show that for the following equation:
 
 a = b / c

Then we can show through the principals of logarithms that we can convert all the values to decibels, and we can then convert the division operation to subtraction:

 A = B - C</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hello Wikifriends! ==
I am Pinko1977. I am a Wikipedia editor and a participant at Wikisource. I am a writer who has been published in a number of online newspapers, blogs, and journals, and now I am planning to get into writing books. My areas of interest are history, politics, and culture---especially American pop culture.

I love music and literature, and I am especially enamoured of singers. My favorite vocalists are (in no kind of order) Bessie Smith, Jim Morrison, Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, Robert Johnson, Kurt Cobain, and countless others. As you can see, my love of music is irrespective of era and genre. In terms of books, I've mostly read nonfiction and biographies throughout my life, but recently I've been revisiting fiction and poetry. I've written poetry off-and-on myself over the years, and have attempted a couple of short stories. I see fiction as another avenue where I can explore history, culture, and their effects on human relationships.</text>

== XMLRPC - Serializing and Deserializing Datatypes ==

As a lightweight alternative to SOAP, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer Dave Winer] came up with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC XMLRPC] as a means to make remote method calls and exchange data between servers.  
The spec for this format is located at [http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec].

It works well for its intended use.  Well, unless you are coding in PHP and using the built-in, undocumented functions to generate XMLRPC.  You may have to build your own, just to be on the safe side.

Just a quick example of what it looks like.  In xmlrpc, a &lt;struct&gt; is what we would call in php an 'associative array', whereas an &lt;array&gt; is a 'list' or an array with only numerical indices (or in some languages, no indices).  A complex array datatype with the following structure:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Array
(
	[0] =&gt; dogs
	[1] =&gt; cats
	[animals] =&gt; Array(
		[0] =&gt; FALSE
		[1] =&gt; little_dogs
		[2] =&gt; little_cats
		[3] =&gt; 5
		[4] =&gt; 2.3
		[5] =&gt; 1
			),
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;   

Becomes the following XMLRPC: 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
      &lt;params&gt;
         &lt;param&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;
               &lt;struct&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;0
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;dogs&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;1
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;cats&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;animals
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;
                           &lt;array&gt;
                              &lt;data&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;boolean&gt;0&lt;/boolean&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;little_dogs&lt;/string&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;little_cats&lt;/string&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;i4&gt;5&lt;/i4&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;double&gt;2.3&lt;/double&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                                 &lt;value&gt;&lt;boolean&gt;1&lt;/boolean&gt;
                                 &lt;/value&gt;
                              &lt;/data&gt;
                           &lt;/array&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
               &lt;/struct&gt;
            &lt;/value&gt;
         &lt;/param&gt;
      &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/methodResponse&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==What is Mathematics?==
This question is one of the most complicating questions I've ever had to take in mathematics, and has no simple satisfactory answer. The Philosophy of mathematics is a complex and difficult topic not really suitable for an introductory text.

At a naive level we can describe mathematics as a language that expresses relationships.  This includes logic, measurement, algebra, calculus and geometry.  This language allows us to understand our universe and to solve problems in it. When your eyes view a page of mathematics, it looks like a collection of symbols.  Mathematics is not the symbols on the page but what those symbols really mean.

Any two people from any corner of the Earth, if both understand mathematics, can view the same page and understand the implications precisely, understand a question uniformly, or continue the discussion without a single spoken word.  There is no other such language taught across the entire planet.

This Wikibook is dedicated to helping those who see the page of symbols but do not hear the language of mathematics.

===The Disciplines of Mathematics===
There are two disciplines contained within mathematics: logic and theory.  They are separate but interdependent in that mathematics is useless without both.  Unfortunately, many people are only taught the theory side.  A more thorough description of both disciplines is presented later.  For now, we'll put it all on the table.

====Mathematical Logic====
Logic is the expression of ordered thoughts starting from axioms and resulting in a conclusion.  There are many rules and formalities for mathematical logic which ensure that truth is maintained throughout the logical argument.  Once a conclusion is successfully built it can be used with confidence as an axiom in another different logical argument.

Mathematical logic studies a set of artificial languages called logics. These languages are thought to have theoretically interesting structures, structures which are worthy of study both for their own sakes and for the light that such study promises to shed on the methods of reasoning used throughout mathematics.

====Mathematical Theory====
Theory deals with the abstraction of the real world into the mathematical world.  As much as mathematical logic is rigorous and specific, mathematical theory is abstract and generalized.  There is no doubt that this is where the fun of mathematics shines through.  Using mathematical theory a person can divine how to build a house or why cell phones work, make predictions about seemingly random events, even predict the motions of planets, stars, and galaxies! 

When Theory moves from the abstract to the real world, it is called applied mathematics.  These are the every day experiences people have with mathematics and is the small part of the realm of mathematics with which people usually are most familiar.


=== Things students should emphasize ===

Students must always remember that the mathematical language (terminology and symbols) are just ''representations'' of mathematical thought. Often students of math get mired in or turned off by the language, when the focus should be more on mastering the concepts. Math is universal only in its use of common logic and common concepts. The actual symbols (letters, words, sentences) of the language are not as important as the thought process. 

Yet fortunately, the language itself, especially in writing, has become highly standardized over the years, just to assist in communication. But mathematics is valid no matter how it is represented, as long as all terms and symbols are well-defined to the reader. Sometimes there is no single way to express math, just as, sometimes, there is no single way to make an argument. Ideally, in the open-marketplace of ideas, the most efficient representation becomes the accepted canon. Yet mathematical language, like all human languages, sometimes is entangled in traditional notation. We humans love our traditions! But often all it takes is a fresh new representation, to make concepts that once were confusing, suddenly clear. 

In any event, it is most important to learn the concepts, and then just view the symbolism as a tool of communication, and a bookkeeping tool during problem solving: and an exertion of the mind, which, for most, is unable to keep track of all the complex threads of mathematical logic. 

Students should not stress too much over memorizing pages of facts and concepts, without also striving to understand why they are true, why those facts must follow given the arguments, and why they make sense. Students should focus heavily on developing the skills and practicing the intellectual gymnastics that will enable them to think mathematically and solve mathematically posed problems. That person who can solve a problem from scratch, create new ideas, work things out by his or her own thought process, is more useful to Mathematics and society than one who can simply recall facts and figures, since these can always be looked up on Wikipedia! That is, it is more useful to have people who can write new Wikipedia articles, than people who can just read them!

Nevertheless, memorization is also useful, since of course nobody can possibly have the brainpower, memory, ability, time, or patience to prove all facts from first principles. Often, grand leaps of useful mathematical reasoning can be made by simply proving that one (perhaps already immensely complex and rich) axiom or fact will lead to a new conclusion. I believe Isaac Newton (?) once said, &quot;I can see so far, because I stand on the shoulders of giants.&quot; There is no shame in building on the work of others, as long as one acknowledges the source. Not only does this give fair credit where credit is due, but it allows things to be verified, especially if the thoughts of these &quot;giants&quot; are simply implied. 

One beauty of math that separates it from other disciplines like science, is that the preconditions don't always need to be established. With math, we can simply assume our foundations to be true, and build a new logical structure. In fact, some math concepts are so elemental and obvious, that often they are just implied as following from common sense! Take whole numbers and counting, for example: it seems reasonable to assume that most people would agree that they just &quot;are&quot;, and don't need any intrinsic proof of validity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Origins ==

This is semi-rewrite of policy, amalgamating the more significant parts of [[WB:NC]] and [[WB:HNS]]. I've named it 'policy' rather than 'convention', in the hope it might sound more authoritative, added more examples to make it clearer, and kept it short so as to not scare off newbies.

I've also changed the introductory examples to hint that the subpage convention is preferable to the pseudo-namespace convention, since newbie's can't be trusted to provide backlinks. I've also altered the distinction to focus on the backlinks only, hinting that the only other distinction is typographic. The previous distinction of hierarchical vs. digraphic usage is bogus. You can use either system with either convention.

Comments? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:58, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

:Although you can use either system with either convention, we recommend hierarchical with slashes and digraphic with colons, as that's what naturally follows from the delimiter's nature.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:39, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

::Perhaps in your mind, but from a technical standpoint the only difference is the auto-backlinks. I don't see why we would want to confuse newbies by convincing them otherwise. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:57, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

:::KelvSYC is right '''because''' from a technical standpoint the only difference is the auto-backlinks. The auto-backlinks enforce a hierarchical organization. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 13:54, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

== Template naming conventions ==

It is too strict for templates to have also the same prefix than for books. I agree that we should enforce the use of a naming convention for book-specific templates but I propose to allow in this specific case an abbreviation for the prefix. Rationale: templates are very often used to save keystrokes for repetitive text junks. There are no strong necessities to know to what book belongs one template, as there are for modules. Enforcing complete wikibook names in template prefixes will either promote very short names for books or a recurrent violated policy. For example, in [[Ada Programming|Programming:Ada]] we make extensive use of templates under the [[Template:Ada]] root. These templates are used for external links and for code highlighting. I would not like the book being named just &quot;Ada&quot; or the code templates to become larger. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:04, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

The abbreviation used for templates should be a redirect to the book main page in the main namepace, e.g. [[Ada]]. This will avoid future use of the abbreviation for other books. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:10, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

: Although it is an acceptable compromise in general, it may not suit [[Ada Programming|Programming:Ada]], as under [[WB:NP]] Programming:Ada is a section of [[Computer Programming|Programming]], which means for it to be called a book you would have to move the entire book anyways.  Since book management will soon be under the auspices of [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]], the office should be responsible for book aliasing.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 02:44, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:: There seems to be some confusion here. This is a really early naming convention which I have entitled the &quot;bookshelf convention&quot; as per [[Wikibooks:Naming policy#Historical conventions]]. All it needs is to be renamed from [[Ada Programming|Programming:Ada]] to Programming Ada, [[Ada Programming]], How to Program in Ada, or just Ada, or whatever. All its subpages will need to renamed too. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:09, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

::: No confusion, [[Talk:Ada Programming/New Name needed|discussion for a rename]] are on the way. We are very much in favour on sticking to agreed standards. It is in this discussion that we discovered that the new policy has some hurdles for us in choosing a suitable new name. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:29, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

Forgetting about Programming:Ada, is there any objection against this change to the proposed policy? May we edit the page to reflect this compromise. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 23:21, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

: I suppose even if your book is named &quot;My Extremely Long Book Title About Programming Ada&quot;, but you've created the redirect &quot;Ada&quot; to point to it, then technically, you own that subsection of the template namespace, so any templates beginning with &quot;Template:Ada:&quot; or &quot;Template:Ada/&quot; belong to that book also. Is this acceptable? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:58, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:: I have no complaints aside from how book aliasing is controlled.  I suggest that the CCO should have an alias registry.  You really don't want an obscure and inactive book to have a single-letter alias, right?  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 03:34, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Good point. I'll allow it in this case, since the Ada book is really quite professional looking, and I don't want to irritate the authors too much. It has a lot of pages, and uses a lot of templates, mostly of the form &quot;Template:Ada/&quot;. The programming language is probably the most common use of the word &quot;Ada&quot;, and I can't think of another book that would need to fight over this part of the namespace (except perhaps a Wikibook about [[w:Ada Lovelace]] herself). But you're right, we do need to keep track of aliases. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:52, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

: So, just to clarify, can the [[Movie Making Manual]] use [[MMM]] as a prefix for our headers now that I've setup a redirect from [[MMM]] to [[Movie Making Manual]]?  For example, is the header name &quot;MMM Header&quot; legal? [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 14:12, 23 Sept 2005 (GMT)
:: No, community consensus is needed in order for a book to get an alias. Also, even if you get the alias, naming it &quot;Template:MMM Header&quot; breaks [[WB:NP]].  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 17:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
::: Thanks for the reply.  Sorry, I'm new here... Why does &quot;Template:MMM Header&quot; break [[WB:NP]]? [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 10:22, 24 Sept 2005 (GMT)
:::: For any book ''book'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Template:''book''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is reserved for a book's internal organization.  Thus, to conform you need it to be named (assuming you have the alias) &quot;Template:MMM:Header&quot; or &quot;Template:MMM/Header&quot;. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 17:31, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

== things that go into 2 or more books ==

[[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] mentions
''There are no strong necessities to know to what book belongs one template''

I agree. Some templates are useful enough to be used in several different books.

I'm sure I have at least 6 paper books on my shelf that each have a &quot;Appendix: ASCII Chart&quot;, and 5 other books that each have an &quot;Appendix: Periodic table of the elements&quot;.

* (a) Should such things go into a free-floating &quot;page&quot; without a book name ? (I suppose this is technically the same as a &quot;book&quot; with only the one page, without any sub-pages).
* (b) Or should such things go into a free-floating template as [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] suggests?
* (c) I suppose the third option is to mantain several more-or-less identical copies, each one associated with a single book to give it the &quot;right name&quot;. But that would be silly.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:27, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

=== Transclusion ===

I belive that transclusion is a good answer to that. Often there will be a more general/higher level book which could contain the source and all other books would transclude the pages in. For example see [[Computer Programming/Control]] and [[Ada Programming/Control]] - of course this is a very complex example - but it shows that the technique scales well.

-- anon

: OK, that's yet another option I hadn't considered.

* (d) Associate the text with one particular &quot;general&quot; book, but transclude that text into all others that wanted it.

: So the ASCII chart would presumably &quot;really&quot; go into [[Computer Programming]], and all other books that wanted one would transclude it.
: So the periodic table would &quot;really&quot; go into [[General Chemistry]], and any other book that wanted one would transclude it.
: OK, that sounds like a good idea.

== Capitalization ==

Regarding capitalization, I wanted to promote the case like &quot;The Title of Doom&quot;, rather than &quot;The Title Of Doom&quot; (I forget which is title-caps and title-case). I just happened to choose a bad example (i.e. &quot;How To Build A Computer&quot;). If someone can find a good example of a '/'-based 'flat'-style Wikibook with the right capitalization, let me know. I think the subpages (i.e. chapters) perhaps ought to follow the same conventions, but I didn't want to seem too pedantic. :-) - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:22, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

:Great. To be more specific, we capitalize the first word and all words that are not [[w:Closed-class_word|closed class words]]. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:05, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
::The policy as it stands now only allows for lowercase articles (the, an) and prepositions (of, into, without). What about conjunctions (And, Or) and pronouns (It, Their)? I have at least one printed book with a lowercase &quot;and&quot;, though I have not found a pronoun in a title. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

::[[Guide to UNIX]] has a lowercase &quot;to&quot;, but you could also argue that it is sentence case (&quot;The title of doom&quot;) because UNIX is a proper noun. The bad thing is that Guide to UNIX mixes slash convention (&lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX/Shell Prompt&lt;/s&gt;, colon convention (&lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX commands:File system utilities&lt;/s&gt;), and space convention (&lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX files&lt;/s&gt;). The subpages and sections have inconsistent case: &lt;s&gt;Guide to UNIX/Shell Prompt#Finding a shell prompt&lt;/s&gt; is a sentence case section name on a title case subpage. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:12, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

::I made several page renames in [[Guide to UNIX]], which is why I striked several of the names above (including one typo). The submodule names are now more uniform. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:10, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Talking about conjunctions, I prefer using &quot;and&quot; instead of the ampersand &quot;&amp;&quot;. Or is this too nitpicky?

What about situation when whole title consists of capital letters like {{bad link|RANGERS IN COLONIAL AND REVOLUTIONARY AMERICA}}? Such case is not mentioned, so it looks like there's a problem. When I asked author of this module to change it name, he replied that current naming policy does not forbid such titles and that it is common in US Army documents. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:16, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

==Page naming==
My own gripe with the present [[WB:NP]] is the ban on the use of abreviated book titles in page names.  Long page names look very ugly and hurt the usability of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:category:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages (i.e. the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:category:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages work best if each page name only takes up a single line).  For example, I would really like to be able to use the [[MMM]] abreviation for the [[Movie Making Manual]], e.g. [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras]]. Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 16:25, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
*The current version would let you register MMM as an alias. However, the requirement to check with administrators is too strict; the chance that someone else also wants MMM (Making Monster Madness? Map of Much Music?) is too low. Instead, any wiki contributor should be able to edit the registry and add MMM. Also, the current version of the naming policy does not allow MMM names for subpages, templates, and categories ([[:Category:MMM/festivals]]). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:35, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== Votes ==

Please vote ''Aye'' it you thing the policy is okay as it is and ''Nay'' if you think it needs more work. If the ''Ayes'' have it for a whole week then the policy is accepted.

We are writing books, not encyclopedia entries or magazine articles. Title caps would give the books an air of respect, that I'm sure that authors all want to portray. Next, I think the forward slash convention is the better convention, not only because it creates the backlinks (which are small, and noninvasive), but also because the colon convention could potentially interfere with the creation of other wiki- projects, or other namespaces. Lastly, If we allow for aliases (although we should make it easy for a book to obtain a non-contested alias), the template naming convention makes the most sense: we want templates to be attached to their book, so that they aren't stolen and adapted for other books.
# I believe this policy has a strong explanation now and should be approved. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 18:36, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

=== Nay ===

# - For now. It's not that clear if title caps or title case is preferred for book names, maybe title case would be better, because that's what's generally used for the titles of books. Also, no preference is given to any method of capitalising the titles of sub pages. There is currently a discussion going on over at [[Talk:Cookbook:Policy]] about these capitalisation rules, and it would be nice if we could come up with a consensus for a general policy for Wikibooks as a whole, instead of limiting it to only the Cookbook.

# - The caps should refer all exceptions if any. The alias should refer limitations of chars if any, in example the case of the use of &quot;/&quot; like in the Programming C -/- -/- that is under dispute, as a writer :I do think that the use of non alphanumeric chars on titles should be very clear, even more as I defend the use of ASCII hexa in places like where + can't be used and a graphically similar char exist (like the plus minus sign), and that the url of a work may be or not difer from the books title, there are very good reasons, even beneficial to the hole site (wikibooks) in not having human friendly urls more so since they aren't already that friendly for example the &quot;_&quot; = &quot; &quot; can give some problems in edits and transclusions.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:13, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

It is far more important to simply suggest best practices and to make a clear example of what has already been done on Wikibooks.  Indeed, I don't really care how a particular Wikibook is organized as long as the naming convention for pages is consistant throughout that particular Wikibook.  It also helps if ''somewhere'' on each page you can get back to the &quot;main page&quot; of the Wikibook.

#:What if we include a clause about how harsh a violation of this policy will be for the book. Certainly, we dont want to delete an entire book because they delimit page names with the wrong character, but we should still have a set of standardized guidelines, that people can work towards.

I am in general opposed to &quot;article&quot; style names where no naming convention is used, but otherwise I don't think it really matters.

[[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 16:12, 13 October 2005 (UTC)''

From the comments above, perhaps the policy should say something like
: ''On a case-by-case basis, the community may approve 2 different names for a book. A &quot;short name&quot; such as &quot;Ada&quot; for a book -- (( or even a chapter of a book ???)) -- with a long name such as Programming:Ada. All sub-pages and templates would use the short name. The short name should be composed of one or more whole words, not abbreviations.&quot;
If we changed the policy to say that, would you change your vote to approve the policy?

Just to point out an example here, when I started the naming conventions for [[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] (Wikisource...not Wikibooks) I realized that it would get very tiring typing in 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica for every link.  I shortened the name to EB1911 for most of the articles and template (as well as categories) essentially out of practical need, and the fact that it was fairly obvious what the topic was about.  I also added a redirect from [[s:EB1911|EB1911]] to the main page.  That way if they went to that obvious shortcut it would take you to the main page as well.  (It appears as though the redirect was lost on the move to en.wikisource).  I think the redirect is a good idea anyway if you are going to have a naming convention shortcut.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:27, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Kumarayil. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Kumarayil~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

hi my name samboeun, and i live in Cambodia. and my Email: samboeun100@yahoo.com. i just want to add some idea for my knowledge to all people who want to develop him self and become a good student or person. this is this main idea for me that i think that it will be help all of you to study



      English is the only language that any one can understand. So to say, it has become as an ideal language for expressing our feelings. First, we have to learn the language and then we have to gain fluency in the language. Unless we have the fluency in English language, it would not be possible to work with the computer. If you do not know English, then you would be in need of a translator to do the job.

    The first stage of learning this language would be very interesting. Once you are fluent with the alphabets, slowly you can learn many words. It would always be better to follow the method of reading first, then writing. You can use the picture books for this purpose. When you feel that you are familiar with the words, you can form sentences. This is the most interesting stage to learn. You just think of a sentence in your mother language, and try to write the same sentence in English. There could be some mistakes. But you should not bother about it. But, you have to write the same sentence using many different words till you are satisfied with your sentence. If you follow this way, very soon you can create sentences of your own.

The next step is learning the grammar of the language. It is quite simple and very systematic compared with other languages. There are certain rules and regulations for each and every topic in grammar of this language. As long as you follow the rules and regulations, it would be a difficult task to make mistakes. You would gain that much guidance from the grammar.
The presentation is the most important factor in communicating your feelings. So, naturally you must be sure while you are presenting. what you really wish to say. At any point, do not try to write or speak, beyond your capability. Even if it is a small and simple sentence, it would reach the receiver perfectly. This is our basic idea. Slowly, you can improve the standard of your language by practice. If you know to form the sentences, it is more than enough to go deep into the subject. Though this only an article about the importance of the English Language, we have to learn some of the basic points in presenting the sentences.
There are three different types of sentences: They are,
1. Statements. 2. Interrogative sentence. 3. Imperative sentence. 4. Exclamatory sentence. To begin with, you must know the difference between a phrase and a sentence.

Phrase is a group of words, which gives meaning, but not complete meaning.
A sentence is a group of words, which makes a complete sense.

1. Statement: The sentence starting with nouns or pronouns is known as statement.

Example: Rome is a church city.

2. Interrogative sentence: There are two types of interrogative sentences.

a. &quot;wh&quot; type question. The sentences starting with the following fords are &quot;wh&quot; type question. What, When, Where, Who, How many, How long and etcetera.
Example: Why did you come late? 2. What are you doing there?

b. &quot;yes or no&quot; type question. For which sentences you get the reply either with yes or no they are called yes or no type question.
Example: Is your father a doctor? The answer: No sir.

3. Imperative sentence: The sentence that gives command, request, and advice is known as Imperative sentence. Example: Walk on the pavement. 2. Eat regularly.

4. Exclamatory sentence: The sentence that expresses the sudden feelings or strong emotions is known as exclamatory sentence.

Example: Alas! He is dead. 2. Oh! What a beautiful sight.

When you are familiar with the above points, it would be very interesting to you to create many wonderful sentences.
In general, the sentences are divided into three different kinds. They are,
1. Simple sentence. 2. Compound sentence. 3. Complex sentence.

Though it very essential to have knowledge in handling the above sentences, we have to study them separately. In this essay, we are talking about the importance of the language.
Many people make mistakes even with the usage of articles. It is a pity that even scholars may make mistakes. So, you should not get dejected with your style of writing.

There is a lot of difference between these two. 1. a few 2. few
When you want to say that you have friends, you have to say that,&quot; I have a few friends.&quot;
When you want to say that you do not have friends, you have to say that, &quot;I have few friends.&quot;

This is the opposite meaning of the word, many.
Apart from these, there are many points to be discussed later.
When you feel that you are already strong on the above subjects, you can develop your knowledge for betterment of your knowledge. As long as you educate yourself, you will come across many new things. There is no end for learning. All the above points are used in the normal usage of English. The literature value of the English Language is entirely different and should be dealt separately.
so this is my new idea and if you want to share your knowledge you can press &lt;u&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/u&gt;'''''Bold text'''''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now as a good student, you are allowed to contribute for the good. So, there are some facts that you must know after reading this Wikibook.

1.) Being a good student doesn't mean that you must be an angel. Because, at some situations you have to be a little rugged, &quot;NOT MEAN&quot;. If someone fights with you, you first ignore but then if he insists, show him a good knuckle sandwich, but that doesn't matter. The thing that matters is your judgement to decide when to fight and when not to.

2.) As a good student, advantages of a good education must be known to you now. So, if you want to be better, always try knowing more, search good articles at Wikipedia, read good educational books. Contribute to a good field and plan an excellent career at this stage to prevent future difficulties.

3.) I created a quote that ''A magician tries to conceal his teachings but a good student always spreads/reveals his knowledge.''
Always help and support others as much as you can. If anyone is always getting bad grades, improve him so not only you but he's also happy. Of course, helping doesn't include cheating.

I hope you may follow these tips in your future. You are about to be on your journey as a good student for the first time. That's all you need to know! Take care and have a very happy life!

Hello! Bonjour! Guten Tag! Hola! Ciao! My name is Murtaza Ali (but I call myself Mastermind 007 at this site). I live in Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. and I study in Sherwood Academy. 
I'm a big fan of Wikipedia because it can provide you with almost all the knowledege they gain through other users. It's similar to Microsoft's Encarta. I've just worked on these Wikibooks till now:-

*[[How To Become A Good Student]] 
*[[Football (Soccer)]]

I'll create many Wikibooks if you can just provide me with some topics(must be in English) but I'll try my best to do it along with you all. You can send an article to me with your ideas at my talk page. 
Have a good time at Wikibooks!

Goodbye! Au Revoir! Adiós! Auf Wiedersehen!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inserting figures into a document is often a very problematic task when we start learning [[w:LaTeX|LaTeX]] and using it for the first few times. The large ammount of different [[w:graphic formats|graphic formats]], and incompatibilities between them, also makes the situation more confusing. This chapter will try to explain the ''complete'' method required to insert figures into your document, while providing several tips and hints on how to get the best results.

==Conventions==

Before we start, and in order to avoid any possible confusion, we will have to agree on the terms that will be used in this chapter, and what they mean when they are used.

* A ''graphic'' is any drawing, illustration, image, diagram, photograph, graph, chart, plot, histogram, etc.; that you might want to include in a document to illustrate or clarify an idea. Most of the content of this chapter deals with preparing graphics for inclusion in LaTeX documents.

* A ''figure'' is the structure commonly utilized to insert a graphic in a document. A figure is usually composed by a graphic, a caption (which is ''not'' part of the graphic), as well as a numbering sequence that identifies figures in the document (Figure 1, Figure 2, ...).

==Overview of the process==

The complete process to include a figure in a LaTeX document is composed, essentially, of the following four steps:

# '''Determine the appropriate format for your graphic.''' There are two main kinds of graphics: [[w:raster graphics|raster graphics]] and [[w:vector graphics|vector graphics]]. It is important to know the difference between them so that you can choose which one is more appropriate for your needs. This step will also help you to determine which of the available tools will be most useful in the next step.
# '''Draw/create/obtain the graphic.''' This is probably the most important part of the whole process. Next steps will be much simpler (and produce better results) if this step is carried out correctly. However, this step is also the most difficult to explain due to the large ammount of available tools and programs to produce graphics.

Además, dependiendo del tipo de gráfico y del origen de tus datos, unas herramientas pueden ser más adecuadas que otras. Por otra parte, generar un gráfico con la herramienta inadecuada puede ocasionar que las figuras terminen con muy mala calidad en tu documento final. Una gran parte de esta guía está dedicada a darte diversas sugerencias y estrategias para seleccionar la herramienta adecuada según el tipo de gráfico que necesites.
# '''Preparar el gráfico en un formato adecuado para LaTeX.''' Esta parte es normalmente muy sencilla. Aunque es la parte con la que  muchos principiantes tenemos problemas por no haber llevado a cabo satisfactoriamente el paso anterior, y por desconocer los comandos existentes para realizar esta tarea. Esta guía explicará también los métodos más comunes para preparar tu gráfico en un formato que LaTeX pueda entender.
# '''Insertar el gráfico como una figura dentro de tu documento.''' Esto ya es pan comido, simplemente agregas unos cuantos comandos a tu documento y ''¡listo!''

Las siguientes secciones detallan como realizar exitosamente cada uno de estos pasos, y te brindan también una gran cantidad de consejos para obtener los mejores resultados.

===Determinar el formato adecuado para tu gráfico===

Antes de comenzar a discutir las diversas opciones y herramientas para producir gráficos es necesario aclarar que existen, escencialmente, dos formas de almacenar un gráfico dentro de un archivo en la computadora (y es una decisión muy importante determinar cual de los dos formatos es el adecuado para el tipo de gráfico que necesitas):

====Mapas de bits====

Un [[w:mapa de bits|mapa de bits]] es, en escencia, una gran tabla que indica el color de cada punto (''[[w:píxel|píxel]]'') en tu gráfico. Es un formato muy sencillo y popular para internet pues no requiere (salvo la compresión) de un procesamiento complicado para mostrar el gráfico, simplemente la tabla de colores se copia en la pantalla y listo. Este tipo de archivos es conveniente para guardar fotografías ya que las cámaras y escáneres digitales funcionan precisamente de esa manera, dividiendo el gráfico en una gran cantidad de puntos y registrando el color de cada uno de ellos.

La desventaja principal de este formato es que no puede cambiarse el tamaño del gráfico con facilidad. Originalmente los puntos son del tamaño del punto más pequeño que se puede mostrar en la pantalla. Pero si tratamos de hacer el gráfico más y más grande acabaremos por ver unos cuadrotes en lugar de puntitos. Además, si hacemos el gráfico pequeño y lo queremos después agrandar perderemos inevitablemente calidad en la imagen (una tabla pequeña no puede guardar la misma información que una tabla grande).

Extensiones típicas de archivos que usan este tipo de formato son: [[w:BMP|BMP]], [[w:JPEG|JPEG]], [[w:GIF|GIF]], [[w:PNG|PNG]] y [[w:TIFF|TIFF]]. Entre las aplicaciones populares que pueden generar este tipo de archivos están [[w:Microsoft Paint|Microsoft Paint]] y [[w:Adobe Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] entre otras.

====Gráficos vectoriales====

Una alternativa para tener gráficos que no pierdan calidad cuando se cambia su tamaño son los [[w:gráfico vectorial|gráficos vectoriales]]. Este tipo de formatos, en lugar de guardar una gran tabla de colores, almacena una serie de instrucciones a seguir por la computadora para, literalmente, ''dibujar'' el gráfico cada vez que lo necesite. Un archivo vectorial puede contener instrucciones como: ''&quot;dibujar un circulo aquí con este radio&quot;'', ''&quot;trazar una recta de este punto a este otro&quot;'', ''&quot;poner una flecha al final de esta linea&quot;'', y las instrucciones pueden complicarse hasta cosas como ''&quot;escribir este texto en esta posición con este tipo de letra y este tamaño&quot;'', ''&quot;dibujar una [[w:curva de Bézier|curva de Bézier]] con esta lista de puntos de control&quot;''.

Como todas las coordenadas de los puntos y dimensiones en un gráfico vectorial están dadas de manera relativa, aumentar o reducir el tamaño del gráfico es (para la computadora) una simple cuestión de multiplicar o dividir. Este formato es particularmente útil para crear diagramas (en esencia lineas, flechas y cuadros), así como gráficos para visualizar datos, fórmulas o ecuaciones (histogramas, diagramas de sectores, gráficas de puntos o líneas, etc.); así como ilustraciones en general: modelos de un átomo, el diagrama de un experimento o un fenómeno físico, una ilustración geométrica. Siempre es preferible, si es posible, tener gráficos vectoriales pues conservan su calidad aún después de transformarlos o modificar su tamaño.

Hay aplicaciones profesionales, comerciales, que generan este tipo de gráficas como [[w:Corel Draw|Corel Draw]] y [[w:Adobe Illustrator|Adobe Illustrator]]. Las herramientas de dibujo de [[w:Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office]] (como en [[w:Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[w:Microsoft Word|Word]], [[w:Microsoft Excel|Excel]] o [[w:Microsoft Draw|Microsoft Draw]]) también generan gráficos vectoriales ([[w:WMF|WMF]]). En el mundo TeX son populares los formatos [[w:EPS|EPS]] (PostScript Encapsulado) y [[w:PDF|PDF]], además de que el mismo lenguaje de LaTeX (junto con algunos paquetes auxiliares) puede utilizarse para describir gráficos en un estilo vectorial.

Cabe señalar que la mayoría de los formatos vectoriales (si no es que todos) soportan también insertar mapas de bits dentro de ellos. Un error que muchos llegamos a cometer es pensar que, como hemos logrado guardar un gráfico dentro de un EPS, el gráfico ya es vectorial. Hay varias herramientas para producir gráficos que dicen poder exportar gráficos en EPS, pero lo único que hacen es guardar la tabla de colores dentro del EPS (y cabe señalar que el EPS es un formato particularmente malo para guardar mapas de bits resultando, usualmente, en archivos enormes aún para gráficos pequeños).

Hecha esta explicación lo único que queda por decir es que, siempre que sea posible, utilices algún formato vectorial para crear y guardar tus gráficos. Las únicas excepciones son cuando el gráfico es por naturaleza un mapa de bits, como por ejemplo: una fotografía, material obtenido de internet o capturas de pantalla.

===Dibujar/crear/obtener el gráfico===

En esta sección presentaremos diversos consejos para producir diferentes tipos de gráficos. Empezaremos por el caso de los mapas de bits donde las siguientes sugerencias te ayudarán a obtener buenos resultados.

====Fotografías en formato JPEG====

La mayoría de las cámaras y escáneres digitales producen directamente archivos ya en formato [[w:JPEG|JPEG]] (o JPG, que son lo mismo). La ventaja principal del formato JPEG es que tiene un algoritmo de compresión muy poderoso que produce, normalmente, archivos muy pequeños (comparados por ejemplo con un BMP). Para alcanzar estos altos niveles de compresión se basa en el hecho de que el ojo humano no es realmente capáz de distinguir tantos colores como hay disponibles en una computadora (algo así como 24 millones de colores) y modifica ligeramente el color de algunos puntos (''píxeles'') en la imagen.

Podemos decir, de hecho, que el formato JPEG logra comprimir la imagen sacrificando un poco de su calidad. Para fotografías, u otro material similar, que normalmente contienen muchisimos colores la pérdida de calidad es imperceptible y convierte al formato JPEG en una opción excelente.

====Imágenes ''sencillas'' en formatos BMP, GIF, PNG====

En este caso por ''sencillas'' me refiero a mapas de bits con pocos colores, o con areas uniformes (del mismo color) muy grandes. Este tipo de gráficos son comunes, por ejemplo, en manuales de software donde quieres incluir una figura mostrando alguna de las ventanas de tu aplicación o en general cualquier [[w:captura de pantalla|captura de pantalla]] (''screenshot''). Para estos casos la compresión en JPEG puede ser un desastre ya que la pérdida de calidad si se hace notoria y evidente.

La solución entonces es recurrir a formatos como [[w:BMP|BMP]] que no realiza gran esfuerzo para comprimir (en cuanto a calidad es el mejor formato porque guarda la tabla de colores, casi, tal cual). Otras mejores soluciones son [[w:GIF|GIF]] y [[w:PNG|PNG]] que sí tienen algoritmos de compresión más inteligentes pero evitan en lo posible demeritar la calidad del gráfico. En todo caso, si tienes la posibilidad de elegir, PNG es mucho mejor formato pues nunca ha tenido problemas de [http://burnallgifs.org/archives/ patentes] y es mucho más amigable con LaTeX.

====Herramientas para manipular mapas de bits====

Si quieres hacer retoques o editar un mapa de bits existen soluciones comerciales como [[w:Adobe Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]] o [[w:Paint Shop Pro|Paint Shop Pro]]. [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] tiene el programa [[w:Microsoft Paint|Paint]] que provee una funcionalidad mínima y para algunos casos puede ser suficiente. Alternativamente en el mundo del software libre puedes encontrar [http://www.gimp.org/ The Gimp], es el favorito de los usuarios de [[w:Linux|Linux]] y hay también una versión de [http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/ Gimp para Windows]. Estos programas te permiten también convertir entre tipos de formatos y producir, entre otros, los BMP, PNG o JPEG. El programa [http://www.imagemagick.org/ ImageMagick], que presentaremos en detalle más adelante, es también muy util para convertir entre diferentes formatos.

Recuerda, sin embargo, no utilizar mapas de bits a menos que tu gráfica sea una fotografía, que la única fuente que tengas de la imagen sea a través de internet, o que la imagen la obtengas como una [[w:captura de pantalla|captura de pantalla]].

====Productos comerciales====

Para gráficos vectoriales hay muchas más opciones y caminos a seguir. Todos con sus propias ventajas y desventajas. Un grupo de estas soluciones consiste en utilizar algún producto comercial, como [[w:Corel Draw|Corel Draw]] o [[w:Adobe Illustrator|Adobe Illustrator]], para crear tus gráficos. Este tipo de programas normalmente pueden exportar buenos archivos EPS que se pueden utilizar con LaTeX. Una de sus principales ventajas es que proveen un juego de herramientas muy completas para hacer todo tipo de diseños profesionales. Siempre guarda, además del EPS que puedes exportar, una copia de tu gráfico en el formato nativo de la aplicación para poder modificarlo o reusarlo después.

En el caso de gráficas de puntos o lineas, o gráficas en general que resultan de análisis numérico, muy buenas soluciones comerciales incluyen a [[w:MATLAB|MATLAB]] y [[w:Mathematica|Mathematica]]. Estos programas también permiten exportar los gráficos en EPS y otros formatos amigables para LaTeX.

La desventaja obvia es que necesitas tener acceso a uno de estos programas ya sea en tu universidad, lugar de trabajo o, alternativamente, comprar una licencia para usarla en tu propia computadora. Otra desventaja es que para algunos usuarios principiantes la gran cantidad de opciones y herramientas puede hacer parecer complicado el usar este tipo de programas.

'''Nota:''' Algunas aplicaciones tienen la opción de agregar un ''&quot;tiff preview&quot;'' al archivo EPS. Verifica que tengas deshabilitada esta opción ya que dichos ''previews'' hacen que LaTeX sea incapaz de procesar correctamente el archivo EPS.

====Soluciones alternativas====

Existe también [[w:software libre|software libre]] alternativo que puedes utilizar para crear tus gráficos. Un muy buen editor libre para gráficos vectoriales es [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkspace]. Otra solución alternativa, enfocada particularmente a la creación de diagramas y realmente muy fácil de usar, es [http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/ Dia] que cuenta también con un [http://dia-installer.sourceforge.net/ instalador] para Windows.

La ventaja principal de estos programas es que se trata de software libre, que puedes obtener gratuitamente desde internet, y su potencial es muy cercano al de las soluciones comerciales discutidas anteriormente.

Otro de los favoritos de Linux es [http://www.xfig.org/ Xfig] que tiene su equivalente [http://www.schmidt-web-berlin.de/WinFIG.htm WinFIG] para Windows. Además está [http://www.skencil.org Skencil] que, después de cargar una buena cantidad de [http://www.nongnu.org/skencil/devel.html herramientas y aplicaciones], también puedes correr en Windows. Finalmente esta la suite de aplicaciones de [http://www.koffice.org KOffice] que corre en el ambiente KDE y, entre otras monerias, incluye Kivio (para diagramas) y Karbon14 (para gráficos vectoriales). También hay intentos de hacer correr KOffice en Windows pero se encuentra todo en etapas mas bien experimentales y necesitas instalar una buena cantidad de emuladores de Linux (vamos, que al final es más facil instalarte mejor un sistema de Linux completo).

Una de las pocas desventajas es que prácticamente todos estos programas se originaron para Linux y, aunque si hay algunas versiones para Windows relativamente fáciles de instalar, el entorno de trabajo no se siente tan estable y fluido como el de las soluciones comerciales.

====Soluciones amigables para Windows====

Si estás muy acostumbrado al uso de productos de Microsoft Office o programas de Windows en general, hay buen truco que consiste en instalar el controlador de una impresora PostScript genérica en tu computadora. Hecho esto puedes mandar a imprimir desde cualquier programa o aplicación de Windows y guardar los resultados en un archivo EPS. Después de esto tienes aún que ''arreglar'' el archivo EPS antes de poder usarlo en LaTeX. Los detalles y consejos adicionales para poner en práctica esta solución los puedes encontrar en el excelente artículo [http://ltx.blogspot.com/2003/11/cmo-crear-figuras-eps-desde-windows.html Cómo crear figuras EPS desde Windows] de JL Diaz.

Una opción ''shareware'' en esta misma línea consiste en utilizar [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/wmf2eps.html WMF2EPS]. Este programa te ayuda realizar con unos cuantos ''clicks'' todo el proceso, que puede llegar a ser un poco engorroso, de imprimir el archivo EPS y corregirlo. La gran desventaja de esta solución es que se trata de [[w:shareware|shareware]] y sólo lo puedes utilizar, según la documentación, durante diez dias antes de comprar el producto.

====Usando el lenguaje de LaTeX====

Otra solución que da muy buenos resultados es utilizar el mismo lenguaje de LaTeX para describir tus gráficos. Un paquete excelente que te permite hacer este tipo de cosas es [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/pgf.html TikZ] de Till Tantau (lo puedes instalar fácilmente desde ''MiKTeX Options'') que pone a tu disposición una amplia gama de comandos para realizar todo tipo de gráficos y diagramas. Los resultados son impresionantes y espectaculares, tan sólo da una mirada al [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/doc/generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/en/pgfmanual.pdf manual de usuario] (en inglés) que, además, es un placer de leer.

Esto tiene sus ventajas y desventajas, muy similares a LaTeX mismo. Por un lado al poder ''programar'' tus gráficos tienes un control absoluto y preciso sobre todos los detalles, realizar gráficos sencillos es también muy rápido. Por otra parte, tienes un nuevo lenguaje que aprender, no tiene una interface gráfica y el código (por más sencillo que sea) no te permite ver inmediatamente como es que se verá finalmente el gráfico.

Un paquete que pone en práctica una idea muy similar es [http://pstricks.de PSTricks] de Herbert Voß que, aunque puede ser algo más poderoso, tiene la desventaja de que sólo puede producir directamente archivos en formato PS. Para lograr conseguir archivos PDF tienes que hacer un poco más de [http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=pdf/pdfoutput trucos].

Existen algunos intentos por crear interfaces gráficas que pueden ayudarte a ganar un poco de las ventajas de este tipo de soluciones sin tener que cargar con todas sus desventajas. Uno de proyectos más notables es [http://jpicedt.sourceforge.net/ jPicEdt] de Sylvain Reynal que te permite exportar código de PSTricks para incluirlo en tu documento de LaTeX. jPicEdt es una buena solución y con un repertorio de herramientas bastante razonable pero, aunque que se encuentra en constante y activo desarrollo, aún no tiene el potencial y la versatilidad que otras soluciones (tanto libres como comerciales) suelen llegar a tener. Obserba también que '''j'''PicEdt está escrito en Java y necesitas tener una [http://java.com/en/index.jsp máquina virtual de Java] para poder ejecutarlo.

Otra aplicación que cae en esta categaría es [http://www.gnuplot.info/ gnuplot] que te permite crear gráficos a partir de datos o funciones matemáticas. Se trata también de un programa donde tienes que hacer ''scripts'' (aprender un nuevo lenguaje) para después procesarlos y obtener el gráfico en alguno de los lenguajes para LaTeX (como PSTricks) o directamente en EPS.

La ventaja principal de este tipo de soluciones es que, a diferencia de todas las anteriores, el procesado del gráfico se hace por LaTeX mismo. En particular tienes acceso a insertar texto y fórmulas con toda la libertad como lo harías en el resto de tu documento. Esto produce finalmente gráficos de muy buena calidad pues, si contienen texto o símbolos, se utilizan las mismas fuentes del resto del documento ganando uniformidad.

Las mejores soluciones, en cuanto a calidad final, se pueden lograr normalmente utilizando este tipo de herramientas. Sin embargo, son también estas soluciones las que pueden requierir de mucho más trabajo y esfuerzo para lograr ver los resultados finales en tu documento.

===Preparar el gráfico en un formato adecuado para LaTeX===

En este momento debes de tener ya dibujado o creado tu gráfico pero, posiblemente, no se encuentre aún en un formato adecuado que pueda entender LaTeX. Para esto hay dos reglas básicas que tienes que seguir:

* Si generas un documento PS (compilas con &lt;tt&gt;latex + dvips&lt;/tt&gt;, los modos &lt;tt&gt;LaTeX =&gt; PS&lt;/tt&gt; ó &lt;tt&gt;LaTeX =&gt; PS =&gt; PDF&lt;/tt&gt; de TeXnicCenter) necesitas todas tus figuras en formato EPS.
* Si generas directamente un PDF (compilas con &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt;, o el modo &lt;tt&gt;LaTeX =&gt; PDF&lt;/tt&gt; de TeXnicCenter) necesitas tus figuras ya sea en PNG, JPEG o PDF.

Si eres de los que les gusta simplificarse la vida y no te gustan las reglas complicadas, entonces simplemente apréndete esta regla infalible:

* Asegurate de tener, por cada gráfico, una versión EPS y otra versión en alguno de los formatos: PNG, JPEG o PDF.

De estos últimos tres formatos elige el más adecuado según el tipo de gráfico que se trate: PNG para mapas de bits ''simples'', JPEG para fotografías digitales y PDF para gráficos vectoriales. Ahora la pregunta que seguramente te estás haciendo es: ¿Y cómo carambas logro obtener mi gráfico en alguno de estos formatos ''raros''? Las siguientes secciones muestran los métodos más comunes y efectivos.

====EPS a PDF====

Muchas de las soluciones presentadas anteriormente te permiten generar o exportar a un archivo EPS. Si ya tienes el EPS entonces conseguir el PDF es muy sencillo. Simplemente abre una ventana de ''Símbolo de Sistema'' o ''Consola de Comandos'' busca la carpeta donde tienes tu gráfico y ejecuta el comando:

 &gt; epstopdf grafico.eps

Esto genera el archivo PDF correspondiente y, si el EPS contenía originalmente un gráfico vectorial, el PDF resultante será también vectorial. No es recomendable usar esta ruta si el EPS contiene un mapa de bits ya que producir un PNG o JPEG es mucho mejor alternativa. El comando &lt;tt&gt;epstopdf&lt;/tt&gt; es parte de MiKTeX y seguramente ya lo tienes instalado.

====JPEG a EPS====

Si tienes un gráfico JPEG, y necesitas producir un documento PS, la mejor solución es encapsularlo dentro de un EPS usando [http://www.pdflib.com/products/more/jpeg2ps.html jpeg2ps]. Este programa lo tienes que bajar e instalar en tu computadora, una vez hecho esto puedes ejecutar el comando:

 &gt; jpeg2ps grafico.jpg &gt; grafico.eps

para generar el archivo EPS correspondiente. Este comando lo que hace es simplemente añadir a tu archivo JPEG cierta información adicional que le permite a LaTeX procesarlo correctamente, conservando la compresión del archivo original. Esto es buena idea ya que, como comenté anteriormente, el formato EPS es particularmente malo para tratar directamente con mapas de bits (genera archivos ''muy'' grandes).

====ImageMagick: LoQueSea a LoQueSea====

Una excelente herramienta, si ya tienes tu gráfico guardado pero en algún formato incompatible con LaTeX, es utilizar [http://www.imagemagick.org/ ImageMagick]. Entre otras cosas, este programa te permite convertir entre una cantidad inimaginable de formatos usando un sencillo comando &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; (se ejecuta también desde una consola de comandos), por ejemplo:

 &gt; convert grafico.png grafico.eps

En particular si tienes [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ Ghostscript] instalado (en MiKTeX, por ejemplo, ya viene incluido) te brinda soporte para generar los archivos EPS. ImageMagick da muy buenos resultados convirtiendo mapas de bits, pero debes de tener un poco de cautela tratando de convertir gráficos vectoriales pues no siempre da los mejores resultados.

===Insertar el gráfico como una figura dentro de tu documento===

Ya que tienes listo el gráfico en un formato adecuado lo que sigue es agregarlo a un documento en LaTeX. Abre tu documento de LaTeX (&lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt;) y agrega la siguiente instrucción en el preámbulo (antes de &lt;code&gt;\begin{document}&lt;/code&gt;):

 \usepackage{graphicx}

Este paquete lo que hace es permitir incluir gráficos externos en tu documento. Luego, en algún lugar cercano a donde quieras que se coloque tu figura agrega el siguiente código:

 \begin{figure}
   \centering
     \includegraphics{migrafico}
   \caption{Mi Figura}
   \label{fig:ejemplo}
 \end{figure}

El comando &lt;code&gt;\includegraphics{...}&lt;/code&gt; indica el nombre del archivo que contiene el gráfico que quieres insertar. Observa que no es necesario incluir la extensión del archivo, de este modo LaTeX siempre utilizará el más adecuado (EPS, PDF, PNG o JPEG) según la forma en que estés compilando.

==Consejos y notas adicionales==

En esta útlima sección se encuentran algunas notas finales que pueden ayudarte a resolver problemas típicos cuando tratas de insertar figuras en LaTeX.

===Posicionamiento de las figuras===

Normalmente las figuras no aparecen exactamente en el lugar donde tu las podrías esperar. Pero no te alarmes demasiado, LaTeX es muy inteligente y lo que hace es tratar de acomodar las figuras en el lugar más apropiado donde se verán mejor.

Evita entonces redacciones del tipo:

 ... como se muestra en la siguiente figura:

y utiliza en su lugar las bondades de LaTeX:

 ... como se muestra en la Figura~\ref{fig:ejemplo}.

Esto hace que la referencia no dependa del lugar donde aparesca la figura y, finalmente, todo se ve mucho más elegante. Si, por alguna razón, realmente quieres controlar la posición donde aparece la figura puedes leer el artículo [http://ltx.blogspot.com/2003/10/quiero-mi-figura-aqui.html Quiero mi figura AQUÍ] de JL Diaz.

===Tamaño de las figuras===

Si la figura resulta demasiado grande o demasiado pequeña puedes agregar opciones al comando para incluir el gráfico:

 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{migrafico}

que ajusta el ancho de la figura al 70% del ancho del texto que cabe en una página. Puedes, por supuesto, modificar el valor 0.7 por cualquier otro para ajustar el tamaño a tus necesidades. Hay muchas más opciones que provee el comando &lt;code&gt;\includegraphics&lt;/code&gt;, si tienes curiosidad puedes leer la guía [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex.pdf Using Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e].

===Ruta para guardar los archivos===

Recuerda poner los archivos de los gráficos (al menos las versiones que requieres para compilar en LaTeX) en la misma carpeta donde se encuentra el archivo principal &lt;tt&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; de tu documento. Esto te ayuda a resolver muchos de los problemas que podrías tener insertanto figuras y ayuda a que LaTeX sea más eficiente procesando tu documento. Existen opciones para especificar rutas alternativas donde LaTeX puede buscar tus gráficos, si estás interesado revisa la también la guía [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex.pdf Using Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e] donde se discuten además los pros y los contras.

===Problemas de visualización===

Uno de los problemas típicos de visualización que los principiantes llegamos a tener es que la gráfica no aparece y, en su lugar, sólo vemos una caja con el nombre del archivo del gráfico. Esto normalmente ocurre porque se tiene activada la opción &lt;code&gt;draft&lt;/code&gt;, ya sea como opción del paquete en &lt;code&gt;\usepackage[draf]{graphicx}&lt;/code&gt; o como una opción global para todo tu documento en &lt;code&gt;\documentclass&lt;/code&gt;. Esta opción puede ser muy útil ya que, normalmente, los documentos sin gráficos se pueden visualizar más rápidamente mientras estás desarrollando tu trabajo. Sin embargo recuerda quitar esta opción, o cambiarla por &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;, si quieres que aparescan los gráficos en el documento.

Otro de los problemas es que, principalmente con archivos EPS, los gráficos no aparecen correctamente cuando visualizas el DVI de tu documento. Recuerda que el formato DVI es sólo para ''pre-visualizar'' tus documentos. No esperes ver todas tus gráficas y con todos sus efectos especiales en un visor de archivos DVI (como Yap de MiKTeX). Para ver los resultados finales y definitivos siempre mira el archivo PS o PDF.</text>

I saw your question on the mathematics bookshelf, and I wanted to see if i could help out. Wikibooks in general frowns upon creating random pages full of lists, so it would be a bad idea to simply create a page that lists highschool-appropriate classes. However, there are 2 techniques that you could use, if you want to lump all such pages into a single reference source:

#you can create a subpage in your user namespace to hold the list. User namespaces are generally free from the restrictions in other parts of wikibooks, although some restrictions still apply. You can list all relevant pages on your user page namespace.
#you could create a template that would tag certain pages as being &quot;highschool appropriate&quot;, and then create a category for that template. All the tagged pages then would appear under the category, which you could browse.

If you want to try either solution, or if you have any questions, leave me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my talk page]]. good luck! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Digital Signal Processing|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:12, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

When designing a particular filter, it is common practice to first design a Low-pass filter, and then using a spectral transform to convert that lowpass filter equation into the equation of a different type of filter. This is done because many common values for butterworth, cheybyshev and elliptical low-pass filters are already extensively tabulated, and designing a filter in this manner rarely requires more effort then looking values up in a table, and applying the correct transformations. This page will enumerate some of the common transformations for filter design.

It is important to note that spectral transformations are not exclusively used for analog filters. There are digital variants of these transformations that can be applied directly to digital filters to transform them into a different type. This page will only talk about the analog filter transforms, and the digital filter transforms will be discussed elsewhere.

== Low-Pass to Low-Pass ==

This spectral transform is used to convert between two lowpass filters with different cutoff frequencies.

:&lt;math&gt;z^{-1} = \frac{1}{F(\hat{z})} = &lt;/math&gt;

We have high-pass and lowpass filters, and it turns out that we can create both filter effects using a single piece of hardware called a '''tunable filter'''. Tunable filters rely on a device called an '''allpass''' filter to create other types of filter outputs.

== Allpass Filters ==

A common, although unintuitive, tool in the DSP toolbox is the all-pass filter. As the name implies, the all-pass filter passes all frequency components without attenuation.

== Why Allpass? ==

The question comes up, if an allpass filter doesn't actually filter anything, why do we bother to study it? The answer is that even though the allpass filter doesn't affect the magnitude response of the system, it will affect the phase response of the system.

Allpass filters have the property that cascading an allpass filter with another IIR filter will produce a linear output for the whole system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This section covers the topics on sensor imperfection and how these components behave in the real world.''

There is no such thing as a &quot;distance sensor&quot;. period. Those components commonly called &quot;distance sensor&quot; or similar names measure something and extract distance information out of that. This extraction works pretty good in particular circumstances, but are worthless in many others. The key to successfully measuring e.g. a distance, is knowing, exactly, what your sensors measures and how external factors influence the measurement. This doesn't mean you just need to know how accurate the sensor is, it means you need to know what part of physics is used, and what the laws of physics say about that.

I'll cover some of the most commonly used sensors and what laws of physics apply to those. I'm not going very deep into explaining physics, there are better sources for that (a wiki physics book for example), just enough to give you the idea of what problems you may expect and where to look for a solution.

==Light Based Sensors==

===Reflection: short range sensors===
This type of sensor detects objects at a range up to a few centimeter. These sensors are quite simple. They consist of a light source, usually an IR diode which signal can be modulated and a light detector, which can be as simple as a light sensitive diode or transistor with an amplification circuit or a more complex IC complete with filters and TTL level outputs.

These sensors work by detecting the reflection of the emitted light. The range at which an object is detected depends on a number of properties of the object:&lt;BR&gt;
* reflectivity/color: how well does the object reflect IR-light? Every object has a color. A green object means that it reflects light with wavelengths that we interpret as the color green. This can be a pretty large range. IR is also a color. Like any other color, some objects reflect IR, and other objects absorb IR.
* surface smoothness: A very smooth surface (like a mirror) reflects more light than a rough surface. (For example, a photograph of a black billiards ball usually shows a white spot caused by [[w:specular reflection]]).
* Angle: The more the surface is turned away from the sensor the more light is going to be reflected away from the sensor.
* Lightsources: Other lightsources like light bulbs or the sun emit IR light as well. Especially the sun can prevent an IR based sensor to operate.

===Reflection: medium range sensors===
Medium range sensors are a bit more complicated than short range sensors. These sensors consist of an IR emitting diode which signal is modulated, the receiver has a lens to focus the reflected light onto a light sensitive strip. Moving the sensor back and forward towards an object moves the reflection beam along the light sensitive strip. The resistance of the strip depends on where the light hits the strip.

Its range has the same limiting factors as short range sensors.

===Reflection: Long range sensors===
Long range sensors use the time a laser pulse takes to travel from the emitter to the object and back.  There are several methods of measuring this time of flight, but most involve correlating the transmitted and received light pulse.  By comparing the phase of these two pieces of data, a very accurate time value can be extracted.  These sensors can operate over a wide range, typically between a few centimeters up to several kilometers.

Its range is also limited in the same way as the previous IR sensors. Another thing than can limit is haze, smoke and other particles on the air.

=== Camera ===

Cameras used in robotics are commonly built around a [[w:Image sensor|image Sensor]]. These cameras are sensitive to IR-light and usually have a IR-filter in front of the lens. Cheap webcams may not contain such a filter, which makes them very sensitive to sunlight. 


=== Stereo vision ===

These sensors consist of (at least) 2 cameras mounted some fixed distance from each other.

This is rarely used because solving the [[w:correspondence problem|correspondence problem]] is difficult.

See also [[Robotics: Sensors: Computer Vision]].

==Sound Based Sensors==
===What is sound?===
Sound is in essence vibrations and pressure differences in the air. These vibrations are split into 3 groups by their frequency. The first group, called ''infrasone'' has a frequency below 20 Hz. The second group, called ''ultrasonic'', has a frequency above 20 kHz and an upperbound of 2 MHz in air or 30 MHz in water. The last group is what is commonly called ''sound''. This groups range lays between 20 Hz and 20 kHz and can be heard. Although only newborn babies can really hear all the way up to 20 kHz. The older you get the less frequencies you can hear.

Most sensors use ultrasonic sound, usually around 40kHz. Such a signal can't be heard, while it's still easy to use (generate, detect, ...).

===Doppler effect===
If both the source and the receiver are motionless relative to each other, the receiver will hear the same frequency as the source emitted. However if one or both of them move relative to the other, the receiver will detect a different frequency. This change in frequency is called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect Doppler Effect]. Most people know this effect from the sirens of passing police cars or ambulances. When they pass you'll hear one sound as they approach and a somewhat different sound as they move away.

Calculating what frequency the receiver will hear is quite easy:

&lt;math&gt;f_r = f \frac{c + v_r}{c - v_s} &lt;/math&gt;

With:
:&lt;math&gt; f_r&lt;/math&gt; = The frequency the receiver hears
:&lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; = the frequency the source emits
:&lt;math&gt; c&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of sound
:&lt;math&gt; v_r&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of the receiver
:&lt;math&gt; v_s&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of the source

===Speed of sound===
The speed of sound depends on the medium it traverse through and its temperature. For air this is approximately 330m/s at 0°C. Of course most of the time the temperature is a bit higher than this. Calculating the actual speed is fairly easy:

&lt;math&gt;c = c_0 \sqrt{\frac{T}{T_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

with:
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = the actual speed at the current temperature.
:&lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; = the speed of sound at 0°C: 330m/s.
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = the current temperature in Kelvin.
:&lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; = 273,15 K (this is 0°C in Kelvin)

===Reflection===

===Resonance===
===Diffraction===

==Ultrasonic Distance sensors==
These sensors are pretty simple. In theory that is. In practice these sensors can be a real pain in the pinky. In this section I'll cover some of the troubles you may run into when trying to get them to work.

Ultrasonic distance sensors consist of 3 major parts: A transmitter, a receiver and a timer. To measure a distance the timer triggers the transmitter which emits a series of pulses, then the timer waits until the receiver detects the reflection of the pulses and stops the timer. The time measured is then divided by 2 and multiplied with the speed of sound. The result is the distance between the sensor and the object in front of it.
The transmitter send out a stream of pulses on a carrier frequency. The maximum frequency humans can hear is about 20 kHz. A frequency higher than that is picked to avoid annoying humans with the constant beep -- 40 kHz is a common value.

The receiver triggers when it receives a signal with that particular frequency. This is not necessary the signal the transmitter sent. If more than one ultrasonic sensor with the same carrier frequency are used, they can detect each others signals.

Sound doesn't move in a straight line, but rather as a 3D expanding wave. When the wave reaches an object part of it bounces back and moves again as a 3D expanding wave in the opposite direction. Such a wave can easily bounce multiple times before disappearing. So it is very possible that you receive pulses that have travel a much larger trajectory than just to and back from the object in front of the sensor. While some part of this problem can be solved by letting the sensor wait some time before starting another measurement, other situation can produce incorrect measurements which are fairly tough to correct. For example moving through a doorway can fail because the sensors emitted pulses bounce from the walls back to the sensor and so giving a measurement that indicates an object in front of the sensor. One way of correcting this is using another sensor, for example a IR distance sensor to see if there really is an object. However such solution pose another problem: which sensor to believe? 3 sensors allow you to go with the majority, but then things become quite complicated in constructing and interfacing such systems, not to mention what it does to the power consumption.

===Distance Formula===
The formula for calculating distance from a sonar pulse looks like:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Distance} = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \times \frac{\text{Elapsed Time}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

343 m/s is the speed of sound, and we need to divide the time by 2 because the sound travels out and back.

===Availability &amp; Range===
Sonar sensors are widely available and relatively inexpensive, ranging from $15 to $40 depending on the desired range.  On average the maximum range of a midlevel sonar sensor will be between 4 and 6 meters.  Unlike infrared or laser sensors, sonar sensors also have a minimum sensing distance as well.  This is due to the fact that the distance measurements are based on the speed of sound, and over very short ranges the sound travels out and back more quickly than the circuitry can respond.  This minimum distance will vary by sensors, but is typically around 2 to 5 centimeters.
Also unlike infrared sensors, sonar sensors don’t have a perfect “cone” of vision.  Because sound propagates as a 3D pressure wave, the sensor actually has a range that resembles a sinc function wrapped around a curve.

===Potential Problems===
Sonar sensors work very well for collision avoidance in large areas, but they do have some limitations.  Because sound propagates out as a 3D pressure wave and echoes, your robot may see things that are not really in its way.  For instance, near angled walls the sound waves may bounce several times before returning to the sonar receiver.  This makes it difficult for the robot to know which echo is actually the correct distance to the nearest obstacle.

Similar to this is the problem of having multiple sonar sensors operating the in the same area.  If the frequencies of nearby sonar sensors are too similar they may cause false readings since the sensors have no method besides frequency to distinguish pulses it sent out from those other sensors send out.

Another common problem is the difference in absorbency and reflection of different materials.  If you shoot a sonar pulse at a cloth covered wall (i.e. cubicle), it is likely that the cloth will absorb a significant amount of the acoustic energy and that the robot will not see the wall at all.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, a floor with very high acoustic reflection may register as an obstacle when it is really a clear plane.

==Magnetism Based Sensors==

===Compass sensors===
These sensors are used to measure the orientation of the robot relative to the magnetic north. It is important to remember that the magnetic north is not exactly the same as the geographical north. They differ several degrees.

The magnetic field of Earth is quite weak. This makes that these sensors will not operate well along other magnetic fields. E.g. speakers would mess up the reading. If you use these sensors it is best to mount them as far away from your motors as possible. While you can't shield them without making them useless, paying attentions to where you mount them can make a considerable difference in reliability.

Access keys are keyboard shortcuts for links and form elements. Important links that appear on all pages on your website, e.g. the link to the home page, should be given an access key. The access key bindings should be the same on all pages on your website. You should include a web page that lists all the access keys used on your website.

== Search and Site Map ==
You can't have a link from your home page to every other page on the website. If your website contains more than a few pages you need a site map and possibly a search tool so users can find relevant pages easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello... I notice that you have been adding many wiki links to the [[English]] book.

You might want to read '''[[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]'''. This wiki, Wikibooks, is divided into separate books, so instead of making links like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Past simple]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, you should make links like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[English:Verbs]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, with &quot;English:&quot; or &quot;English/&quot; in front, where &quot;English&quot; is the front page of a book. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">* create a more thorough introduction
* add a better explanation of terms for beginner users
* place comments within examples
* expand the summary section and put a positive spin on the &quot;draw-backs&quot; section
* conform the visual aspects of the page to the ones discussed in class

'''revisions suggested by editorial board - Christina Serrano - 2/2/06'''

Billy, I agree with all of your suggestions. I'll elaborate below.

* Learning Objectives - Revise so they're more descriptive and illustrate what is really learned in this chapter. Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;create custom XLINK in both XML and XML schema&quot;'' Where is the schema? Maybe I overlooked something, but I only see information about how to use XLINK in an XML document and stylesheet.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Introduction - Flesh out the Intro and revise some of the current wording. Examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;XLink allows a documents hyperlinks to be isolated and centralized on a separate document which is similiar to centralization of formatting on XSL stylesheets. When document addresses change these can be changed in the centralized location.&quot; ''This is worded awkwardly.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;XLink allows bidirectional linking and parameters that control when the link is processed.&quot; ''What does this mean? What is bidirectional linking? This could be explained before this bulleted list. The Intro can also explain parameter controls.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The use of xlink requires the declaration of the xlink namespace which is at http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink/. This namespace provides the global attributes for type, href, role, arcrole, title, show, actuate, label, from and to.&quot; ''What is the xlink namespace? Elaborate on the global attributes, even if you just say that these attributes will be outlined in more detail in the XML Documentation section of this chapter.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* XML Documentation - 1. Should this section be titled &quot;XML Documentation&quot;? 2. The attributes should be listed in a table format, with a table heading. There should also be a segment of info before and after the table to transition between the sections. Examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Intro: &quot;The following table outlines the attributes that can be used with the xlink namespace. The table also includes descriptions of how the attributes can be used.&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Summary: &quot;The proceeding examples illustrate how to use the xlink namespace and attributes within XML documents (and schemas? stylesheets?).&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* XML Examples - The code should be separated for the XML document, XML stylesheet, and HTML. The examples should have better explanations. If feasible, it may be helpful to modify the example code to continue the TourGuide model.
* Summary - The summary seems to have unnecessary line breaks at the end of each line. Regarding the XLINK limitations, is this information still current? Is it possible that there's more widespread support for XLINK in browsers today?
* Exercises - I don't believe the exercises should be in their own blocks. I need to consult with the editorial board, so we can develop more specific standards for formatting exercises and solutions. However, exercises and solutions should be links off of this page.
* Overall - The page formatting should conform to the author guidelines (as you've said). The content can be fleshed out and explained better. Please edit any grammar or spelling errors you see. There are many fragments and missing punctuation in the text.

I think the plan and comments on the plan are on target.

== Discrete Cosine Transform  in dsp==

The '''Discrete Cosine Transform''' (DCT) is a transform that is very common when encoding video and audio tracks on computers. Many &quot;codecs&quot; for movies rely on DCT concepts for compressing and encoding video files. The DCT can also be used to analyze the spectral components of images as well. The DCT is very similar to the DFT, except the output values are all real numbers, and the output vector is approximately twice as long as the DFT output.
It expresses a sequence of finite data points in terms of sum of cosine functions.

== Haar Transform ==

The Haar Transform, or the '''Haar Wavelet Transform''' (HWT) is one of a group of related transforms known as the '''Discrete Wavelet Transforms''' (DWT). DWT Transforms, and the Haar transform in particular can frequently be made very fast using matrix calculations. The fastest known algorithm for computing the HWT is known as the '''Fast Haar Transform''', and is comparable in speed and properties to the Fast Fourier Transform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beekeeping gloves are, as the name suggests, special gloves made for beekeeping.  They are made of leather and other tough but flexible materials.  The gloves extend to the elbows, where they are tied.
Many experienced beekeepers do not use gloves as bees will generally not sting unless provoked.  For beginners, however, both because they are more likely to make mistakes and because they aren't so used to being around bees, gloves are definitely a good idea.

Some people use thin nitrile gloves as an alternative to heavy duty leather gloves. These gloves are more sensitive and therefore result in less chance that bees will get inadvertently crushed. In addition, bees don't perceive the nitrile gloves as skin so they tend not to sting through the gloves.

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Chessmaniac. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Chessmaniac~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

There is a very verbose policy [[Wikibooks:Media]] that needs some tweaking. I have called the attention at the time of the proposal to factual errors.&lt;br&gt; 
I strongly disagree with the use of the phrase &quot;Public domain works are works not protected by copyright laws or are ineligible for copyright protection.&quot; and also but with a minor degree have a strong distaste for the continued mislabeling of the Wikibooks GFDL policy as simply GFDL (this one may still cause us problems, it improbable, but any complain would have legitimacy, since any work that was clearly GFDL and is now using Wikibooks GFDL constitutes the relicensing of the work by an unauthorized party).&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Wikibooks GFDL&quot; is used to distinguish that the project uses the GFDL with some restrictions (that is with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts ).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:42, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

Preámbulo

Este ensayo nace de la diversidad. Somos diez personas de lugares muy distintos, y ponernos de acuerdo no ha sido tarea sencilla. La variabilidad en cada uno de los debates realizados, la falta de consenso y la dificultad para llevar a cabo la idea de concierto arendtiana, donde se supone que la polifonía de la diversidad, de todas las voces haciendo una amalgama musical en la cual diferencias y desacuerdos forman parte de una música colectiva que no desafina y suena bien, ha hecho que tengamos que recurrir al único lenguaje posible para unir este archipiélago disperso de subjetividades: el sentido del humor. 
La búsqueda del pensamiento como ejercicio libre de la imaginación y la necesidad de encarnar el reto de nuestra imaginación desbordada y estimulada por estos seminarios, ha hecho posible que nos conectemos en una misma frecuencia como proceso para poder hacer algo en común. Pero fue solamente cuando dejamos de tomarnos tan en serio unos a otros, cuando nos pudimos reír y apreciar nuestros ridículos intentos de imponer hacer al grupo lo que cada uno quería hacer individualmente. Solamente en ese momento en que pudimos ver lo que nos estaba pasando pudimos empezar a desarrollar verdaderamente algo juntos. Y es que hasta entonces cada uno quería ejercer cierto dominio desde el reino de su parcela de conocimientos y experiencia confrontando a los demás ya que competir entre nosotros es una práctica habitual. Mucho Cacique y poco indio. En los debates pudimos discutir entre nosotros, coincidir, divagar, perdernos, encontrarnos, buscar puntos comunes, cuestionarlos y sobre todo reírnos de ellos a través del humor que nos abrió la puerta para darle la vuelta a la tortilla y cambiar nuestra dinámica de funcionamiento.
En un principio, cuando unimos los dos grupos de trabajo de los cuales partimos, no nos dimos cuenta de la complejidad de la tarea que nos habíamos propuesto. No parecía tan difícil enlazar los temas de Subjetividad, Prácticas e Imaginarios. Si somos muchos, podemos fácilmente dividirnos las tareas, parecimos asumir todos sin mucha preocupación. Craso error: cada uno tenía su mirada puesta en cosas muy diferentes desde perspectivas muy distintas y hacer un ensamblaje de esas diferencias iba a resultar, después de agotadores esfuerzos, a lo sumo en un pobre y desarticulado Frankenstein: pedazos mutilados y sin alma puestos juntos sin mayor trascendencia. 
Nos aventuramos pues en esta plataforma que nos unió, que es el sentido del humor, para poder aproximarnos al tema de investigación. Con toda probabilidad ha sido un esfuerzo lleno de riesgos, imprecisiones, límites borrosos y mucha dificultad. No ha estado exenta de sufrimientos, y a pesar de que tenemos la costumbre de asociar el humor a lo placentero, en numerosas ocasiones no lo ha sido tanto. Pero ha sido una aventura enriquecedora, muy nutritiva y también divertida para nosotros, como se aprecia en las etapas que hemos vivido a lo largo del trabajo, por lo que pensamos que ha valido la pena el esfuerzo y esperamos que también lo sea para los que lean este trabajo. 


 
Introducción
Este ensayo pretende estudiar la influencia del imaginario social en lo construcción de la subjetividad y la práctica social del sentido del humor. 

En la primera sección abordamos definiciones que varios autores ofrecen, entorno a al sujeto y subjetividad. Mostramos la indeterminación que el concepto encierra en su propia polisemia. Luego, partimos de las aportaciones de las ciencias sociales en torno a la subjetividad para introducirnos a la concepción de Castoriadis, en tanto sujeto como creación social.

En la segunda sección, partimos de la teoría de Castoriadis (1986) en cuanto al imaginario social y nos aventuraremos a estudiar el humor cómo una forma en que el imaginario social se materializa. Siendo el propio Castoriadis quién acuña el término de Imaginario Social, pareció pertinente tomarlo como base. Así, tomando como pretexto de algunas expresiones del humor, establecemos vínculos entre el humor  y los caracteres múltiples, del origen magmático, autonomía, de las dimensiones conjuntista-identitario y social-historico del imaginario social. 

Finalmente, la última sección concluimos………….. 






1.	De la noción de sujeto a la subjetividad: la indeterminación como principio.

El concepto de subjetividad es posiblemente uno de los más difíciles y problemáticos de definir en ciencias sociales, debido a su amplitud descomunal y escasa precisión. Para acercarnos a este complejo concepto, un punto de partida puede ser la noción de sujeto de Heidegger como ser ahí (dassein), que le otorga al ser humano la condición ontológico-existenciaria de que “es abierto a él mismo”, lo cual quiere decir que nos movemos ya en cierta comprensión de nosotros, sin que esta comprensión esté determinada o nos determine en modo alguno.  Es decir, para entender la subjetividad es preciso partir de un principio de indeterminación. 
Asimismo, Melucci (2001) la revela como una –unidad abierta-. Esto hace que podamos preguntarnos por sus sentidos sin que estos “aparezcan” del todo, sin que tengamos que hacer una visión desde el ojo de Dios, view from everywhere, o que tampoco la hagamos desde ningún lugar, view from nowhere. 

Hacer el intento de (re)presentar, (des)velar e imaginar la subjetividad supone adentrarse en un nodo de significados, intercambios y metáforas articuladoras de sentido. En la subjetividad están inscriptos: su contrario, “lo objetivo”, la identidad, la filosofía que supone sujetos, el Yo, la conciencia, el cuerpo, la verdad, la autonomía, la salvación, la belleza, la política, la historia, el lenguaje, los imaginarios, los otros, la sociedad, el conocimiento, la cultura, las preguntas acerca del origen:¿Quién soy ahora, qué papel me toca jugar?
Este gran conjunto aparentemente ilimitado de tropos es indicativo de la complejidad que existe para abordar una categoría que se presenta como nodo y no como un concepto o dispositivo concreto.

Existen pues muchas visiones de la subjetividad; las hay que le otorgan poder/saber al sujeto dotándolo de autonomía e imaginación y le dejan la posibilidad de auto construirse, autodeterminarse. Las hay también en su sentido opuesto, las que no le otorgan al sujeto casi ninguna posibilidad de autodeterminación en sí mismo, sino en principios o estructura externas que lo constriñen. El desarrollo de este nodo-concepto ha estado impregnado desde sus comienzos por la tradición filosófica occidental, a través de diversidad de escuelas y tendencias. El abordaje de la subjetividad plantea el surgimiento de la antinomia sujeto/objeto como un marco que pauta la conformación del conocimiento acerca de la realidad. Largos debates han atravesado las escuelas idealistas o materialistas en filosofía, las cuales han aportado multiplicidad de visiones sobre sus sentidos.

El marco filosófico occidental ha delimitado las coordenadas del ser: lo que uno es, está relacionado con lo que uno piensa, la identidad del Yo será un proceso reflexivo (con)formado por él mismo. En este contexto, la modernidad propone el sujeto y la conciencia como dos figuras para delinear la subjetividad.

En las ciencias sociales, podríamos decir que la conformación del nodo-concepto de subjetividad parte del espacio en que los sujetos sociales, y con ellos, los sujetos individualizados, comprenden el mundo y a sí mismos (Engelken, 2005). De esto se desprende que existen gran variedad de conceptos relacionados o asociados con el de subjetividad, tales como los de sí mismo, self, yo, mundo, sociedad, individuo, psique, identidad, cultura, entre tantos otros. 

La investigación de la subjetividad consiste básicamente en la interrogación de los sentidos, las significaciones y los valores, éticos y morales, que produce una determinada cultura, su forma de apropiación por los individuos y la orientación que efectúan sobre sus acciones prácticas. No existe una subjetividad que pueda aislarse de la cultura y la vida social, ni tampoco existe una cultura que pueda aislarse de la subjetividad que la sostiene. Esta mutua determinación –en verdad, mutua producción- debe ser nuestro punto de arranque, ya que la subjetividad es cultura singularizada tanto como la cultura es subjetividad (objetivada en los productos de la cultura, las forma de intercambio y las relaciones sociales concretas que las sostienen, pero también en las significaciones y los sentidos que organizan la producción cultural). 

1.1 Imaginario social y sujeto
Para Castoriadis (1986) el hombre existe sólo, en y a través, de la sociedad y la sociedad siempre es histórica. La sociedad como tal es una forma, cada sociedad dada es una forma particular e incluso singular. La forma se vincula a la organización, es decir, al orden o si se prefiere orden/desorden. Los individuos y las cosas son creaciones sociales tanto en la forma general y particular que ambos toman en cualquier sociedad determinada.

¿Qué es lo que mantiene unida a una sociedad? ¿Cuál es la base de la unidad, la cohesión y la diferenciación organizada de la maravillosa y compleja red del fenómeno que observamos en cada una de las sociedades existentes? 
Para Castoriadis (1986) lo que mantiene unida a una sociedad es “la institución de la sociedad como todo”, esto es, constituida de varias instituciones particulares. La palabra institución está tomada aquí en su sentido más amplio y radical: normas, valores, lenguaje, instrumentos, procedimientos y métodos para tratar con las cosas y hacer cosas, y, desde luego, también como el yo individual, en el tipo y la forma tanto particular como general. Por ejemplo, las distinciones: hombre/mujer que se le da en cada sociedad. 

Castoridis (1986) afirma que las instituciones prevalecen, asegurando su validez efectiva, a través de la adhesión, el apoyo, el consenso, la legitimidad, la creencia, más que por coerción y sanción. A la transformación, o fabricación, del material humano en individuos sociales, transformación en la cual están implicados éstos y el mecanismo de su perpetuación. Lo cual deja entrever una recursividad entre construcción de individuos sociales troquelados por la “la institución de la sociedad como todo”, y entre estos individuos que legitiman y reproducen las instituciones que les engendró. 

El autor se pregunta: ¿cuál es la parte del pensamiento y de la manera de mirar y de hacer las cosas que no está condicionada o co-determinada, en un nivel decisivo, por la estructura y los significados de la lengua, por la organización del mundo que aquélla lleva en sí, por el primer ambiente familiar, la escuela, todo el hacer y el no hacer al que uno ha estado constantemente expuesto, los amigos, las opiniones que van y vienen, las maneras en que uno se ve forzado por los innumerables artefactos en los cuales uno anda nadando, etc.? Concluye que si, con toda sinceridad, alguien puede responder cerca del uno por ciento de este planteamiento, ciertamente, es uno de los pensadores más originales que jamás han existido. 

Así pues, declara el autor, hay una unidad de la institución total de la sociedad y, esta unidad es la unidad y la cohesión interna de la inmensa y complicada red de significaciones que atraviesan, orientan y dirigen toda la vida de una sociedad y a los individuos concretos que la constituyen realmente. Esta red de significados es lo que él llamo el magma de las significaciones imaginario-sociales, las cuales son llevadas por la sociedad e incorporadas a ella y, por así decirlo, la animan. Tales significaciones imaginario sociales son, por ejemplo: los espíritus, los dioses, Dios; la polis, el ciudadano, la nación, el Estado, el partido, la comodidad, el dinero, el capital, la tasa de interés; el tabú, la virtud, el pecado, etc. Pero también son el hombre/la mujer/el niño tal como se especifican en una sociedad; más allá de las definiciones puramente anatómicas o biológicas, el hombre, la mujer y el niño son lo que son en virtud de las significaciones imaginario sociales que los hacen ser precisamente eso que son. Un romano y una romana fueron y son algo totalmente diferente, por ejemplo, de los americanos y las americanas de hoy. Castoridis llamó imaginarias a estas significaciones porque no tienen nada que ver con las referencias a lo racional o a los elementos de lo real, o no han sido agotadas por ellos, y porque son sustentadas por la creación. Y las llamó sociales porque existen sólo sí son instituidas y compartidas por una colectividad impersonal y anónima.

Si nos detenemos ahora en Bourdieu, éste nos explicará la posición que ocupa el sujeto, una posición relativa respecto a los otros actores dentro de lo que él entiende por campo, el espacio social pluridimensional. Las prácticas que desarrolle cada sujeto están en función del interés o ilusión por participar en este campo manteniendo, cambiando o intentando cambiar su posición dentro de él. 
No obstante, para que estas prácticas se instituyan como estrategias Bourdieu apela al habitus, que es lo que genera prácticas individuales dando a la conducta esquemas de percepción, pensamiento y acción y es lo que nos permitirá conectar lo individual con lo social. 

Normalmente el agente expresa su habitus de clase o grupo a través de un determinado habitus lingüístico: interés por decir determinadas cosas y una determinada manera y capacidad para hablar en un determinado contexto.  Por tanto, el habitus nos permite entender como una determinada comunicación entre diferentes sujetos está determinada por la internalización de la posición que ocupa en la estructura social. De esta manera vemos como se configuran mercados lingüísticos con discursos estilísticamente caracterizados (Bourdieu, 85), lo que condiciona racionalmente, según los propósitos individuales, cómo elegimos dirigirnos a terceros. Así pues, las prácticas del sentido del humor estarán relacionadas directamente con los sujeto/s al/a los que se dirijan, lo que permite que se constituyan y reafirmen las identidades de agentes y grupos; y de aquí que podamos construir diferentes tipologías del sentido del humor a partir de estas relaciones: críticas con el poder establecido, del absurdo, etc.


2. Imaginario social y Humor

Bajo este entendimiento de subjetividad y lo que es el magma de significaciones imaginario sociales, veamos su relación con el humor. Etimológicamente “humor” proviene del latín “umus”, que significa líquido, fluido, humedad (Ortega, 1997; Luke, 1987). Sin embargo, el término “humor” a lo largo de la historia, ha tenido, y tiene, una gran variedad de significaciones. Desde Hipócrates se asocia “Humor” con disposiciones anímicas y temperamentos del hombre (Ortega, op. cit). Las primeras aproximaciones a una tipología de la personalidad y comprensión del ser se basaron en la proporcionada distribución de los “humores” en la teoría hipocrática, flemático, sanguíneo, colérico y melancólico. Pero aquí quizás convenga diferenciar entre el humor  y otros conceptos relacionados. Una de las formas más comunes del humor popular es el chiste. Fischer lo define como un &lt;juicio que juega&gt; (Fischer, cit. en Freud, 1976a) que encuentra sentido en las incongruencias. Aquí lo entenderemos como “maneras de ver al mundo, de observar o percibir”. Es en las relaciones e interacciones cotidianas que tienen las personas, como juegos de lenguaje, con contenido de imágenes y emotividad, donde se encuentra lo más interesante del fenómeno humorístico. Por tanto, el humor contempla una complejidad de interconexiones. En palabras de Lyotard (1989): 
“(…) los juegos de lenguaje son (...) el mínimo de relación exigido para que haya sociedad (...). Desde su nacimiento, el ser humano está ya situado con referencia a la historia que cuenta su ambiente, y con respecto a la cual tendrá posteriormente que conducirse”.   
El humor en la colectividad, en las sociedades, ha tenido gran importancia en la historia de los pueblos, como puede constatarse, por ejemplo, en las festividades y carnavales. Un autor que toma con fuerza esta idea es Lipovetski (1998), quién alude a un tipo de humor en la era medieval, en donde la risa y los elementos humorísticos de la colectividad estaban asociados a lo grotesco, lo inferior, el rebajamiento de lo sublime, del poder, de lo sagrado. Incluso en el Renacimiento: 
“La risa siempre está unida a la profanación de los elementos sagrados, a la violación de las reglas oficiales”. 
Sin embargo, cuando se extraen del humor los elementos de mofa, grosería, su base obscena, según el autor, lo humorístico ya no es tan sólo el simbolismo de la degradación de lo sagrado, sino que también comienza a ser algo crítico, agudo, contracultural, rebelde. El humor, así, pierde un tanto su carácter de acción pública,
 “Se metamorfosea en placer subjetivo ante tal o cual hecho cómico aislado” 
Si tuviésemos que realizar una definición aproximada y muy general del humor en base a las referencias que nos ofrece la literatura revisada, de alguna manera nuestro esfuerzo sintético confluiría en algo como esto: en el humor, las concepciones de realidad, de conocimiento, la moral, el “yo”, los “otros”, y por lo tanto la identidad y alteridad del que “comprende” estos sentidos en lo sin sentido, están inextricablemente involucradas.

Quizás haya sido Esopo, como dice Ortega (1997), el que con sus fábulas de gran belleza nos introduzca en esta mezcla de seriedad y de risa. En todas sus historias, se desviste al final una suerte de moraleja, algo que nos enseña cosas de nuestro mundo y de nuestras relaciones. 

“El humor, piensa el griego, descubre el punto convergente de las antinomias y resuelve equilibradamente la aparente contradicción entre lo doloroso y lo grato”.  

Dicho humorismo se adentra y se aventura a considerar el humor entre contrastes: lo trágico y lo cómico, lo doloroso y lo placentero, aparentes fuerzas contrarias que desde él se van desentrañando para comprender al hombre en sí mismo. Por esta razón, según los mismos pensadores griegos, al humor le precede no sólo la reflexión, sino también un profundo entrenamiento del espíritu. Es decir, se relacionaría directamente con una comprensión ética del ser y del mundo, la conducción del espíritu humano con una pedagogía, con ciertos valores. 
El humor sería entonces:

“(…) capaz de alzarse benignamente sobre los defectos humanos, tomar distancia frente a ellos por medio de la risa, para penetrar en una concepción sana y natural del mundo, al par que muestra debilidades y errores”. 

 La sucesión de desconcierto– iluminación, que hace referencia a la pregunta de ¿quiénes somos?, nos da la idea que en el humor se nos revela algo que no siempre es evidente, algo que no es del todo visible, tal y como las estrellas no son visibles en el día, pero no por ello dejan de estar allí. Aquí pues, la conexión del humor impregnado y sustentado en este magma de las significaciones imaginario sociales, que hacen del humor la característica del grupo social que le da vida.  

2.1 La Multiplicidad social y la humorística
Estos juegos de lenguaje del humor, es una práctica que hace operativa la socialización, y da sentido de existencia. Castoriadis (1986) dice: “La sociedad como tal es una forma, cada sociedad dada es una forma particular e incluso singular”.  El humor como expresión social, también tiene formas, formas singulares asociadas a la sociedad donde se produce. El humorista o la persona con sentido del humor, parece tomar elementos del medio que les rodea, para adaptarse/criticar a su entorno, y de allí emergen diversidad de formas de expresión de esa cualidad. Éstas también se han consagrado en nuestras prácticas académicas: la ironía, el sarcasmo, la sátira, la burla, la caricatura también, como negarlo, forman parte de nuestro día a día en el mundo académico. 


 El humor tiene vigencia cultural, singularidades que le hacen asequible a cierto grupo social, definiendo así una forma particular. Un ejemplo claro de ello es el chiste nacionalista o regional, el cual genera un sentido de unidad en el grupo social. ¿Cuantos chistes redimen la nacionalidad propia en despecho de las ajenas y subvierten su precariedad? Este tipo de chistes, al tiempo que generan una cohesión, un sentido de pertenencia, crean valores, normas de conducta, expectativas del deber ser, procuran: adhesión, el apoyo, el consenso, la legitimidad, la creencia. Esta manera de crear unidad, en concordancia con Castoriadis, no es en definitiva a través de la fuerza, sino de la forma sutil, simbólica, creativa, veladamente potente, a la vez que divertida e imaginativa. En este rubro se encuentran  los chistes regionalistas que ponen al descubierto y en evidencia cruda lo que como sociedad hacemos, que para entenderlo hay que vivir en el lugar, su significado se asocia a los códigos del imaginario propios del lugar. Un ejemplo sería el siguiente:
 

En América Latina, por ejemplo, el humor nos sirve para identificarnos como pueblos, a través de la pobreza, la miseria, de la historia de los regímenes políticos llevados por dictadores, de las pseudos-democracias. Justamente, al hablar de comprensión, en el latinoamericano se le atribuye una especie de agilidad para entender situaciones humorísticas de agudeza y profundidad, que no podrían ser entendidas por cualquiera, por ejemplo, los anglosajones, quienes parecen tener un humor basado más en la torpeza, en la burla. El humor “hermana”, quita las fachadas, permite el acercamiento entre las personas.

También es cierto que hay humor general o “globalizado” como lo es por ejemplo las películas de Chaplin, o algunos que circulan por internet. Este tipo de humor también es un reflejo de las formas sociales, como en espejo. Veamos una muestra:

 

Este chiste da cuenta de una práctica dentro de nuestras interrelaciones en un imaginario social globalizado, y descara algunas de sus características. Descubre la neurosis corpórea, ante la idealización de un modelo del cuerpo ajeno e impuesto a través de los medios masivos de comunicación. También, ejemplifica la fluidez post-modernista en tanto a la facilidad de cambiar de personalidad, bajo un medio que permite seleccionar virtualmente cualquier sexo, edad, nacionalidad, estatura, color, etc. Ante esta cachetada de verdades, no queda más que reírnos de nosotros mismos.

Aristóteles buscaba para el desarrollo y crecimiento del hombre cierta moderación, equilibrio, sentido de proporción o “prudencia” (phronesis), entre lo cómico y lo trágico. Compensación: “El humor en la tragedia, y seriedad en la comedia”. Diógenes Laercio: franco opositor de los órdenes convencionales, reconocía su importancia: el humor, la comedia y la tragedia conformaban aspectos esenciales para vivir bien en este mundo.

El humor, piensa el griego, descubre el punto convergente de las antinomias y resuelve equilibradamente la aparente contradicción entre lo doloroso y lo grato. (Ortega, op. Cit, p. 20)

Por esta razón, según los mismos pensadores griegos, al humor le precede no sólo la reflexión, sino también un profundo entrenamiento del espíritu. Es decir, se relacionaría directamente con una comprensión ética del ser y del mundo, la conducción del espíritu humano con una pedagogía, con ciertos valores. El humor sería entonces

 “capaz de alzarse benignamente sobre los defectos humanos, tomar distancia frente a ellos por medio de la risa, para penetrar en una concepción sana y natural del mundo, al par que muestra debilidades y errores”  (Ortega, op. Cit., pp. 21).

De allí surgen algunas consideraciones que hasta hoy parecen profundamente asociadas al sentido del humor: obtención de cierto placer, conciencia de imperfección para reírse de sí mismo, tolerancia y humildad, liberación de las prisiones convencionales y de las visiones parciales que nos ciegan, capacidad para “discriminar y responder a las relaciones de las partes al todo” (Luke, op. Cit.), la confrontación a la moral convencional, y quizás la más compleja de todas, por incluir en cierta medida a las anteriores, la capacidad de comprensión o Verstehen. 

&lt;el humor es en principio un intento por comprender y responder ante determinadas situaciones o experiencias de perplejidad, de asombro, en donde “algo no es cual debería ser”&gt;. Es decir, que en el humor, las concepciones de realidad, de conocimiento, la moral, el “yo”, los “otros”, y por lo tanto la identidad y alteridad del que “comprende” estos sentidos en lo sin sentido
 
Este chiste, evidencia el repudio a los signos de vejez. En este caso, la caída de los senos como proceso natural del paso del tiempo. El empecinamiento por aparentar lo que se ha perdido, lo que no se tiene, el deseo por otro cuerpo, ser otra persona. Esa que es aceptada como lo deseable, el estereotipo vigente. La sonrisa de la anciana, muestra una satisfacción tras encontrar una careta que disfrace la naturaleza de su cuerpo. Lo que importa es lo que aparentamos, lo que ven los demás (o que pretendemos que se ve), aunque sepamos el engaño. Es al tiempo una legitimación de lo que  se quiere, pechos turgentes. Esta es una cachetada obvia del imaginario social, que por ponerla de manifiesto sin tapujos, solo queda reírnos de nosotr@s  mism@s.   

Un contraejemplo, que denuncia un imaginario masculino es el siguiente:

  

Bugdeon argumenta que los cuerpos no sirven simplemente como una fundación natural o superficie pasiva sobre la cual se inscriben sentidos por sistemas de significación sino que existe una irreductibilidad entre el sujeto y el objeto tal que, en orden para comprender las vías en las cuales los hombres y mujeres viven activamente sus identidades encarnadas, es necesario desarrollar un enfoque en el que se pueda visionar un cuerpo más allá de la dicotomía de materialidad y representación, es decir, el cuerpo visto no como un objeto, sino como un evento. 

Según la teoría de estructuración del cuerpo de Giddens, es de central importancia la relación entre la agencialidad y las estructuras sociales ya que el control regularizado y el monitoreo reflexivo del cuerpo por el agente cognoscente es una condición necesaria para la acción. En la modernidad tardía, dicho autor sugiere que la reflexividad se ha acelerado de manera tal que el cuerpo, una vez dado como aspecto de la naturaleza, se convierte en un proyecto abierto a la intervención humana, y como la naturaleza, es colonizado y sujeto a constante revisión. El oscurecimiento de la frontera entre lo que es dado y lo que está abierto a elección nos diría que el sí mismo puede ser liberado de la determinación corporal. 

A través del desarrollo de técnicas y tecnologías tales como la ingeniería genética, tecnologías reproductivas, cirugía plástica, la dieta y regímenes para la salud, los cuerpos no sólo se convierten en objetos para el manejo y la reconfiguración, sino que cada vez más son centrales en la construcción de la identidad propia. Existe la idea de un supuesto “libre albedrío”, o libertad de elección, según la cual los individuos son responsables de cultivar y reestructurar activamente lo corporal, eligiendo a través de diversidad de rangos de elecciones entre múltiples alternativas. En la post-modernidad, las experiencias del sí mismo y el cuerpo están mediadas por una constante proyección amplificada por los medios de comunicación, de una proliferación de imágenes y opciones, que uno debe incorporar a su propio proyecto. 

Siguiendo con la teoría de Guiddens, Bugdeon (2003) plantea que la relación entre el cuerpo y sí mismo está abierta a tres aspectos críticos fundamentales:
1)	Las conceptualizaciones sobre mente y cuerpo se establecen principalmente como dicotómicas.
2)	En este proceso se privilegia especialmente la mente sobre el cuerpo.
3)	Se produce una especie de ceguera sobre la naturaleza del género en esta dicotomía. 
Esto nos sugiere que en el mundo occidental, la reflexividad tiene un lugar preponderante como modo de relación y compromiso con el mundo. En este compromiso, el cuerpo se convierte en un material a través del cual la mente actúa, colocándolo fuera del actor. Es decir, los actores son principalmente agentes pensantes y que eligen entre múltiples alternativas, y no seres que sienten y habitan como seres-del-mundo. Existe entonces una énfasis exagerado en la reflexividad donde la mente toma al cuerpo, y ese privilegio nos provee una mirada en donde los actores sociales quedan “descorporeizados”, el individuo es un sí mismo reflexivo y no encarnado; es una conciencia desencarnada. Esta imagen probablemente haya sido en gran medida influida por la criatura cartesiana.

2.2 El origen magmático y su relación con el humor

En relación a la raíz u origen del magma y de su unidad, Castoriadis (1986), dice que  “ningún sujeto o individuo (o grupos de sujetos e individuos) podría nunca ser este origen”. Esta borrosidad del origen también es característica del humor. El “Humor”, como ya hemos señalado, es fluido, su sino escapa, se escurre de las dimensiones factuales de los significados, de los signos, de la rigurosidad lógica. El fenómeno humorístico parece estar constituido por nubes de Humo, suerte de estructuras disipativas (o ausentes), humedad vaporizada, que hace sumamente difícil la tarea de convertir al humor en objeto de estudio o de encontrar su origen, su creador primero ¿Quién creo el último chiste que escuchamos? es difícil señalarlo, y finalmente pierde sentido en la práctica cotidiana. Lo que nos lleva a concluir que el humor tanto producto del imaginario social, no podemos encontrarle un origen único e indiscutible. 
Por otro lado, el autor señala “Somos fragmentos de la institución de la sociedad, partes totales” el chiste, como producción humana, también funciona como un fragmento que es parte de la imagen total, pero que a su vez, de alguna manera la sintetiza, la reproduce, en forma de holograma. 

Esta creación humana (el humor) tiene a su vez un doble vínculo. Es una creación  al tiempo que crea, engendra. Crea, recrea o legitima creencias, formas de ser, valores, estereotipos.  Es decir, el humor es producto de un imaginario colectivo que recrea imaginarios colectivos. 
 

Este es un ejemplo de los atributos esperados/acusados para hombre/mujer, que expresan/acusan las creencias, valores, lo que debe ser o se espera socialmente de cada género. 
El problema de la realidad en el humor se traduce en poder ver las cosas desde otras perspectivas, que eso que denominamos no es unidimensional sino que ofrece diversas caras. 
De allí surgen algunas consideraciones que hasta hoy parecen profundamente asociadas al sentido del humor: obtención de cierto placer, conciencia de imperfección para reírse de sí mismo, tolerancia y humildad, liberación de las prisiones convencionales y de las visiones parciales que nos ciegan, capacidad para  “(…) discriminar y responder a las relaciones de las partes al todo” a la a confrontación a la moral convencional, y quizás la más compleja de todas, por incluir en cierta medida a las anteriores o a la capacidad de comprensión o Verstehen.


Castoriadis (1986) afirma que si se analiza cómo funcionan, en una sociedad, “el magma de significaciones imaginario sociales y sus correspondientes instituciones, se puede ver que, en un aspecto, hay una similitud entre la organización social y la biológica: en el ‘cierre’ […]. Tanto la organización social como la biológica muestran un ‘cierre’ organizativo, informativo y cognoscitivo. Cada sociedad, al igual que cada ser o especie viviente, establece (crea) su propio mundo, dentro del cual, desde luego, se incluye a sí misma.[…] La institución de la sociedad es la que determina lo que es real y lo que no lo es, qué tiene sentido y qué no lo tiene”. La producción de los chistes es reflejo de esta idea. Es la sociedad, (los individuos) la que define qué tiene sentido y qué no lo tiene. La difusión de cada chiste esta en función de su vigencia, de su significado, o a falta de él, sucumbe. La vida de cada chiste esta en función del sentido, del reflejo que tiene de “la realidad” o su significante. Así, basta que exista un evento social para que surjan nuevas creaciones humorísticas como por ejemplo: Irak, San Juanico en México, elecciones políticas, etc. contra chistes que dejan de circular, porque pierden vigencia. El humor, como producto social es una “construcción, una constitución, una creación del mundo, de su propio mundo. Su identidad no es sino este sistema de interpretación, este mundo que ella crea” (Castoriadis 1986). 

2.3 La Autonomía en el  humor

Castoriadis (1986) compara el sí mismo de la sociedad con lo que Varela ha llamado la “autonomía” del ser viviente.  Nosotros nos permitimos relacionar el sí mismo social, con el humor. Los cuales comparten las siguientes características:
a)	La fijación de sus caracteres no poseen una base física, como el genoma, que pudiera garantizarles,  incluso probabilísticamente su conservación a través del tiempo y su transmisión. Su vigencia, difusión y permanencia, corresponden a otro tipo de factores, difusos y al parecer volubles.
b)	“Propiamente hablando, para la sociedad no existe el ruido. Cualquier cosa que aparezca, cualquier cosa que suceda en una sociedad, debe querer decir algo para ella; o, abiertamente, se le declarará sin sentido”. Así los chistes, tienen o no sentido, y cuando alguien cuenta alguno y no nos causa gracia buscamos el sentido de su gracia. Tendemos a escarbar el significado, nos empeñamos para hacerlo inteligible, o terminamos por desecharlo.
c)	La fabricación y elaboración de información se da como algo virtualmente ilimitado y  va más allá de cualquier caracterización funcional. 
d)	Su principio de conservación está en “la conservación de los atributos arbitrarios característicos de cada sociedad  sus significaciones imaginario sociales” (Castoriadis, 1998). 
e)	Las operaciones lógicas/físicas a través de las cuales se relacionan, organiza y utiliza, están siempre bajo la influencia de las significaciones imaginario sociales, las cuales son arbitrarias y diferentes entre sí, como si pertenecieran a sociedades distintas 
f)	“La sociedad, sin correlativos físicos, crea Ser en una forma masiva e indiscriminada: espíritus, dioses, pecados, virtudes, derechos del hombre, etc. y para ella este tipo de Ser tiene siempre un orden más alto que el físico puro” Castoriadis (1986). El humor, como hemos dicho, esta en el orden de lo imaginario, de lo masivo, de la creación, en un ámbito que va más allá de lo físico, que es incluido en algunos referentes pero no se circunscribe a él.
En las fábulas, los refranes (y en general, en todo el sentido del humor). El alto contenido de fondo moral que éstos ostentan, acerca de los valores, hábitos, costumbres, respetos, la cotidianidad que se manifiestan en sus moralejas, que son relatadas de una forma liviana “Una fábula seria no le gusta a nadie”. Sus contenidos son dichos en una forma que no es represiva, obligante, ni fastidiosa, se descubre una enseñanza, y la perciben en general como una buena manera de aprender. El humor, como referíamos antes, sin hacerlo de una forma explícita, evidente, abre un poco su espectro e indica ciertos parámetros, ciertos caminos, de una manera casi sublime. En una moraleja hay pues un mensaje de fondo que tiene como propósito guiar a la gente, a través de una crítica que, si bien puede ser muy hiriente en el caso de las ironías o del “humor negro”, en general es “manejable”, a través de una crítica con refranes, a través de una crítica con humor. Las personas que los usan están indicando un camino que se puede observar, y que no es tan severa la crítica a cuando se hace de forma directa. La obra humorística entonces da cuenta de un valor moral. Sin embargo, en el humorista, no se habla de que existan valores distintos, ni costumbres y creencias que los aparten mucho del resto de los mortales. Se dice que existe cierta tendencia a ser gente de oposición, de “izquierda”, o de una “moral liberal” lo cual tiene mucha relación con el papel del humor como opositor al “sistema”.Lo cual de cuenta de una alta relación de moralidad que existe en el humorista. Entonces, como tendencia, si podemos ver esa conexión del humorista con una realidad que no pretende cambiar permanentemente, pero que la denuncia de una manera muy particular, y logra con ello elevarnos para observarla en perspectiva y bromear con sus significados.
De aquí se deriva el nexo del humor que se desprende del magma de representaciones  imaginario sociales. 

Para Castoriadis (1986), la sociedad no existe sin el mito y para la sociedad, “el mito es esencialmente una forma de revestir de sentido al mundo y a la vida que está dentro del mundo; porque, de otra manera, ambos carecerían de sentido”. El humor podríamos verlo, bajo esta perspectiva, como una derivación del mito, porque también es una forma de revestir el mundo y a la vida que contiene, en este sentido holográmico ya mencionado. Es decir, el humor como una condensación de una realidad humana de significación, que aunque no necesariamente es universal como en el mito, si es común al grupo social. 

2.4 Las Dimensiones conjuntista-identitaria e imaginaria en el humor

Castoriadis (1986) afirma que la institución de la sociedad, y las significaciones imaginario sociales que tienen que ver con ella, se despliegan siempre en dos dimensiones que no pueden dejar de asociarse. La dimensión conjuntista-identitaria, grupo teórico-lógico, y la estricta y propiamente imaginaria. 
“En la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria la sociedad funciona, actúa y piensa a través de/en elementos, clases, propiedades y relaciones establecidas como distintas y definitivas. En esto, el esquema más importante es el de la determinación. Entonces, lo que se necesita es que todo lo que sea concebible se vea a través de la determinación, y las consecuencias o implicaciones de esto también. Desde este punto de vista, la existencia es la calidad de lo determinado.En la propia dimensión imaginaria, la existencia es significación. Pero, aunque no puedan ser señaladas, las significaciones no están determinadas. Se relacionan entre sí a través de una forma básica de reenvío, representación, el cual implica también una cuasi equivalencia y una cuasi pertenencia. Funciona la mayor parte de las veces a través de un quid pro quo, x en vez de y, que, en casos no triviales, es arbitrario, es decir, instituido. Este quid pro quo es el meollo de lo que el autor llamó ‘relación signitiva’; es decir, de la relación entre el signo y aquello de lo cual es signo el signo, y que es la base del lenguaje. No existe una razón necesaria o suficiente para que ‘perro’ esté en lugar de ‘canis’ o para que ‘siete’ tenga algo que ver con ‘Dios’. Pero la relación quid pro quo va más allá del propio lenguaje.” 
En éste la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria corresponde a lo que Castoriadis llama ‘código’. Lo propio de la dimensión imaginaria se manifiesta a sí misma a través de lo que él llamó lengua (langue). Así, en determinado contexto, pertenecen al código frases como: “Dame el martillo”. En cambio, pertenecen a la lengua oraciones como: “Senté a la belleza en mis rodillas y la sentí amarga y la injurié”. La diferencia entre código y lengua, más generalmente, entre la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria y la propia dimensión de lo imaginario, no es, desde luego, una diferencia de esencia, sino de uso y manejo. Las dos dimensiones son, para usar una metáfora topológica, impenetrables; en el lenguaje y en la vida social. Esto quiere decir que, arbitrariamente, cerca de cualquier punto del lenguaje hay un elemento que pertenece a la dimensión conjuntista-identitaria y también hay un elemento que pertenece a la dimensión de lo imaginario. El humor es un reflejo creativo de esta bidimensionalidad, en él lo interesante y el objetivo es evidenciar en y a través del código, el imaginario. Cada juego de palabras quiere exponer, en el humor, a manera de reflejo impúdico lo que a su grupo concierne. Así, sin tapujos se desvela lo obsceno de lo político, de las creencias, de la subjetividad, de las costumbres, de las miserias, la idiosincrasia, de lo obvio, de las catástrofes y de la muerte misma. En suma, de lo que es propiamente la red de representaciones imaginario sociales (magma). 

2.5 Carácter social-histórico del humor

Así, en una sociedad, las significaciones de lo imaginario social presentan un tipo de organización desconocida, hasta la fecha, en otros campos. A este tipo de organización Castoriadis (1998) lo llamó magma. El magma contiene grupos—incluso un número indefinido de ellos--, pero no es reducible a grupos o sistemas de grupos, aunque éstos sean ricos y complejos. Incluso no puede volverse a constituir analíticamente, es decir, por medio de las categorías y operaciones de los grupos teóricos. El orden social y la organización no son reducibles a las acostumbradas nociones matemáticas, físicas e incluso biológicas de orden y organización, al menos como han sido concebidos hasta ahora. 
Declara el mismo autor, que lo social histórico crea un nuevo tipo ontológico de orden, unidad, coherencia y diferenciación organizada. No se crea de una vez y por todas, un nuevo tipo de orden ontológico, característico del género sociedad. Sino que, en cualquier momento, este tipo de orden se materializa a través de diversas formas, cada una de las cuales encarna en una creación, en un nuevo eidos de la sociedad. El humor tampoco es estático, sino que evoluciona, muta se transforma, se recrea. Un ejemplo de ello son la adaptación de los chistes sexistas como el que sigue: 

Versión 1: José que tu mujer te pone los cuernos// Pero compadre, que vergüenza, pobre hombre que fiasco se ha de haber dado.

Versión 2: María siéntate, tengo que darte una noticia terrible… Tu marido te engaña// María contesta “No me digas eso,  pobre chica la aburrida que se llevará”

o como los estos:
¿Por qué se necesita un millón de espermatozoides para fertilizar un óvulo?
Porque no les gusta preguntar direcciones. 

¿Qué haces si una mujer te arroja un seguro de granada?
¡Corre, seguramente tiene la granada en la boca!  


El humor sexista con un discurso de hegemonía masculina, deriva tras el feminismo en un sexismo contrapuesto, igual de hegemónico, en un movimiento de contraataque. Evidenciando esta capacidad adaptativa en el humor, reflejo de los contextos socio-históricos. 
 
“El humor no sólo tiene algo de liberador, como el chiste y lo cómico, sino también algo de grandioso y de patético, rasgos estos que no se encuentran en las dos clases de ganancia de placer derivada de una actividad intelectual (...) lo grandioso reside en el triunfo del narcisismo, en la inatacabilidad del yo triunfante aseverada. El yo rehusa sentir las afrentas que le ocasiona la realidad; rehusa dejarse constreñir al sufrimiento...” 

Es decir, que el humor asume el encargo de guiar al “yo” que sufre, en los embates de una realidad que podría parecer aplastante. El humor no es conformista, no es “resignado”, se opone a las circunstancias reales, es capaz de afirmarse ante lo desfavorable y además de obtener placer por ello. A diferencia de la comicidad, el humor no es sólo alivio, no sólo libera lo reprimido. Hace elevar al humorista desde una visión en perspectiva. Es como distanciarse y decir “Véanlo: ese es el mundo que parece tan peligroso. Un juego de niños, bueno nada más que para bromear sobre él” (Freud, 1976b). El “super yo” sería la instancia psíquica que para éste autor consolaría al yo y lo pondría a salvo del sufrimiento: 

“(…) la esencia del humor consiste en ahorrarse los afectos a que habría dado ocasión la situación y en saltarse mediante una broma la posibilidad de tales exteriorizaciones de sentimiento.” 

Entonces sería comprensible el por qué el humor tiene un toque de genialidad que supera las antinomias, que afronta las desigualdades de una manera singular.

Siguiendo de nuevo a Castoriadis, quien dice: “En resumidads cuentas: lo viejo entra en lo nuevo con la significación que éste le da a aquel, y no podría ser de otra manera, […] lo que estaba en lo viejo está, de una manera o de otra, preparando lo nuevo o relacionándose con él”. En relación a esto, el mismo autor refiere que “basta recordar como, desde hace siglos, las ideas o los elementos griegos o cristianos han sido continuamente redescubiertos y remodelados, reinterpretados, en el mundo occidental para conformar lo que equivocadamente se llama las necesidades y que, en realidad, es el esquema imaginario del presente. Esta sociedad se cuestiona su propia institución, su representación del mundo, su representación imaginaria social”. Esto origina una transformación y renovación que hace posible, en el mismo lugar, encontrar sociedades con imaginarios diferenciados a la luz del tiempo. 
El humor se rebela contra ciertas cosas establecidas, situaciones “duras”, y también contra el estatus, contra normas o poderes constituidos que oprimen. De allí, la interesante relación que se establece entre el sistema y el humor, que tiene que ver directamente con el problema de la realidad “...lo rígido, lo fuerte de un tema algunas veces lo rompe el sentido del humor, te permite abordar las cosas con una dinámica más suave, se rompe una estructura de seriedad, de un patrón que a mi me parece además pesado”. O bien ésta otra frase más explícita: “el sentido del humor ha servido a través de toda la historia como una forma de proyectarse contra el sistema y de poderle sacar la lengua”.
Entonces, el humor no consiste simplemente en hacer más “digerible” la realidad, como sí lo hace la comicidad. El sentido del humor sería una forma de comprender la realidad, de abordarla. El poder jugar con los significados y transformarlos, descubrir o construir significados que permitan contra-atacar una realidad que parecía irreversible, otorga una “fuerza” que permite levantarse de la situación “aplastante”. El humor luce entonces incontestable. Lo curioso es que en el humor, se colocan en el tapete cosas que por obvias, por evidentes, por naturalizadas, o quizás por el miedo que producen, no se nombran, no se cuestionan, o no se observan. Uno de los entrevistados, se refirió al humor como “El arte de decir la verdad sin darle chance de defenderse a la mentira”.

Castoriadis (1998) explica que “aparte de la existencia de instituciones que se dan en todas las partes de la sociedad, y significaciones imaginario sociales que se dan en cualquier parte de la sociedad, y de algunas cosas sin importancia, no hay nada esencial que sea común, digamos, entre una moderna sociedad capitalista y una sociedad primitiva. Y, si lo que dije anteriormente se sostiene, no existe, y no puede existir, ninguna ley o proceso determinante por el cual una determinada forma de sociedad podría producir otra, o al menos ser la causa de que apareciera. Los intentos de hacer derivar las formas sociales de las condiciones físicas, de los antecedentes o de las características permanentes del hombre, son peores que fracasos: carecen de sentido. En esto, la ontología y la lógica heredadas no tienen esperanza: están obligadas a Ignorar el propio ser de lo social histórico. Pero ‘creación’ no sólo es una mala palabra para la ontología y la lógica. También es inevitable llegar a preguntar: ¿creación por parte de quién? Pero la creación, al igual que el trabajo de lo socialimaginario, de la sociedad instituyente (societas instituans, no sociedad instituta), es el modo de ser del campo de lo social histórico, a través de los medios del cual este campo es, La sociedad es autocreación, desplegada como la historia. Para aceptar y dejar de hacer preguntas sin sentido sobre sujetos y sustancias, o sobre causas, se necesita, para estar seguro, una radical conversión ontológica […]  Las nuevas formas socio-históricas, surgen de la creación. Directa o indirectamente hemos sido testigos del surgimiento de las nuevas formas social históricas: por ejemplo, la creación de la polis democrática en la antigua Grecia; o, más de cerca, del capitalismo occidental. En cada uno de estos casos hay muchas cosas significativas por decir y un trabajo interminable por realizar, acerca de las condiciones que preceden y rodean ese surgimiento. Se puede elucidar esos procesos; pero no explicarlos. Su explicación vincularía tanto los significados a los no-significados, lo cual no tiene sentido; como la reducción de todos los magmas de significaciones que aparecen en la historia a varias combinaciones de nuevos elementos de significación que han estado presentes desde el comienzo de la historia humana—lo cual es, obviamente, imposible (y otra vez nos llevaría a hacer la pregunta; ¿cómo surgieron estos elementos primarios?”. 

Para tomar un ejemplo concreto y explicativo: consideremos el surgimiento del humor, no se observa una producción al azar de un gran número de variedades sociales, ni la eliminación de todas, menos una, por inadecuadas, ni la elección de un tipo de humor por ser la única forma social adecuada que vale la pena. Lo que se observa es el surgimiento de una nueva significación social imaginaria: la ilimitada expansión del dominio de lo racional de estos factores al producir una forma, el chiste contado de boca en boca, la cual no fue planeado por un actor que pueda ser señalado o un grupo de actores y la cual, ciertamente, no podría ser construida a través de una imprevista asamblea de elementos preexistentes. Estos elementos y estos factores entran en el humorismo de una sociedad sólo si, y cuando, pueden ser utilizados por ella o cuando llegan a convertirse en su instrumento, por decirlo de alguna manera, hacia la esfera humorística de significaciones y por lo tanto les sea otorgado un nuevo sentido. 

Muñiz (1994)   en su descripción teórica, nos dice que el humor desde la biología revela enigmas: no tiene un sentido específico, y no pareciera tener un alto valor utilitario. La risa que provoca es un reflejo que no tiene “propósito” biológico, más que el de aliviar o relajar tensiones. Tampoco pareciera contribuir a nuestra supervivencia, aunque el valor social del humor puede tener influencia diferencial sobre las personas y sus ocupaciones. Pero también agrega que el humor es una actividad creativa de alto nivel de complejidad y abstracción. 

El humor se trata en el fondo de imágenes y de experiencias significativas expresadas en símbolos de un texto que  pueden ser palabras, imágenes, dibujos, gesticulaciones u otra forma de expresión. Lo humorístico, denota una propiedad compleja: no es un asunto de estructuras sino de interacciones de significado entre personas que provienen de comunidades, que poseen una historia, que atribuyen sentidos a su realidad (Maffesoli, op. cit), que imaginan, actúan, proyectan deseos a lo que consideran debe ser la misma, personas que van configurando relaciones entre lo originado y lo originante que ellas mismas originan, o al menos tratan de originar.





3. Conclusiones.

El humor es una reflexión, se basa en buscar sentidos y dejar la mente libre que fluya y que juegue con los conceptos que pueden pasar como inapercibidos por ser ya internalizados a nivel inconciente. De tal manera, el humor saca al nivel conciente las practicas sociales que internalizamos sin tener una razón, sino porque pertenecemos a una delimitación espacio temporal que nos impide que nos conformemos con las reglas y normas sociales sin cuestionarlos.
Viéndolo desde esta perspectiva, el humor es una practica social, basada en una narrativa subjetiva que desborda los limites lógicos y/o impuestos como norma social, con el papel de defensa, socialización, buscar sentidos para las cosas y para la existencia. 
 El análisis teórico y la etnografía que hicimos sobre la intertextualidad entre imaginario social y sentido del humor (como artefacto social) subraya la relación entre yo y otros como una relación  dinámica, dependiente del espacio geográfico y la delimitaciones histórico-socio-culturales. 
En la presentación se menciono la relación entre la inteligencia y el humor. También el hecho de que en tu propia lengua en más fácil hacer chistes con cómico de lenguaje y que tengan sentido por los demás. Con esto quiero subrayar el hecho de que en humor, bajo cualquier forma (cómico de situación, de personaje, lenguaje, etc.) juega con los símbolos y conceptos socialmente construidos. 
Desde este punto de vista podemos ver al humorista como “etnógrafo” o “artesano” en construir y resignificar la realidad. El es flexible a la dinámica social, se adapta y por moldear la materia como a un artesano le salen distintas formas de expresarse. La relación de comunicación con los demás se basa en mostrar distintas formas de ver las cosas. Es decir de un punto común, un concepto se esta construyendo una narrativa subjetiva, pero esta tiene sentido en un determinada delimitación espacio-temporal. 
¿Porque aparece esta delimitación? Los ejemplos que me vienen en la mente son: maneras de percibir el concepto de belleza, de la familia, etc. en imaginarios sociales distintos. Estamos viendo las mismas cosas y podemos entenderlo de manera distinta según el bagaje de informaciones que tenemos. Esto puede pasar aun en la misma cultura, pero cuando hay también otras maneras de codificar y decodificar las practicas sociales y sus artefactos el problema es mas  complejo. 
Hablamos de códigos de los imaginarios propios o de los propios imaginarios o de otros. Es suficiente ver el la codificaciones que hay en el lenguaje utilizando las gafas de un lingüista o antropólogo o psicólogo, ya aparecen una perspectivas bastante interesantes que sabemos pero nunca nos ocurrió pensarlo de esa manera.
Vuelvo a la relación entre inteligencia y humor porque es importante subrayar –según lo hicimos antes en el trabajo- que el segundo necesita un nivel alto de complejidad y abstracción. Mencione esto porque el humor es un juego que maneja con los significados, símbolos y la lógica. Es en juego de significar y resignificar según la lógica del codificación-decodificación del lenguaje (mira grafico).
 Por ejemplo, en un comercial que dan ahora en la televisión se dice: “una lección divertida nunca se olvida, dicen los psicólogos, pedagogos y padres”. Si, estamos de acuerdo, pero ojo a la codificación-recodificación (sobre todo si lo usas en otro imaginario), porque pueden aparecer diferencias causadas por distintos variables: lenguaje, entorno social, educación, histórico-socio-cultural, económico, etc.  

Vuelvo a la importancia social del humor como artefacto social, porque este es un tipo que tiene una dinámica histórica bastante interesante: no base física, se basa en la disipación social, no tiene origen y tampoco se le impide. Cuando escuchamos una broma no pensamos: ¿Quien lo hizo? ¿Cuando? ¿Donde? No, solo reímos y (sub)entendemos el idea. Pero también es importante subrayar que la difusión y permanencia son tan subjetivas como el objeto en si y que depende de factores bastante volubles.
El humor como las maneras de ver el mundo, de observarlo o percibirlo se encuentra precisamente en las interacciones cotidianas como por ejemplo en los juegos de palabras, las alusiones a determinados acontecimientos conocidos por todos o en metáforas de la vida cotidiana…
Las prácticas que desarrolle cada sujeto están en función del interés o ilusión por participar en este campo manteniendo, cambiando o intentando cambiar su posición dentro de él. 
No obstante, para que estas prácticas se instituyan como estrategias Bourdieu apela al habitus, que es lo que genera prácticas individuales dando a la conducta esquemas de percepción, pensamiento y acción y es lo que nos permitirá conectar lo individual con lo social. 
Normalmente el agente expresa su habitus de clase o grupo a través de un determinado habitus lingüístico: interés por decir determinadas cosas y una determinada manera y capacidad para hablar en un determinado contexto.  Es decir, si los aplicamos al humor nos podemos encontrar con situaciones en las que un parlante estándar para llamar la atención, producir buenas comunicación, buen entendimiento, y por qué no incluso respeto en determinados momentos, cambia su registro y se identifica con el receptor para gastarle una broma, utilizando una jerga graciosa, etc.
Por tanto, el habitus nos permite entender como una determinada comunicación entre diferentes sujetos está determinada por la internalización de la posición que ocupa en la estructura social. 
De esta manera vemos como se configuran mercados lingüísticos con discursos estilísticamente caracterizados (Bourdieu, 85) [2], lo que condiciona racionalmente, según los propósitos individuales, cómo elegimos dirigirnos a terceros.
Después del proceso de codificación y decodificación de los conceptos estamos de acuerdo con la teoría de Castoriadis según la cual el humor es un proceso dinámico de resignificación que es flexible al entorno social.
Como conclusión y para motivar la elección del sentido del humor quiero mencionar que el concepto elegido es producto de un imaginario social colectivo que crea un imaginario colectivo. De tal manera como hay la destilación de las practicas y normas sociales, que se construyen y tienen sentido en una cierta delimitación espacio-temporal.

You are correct. That was a typo. I've corrected it now. Thanks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Digital Signal Processing|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:47, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Life Classification'''

=='''Concept'''==
Lifeforms ('''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/O|organisms]]''') are '''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/C|classified]]''' into groups to create a '''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/H|hierarchy]]''' of life.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=60%&gt;The hierarchy of life has many divisions in it.  The basic divisions are as follows:
*Domain
**Kingdom
***Phylum
****Class
*****Order
******Family
*******Genus
********Species

==Examples==

==='''The Five Kingdoms'''===

All life can be classified under one of five kingdoms.

*Kingdom: [[Middle School Science/Biology/Bacteria|Bacteria]]
*Kingdom: Protista ([[Middle School Science/Biology/Protists|Protists]])
*Kingdom: [[Middle School Science/Biology/Fungi|Fungi]]
*Kingdom: Plantae ([[Middle School Science/Biology/Plants|Plants]])
*Kingdom: Animalia ([[Middle School Science/Biology/Animals|Animals]])

===Classification of Humans===
Humans are living things and therefore can be classified into this hierarchy.

''''''Human Classification''':'''
*'''Kingdom:''' Animilia (animals)
**'''Phylum:''' Chordata (animals with a vertebrate)
***'''Class:''' Mammalia (mammals)
****'''Order:''' Primates
*****'''Family:''' Hominidae (human-like)
******'''Genus:''' Homo
*******'''Species:''' sapiens

Scientifically, the human species is identified as ''Homo sapiens''.

==Expository Text==
Think of all the different animals that you can.  Make a list of all the ones that you know about--cats, dogs, elephants, giraffes, lions, tigers, bears, bugs.  Now add to the list all of the plants that you can think of--pine trees, palm trees, carrots, apples trees, lettuce, cactus, grass.  Combining these will create a long list of things is hard to look at and even harder to study from.  There are more than 1.5 million species of '''[[Middle School Science/Glossary/O|organisms]]''' that have been identified by scientists.  In order to study all of these organisms, scientists have put them into different categories, in other words, they ''classify'' them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wort Boiling==

===With Malt Extract===
Heat the wort to boiling uncovered, adding any brewing salts (gypsum, et al.) at this point.  Remove from the heat source and add 1 or 2 cups of malt extract, stir until completely dissolved and return the wort to a boil.  The boil does not need to be too aggressive.  The [[hot break]] usually occurs during the first 5 to 15 minutes of the boil.

After 10 minutes, make the first (&quot;bittering&quot; or &quot;boiling&quot;) hop addition.  Begin timing your hour boil at this time.  Continue to add hops at the intervals specified in your recipe.  Be sure to remove your hops from the refrigerator several hours before brewing so that they may come up to room temperature before adding to the kettle.

Boil for 45 minutes and add 1/2 teaspoon of Irish moss.  If using a immersion wort chiller, place the unit in the kettle now to allow 15 minutes of boiling for sterilization.

Continue to boil for 15 minutes.

Once again remove the kettle from the heat source, and add the remaining extract and adjunct sugars (if any) to the wort and stir to dissolve thoroughly and completely.  The temperature should drop to about 170°F.

Allow the hot wort to remain at this temperature for about 10 minutes to sanitize the extract and sugars.

Cool the wort by any or all of the following methods:
* Begin the flow of cold water through an [[Brewing/Boiling/Immersion Chiller|immersion chiller]]
* Add ice which was previously made by filling sterilized 1- or 2-litre PET (soda) bottles with water that had been boiled, allowed to freeze, and the plastic bottle cut off
* Place the brew kettle in a sink filled with ice water.

Siphon the wort into your fermenter, leaving the hot break, cold break, hops and other sediment in the kettle.  Top up to the volume desired for fermentation.  Aerate the wort well for 5 minutes.

Pitch the yeast when the temperature of the wort has dropped below 80°F (ideally around 76°F).

If dry hopping, wet the hops with a small amount of hot water (in effect making a quarter cup of &quot;hop tea&quot;) before adding them to the cold fermenter.  This will allow the aromatic oils to more easily dissolve out of the hops.

===Hop Additions===
Hops are added into the wort during the boil to extract the bitterness from the hops. 

'''Bittering hops'''
Adding the hops at the start of the boil maximises the amount of bitterness extracted from the hops. The hops added at the start of boil contribute mainly to the bitterness of the beer, however the aromatic compounds are very soon boiled off and so these hops do not contribute much to the hop aroma of the beer.

'''Aroma hops'''
The hops added towards the end of the boil retain more of the volatile aromatic compounds and this results in a beer with more hop aroma. But because of the short time the hops are boiled - not much bitterness is extracted.


===Adjunct additions===
During wort boiling sugar or syrup adjuncts may be added. The adjunct needs to be added so that enough time is given for the adjunct to be dissolved and sterilised.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Diagnostic skills are not taught in automotive schools or books as much as in the past, for several reasons.  First, it is often more efficient for a mechanic to remove and replace a part than to try to repair that part.  Second, the parts themselves are not made to be repaired as much as in the past.  Granted, the time it would take to repair a transmission may be far more than it would be to replace the transmission, so it may be a more efficient system overall.  However, the modern way does have its disadvantages--one of them being less ability to diagnose.  In one case, a customer was nearly charged $3000 to replace the transmission in a pickup truck when the problem was a bad spark plug (the plug was not firing properly so the engine computer would downshift looking for more power and would then be told to upshift again because the RPMs were too high).  Knowing how to really track down the problem can save you a lot of money.

There are several approaches to diagnosing a problem:
1) using a repair manual
2) relying on your own analysis
3) using the experiences of others with the same problem.
I suggest grabbing a repair manual until you know more.  As you repair with the guidance of a manual, you will develop an 'intuition' that will guide you to problems.  This process won't happen on its own, however--you have to be hungry for it.

The first step in any diagnosis is to gather information.  Use your senses and ask questions: when does the car make that noise?  What does it sound like?  How does it feel?  Where is the sound coming from?  Does it happen at all speeds?  Does the car do anything at all?

The second step in diagnosis is to grab a manual armed with that information and look for the troubleshooting charts.  I believe that factory manuals have great information, but are not as novice-friendly as the manuals from the auto parts stores.  For my own vehicles, I try to get the factory manual (for the most authoritative information) as well as the Haynes (or similar) manual.  If you only get one, maybe just the Haynes.

Please note that advanced mechanics will often not need this step, as the problems will be obvious to them.  After doing enough repairs, the different systems fit together and do not seem foreign, separate, confusing, or threatening.

&lt;H1&gt;Holden / Opel / Vauxhall Astra &lt;/H1&gt;

Symtoms diagnostics and repairs for common faults of the Astra Mk3 C14NZ engine. Refer to a Haynes Manual for details concerning the actual repair.

{{subject|Automobile_Repair/Diagnostics}}==Astra Engine temperature erratic usually low==
This is usually caused by the thermostat stuck open. Either luckily or by design thermostats usually fail safe - open.  On a C14NZ the thermostat is behind the camshaft belt casing and requires the camshaft belt and pulleys to be removed so it cannot be easily tested. New thermostats are remarkably cheap from generic parts supplier, and can be fitted in the upper radiator hose as an alternative to their proper placement. Haynes does not describe this procedure. Remember to fit the thermostat the correct way around,, that is with the longer piece facing the engine.

==Astra Engine temperature high, electric fan not running==
First check the fuse. Fuse # 11. 
Second test the Cooling fan thermostatic switch. Removing this will let all the coolant out, observe safety precautions described in the Haynes manual - cool engine and catch coolant. The switch often fails open circuit, use a continuity tester to check if switch closes when heated in a pan of water just before boiling point.

Thirdly check that 12Volts is being supplied to the fan motor, if not, broken wires can be the cause. Lastly prepare to replace the fan assembly, remove it and check it before buying a new one.

==Astra Engine misfires at low revs==
Symptoms such as misfires and stalls until engine is running at &gt; 3000 RPM and even then runs rough. 
Firstly check the spark plugs for excessively large gaps, eroded electrode or dirt. Replace if necessary.
Otherwise on the C14NZ engine this is often caused by oil in the distributor cap. The distributor is mounted horizontally on the end of the camshaft and the oil seal allows small amounts of oil into the distributor that then causes short circuits.
This can be cured during the early stages by wiping the inside of the distributor cap with a clean rag. Later stages of deterioration burn carbon tracks in the cap and these can be cleaned off, but a new cap is required. If a lot of oil leaks into the distributor the whole unit has to be replaced, it is not possible to buy component parts of the distributor.

==Astra Engine falters or stalls==
The C14NZ engine may run for long periods and then it falters and perhaps stalls.  In many cases it will restart and run normally for a while. This fault is infuriating if the period between failures is weeks since you can never be sure that the problem is fixed and it can be caused by numerous faults.
First check the failure mode, if the rev counter drops to zero before the engine stops it is most likely to be the Engine Control Unit or the crankshaft position sensor.  The C14NZ ECU is pretty robust and the CPS is more lightly to fail. Surprisingly the CPS can be intermittent, but it will eventually fail completely. It is simple to change, but cannot be bought as an individual component.
If the rev counter continues to reflect the engine speed the problem is in the High Tension circuit, most likely the plug leads.

==Astra Engine idles erratically ==
The C14NZ engine should run at 600 RPM at idle, if it hunts, increases in speed and then may cut out completely, first check the air filter is in good condition. Otherwise the most likely fault is the hose pipe between the Multec CFI single port injection system and the MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensor. Check the pipe has not come loose or been damaged.

==Astra Engine misfires under full throttle==
Engine runs normally under light load but misfires at full throttle. 
Firstly check the condition of the spark plugs.
Then look for signs of a rich mixture, check fuel consumption. An over-rich mixture can be due to a broken Coolant Temperature Sensor or wiring. The sensor operates the dashboard temperature gauge, check readings are sensible. A broken sensor failure is the equivalent of running with the choke on. The ECU thinks the engine is cold. The sensor connector is exposed and rather insecure. The sensor should read about 1600 Ohms at room temperature. See Haynes manual for replacement procedure.

==Astra 5 speed manual gearbox, cannot select 2nd gear==
Usually caused by a worn gear linkage. Inside the engine compartment, the top side to side link is made of plastic and seems to be the &quot;weak link&quot;. With an assistant in the car, have them try to select 2nd gear, if there is side to side play replace the link. This is not described in the Haynes Manual - details follow.
&lt;H1&gt;Jeep Cherokee XJ / Grand Cherokee &lt;/H1&gt; the whole sentence listed above has unconfirmed datas

==Cherokee Diagnostic Trouble Code 11==
DTC 11 on the 4.0L Inline 6 MPI &quot;Power Tech HO&quot; (High Output) engine indicates a fault with the CPS (Crankshaft Position Sensor). The Haynes manual describes the electrical checks to diagnose a faulty unit before purchasing and fitting a replacement.

The CPS on the 4.0 Liter automatic uses one 11mm (*) bolt, the manual uses two. Access is possible from the underside of the engine. The sensor is mounted on the back of the clutch bell housing with little clearance between it and the bulkhead. It can be felt but not seen from underneath the vehicle, and seen but not accessed from the top of the engine. Use a socket with an omni directional extension and a couple of straight extensions so that the ratchet is free of the bodywork. The torque setting is fairly low, and once the socket is in place removal does not require much effort.
Replacing the sensor is more difficult, the bolt must be started in its thread by hand and there is barely enough room to use your thumb. Use the socket and extensions to tighten to the correct torque setting.

(* on a Feb 97 UK spec manual the bolt heads mike up at 10.7mm across flats so there's a bit of slack. If not corroded in they come out easily enough using an 11mm socket, as did the one I measured. I don't know whether there is a special tool in exactly the right size to prevent rounding off the hex, but I still have one that's seized in to sort... TS)

==Cherokee Coolant leaks underneath the manifolds==
The 4.0L Inline 6 MPI &quot;Power Tech HO&quot; engine may develop coolant leaks when the engine core plugs become corroded. Corrosion is often caused by running the engine without anti-freeze or corrosion inhibitors in the cooling system. 

Access to the front core plug is possible without removing the manifold. Remove the core plug by locating the weaker corroded part and puncturing it with a center punch or a screwdriver. The core plug is made of fairly soft material, but be very careful not to push the plug into the engine block, if this happens the manifold will have to be removed to recover it. Once the core plug is pierced with the screwdriver lever it out until an edge is exposed and then use a Mole grip to remove it.

Refit using a socket that fits the new core plug loosely, 32 mm or similar. Ensure that the core plug is square on the engine block, add sufficient socket extension bars so that they are free of the manifold and the push it using a large piece of wood as a lever. Once the core plug is engaged feel it to check that it is square, if so drive it in with a shorter extension and a hammer (be sure to use a solid steel hammer, not a sand filled or lead &quot;dead blow&quot; type, as the impact of these hammer types is not sufficient to drive in the frost plug), if not use use a smaller socket to drive one side rather than the other to square it up. Stop when the core plug flange is flush with the engine block.
Refill the cooling system with rust inhibitor and anti-freeze.

Frost plug sizes are 2&quot;, except certain 1987 Renix models which have both 2&quot; as well as 1&quot; frost plugs.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Kabir. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Kabir~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About This Book ==
This book is intended to be a complete replacement for science books in middle school (ages 12-15).  Each section should be set up as a module that can be used independently of other modules.
&lt;br&gt;
Although there are many other informational textbooks, many are very complex and not suited for middle school students.
&lt;br&gt;
Many of the textbooks that are online lack resrouces for teachers.  The purpose of this Wikibook is to provide teachers quiz and test questions, worksheets, and labs or activities to use in the classroom.

== Basic Module Format ==
The modules for each section should follow this basic format

* '''Concept''': This is the basic idea of what this section is about.  Each page should have a short concept that consists of clear, easy-to-understand sentences.

* '''Examples:''' To keep the concepts as clear as possible, put all examples explaining that concept into this section.  This section is intended to be added to and exapanded the most.

* '''Optional module sections:'''
** '''History:''' A brief history of the concept, such as how it was discovered, or how it was developed.
** '''Review Questions:''' Include questions that would be good for a test or quiz
** '''Activities/Labs:''' Include activities that can that might help students understand this concept.

==Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence==

As White, you still have designs on playing f4, but Black with his knight sortie has challenged your control of d5. Should you fight back, or ignore this distraction?

:[[/3. f4/]]: White has had enough of Black's e-pawn, and feels an open f-file would be useful in his later attack. 

:[[/3. Bc4/]]: White again restrains himself from the committal f4 and places another piece where it controls d5. With a little co-operation from Black, White may now head towards one of the most terrifying opening positions yet discovered...

Less critical alternatives are:

:[[/3. a3/]]: the Mengarini Variation, preventing Bb4, but this bishop has at least one other good square. 

:[[/3. d3/]]: Having challenged Black to some old-fashioned fisticuffs, White sadistically transposes to a solid King's Indian Attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== An Overview of GCC Architecture ===

This section is based on a Red Hat magazine article {{ref|rh_magazine}}.

GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) comprises a number of compilers for different programming languages. The main GCC executable '''gcc''' processes source files written in C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, Fortran, or Ada and produces an assembly file for each source file. It is a driver program that invokes the appropriate compilation programs depending on the language of the source file. For a C source file they are the preprocessor and compiler '''cc1''', the assembler '''as''', and the linker '''collect2'''. The first and the third programs come with a GCC distribution, the assembler is a part of the GNU binutils package. This book describes the internals of the preprocessor and compiler '''cc1'''.

Each compiler includes the following three components: a front end, a middle end, and a back end. GCC compiles one file at a time. A source file goes through all three components one after another. [[:Image:Gcc.JPG|Figure 1]] illustrates the components and the source file representations associated with each component.

[[Image:Gcc.JPG|center|frame|GCC front end, middle end, and back end with source file representations.]]

The purpose of the front end is to read the source file, parse it, and convert it into the standard ''abstract syntax tree (AST)'' representation. There is one front end for each programming language. Because of the differences in languages, the format of the generated ASTs is slightly different for each language. The next step after AST generation is the unification step in which the AST tree is converted into a unified form called generic. After this, the middle end part of the compiler takes control. First, the tree is converted into another representation called ''GIMPLE''. In this form, each expression contains no more than three operands, all control flow constructs are represented as combinations of conditional statements and goto operators, arguments of a function call can only be variables, etc. [[:Image:gccinternals-img2.png|Figure 2]] illustrates the differences between a tree in generic form and a tree in GIMPLE form. GIMPLE is a convenient representations for optimizing the source code.


After GIMPLE, the source code is converted into the ''static single assignment (SSA)'' representation. The central idea of this form is the fact that each variable is assigned to only once, but can be used at the right hand side of an expression many times. Every time the same variable of a tree in the GIMPLE form is reassigned, the compiler creates a new version of that variable and stores the new value into it. When the same variable is assigned to in both branches of a conditional expression, one needs to merge the two possible values of the variable into a single variable. This operation is denoted as PHI function in the SSA form.


The SSA form is also used for optimizations. GCC performs more than 20 different optimizations on SSA trees. After the SSA optimization pass, the tree is converted back to the GIMPLE form which is then used to generate a ''register-transfer language (RTL)'' form of a tree. RTL is a hardware-based representation that corresponds to an abstract target architecture with an infinite number of registers. An RTL optimization pass optimizes the tree in the RTL form. Finally, a GCC back-end generates the assembly code for the target architecture using the RTL representation. Examples of back-ends are x86 back end, mips back end, etc.

In the next sections we describe the internals of the C front end and the x86 back end. The compiler starts with its initialization and command line options processing. After that the C front end preprocesses the source file, parses it and performs a number of optimizations. The back end then generates the assembly code for the target platform and saves it to a file.

{{GCC_take_home|GCC is a compiler collection that consists of a front end for each programming language, a middle end, and a back end for each architecture. The main representations that each source file goes through are AST in front end, RTL in middle end, and the assembly representation in back end. GCC compiles one file at a time.}}

=== GCC Initialization ===

The C front end includes the C/C++ preprocessor and the C compiler. Program '''cc1''' includes both the preprocessor and C compiler. It compiles a C source file and generates an assembly (.S) file.

The compiler frontend and backend interact with each other using callback functions called language hooks. All hooks are included into a global variable struct lang_hooks lang_hooks that is defined in file langhooks.h. There are the following types of hooks: hooks for tree inlining, hooks for call graph, hooks for functions, hooks for tree dump, hooks for types, hooks for declarations, and language-specific hooks. The default values for the hooks are defined in file langhooks-def.h.

GCC initialization consists of command line option parsing, initializing the back end, creating the global scope, and initializing the built-in data types and functions.

Each declaration is associated with a scope. For example, a local variable is associated with its function's scope. A global declaration is associated with the global scope. 

Function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4674|toplev_main()}} is the function that processes the command-line options, initializes the compiler, compiles a file, and frees up the allocated resources. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|opts.c|477|decode_options()}} processes the command-line options and sets the corresponding variables within the compiler. 

Following the command line option parsing function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4621|do_compile()}} is called. It performs the back-end initialization by calling function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4487|backend_init()}}. After that, function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4519|lang_dependent_init()}} performs language-dependent initialization which includes the initialization of a front-end and a back-end. The C initialization function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-objc-common.c|154|c_objc_common_init()}} creates built-in data types, initializes the global scope and performs other initialization tasks. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-common.c|3043|c_common_nodes_and_builtins()}} creates pre-defined types described in file builtin-types.def. 

The standard C types are created at the initialization time. The following table presents several types:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC builtin types
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Variable Name
| C type
|- align=left
| char_type_node
| char
|-
| integer_type_node
| int
|-
| unsigned_type_node
| unsigned int
|-
| void_type_node
| void
|-
| ptr_type_node
| void*
|}

GCC built-in functions are the functions that are evaluated at compile time. For example, if the size argument of a strcpy() function is a constant then GCC replaces the function call with the required number of assignments. The compiler replaces standard library calls with built-in functions and then evaluates them once the function's AST is constructed. In case of strcpy(), the compiler checks the size argument and uses the optimized built-in version of strcpy() if the argument is constant. Builtin {{GCC_func|3_4|builtins.c|1444|builtin_constant_p()}} allows to find out if the value of its argument is known at compile time. GCC builtins are used beyond GCC. For example, the string processing library of Linux kernel uses builtin_constant_p() to invoke the optimized version of a string processing function if the string size is known at compile time. 

GCC evaluates each builtin function using a corresponding expand_builtin() function. For example, builtin_strcmp() is evaluated using {{GCC_func|3_4|builtins.c|3260|expand_builtin_strcmp()}}. The following table gives examples of GCC builtins:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC builtin functions
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Builtin Name
| Explanation
|- align=left
| builtin_constant_p
| returns true if the argument is a constant
|-
| builtin_memcpy
| equivalent to memcpy()
|-
| builtin_strlen
| equivalent to strlen()
|}


{{GCC_take_home|GCC initialization consists of command line option parsing, initializing the back end, creating the global scope, and initializing the built-in data types and functions.}}

=== C Preprocessor ===

Following the initialization, function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|4621|do_compile()}} calls function {{GCC_func|3_4|toplev.c|1807|compile_file()}}. This function invokes parse_file() front-end language hook which is set to function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-opts.c|1205|c_common_parse_file()}} for C language. The latter function invokes function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-opts.c|1306|finish_options()}} which initializes the preprocessor and handles -D, -U, and -A command line options (which are equivalent to #define, #undef, and #assert respectively). The C preprocessor handles the preprocessor directives such as #define, #include in the source code.

Following the preprocessor initialization, {{GCC_func|3_4|c-parse.in|3767|c_parse_file()}} function is invoked. This function uses the standard lex/bison tools to parse the file. The preprocessor is implemented as a part of the lexer. The C language lexer function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-lex.c|433|c_lex()}} calls the libcpp function {{GCC_func|3_4|cppmacro.c|1038|cpp_get_token()}} which handles the preprocessor keywords. The state of the preprocessor is defined by variable {{GCC_func|3_4|c-common.c|46|cpp_reader *parse_in}}. Type {{GCC_func|3_4|cpphash.h|319|struct cpp_reader}} contains most importantly the list of text buffers being processed. Each buffer corresponds to a source file (.c or .h). Function {{GCC_func|3_4|cppmacro.c|1038|cpp_get_token()}} calls appropriate functions for legitimate preprocessor keywords. For example, when #include is encountered, function {{GCC_func|3_4|cpplib.c|672|do_include_common()}} is invoked. It allocates a new buffer and places it on top of the buffer stack making it the current buffer. When a new file is compiled the buffer is popped off the stack and the compilation of the old file continues.

Function {{GCC_func|3_4|cpplib.c|501|do_define()}} is called whenever a new macro is defined using #define keyword. 

{{GCC_take_home|The preprocessor takes care of the preprocessor directives, for example #include and #ifdef.}}

=== Source Code Parsing ===

After running the preprocessor GCC constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) for each function of the source file. An AST is a number of connected nodes of type {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|1768|struct tree}}. Each node has a ''tree code'' that defines the type of the tree. Macro {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|276|TREE_CODE()}} is used to refer to the code. Tree codes are defined in files {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|1|tree.def}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-common.def|1|c-common.def}}. Trees with different tree codes are grouped into ''tree classes''. The following tree classes are defined among others in GCC:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC tree classes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Tree Class
| Explanation
|- align=left
| 'd'
| declarations
|- 
| '&lt;'
| comparison
|- 
| '2'
| binary arithmetic
|}


There are two types of trees: ''statements'' and ''expressions''. Statements correspond to the C constructs, for example an expression followed by a ';', a conditional statement, a loop statement, etc. Expressions are what the statements are build up from. Examples of expressions are an assignment expression, an arithmetic expression, a function call, etc. Examples of tree codes are given in the following table:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ GCC tree codes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Tree Code
| Tree Class
| Explanation
| Operands
|- align=left
| MODIFY_EXPR
| 'e'
| an assignment expression
| TREE_OPERAND(t,0) - left hand side; TREE_OPERAND(t,1) - right hand side;
|-
| CALL_EXPR
| 'e'
| function call
| TREE_OPERAND(t,0) - function definition; TREE_OPERAND(t,1) - function arguments;
|-
| FUNCTION_DECL
| 'd'
| variable declaration
| DECL_SOURCE_FILE(t) - source file; DECL_NAME(t) - variable name;
|-
| ARRAY_TYPE
| 't'
| array type
| TREE_TYPE(t) - type of an array element; TYPE_DOMAIN(t) - type of index;
|-
| DECL_STMT
| 'e'
| variable declaration
| TREE_OPERAND(t,0) - variable; DECL_INITIAL(TREE_OPERAND(t,1)) - initial value;

|}

In addition to the tree code that defines the type of the tree, a number of operands different for each tree type are available. For example, an assignment expression has two operands which correspond to the left and right sides of the expression. Macro {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|814|TREE_OPERAND}} is used to refer to the operands. Macro {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.h|745|IDENTIFIER_POINTER}} is used to find the name of an identifier that an {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|53|IDENTIFIER_NODE}} tree represents. The following table presents several tree nodes, their purpose, and their operands.

Each tree has a type that corresponds to the type of C expression that it represents For example, the type of the {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|425|MODIFY_EXPR}} node is the type of the left-hand side operand. {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|697|NOP_EXPR}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|692|CONVERT_EXPR}} trees are used for type casting.

Tree NULL_TREE is equivalent to NULL. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|print-tree.c|45|debug_tree()}} prints out the tree to stderr.

The parser is implemented as a bison grammar. The grammar invokes the GCC functions that construct the AST. When a new identifier is lexed, it is added to the pool of strings that GCC maintains. The tree code of an identifier is {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|53|IDENTIFIER_NODE}}. When the same identifier is lexed again, the same tree node is returned. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|stringpool.c|94|get_identifier()}} returns the tree node for an identifier. 

A new variable declaration is processed in a number of function calls. First, function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2493|start_decl()}} is called with the name of the declaration, its type as returned by the lexer, and its attributes. The function calls {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|3223|grokdeclarator()}} that checks the type and argument nodes and returns a tree with the code appropriate for the declaration: {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|280|VAR_DECL}} for variables, {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|280|TYPE_DECL}} for types, etc. The declarartion is then added to the ''scope''. A scope contains all declarations created within a function, but does not contain global declarations. There is also the global scope that contains global declarations. When a function is parsed, its declarations are attached to its body as a {{GCC_func|3_4|tree.def|69|BLOCK}} node. When a declaration is created, the identifier node is associated with the declaration node using {{GCC_func|3_4|c-tree.h|70|IDENTIFIER_SYMBOL_VALUE}}. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2147|lookup_name()}} returns the declaration for a given identifier. When a declaration leaves the scope the tree attributes {{GCC_func|3_4|c-tree.h|131|C_DECL_INVISIBLE}} is asserted.

A ''symbol table'' is not maintained in GCC. Instead, the compiler uses the pool of identifiers and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-tree.h|131|C_DECL_INVISIBLE}} attribute. Language hook lang_hooks.decls.getdecls() returns the variables in the scope chained together.

Functions {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|4426|start_init()}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|4490|finish_init()}} are called for an initialized declaration. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2673|finish_decl()}} finalizes the declaration. For an array declaration it computes the size of an initialized array. Then function {{GCC_func|3_4|stor-layout.c|339|layout_decl()}} is called. It computes the size and alignment of the declaration.

Parsing a function depends on the presence of its body. A function declaration is parsed using the same functions as those used for variable declarations. For a function definition, function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|5406|start_function()}} is called. Then the compiler parses the body of the function. When the function ends function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|6006|finish_function()}} is called.

Functions {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2493|start_decl()}} and {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|5406|start_function()}} take declaration's ''attributes'' parameter as one of their arguments. The attributes are described in the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.5/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes GCC Manual]. Attributes are extensions of GNU implementation of C. The following table presents a few of them and explains their purpose:

{| border=&quot;1px solid black&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=center
|+ Function attributes
|- bgcolor=#ffe0ff align=center
| Attribute
| Explanation
|- align=left
| constructor
| call function automatically before main()
|-
| destructor
| call function automatically after main()
|-
| alias
| alias to another function

|}

For each type of C statements there is a function that constructs a tree node of the corresponding type. For example, function {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|1656|build_function_call()}} builds a CALL_EXPR node for a function call. It takes the identifier of the function name and the arguments as its parameters. The function finds the function declaration using {{GCC_func|3_4|c-decl.c|2147|lookup_name()}} and type casts the arguments using {{GCC_func|3_4|c-typeck.c|1135|default_conversion()}}. 

The ASTs are then converted into the SSA and eventually to the RTL representations. Whether the conversion occurs after parsing each function or when the whole file is parsed is controlled by the compiler option -funit-at-a-time. It is false by default. 

{{GCC_take_home|GCC parser is written as a bison grammar. It creates the AST representation of the source file. ASTs are built up of tree nodes. Each node has a code. Tree nodes correspond to the statements and expressions of C. Function debug_tree() prints out the tree.}}

=== Assembly Code Generation ===

The backend generates the assembly code for the specified target platform. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|final.c|2884|output_asm_insn()}} is called for each instruction written to the assembly file. Function {{GCC_func|3_4|final.c|1322|final_start_function()}} generates the prolog of the function before it is saved to the assembly file.

{{GCC_take_home|The backend generates the assembly code for the specified target platform.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we describe the creation of a new compiler extension step-by-step. First, one needs to download the GCC and patch it with the GEM patch. After that one can start writing the compiler extension. When the extension is ready one can compile other programs using the GEM-patched version of GCC and the new compiler extension.

=== Installation ===

Download GEM framework from [http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/gem/gem-3.4.1.tar.gz here]. Unpack it and type '''make all'''. This will download a copy of GCC, patch it with GCC patch, compile and install GCC, and build examples.

The C function overloading example allows one to overload functions in C just like in C++:

   /* one function */
   void test(int a, int b) {
     printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;, a, b);
   }
   /* overloaded function */
   void test(char *a, int b) {
     printf(&quot;%s %d\n&quot;, a, b);
   }
   void main() {
     test(1,2);
     test(&quot;abc&quot;, 1);
   }

Let us consider the CFO example in more detail.

=== C function overloading ===

The source code of the extension is located in ./examples/cfo/cfo.c file. The following hooks are implemented:

  gem_start_decl()
  gem_start_function()
  gem_build_function_call()

The idea of the implementation is to modify the name of each function declared more than once. The names of these functions are modifier to include the type information of the arguments. For example, function test(int, int) is renamed into test_i_i(int, int). The renaming takes place in function cfo_alias_decl(). 

Functions cfo_start_decl() and gem_start_function() call this function. It looks up the name of the function being declared and returns immediately if the name is not found:

  cfo_find_symtab(&amp;t_func, func_name);
  if (t_func==NULL_TREE || DECL_BUILT_IN(t_func)) {
    return;
  }

Therefore, the names of non-overloaded functions are not changed. This maintains the compatibility with the unmodified compiler.

If the function with this name was declared previously then the extension checks if an alias with the arguments type information was created:

  strcpy(new_name, func_name);
  strcat(new_name, cfo_build_name(TREE_PURPOSE(T_O(declarator, 1))));
  cfo_find_symtab(&amp;t_func_alias, name);

Function cfo_build_name() builds the name of the function arguments. An alias is created if it was not created before.

    t_alias_attr=tree_cons(get_identifier(&quot;alias&quot;),
                           tree_cons(NULL_TREE, get_identifier(name), NULL_TREE), NULL_TREE);
    TYPE_ATTRIBUTES(T_T(t_func)) = t_alias_attr;
    DECL_ATTRIBUTES(t_func)=t_alias_attr;

Finally, the new declaration is renamed so that it includes the type information of the arguments:

    T_O(declarator,0) = get_identifier(new_name);

Function cfo_build_function_call() builds the name of the function that includes the argument type information and looks it up in the symbol table. If the name is found then the function name is replace in the function call. If the name is not found then the function was not overloaded and the name of the function being called is not changed. Build the new name:

  name = cfo_build_decl_name(t_func, t_parm);

Check if this identifier was parsed previously:

  t_new_func = get_identifier(name);

If it was then get the declaration:

  if (t_new_func) {
    t_new_func = lookup_name(t_new_func);
  }

If the declaration is found then replace the function:

  *func = t_new_func;

=Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence=

White has nailed down Black's d-pawn by controlling d5 with three pieces. This prevents Black from breaking open the centre, or does it? The late Alexander Alekhine, world champion in the 1930s, recommends:

:[[/3...Nxe4/]]! 

This is the fork trick common to several openings. After 3...Nxe4 Black has eliminated two of the attackers of d5 with one stroke, and will proceed to regain the piece by 4...d5, grabbing a large chunk of the centre as he does so. For now, Black is a pawn up, but White may just have something else up his sleeve too...

Black can also choose to forget about d5 for the time being:

:[[/3...Nc6/]] transposes back to the Max Lange Defence. 

:[[/3...d6/]] is a timid move. It attempts to maintain a pawn at e5 after White plays f4, but it happens to give White the run of the board in the process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Function overloading as in C++===

This example was presented previously.

===toString() method for each structure as in Java===

===Invoke a block of code from a function as in Ruby===

Linux implementation of lists allows to invoke a block of code on each element of the list:

[http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/nfs/pagelist.c?v=2.4.20#L199 pagelist.c]:

        list_for_each_prev(pos, head) {
                 struct nfs_page *p = nfs_list_entry(pos);
                 if (page_index(p-&gt;wb_page) &lt; pg_idx)
                         break;
        }

list_for_each_prev takes the code in the brackets as a parameter. The trick is to use a macro that rolls out to a for() loop whose body becomes the code in the brackets. The goal of this project is to allow programmers to use code blocks in function calls. 

===Dereference function results when a structure is returned===

C allows one to dereference the return value of a function if it is a pointer to a structure:

  get_struct()-&gt;field=0;

If the function returns the structure, not a pointer to it, then a compile-time error is generated:

  get_struct().field=0;
  &gt; request for member `field' in something not a structure or union

This extension addresses the problem of dereferencing structures that are return values.

===Use functions to initialize a variable===

When a variable is defined and initialized the initializers is constant. You will get an error if you try to use a function, no matter what this function is:

  int getint() { return 1; }
  int i=getint();
  &gt; initializer element is not constant

When a variable is used the function it was initialized with is called. 

===Default values of function arguments as in C++===

  void func(int a=0) {
    printf(&quot;a=%d\n&quot;, a);
  }
  int main() {
    func();
  }
  &gt; syntax error before '=' token

===Reference parameters as in C++===

  void test(int &amp;a, int &amp;b);
  int x,y;
  test(x,y);

===Return address protection (RAD)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/RAD Rad]

===Repair of control-hijacking attacks (DIRA)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/dira Dira]

===Array bounds checking using segmentation hardware (CASH)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/cash Cash]

===Detecting interger overflows (DIVINE)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/iop Divine]

===Develop in userland, install in kernel (DUSK)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/dusk Dusk]

===Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (GDIF)===
[http://www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/~lclam/gdif/ Gdif]

===GCC switches in object file===
[http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Record_GCC_command_line_switches_in_object_files GCC switches in object file]

===The -fstack-protector feature===
[http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.1/ GCC 4.1] implements a protection mechanism against buffer overflow attacks and exposes it to a programmer with a -fstack-protector option. This is an example of functionality that benefits from modular implementation because it has nothing to do with core functionality of the compiler. Does GCC have enough hooks to implement -fstack-protector module?

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An important decision you must make before starting to create a website is the version of (X)HTML that the web pages will conform to.

The following versions of (X)HTML are current in January 2006:
* HTML 4.01 Strict
** (''HTML 4.01 Transitional'')
** (''HTML 4.01 Frameset'')
* XHTML 1.0 Strict
** (''XHMTL 1.0 Transitional'')
** (''XHTML 1.0 Frameset'')
* XHTML Basic
* XHTML 1.1
Versions of HTML prior to 4.0 are obsolete. Web pages in these versions should be withdrawn or converted to a variant of HTML version 4.01 or XHTML. No new page should be created using a version prior to HTML 4.01.

Four versions in the list above are shown in brackets. These versions are intended to be used as stepping stones when converting web pages from obsolete versions to current versions. They are not intended to be used by new web pages.

You shouldn't be using any variant of XHTML 1.0 unless you understand and apply the rules in [http://www.w3.org/TR/html/#guidelines Appendix C] of the XHTML 1.0 specification. You also need to understand the differences between the &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/code&gt; MIME types and how to configure your web server to respond with the appropriate MIME type.

Internet Explorer version 7.0 and lower (about 90% of web surfers were using Internet Explorer version 7.0 or lower in January 2006) does not understand XHMTL Basic or XHTML 1.1. These versions should not be used for general purpose web pages at the moment. XHTML Basic is useful for web pages that are only viewed by mobile phones as this is the preferred version for these devices.

This leaves HTML 4.01 Strict as the best choice for new authors. After you have mastered writing quality web pages using HTML you can learn the technical details of '''serving''' XHTML properly. (Writing XHTML web pages is just as easy as writing HTML web pages, the problem is configuring the server to serve them properly.)

Note that automatic tools can easily convert '''valid''' HTML 4.01 Strict to XHTML 1.0 Strict provided you don't use Javascript in your web pages. Converting Javascript is often a problem since XHTML does not permit &lt;code&gt;document.write()&lt;/code&gt;. (If &lt;code&gt;document.write()&lt;/code&gt; works in your XHTML then your server is not configured correctly.) If you must use Javascript avoid &lt;code&gt;document.write()&lt;/code&gt;.

Authors with experience of configuring web servers or access to good technical support may want to use XHTML 1.0 Strict from the start.

== Validation ==
Regardless of the version of HTML you choose to use it is important that you regularly validate your pages to ensure they conform to your chosen specification.

=== HTML 4.01 Strict ===
The DOCTYPE for HTML 4.01 Strict is
 &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
All HTML 4.01 Strict documents must start with this line (certain variants are permitted but they are beyond the scope of  this section).

Many examples of HTML in textbooks will not validate using the Strict DOCTYPE. This normally means that the example uses obsolete HTML elements, e.g. &lt;code&gt;FONT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FRAME&lt;/code&gt;. If you find that the examples in a book won't validate (or only validate with the Transitional or Frameset DOCTYPE) the textbook is probably out of date. The content of a significant number of textbooks are five or more years out of date, e.g. some books published in 2005 have content that was cutting edge in 1999 but is no longer considered best practice. Avoid any textbook that contains example that don't validate.

Findings: &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&lt;br&gt;
* The transition from Latin to Old English is a natural, thus the transition of Iesous from Greek to Latin to O.E. to English reaches an interesting juncture in Chapter 4. Jesus had foreign relations. Modernity opts (v. 7) for universal language at that point. The Coptic only starts in Chapter 2, first viable sacred name is a preview in 3: 10, unavoidably (the abbreviation &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline;&quot;&gt;IHC&lt;/span&gt; represents the unpronounceable name of God already) this shows a mixture of Greek and English translation, an awkward moment, but one of the earliest examples of superlineation and an Aramism of redundant verbage, all in three words, altogether fascinating. Latin makes it easier, Codex D starts at John 3: 16, first viable sacred name John 4: 1. The last leaves or pages in both codices are missing bringing the Latin phrases to a dramatic conclusion in Chapter 20 and 21, even more so the Aramaic in Chapter 20. Can you wait?
* The preliminary heading was Greek/Latin Word pictures with the addition of Codex D, but that puts Latin on an equal basis with Greek. Findings in Chapter 3 touch on a more descriptive term, so the change to “plus Latin Facsimiles” outlining its tertiary and political role, behind Greek and Aramaic. &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;006633&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00AAAA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00BBBB&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00DDDD&quot;&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:51, 11 October 2010 (UTC)

Gmail's huge storage (7 gigabytes) may tempt some to use it as a file storage system. Because of the tedious process of putting one attachment after another and sending it to yourself, someone has taken the liberty of developing a program to add a shell extension to Microsoft's Windows operating systems. There are many different shell extensions (it may take a bit of digging through Google's search engine), each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Here is one to try out, the most popular and well known GMail Drive! There is also an extension for Firefox called &quot;GSpace&quot; that does the same thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thermodynamic Processes for an Ideal Gas ==

Let us first consider the expansion and compression of an ideal gas from an initial volume V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to a final volume V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under constant-temperature (isothermal) conditions.  From the definition of pressure-volume work, we have:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext}dV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If we assume the process occurs reversibly, then &lt;math&gt;P_{ext}=P&lt;/math&gt; where P is the pressure of the gas; therefore&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-\int_{V_1}^{V_2} PdV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now let us use the equation of state for an ideal gas, which is &lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt; where n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute (Kelvin) temperature.  Substituting for P, we get&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{nRT}{V}dV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If we have a closed system, then n is a constant; moreover, since we have stipulated that this process occurs under isothermal conditions, T is also a constant.  Therefore, the integral simplifies to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-nRT\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{dV}{V}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This integral may be solved to yield&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;w=-nRT\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Next we consider the change in the internal energy of the ideal gas upon isothermal expansion/compression.  It is helpful to review the two key assumptions that underlie the ideal gas model:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideal gas particles are point particles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideal gas particles have no interparticular forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
From these two statements, we now contemplate what would happen to the internal energy (U) of an ideal gas upon isothermal expansion or compression.  Because ideal gas particles are point particles, if the gas sample is compressed, the particles will not experience any change in energy because they have no internal volume to get &quot;squeezed&quot;.  Similarly, because they have no interparticular forces, they do not experience any change in attraction or repulsion between different particles if they are squeezed closer together.  Hence, we may (correctly) reason that for an isothermal process on an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is zero.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = 0\;&lt;/math&gt; (isothermal process, ideal gas)&lt;br&gt;
(This same result may be rigorously proved using the thermodynamic master equations, or by using statistical thermodynamics.)  Note that because U is a state function, &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; will always be equal to zero for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; isothermal process on an ideal gas, whether or not it occurs reversibly.&lt;br&gt;
Because of the First Law of Thermodynamics,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = q + w\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and because &lt;math&gt;\Delta U = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the energy change associated with heat upon isothermal reversible expansion or compression is just the negative of the work, or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;q = -w = nRT\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;.
In a similar fashion, other results may be derived for processes on ideal gases.  A summary of results is given below.

== Molar Thermodynamic Properties for an Ideal Gas ==
We are given that the molar Gibbs free energy of an ideal is &lt;math&gt;\bar G = \bar G^\circ+RT \ln\frac{P}{P^\circ}\;&lt;/math&gt;. Let's try and derive &lt;math&gt;\bar U=\bar U^\circ=\bar H^\circ-RT\;&lt;/math&gt;; noting that &lt;math&gt;\bar U^\circ=\bar G^\circ+T\bar S^\circ-RT\;&lt;/math&gt; and assuming that the internal energy &lt;math&gt;U\;&lt;/math&gt; and enthalpy &lt;math&gt;H\;&lt;/math&gt; of an ideal gas are independent of pressure and volume.

==Natural history==
Recurrence rate of 50-80% after surgery. Recurrence rate reduced to 50% with intralesional steroid therapy. RT reduces recurrence rate to 12-28%. 


==Treatment Overview==
*No universally accepted treatment protocol
*Modalities: surgery, radiation, pressure therapy, cryotherapy, intralesional injections of corticosteroids, interferon, fluorouracil, topical silicone, and pulse-dye laser treatment
*Surgery only has recurrence rate of 50-80%
*Post-op RT
**Success rate 75-90% within 10 year follow-up; however, a recent Dutch study had 70+% recurrence within 2 year, in sharp disagreement with prior studies
**Usually surgical excision followed immediately with RT
**Usually 3-4 fractions daily in 3-4 Gy/fx; however, recent Dutch meta-analysis suggests that dose is insufficient for long-term control, and should use BED of &gt;30 Gy (e.g. 13/1, 16/2, 18/3)
**Sites with high rates of recurrence (eg. high-tension areas) should be treated with escalated dosage


==Post-op RT==
'''''Meta-analysis'''''
*'''Utrecht'''
**'''2005''' PMID 16254707 -- &quot;Biologically effective doses of postoperative radiotherapy in the prevention of keloids. Dose-effect relationship.&quot; (Kal HB, Strahlenther Onkol. 2005 Nov;181(11):717-23.)
***Meta-analysis, 18 studies. Recurrence rate for surgery only 50-80%
***BED: Recurrence rate decreased as a function of BED, if &gt;30 Gy recurrence was &lt;10%. No difference with high stretch tension sites
***Conclusion: For effective therapy, need a reasonably high dose (BED &gt;=30 Gy, for example 13/1, 16/2, 18/3 or 27/1 LDR), within 2 days of surgery
**'''2009''' PMID 19362243 -- &quot;Dose-effect relationships for recurrence of keloid and pterygium after surgery and radiotherapy.&quot; (Kal HB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 May 1;74(1):245-51.)
***For keloid recurrence after radiotherapy following keloid removal, with either teletherapy or brachytherapy, the recurrence rate after having delivered a BED greater than 30 Gy is less than 10%.
***Conclusion: &quot;Most of the doses in the radiotherapy schemes used for prevention of keloid recurrence after surgery are too low. A scheme with a BED of 30 to 40 Gy seems to be sufficient to prevent recurrences of keloid&quot;

*'''U.Pittsburgh;2011''' - PMID 20472370 -- &quot;A Radiobiological Analysis of Multicenter Data for Postoperative Keloid Radiotherapy&quot; (Flickinger JC; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Mar 15;79(4):1164-70.)
**Review of multiple published studies. For 95% control of keloids with electrons, fractionated (in 3 fx) dose of 18.3-19.2 Gy (earlobe) or 23.4-24.8 Gy (other sites). Single fraction equivalent dose: 11.4 Gy (earlobe) and 14.5 Gy (other sites).

'''''Randomized'''''
*'''Beth Israel, 1996''' PMID 8646474 -- Steroid injection vs RT

**&quot;Prevention of earlobe keloid recurrence with postoperative corticosteroid injections versus radiation therapy: a randomized, prospective study and review of the literature.&quot; (Sclafani AP, Dermatol Surg. 1996 Jun;22(6):569-74.)
***Recurrence 2/16, 12.5% (RT) vs 4/12, 33% (Steroids), NS.
**Conclusion: No statistical difference seen, but small study, likely underpowered. 

'''''Single Institution'''''
*'''Tokyo; 2007''' (2002-2004) PMID 18046154 -- &quot;Postoperative radiation protocol for keloids and hypertrophic scars: statistical analysis of 370 sites followed for over 18 months.&quot;
**Prospective. Compared 109 pts (121 lesions) treated from 2002-2004 on a risk-adapted protocol vs historic controls (218 pts; 249 lesions). Risk-adapted strategy employed 10, 15, or 20 Gy depending on site (higher dose: anterior chest wall, scapular, suprapubic; lower dose: earlobe). Historical controls received 15 Gy standard dose.
**Minimal f/u 18 months. Recurrence rate 29.3% (historic) vs 14.0% (protocol). The recurrence rate in the anterior chest wall was statistically reduced. Outcomes of earlobe did not differ between irradiation with 15 Gy or 10 Gy.
**Conclusion: &quot;Keloids and intractable hypertrophic scars should be treated with dose protocols customized by site. Our results suggest that keloid and intractable hypertrophic scar sites with a high risk of recurrence should be treated with 20 Gy in 4 fractions over 4 days and that earlobe should be treated with 10 Gy in 2 fractions over 2 days.&quot;

**Retrospective. 35 patients with 54 keloids (earlobe/auricle n=23, sternum n=17, others n=14), treated with HDR BT. First dose with 6 hours after surgery, 2 additional doses next day 6 hours apart. 
**Outcome: 45% recurrence after HDR 4/1 + 6/2; 3% recurrence after HDR 6/1 + 8/2; no recurrence after HDR 18/3. Better cosmetic results after higher doses
**Conclusion: HDR effective; recommend 3 x 6 Gy

**Retrospective. 21 patients with 32 keloids. RT 12 Gy in 3-4 fxs. Mean F/U 19 months
**Recurrence (elevation of the lesion not confined to the original wound area): 72%
**Conclusion: RT may not be as efficacious as suggested by other studies

**75 pts with 113 keloids with follow-up mean time of 9.7 yrs. 74% involved earlobe. 60% no prior treatment. Superficial X-rays used in 89%, 12 Gy in 3 fx over 3 days most common.
**Control rate 73%. Failure 19% if no prior treatment, 42% if recurrent.
**Toxicity: No treatment-related complications. 5% mild hyperpigmentation. Carcinogenesis never reported to their knowledge
**Prognostic: Higher recurrence in those &gt;2cm, previous therapy, in men. No advantage to starting treatment within 24 hrs versus more than 1 day (range 4-21 days). Mean time to recurrence 12.8 months

**101 institutions. 1672 patients treated over 35 years. 880 pts with follow-up. Total doses 10-20 Gy using 2-3 Gy fractions, 3-5 times/week.
**101 relapses; 11.4%.  Most relapses occurred within 2 years. Side effects were low. No secondary malignancies seen.

**Case report. 20F with severe chest burns, then developed keloids. RT 13/5 to bilateral chest wall. At age 57, L invasive BCA with LN-. At age 59 R invasive multifocal BCA.
**Lit review conclusion: No carcinogenicity reported thus far. Causal relationship in this case strong. Two other potential patients reviewed, although causality in one is suspect, and other probably received too high a dose by today's standards

:&lt;big&gt;''Capitalisation''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;p&gt;


Rules about big and small letters are divided into three parts. 
Capital letters:

#after punctuation marks (greinarmerkjum)
#in nouns (nafnorðum)
#in other groups

It must be noted that due to (mostly) English influences, both foreigners and Icelanders tend to write capital letters where not appropriate and vice versa. The Icelandic rules also tend to be confusing. However, these few (about five hundred) and simple rules and years of practice, should make it all worth while.

It's studying time!

=Capital letters after punctuation marks=

==1==

* Always start with a capital letter at the beginning of each sentence. 

Pretty basic, huh?

# Ex.: ''Ég er svangur. Fáum okkur að borða.'' – I'm hungry. Let's have something to eat.
# Ex.: ''Ertu franskur?'' – Are you French?
# Ex.: ''Enska er skemmtileg, en ekki eins skemmtileg og íslenska.'' – English is fun, but not as fun as Icelandic.

* Always write a capital letter after a period (.) or the equivalent of a period (:?!) unless it is followed by a dependent clause (ósjálfstætt orðasamband).

# Ex.: ''Aðal þema Moby Dicks var: Vertu þú sjálfur.'' – The main theme of Moby Dick was: Be yourself.
# Ex.: ''Jæja! Enn og aftur tókst þér að klúðra þessu.'' – Well! Once again you managed to screw it up.
# Ex.: ''Er ég ánægður? Ó jæja.'' – Am I happy? Oh well.
# Ex.: ''Hann missti allt: manga bækurnar sínar, myndirnar sínar og DS tölvuna sína.'' – He lost everything: his manga books, his pictures and his DS game computer.

The last example was a dependent clause (ósjálfstætt orðasamband)

==3==

* If a direct quote is in a sentence, a lower case letter follows, even if it ends with a question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!).

# Ex.: ''&quot;Ertu lítill?&quot; spurði hann.'' – &quot;Are you small?&quot; he asked.
# Ex.: ''&quot;Ég hata þig!&quot; öskraði hún.'' – &quot;I hate you!&quot; she yelled.

=Rules concerning lowercase and capital letters in nouns=



==A list of proper nouns  (sérnöfn)==

* Human names ('''G'''eir '''H'''agalín), human pet names ('''K'''alli), god and godesses ('''H'''ades, '''K'''ristur =Krist) and animal names ('''L'''assý) 
* (Örnefni), f.x. the names of the continents ('''E'''vrópa =Europe), names of countries ('''J'''apan), names of locations ('''N'''ew '''Y'''ork), names of regions in countries ('''N'''orðurland =Northernland), street names ('''K'''ringlumýrarbraut =Kringlumýrar St.), also common nouns which are used as proper nouns e.g. ('''T'''jörnin, which means &quot;the pond&quot; and would be written with a '''t''' in that meaning), and shortened names of locations ('''F'''jörðurinn = Hafnarfjörður)
* Name of constitutions ('''S'''pítali Íslands), clubs ('''T'''he Icelandic book club), corporations ('''E'''imskip, '''S'''íminn) and political parties ('''S'''jálfstæðisflokkurinn, '''S'''amfylkingin)
* Name of books ('''T'''he Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), newspapers ('''M'''orgunblaðið, '''F'''réttablaðið) and magazines ('''H'''ugur og heilsa)
* Names of musical pieces ('''C'''anon in A), poems ('''S'''ónettur Shakespears)and essays ('''Á'''hrif gróðurhúsaáhrifa)
* Nations ('''S'''koti =Scottish man), residents in specific areas ('''T'''exasbúi = a Texan) or continents ('''A'''síu-maður = an Asian)
* Stars ('''P'''ólstjarnan) and constellations ('''Ó'''ríon = Orion)

*Note that the names of '''languages''' are '''not''' written with a capital letter. 
(Ísland = Iceland, Íslendingur = an Icelandic person, íslenska = Icelandic.)

''Finally, some nouns are written with a lowercase letter if they derive from proper nouns and are then an exception from the rules concerning lowercase letters.''

==Concept==
Bacteria are most widely distributed organisms. These are unicellular micro-organisms. A scientist named Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria in 1677 for the first time. Later, Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch worked on them. This was a milestone in the history of biology and medicine. They discovered that bacteria produce many harmful diseases in man and animals. Bacteria(Singular is bacterium) range from 1um to 10um in length and from 0.2um to to 1 um in width. Bacteria can be observed under light microscope. The habitat of bateria is not specific. They are found everywhere, in air, water, living as well as dead bodies of organisms and even in glaciers and hot springs

==Kinds Of Bacteria==
On the basis of various shapes and forms, bacteria are divided into four types.
First is '''Cocci'''(Singular Coccus) and means rounded. The second is '''Bacilli'''(Singular Bacillus) which is rod-like. The third one is '''Spirilla'''(Singular Spirillium) and means spiral shaped and the last is '''Vibrios'''( Singular Vibrion) which means comma shaped.

[[File:Bread machine with bread(1).jpg|thumb|Breadmachine with bread]]
[[File:Хлеб из хлебопечки - Bread from Bread machine.JPG|thumbnail|Bread from breadmachine]]

A bread machine or breadmaker is a home appliance for baking bread. It handles the process from ingredients to a finished loaf, automatically. The machine consists of a bread pan with a paddle mounted in the centre, in a special purpose oven, with a control panel.

Ingredients (often flour, water, salt, sugar, yeast, butter, and milk powder or fresh milk) are measured and added to the bread pan, which is then placed into the bread machine. The machine takes a few hours to make a loaf of bread, first by turning the ingredients into dough using the paddle, then baking the loaf. When it has finished baking and has cooled down, the pan is removed from the bread machine, and the bread freed from the pan. The paddle is now in the bottom of the loaf, and has to be removed, leaving a small paddle-shaped hole.

Generally, the bread goes stale faster than bread from a commercial baker because it doesn't have the same additives. However, it is possible to use a sourdough starter in bread machine dough recipes. Sourdough contains a symbiotic brew of yeast and lactic acid bacteria cultures. Lactic acid produced by these bacteria greatly preserves bread, as well as enhancing its flavour. However, a sourdough rise takes much longer than a yeast rise, and most bread machines do not have a programmable cycle that caters to this.

Some bread machines are equipped with a timer, so that they can be loaded at night before going to bed, and be set to start in the early morning, presenting a freshly baked loaf ready for breakfast. The machine can sometimes be set to just make the dough, not to bake it, in which case it is baked in an oven. Pizza dough is another option.

Packets of bread mix are available, designed specifically for bread machines. They consist of the ingredients pre-measured. The only other ingredient that needs to be added is water.

The first bread machine was released in Japan in 1986. They became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States in the late 1990s.

Using a bread maker is a convenient way to avoid the hydrogenated vegetable oil that supermarkets add to their bread to make it bake more quickly, as well as other unwanted additives.

Some bread machines can be set to make other things besides bread, such as [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]. They can also be used to make [[Cookbook:Mochi|mochi]], a kind of Japanese rice cake.

      <comment>inserted &quot;or&quot; as a missing conjuction between &quot;faa-yiz&quot; and &quot;moomin&quot;</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The hamza is the symbol that is a عين (rħain) with no tail.
It looks like this:&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ء&lt;/font&gt;
The hamza is best thought of as a vowel separator.

The hamza is not a letter by itself, even though it makes a consonant sound.

The hamza is on either a ياء (yaa') or an ألف (alif) or a واو (waaw) or is by itself.
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ئ / ؤ / أ / إ / ء
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Arabic writing makes sense, but the hamza's carriers cannot be figured out by just hearing. One has to either know the hamza spelling rules or have seen enough Arabic words to know how a word would be spelt. And there do exist spelling rules to figure out whether and which letter a hamza should go over.

But most people don't know the rules of the hamza, and they don't need to. They can spell fine without being able to explain why.

Often people wonder why is the hamza carried by other letters at all. Here is a short explanation:

Whenever a word starts with a vowel in Arabic an alif was written.

And in the old accents, people probably didn't pronounce the hamza anywhere else in a word.
for example:
فائز faa-iz- meaning winner
مؤمن mu'min  meaning (religious) believer

were not pronounced in that manner

instead it was:
faa-yiz or
moomin

So if the hamza existed on a yaa' that means that the different dialects pronounced it like a yaa' instead of a hamza'. You can still hear this pronounciaction very often in Arabic dialects for many words.

== Clearing Private Data ==

=== History ===

[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-history.png|thumb|right]]
It is possible to select individual history items to delete, by using the history side bar. You can open the history side bar by selecting from the menu the ''View -&gt; Sidebar -&gt; History'' option. Deleting singular items can be achieved by finding the item, right-clicking on it to get the context menu, and selecting ''Delete''. Deleting multiple entries can be achieved by right-clicking the list to focus it (for left-clicking will open the web page under the mouse, and losing focus on the list) and using the up/down arrows, and shift+up/down to select blocks of entries. Pressing ''Delete'' on the keyboard will delete the selected history items.

It is possible to delete all history items by opening the preferences dialog on the menu at ''Edit -&gt; Preferences'', and clicking on the ''Privacy'' tab and then the ''History'' tab. A button will be there to ''Clear Browsing History Now''. This will clear '''all''' history items.

Under this tab also, by changing the option ''Remember my browsing history for X days'', to 0, history items will not be kept between sessions.

Auto-completed URLs will disappear as corresponding history items are deleted.

=== Cookies ===

[[Image:Firefox_Pref_Window_privacy-cookies.png|thumb|right]]
Cookies can be cleared by selecting the ''Privacy'' tab  and then the ''Cookies'' tab under the user preferences from the menu at ''Edit -&gt; Preferences''. All cookies can be deleted by clicking the ''Clear Cookies Now'' button. Individual cookies can be cleared by clicking the ''View Cookies'' button to open the cookie viewing dialog. Selecting cookies and pressing ''Delete'' on the keyboard will delete those cookies.

By changing the option to ''Keep Cookies'' to ''Until I close Firefox'', cookies will not be kept between sessions. Also it is possible to choose to block all websites from putting cookies on your computer unless you have explicitly allowed them to do so, by adding them to a list accessible from this tab.

=== Other Data ===

It is possible to delete other private data by using options under the ''Privacy'' tab of the user preferences. See [[Using Firefox/Preferences#Privacy|Preferences]] for more details.

If you just want to delete one or a few values from the saved (remembered) list of field (or form) values, navigate to the item you want to clear ''(don't click on it, just &quot;point&quot; to it)'', then use the Shift-Delete key combination to clear it.

=== Deleting All Private Data ===

You can delete all private data, including browsing history, cookies, cache, saved form data, passwords, and download history, by opening the ''Clear Private Data'' dialog under the menu in ''Tools -&gt; Clear Private Data'' (or by pressing ''Ctrl-Shift-Delete'' on your keyboard). This will ask you to list your preferences as to what should be cleared from Firefox. If you want to do the same thing often in the future, you can deselect ''Ask me before clearing private data'', and the dialog will not be cleared. 

Your preferences for this option can be set in the user preferences dialog under the ''Privacy'' tab; there is a button down the bottom right that says ''Settings'', which will effect this function.

=== Security Extensions ===

==== Stealther ====

This Firefox extension allows you to surf the web without leaving a trace on your local machine. It temporarily disables the following while it is active:

- Browsing History (Websites you've visited, no auto-complete of URL's
- Cookies (Doesn't allow websites to store cookies *Warning* this could cause difficulties when trying to access user account or E-Mail)
- Downloaded Files History (All the files you've downloaded)
- Disk Cache (Any files normally stored on your local machine &quot;i.e images&quot; will not be stored for fast viewing)
- Saved Form Information (Information that would be used during the save form feature in Firefox &quot;i.e save user name and password on this computer?&quot; will not work)
- Sending of ReferrerHeader. (When you click on a link from one web page or website to another, the browser usually sends a Referer/header to the server to tell sites where you came from.)

==== NoScript ====
&quot;Winner of the &quot;2006 PC World World Class Award&quot;, this tool provides extra protection to your Firefox.
It allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking web site, and guards the &quot;trust boundaries&quot; against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).
Such a preemptive approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality...
Experts do agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript ;-)&quot; -Giorgio Maone

==== WOT ====

&quot;Can you recognize good and reliable Internet content? Did you have a bad experience that you would like to share with others? WOT can help you. Seeing website reputations on your browser allows you to learn from other people. This shared knowledge makes it easier to avoid online fraud, including phishing and spyware. WOT can add reputations also to web search results, Digg, Gmail, Wikipedia, and other selected sites.&quot; -Against Intuition, Inc.

&quot;This of course preserves your privacy to great extent&quot; - Anonymous

==== CookieSafe ====

&quot;This extension will allow you to easily control cookie permissions. It will appear on your statusbar. Just click on the icon to allow, block, or temporarily allow the site to set cookies. You can also view or clear the cookies and exceptions by right clicking on the statusbar icon. For safer browsing you may choose to deny cookies globally and then enable them on a per site basis.&quot; -Ron Beckman

&lt;big&gt;'''Partial Breast Irradiation'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Anatomical studies==
*Rationale for APBI is that majority of local recurrences occur in close proximity to tumor bed, and &lt;20% appear &quot;elsewhere&quot; in the breast. Absolute number of &quot;elsewhere&quot; failures is quite low (&lt;&lt;1% per year) and is similar to rate of new contralateral tumors

*'''Holland''' - Classic paper that justified the need for whole breast RT. Evaluated mastectomy specimens. 42% of extensive intraductal component (EIC) negative breasts had residual carcinoma; 74% of EIC+ had residual carcinoma. Most carcinoma was intraductal type.  Most tumors were large and clinically detected.
*:PMID 2153190 &amp;mdash; &quot;The presence of an extensive intraductal component following a limited excision correlates with prominent residual disease in the remainder of the breast.&quot; Holland et al., 1990.

*'''Vaidya''' - A paper that paradoxically justified the rationale for partial breast irradiation. Multicentric foci were plotted in an abstract 3-D space and the conclusion was that although 63% (same result as Holland) of otherwise occult cancers were present in mastectomy specimens, over 79% of them were in other quadrants. This was in contrast with the results of breast conserving surgery trials in which early local recurrence occurred most commonly (&gt;90%) of the time in the area around the primary tumor, thus justifying the approach of TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy [[http://www.targit.org.uk TARGIT]]
*:PMID 8795588 &amp;mdash; &quot;Multicentricity of breast cancer: whole-organ analysis and clinical implications.&quot; Vaidya JS, Vyas JJ, Chinoy RF, Merchant N, Sharma OP, Mittra I. 1996.

**PMID 8630874  &amp;mdash; &quot;Intraductal extension of primary invasive breast carcinoma treated by breast-conservative surgery. Computer graphic three-dimensional reconstruction of the mammary duct-lobular systems.&quot; Ohtake et al. 1995.
**:20 pts studied, all had quadrantectomy. Ductal anastomoses are present, and may be a risk for spread to other ductal-lobular systems.  Maximum distance of spread, 11.9 mm.

*:Median extension of intraductal component 9 mm. Related to patient age, with older patients having less extension.

==Dosimetry==
*'''MD Anderson; 2012''' PMID 22884255 -- &quot;A new paradigm for calculating skin dose.&quot; (Gifford KA, Brachytherapy. 2012 Aug 8. [Epub ahead of print])
**Evaluation of skin volumetric models. Literature review showed average breast epidermal thickness 1.68 mm. Clinical plan developed with 2 mm skin contour, as contraction of the external surface contour, to estimate epidermis thickness. Second plan 5 mm expansion of the external contour
**Outcome: median difference for Dmax (01. cc) skin -2 mm vs skin +2 mm was 12% (SS), maximum was 24% (SS)
**Conclusion: Surface model for skin may underestimate dose delivered to epidermis by as much as 24%

**Dose homogeneity index defined as DHI = [V(TDR)-V(HDR)]/V(TDR), where V(TDR) denotes the total treatment volume enclosed by the prescribed treatment dose rate (TDR) and V(HDR) denotes the volume enclosed by high-dose rate (HDR), which is 1.5 X TDR or greater. Also can be written as (V100% - V150%)/V100%

**Meta-analysis. 3 trials with 1,140 patients. 
**Outcome: No difference in OS (OR 0.9, NS), DM (OR 0.7, NS), or SCV recurrences (OR 1.4, NS). However, PBI increased risk of local recurrence (OR 2.1, SS), and axillary recurrence (OR 3.4, SS) compared with whole breast RT
**Conclusion: PBI doesn't jeopardize survival but issue of locoregional recurrence needs to be addressed
**Letter to editor (Polgar C, PMID 20127229): Inappropriate to include the 2 &quot;old&quot; British trials using inadequate patient selections criteria

===Retrospective===
*'''Medicare claims analysis''' (MDACC) (2000-2007)
**Review of medicare claims; patients &gt; age 66 with invasive breast cancer diagnosed 2000-2007, treated with surgery followed by standard whole-breast irradiation (WBI) or accelerated partial breast brachytherapy (APBI)
**'''2011''' Abstract only: No PMID [http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs11/view.php?nu=SABCS11L_814 Abstract] San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium 2011; Abstract #S2-1 &quot;Partial Breast Brachytherapy Is Associated with Inferior Effectiveness and Increased Toxicity Compared with Whole Breast Irradiation in Older Patients.&quot; (Smith GL, Dec 7, 2011)
***Use of APBI-brachytherapy increased over time: from &lt;1% in 2000 to 13% of patients in 2007. At 5 yrs, cumulative incidence of subsequent mastectomy was significantly higher: 4.0% (APBI) vs 2.2% (WBI); HR = 2.14. Higher risk of hospitalization: 9.6% v 5.7% (O.R. 1.71), infection: 8.1% vs 4.5% (O.R. 1.85); rib fracture 4.2% vs. 3.6%; fat necrosis 9.1% vs. 3.7%; breast pain 14.9% vs. 11.7%.  Lower incidence of pneumonitis: 0.1% vs. 0.8%.
***Conclusion: APBI-brachy was associated with inferior effectiveness (as evidenced by increased utilization of mastectomy) as well as increased acute and late toxicities compared with WBI.

[Epub ahead of print])
**Phase II. 53 patients, age &amp;ge; 48, IDC, &lt;3 cm, cN0. Ultrasound driven treatment to select electron energy and cone size, target tumor + 1.5-2.0 cm circumferential margin and +1.0 cm deep margin. Dose 15 Gy electrons prior to segmental mastecomy. Additional WBRT in 20%. Median F/U 3.1 years (minimum 1 year)
**Toxicity: &quot;Good or excellent&quot; RTOG cosmesis physician 80%, patient 76%. Grade 1-2 acute toxicity 6%, no Grade 3-4 toxicities
**Conclusion: RT delivered to in-situ tumor feasible, with acceptable acute tolerance

==APBI-Intraoperative RT==
===Randomized===
*'''ELIOT''' (2000-2007) -- IORT 21/1 vs WBRT 50 Gy + 10 Gy boost
**Randomized, equivalence trial. Italian. 1305 patients, age 48-75, tumor &lt;= 2.5 cm, eligible for breast conserving therapy
***Patients received either intraoperative radiotherapy (21 Gy in 1 fraction) or whole breast radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions plus a 10 Gy boost)
**'''2010''' PMID 24225155 -- &quot;Intraoperative radiotherapy versus external radiotherapy for early breast cancer (ELIOT): a randomised controlled equivalence trial&quot; (Veronesi Lancet Oncol. 2013 Dec;14(13):1269-77.)
***Outcome: 5-year IBTR was 4.4% with IORT versus 0.4% with WBRT (HR was 9.3). 5-year OS was similar (96.8% with IORT and 96.9% with WBRT). 
***Toxicity: Lower skin toxicity with IORT
***Conclusion: Although the rate of IBTR with IORT was within the prespecified equivalence margin, the rate was significantly greater than with WBRT. Improved selection of patients could reduce the rate of IBTR with intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons.
*'''TARGIT-A''' (2000-2012) -- IORT 20/1 vs WBRT 40-56 Gy
**Randomized, non-inferiority. 11 countries. 3451 patients, age &amp;ge; 45 (median age 63, &amp;ge; 70 in 15%), IDC (ILC excluded), unifocal, breast-conserving surgery + SNB/ALND. Mostly T1 (86%), N0 (83%), and low/intermediate grade (84%). Allowed entry prior to surgical pathology results(66%) or post pathology results (34%). Arm 1) Intra-op RT with Intrabeam 50 kV device 20 Gy at surface vs Arm 2) WBRT (as per each individual center, typically 40-56 Gy with/without boost 10-16 Gy). Postop RT for predefined factors (e.g. LCIS, EIC, N+, LVI+ or others pre-defined per each individual center) done as WBRT without boost (a prior expected rate 15%, actual rate 15.2%). Primary endpoint local recurrence. Non-inferiority 2.5% absolute difference in LR.

***Outcome: 4-year LF IORT 1.2% vs WBRT 0.95% (NS)
***Toxicity: Major toxicity (including skin breakdown) IORT 3.3% vs WBRT 3.9% (NS); Grade 3-4 toxicity 0.5% vs 2.1% (SS)
***Conclusion: For select patients, single dose IORT should be considered an alternative to EBRT
***Criticisms: PMID 21060332, PMID 20888981, PMID 20888982  -- Median f/u only 2 years (not directly stated in manuscript but inferred from figures), premature to draw conclusions from only 11 events in 2232 patients, 21% in APBI arm received mastectomy or WBRT, delivered only 5-7 Gy at 1cm from radiation source

***Outcome: 5-year LF TARGIT 3.3% versus EBRT 1.3% (p=0.04, NS). If concurrent with lumpectomy, 2.1% versus 1.1% (p=0.3, NS); if delayed after lumpectomy 5.4% versus 1.7% (p=0.07, NS but larger than the non-inferiority margin).

Analysis restricted to the patients randomised in the first 8 years of the trial - these patients had a median follow up of 5 years - had given the same results and met the non-inferiority criteria. The authors pointed out that although recurrences may occur after 5 years, the effect of radiation on local recurrence is only in the first 5 years and most of this is seen in the first 2-3 years, the period very adequately covered by the follow up period as published.

===Outcomes===
*'''American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite Registry'''
**'''True recurrence; 2012''' PMID 22836556 -- &quot;Tumor bed control with balloon-based accelerated partial breast irradiation: incidence of true recurrences versus elsewhere failures in the American Society of Breast Surgery MammoSite(®) Registry Trial.&quot; (Beitsch PD, Ann Surg Oncol. 2012 Oct;19(10):3165-70. doi: 10.1245/s10434-012-2489-x. Epub 2012 Jul 27.)Randomized trials demonstrate that lumpectomy plus whole-breast irradiation (WBI) yields survival equivalent to mastectomy. Studies that use WBI, however, typically report higher tumor bed recurrence rates than elsewhere failures (EF) (historically considered new primary lesions). The rate of true recurrence (TR) versus EF was queried for a large patient cohort treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).
***Registry trial. 1449 cases, lumpectomy with MammoSite APBI (34/10 BID). Invasive 87%, DCIS 13%. Comparison of true recurrence (TF) versus elsewhere failure (EF). Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: IBTR 3.5%; 5-year invasive IBTR 3.6%, DCIS 3.4%. True recurrence 1.1% versus elsewhere failure 2.6%. ER- status associated with increased risk of IBTR and EF. No pathologic factors associated with TF
***Conclusion: IBTR after balloon-based APBI is low, and similar (and potentially better) than whole breast irradiation

***24 patients, Stage I, treated with proton 3D-CPBI. Treatment plans also generated using photon-electron 3D-CPBI. PTV and prescribed dose held constant. 
***Outcome: PTV coverage: 95% received &gt;90% of prescribed dose in all cases. Only one case &gt;10% inhomogeneity. Significantly better volume of nontarget breast, lung, and heart for proton plans
***Conclusion: Proton 3D-CPBI significantly reduces volume of irradiaated nontarget breast tissue

***Retrospective. 25 patients. Tumor &lt;=2 cm, N0. Proton 3D-CPBI 32 CGE/8 fractions BID over 4 days. 1-3 beams. 
***Dosimetry: Median PTV receiving &gt;95% prescribed dose 100%. Dose inhomogeneity &gt;10% in 1 patient (4%). Median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of prescribed dose 23%. Median lung receiving 20 CGE 0%, 10 CGE 1%, 5 CGE 2%
***Cost-analysis: modestly more expensive (25%) than whole breast RT
***Conclusion: Technically feasible, excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing

===Economics===

**Markov model simulation, 55 year old patient with left-sided BCA
**Outcome: Euro 67,000 cost per QALY gained; better if high risk cardiac patients treated
**Conclusion: Proton therapy for BCA can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen

==Outcomes by patient subgroups==

*'''William Beaumont; 2011''' (1993-2010) PMID 21640491 -- &quot;Clinical outcomes using accelerated partial breast irradiation in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma.&quot; (Shah C, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Nov 15;81(4):e547-51.)
**16 pts with ILC; compared with 410 pts with IDC. APBI technique was interstitial LDR or HDR, balloon, or 3D conformal. 
**Median f/u 3.8 yrs for ILC pts, 6.0 yrs for IDC. ILC pts were more likely to have positive margins (20% vs 3.9%), larger tumors (1.4 cm vs 1.1 cm), less likely to be N+ (0% vs 9.5%) than pts with IDC. 5-yr LR was 0% for ILC and 2.5% for IDC. No differences in regional recurrence, DM, DFS, or OS.
**Conclusion: &quot;Women with ILC had excellent clinical outcomes after APBI. No difference in local control was seen between patients with invasive lobular versus invasive ductal histology.&quot;

**&quot;The authors expressly discourage the routine use of APBI outside clinical trials. Until definite results show that APBI neither impairs therapeutic outcome nor cosmetic results, WBRT remains the gold standard in the treatment of early breast cancer&quot;
**Update (2009) PMID 19806329: &quot;DEGRO expert panel recommends to refrain from APBI outside prospective studies as this would not only jeopardize the completion of the necessary clinical trials but also neglect the lack of data that are mature enough to permit definitive conclusions regarding long term tumor control, overall survival and cosmetic outcome of thousands of women&quot;

***Retrospective. 3 patients treated with HDR APB. 34/10. Implants evaluated. Phantom study performed.
***Dosimetry: Minimal balloon-device distance 10.9 cm, 18.4 cm, and 4.3 cm. Graph developed correlating dose to distance. To meet 2 Gy cummulative dose, minimum distance depended on fill volume: 35 cc - 10.5 cm, 60 cc - 12 cm, 80 cc - 12.5 cm, 100 cc - 13 cm, and 125 cc - 14 cm 
***Conclusion: The proposed distance-dose graph and/or table enable to approximately predict the maximal device dose based on the measurement of minimal distance between lumpectomy and the device before balloon implantation for the suitability of balloon HDR brachytherapy

      <text xml:space="preserve">It would be useful to include what kind of [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pot or pan]] to use for baking this, because I for example was wondering and didn't know.

== Terrible! ==

This is the worst-written of the three Meatloaf recipes.  For example:

&quot;Drain off grease when brown 10-20 minutes.&quot; What does that even mean?  And then there's &quot;Bake until done.&quot;  Is this a joke?

When the writing's not just plain bad, it's still pretty obtuse.  Anbody feel like taking a crack at fixing it?

--------------------------
Just a little bit of chili or some jalapenos make any meatloaf excellent. (I would add a recipe but, why bother, chili makes everything perfect, and those who noticed it will add it anyways.)
Or instead of worcestershire sauce, use habanero tabasco. A teaspoon will be enough for a little bit of spice.</text>

VAU! Mitäs siihen sanot, jos mä tätä tästä alan muokata tällai? Just muuten viime viikolla yksi BSCW:ssä oleva opiskelija ehdotti, että olisi hyvä jos meidän alalle sais tällaisen Wikipedia-tyyppisen avoimen tieto- ja hakuteoksen.

Täähän sujuu kuin tanssi.

No juu, niin sujuu. Tätähän voisi ihan testikäyttää jollain kurssilla. Periaatteessahan tänne voi joku eksyä ja laittaa spämmejään, mutta ehkä se ei ole todennköistä.

Niin, tämä voisi toimia keskustelualustana ainakin. Vaikka mitään ketjuja tähän kyllä ei saa muodostettua. Saako tähän lisättyä liitetiedostoja jotenkin? Edelleen olen eniten mua kiinnostaa just nyt sellainen väline, jolla voisi tehdä tutkimusyhteistyötä. Oonko tylsä, jos olen sitä mieltä, että tämä ei taida toimia ihan juuri sellaisena....Mutta johonkin juttuun tämä varmasti käy. En aio ruveta vielä teknopessimistiksi.

I would further categorize the stocks into '''Value''' &amp; '''Growth''', but the decision to allocate these investments are very subjective, and in regard to a mutual fund the decision ultimately rests with the mutual fund manager to determine. Also common among mutual funds what is considered to be large-cap growth can actally have an allocation of 40% small-cap value and 60% large-cap growth and still be considered &quot;Large-Cap Growth&quot;  thus defining and analyzing would succumb to an individual selection basis, which the investor can do by himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Goal / Purpose== To provide investors in regard to specific asset catagories if applicable: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_risk Default Risk], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return#Average_Annual_Rate_of_Return Average Annual Rate of Return], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Deviation Standard Deviation],  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_coefficient Average Beta] of those Returns for a 5, 10, &amp; 20 year time frame (full market cycle) and corresponding  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_%28economics%29 Indices]. Over all it is to help simplify an overly complex system.

==Target Audience==
Investors that wish to diversify thier portfolio using either [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_investing passive] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_investing active investing] approach.
==Information Benefit==
Even though I am getting very specific about the maturity for fix income based on a 5, 10, &amp; 20 year scale. I would like the data set to be based on 20 years or more thus a full market cycle. As a result the need to update this information will not be necessary. In regards to the subjectivity of rates and other variable, it will have minimal inpact due to the longer time scale that is use for historic return based on each asset class.

==Factors Impact==
*Factors such as management fees, stock selection and market timing do have an impact upon one's portfolio but more in a negative way than a positive way. [http://www.investmentadvisor.com/issues/2003_12/special_report/2553-1.html Market Timing’s Flaw] by '''Larry Swedroe''' [http://www.investmentadvisor.com/issues/2004_03/news_comment/2995-1.html The Evidence on Timing] by '''Larry Swedroe'''

==Topics that should not be in the article==
*Different ways to allocate portfolio or techniques use based on some formula i.e. age.
*Asset allocation rules, however an appropriate link is applicable. 
*Not an article about stress or stomach acid test.
==Topics that should be in the article==
*How to determine an appropriate benchmark and type of benchmark, should be brief and concise.
*Numerical in nature thus a data set that can be used by an informed investor.

===Links===
Maybe the links to wikipedia should be trimmed back a bit.  Just about every time a dollar sign appears it is linked to wikipedia.  This seems excessive, and i think it is a breach of policy.  Those that stay should probaly be formetted in the form W: and then the name of the page on wikipedia. [[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 10:55, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

=Where To Start? With Nothing!=

Clear your mind and assume nothing.  When you achieve this blank state you have arrived at the starting point for Mathematics:  the big Nothing (with a capital &quot;N&quot;).  To move on from Nothing using the Language of Mathematics we will need  a framework to build on.  The framework we need has to allow us to expand the reach of the language as we go.  To find such a framework Mathematics looks to the world of Logic.

==A Brief Glimpse of Logic==

&lt;div id=&quot;reflogic&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;First, a description of Logic&lt;sup&gt;[[#ftntlogic|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Logic] is most often said to be the study of arguments, although the exact definition of logic is a matter of controversy among philosophers. [The task] of the logician is the same: to advance an account of valid and fallacious inference to allow one to distinguish good from bad arguments.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this description it is clear that a solid system of logic requires arguments to work with.  A &lt;b&gt;Logical Argument&lt;b&gt; is the ordered process of going from some definitions to reaching a conclusion.  Obviously you can't have an argument (or reach a conclusion!) without something to argue over.  A &lt;b&gt;Definition&lt;/b&gt; is a simple statement and can form the basis for an argument. A &lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; is the endpoint of an argument.  A useful argument results in a conclusion which tells us something about the original definitions.

An Example is in order:
* &lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; Something which has water on it is wet.
* &lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; Something not protected from the rain gets water on it.
* &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Something not protected from the rain gets wet.

These three statements make up a logical argument.  Using the conclusion from this logical argument, we can now identify the things around us in jeopardy of getting wet the next time it rains.  The couch in the house is safe; the trees outside are not.  Notice that the conclusion comes directly from the definitions -- for this example there is no &lt;b&gt;Body&lt;/b&gt; to the Argument.

Thinking deeper about this argument it becomes clear that we jumped into the middle of something.  You could ask:  What is Rain?  What is Water?  What is a &quot;Something&quot;?  

Obviously there are a lot of logical arguments which could have preceded this one.  For example, we could define Water as a collection of molecules with the chemical formula of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and define rain as a collection of collections of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. An argument relating rain to water can then be made.

But then what is a Molecule?  Again, we could define a Molecule as a collection of atoms.  Still, what is an Atom?  For that matter, what is a Collection??  It quickly becomes obvious why philosophers spend so much time quietly thinking to themselves.

Fortunately we're thinking about Mathematics, not the Meaning of Existence (which can easily take a lifetime&lt;sup&gt;[[#ftntphil|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;).  Remember that a useful logical argument results in a conclusion which tells us something about the original definitions.  In our example above we discovered that we can combine the two definitions into a more compact form as the conclusion.  In this case, it's hard to say that the conclusion is much more useful than the definitions.  However, some logical arguments can take many, many definitions and arrive at a simple conclusion which itself becomes tremendously useful.  This is called &lt;b&gt;Reduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[#ftntreduc|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;.  Reduction will be the first goal of our Mathematics framework.

==Starting The Framework For Mathematics==

Time to start building!  Since the starting point is Nothing there can be no arguments.  We need a definition!

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; An &lt;b&gt;Object&lt;/b&gt; is something that can be described.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Any logical argument leading to this (as a conclusion) we will disregard as being in the realm of pure Philosophy.  We will also assert (not assume!) this definition is true.  Consider the previous assertion of truth carefully!  The implication is powerful:  from the very beginning Mathematics ceases to be tangible.  With this definition we can say &quot;The Universe is an Object&quot; or &quot;Emptiness is an Object&quot; or &quot;Words are Objects&quot;; indeed, even a Thought, a Color, a Feeling, or even Something That Has Not Been Discovered is an object! Ahhh, the freedom!  No boundaries!  If this fundamental definition is preserved (and it will be) our Mathematical Framework will have tremendous reach and breadth.

Wait! There is one problem -- our definition is written in words, specifically English, and we don't want to be limited as to who can understand or use this definition.  There are concepts in other languages as well as things undiscovered which we want to include in the realm of Mathematics.  To keep the limitation of language from putting boundaries on the framework, symbols are used in place of words. For now, we will use lowercase English letters to represent objects.  Remember, they are symbols in Mathematics, not letters.  Letters have sound; symbols do not.  &lt;b&gt;Symbols&lt;/b&gt; can represent any Object as defined above.  We can now add a definition to our framework:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; A &lt;b&gt;Symbol&lt;/b&gt; is a written character.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Next comes a decision on how to use Symbols which brings up another problem:  there are not nearly (not even close) to enough symbols to give every Object its own symbol.  Adding to the problem is the confusion caused in other people if symbols are assigned to objects.  Other people will have to know what each symbol specifically represents, which means creating a gigantic Symbol Dictionary.  The Symbol Dictionary would have to be updated every time a new object is found, created, or considered.  That is no good!

To solve the problem of Symbols, we add the following definition to our framework:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; A &lt;b&gt;Variable&lt;/b&gt; is a Symbol which represents a property of some object(s).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Whew!!  Our Dictionary just got much, much smaller.  Reality requires us to have at least some symbols that are specifically defined and universal -- those situations are not far away.  However, any symbol that does not have such a concrete definition can be used as a variable.  The key point of the definition of a variable is &quot;represents a property&quot;.  Fortunately this definition is wide open since &quot;represents a property&quot; is not a restrictive phrase.  Success!! Our language is universal AND our freedom has returned.

Putting the previous definitions to use we can now define a variable:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let β (the Greek letter Beta) represent an object with two and only two wheels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This statement does not require us to state exactly what object with two and only two wheels is represented by β.  In  fact, an object satisfying β does not even have to exist.  But now we can tell what objects β could be.  For example, β could be a bicycle, but not a car.  β could be a motorcycle but not a motorboat.  Notice the definition of β allows us to separate all objects into two groups of objects:  one group which satisfies the conditions of β and another group which does not.  This leads us to our next definition:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; A &lt;b&gt;Set&lt;/b&gt; is a group of objects with one or more common properties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Sets are vitally important in Mathematics.  If you are not confident in how this definition was reached it is probably well worth your time to review some of the previous definitions for clarification!  Sets are so important and occur so frequently in Mathematics they require universal symbols to represent them.  For a Set, the universal symbols include the left and right curly braces used as follows:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; The Set &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; contains all objects represented by variable β.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(Almost) Mathematical Notation:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is the same as {β} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
  
The Mathematical Notation is not pure -- it is &quot;Almost&quot; because it contains English words.  Let's fix that immediately!
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Equivalence&lt;/b&gt; means two symbols represent the same value, state, or are the same thing.  Another common term for this condition is &lt;b&gt;Equal&lt;/b&gt;.  In Mathematics, the symbol = represents Exact Equivalence. Let's look at this more closely. Since &quot;equivalence&quot; can refer to the &quot;state or condition&quot; two boxes containing three items in each could be considered &quot;equivalent&quot;. However, if the three items are not the same kinds of things, say three cats in one and three dogs in the other, they are not &quot;equal&quot;. For them to be equal, they must be exactly the same. This concept is recurrent in more advanced mathematical structures. This distinction is made now to avoid future confusion the student might have. Many students get the impression that mathematics in not consistent and contradictory when they have such an experience. Keep in mind that people sometimes take shortcuts when explaining material or are so caught up in the explanation at hand that things slip their mind. This is human nature and should be forgiven since perfection seldom exists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In our (Almost) Mathematical Notation for Set &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; above, the phrase &quot;is the same as&quot; shows equivalence.  Therefore, we can write the condition in pure Mathematical Language:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; = {β} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Hopefully your mind hears &quot;&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is a Set of all objects that satisfy the conditions of the variable β&quot;.  It is common in Mathematical literature to use uppercase English letters as symbols for Sets, and lowercase English letters as symbols for variables.  Also, it is common for the Set symbol to be the uppercase equivalent of the Variable symbol.  We will follow these conventions from this point forward.

Example:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; = {a}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

How did your mind hear that line?  It is significant to note that Variable a has never been defined, yet we understand the concept of what is represented by the line above.  It is important to understand that the line above also has not validated any of our previous definitions.  This is a small taste of a special power of Mathematics:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Generalization&lt;/b&gt; is the ability of Mathematics to specify behaviors and relationships for a broad variety of objects without actually defining what the objects are.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

There are not enough tools in our framework at this time to exploit Generalization completely.  But we will eventually!  For now, here's the definition of another set:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; = {p}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This is an &lt;b&gt;abstract&lt;/b&gt; Set, since we do not know what the Variable p represents.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Q&lt;/b&gt; = {q: &lt;s&gt;all words&lt;/s&gt;  any word that starts with 'm'}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This is a &lt;b&gt;concrete&lt;/b&gt; Set since a definition of Variable q is given.  A new universal symbol has been presented here.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Definition:&lt;/i&gt; In the notation for a Set, a colon (:) is used to represent the phrase &quot;is defined as&quot;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Using this definition, the Mathematical Language given above for Set Q reads &quot;Q is a Set of all objects that satisfy the conditions of the variable q which is defined as &lt;s&gt;all words that start&lt;/s&gt; any word that starts with 'm'&quot;.

There is an additional way to specify a Set when there are a specific group of objects contained within it.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; = {x: a donkey, a mushroom, a glass of water, a cloud}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

There is NO spoken phrase for Variable x that correctly describes these objects in terms of a common or shared property.  Nonetheless, this is a valid Mathematical Set.  Again this demonstrates the ability of Mathematics to express concepts that formal written language cannot describe.  This also demonstrates a small piece of the power of Mathematics which we will put to great use as we move forward.


&lt;!-- Defines a set, then set operators --&gt;

For college level math, it is necessary to become somewhat familiar with Greek as well as Latin letters (which is what the English alphabet is derived from), as both are used as Mathematical symbols.  When learning new concepts, anxieties can be reduced if the symbols, at least, are familiar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating Block images ==

I see that you are going through the effort of having to create a whole bunch of images for this little project you are working on.

I have a suggestion:  Why don't you try to use the HTML tables instead to create this content.

For example:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|}

was created using the following table instructions

&lt;pre&gt;
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
!width=&quot;25&quot; |
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|-
| height=&quot;25&quot; bgcolor=red| || bgcolor=white| || bgcolor=white| 
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can obviously be extended, and you can also change the colors.  I hope this would be useful to you.  More information about creating tables can be found at [[meta:Help:Table]].  I think this would save you a bunch of time.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:11, 26 January 2006 (UTC)



Good idea.

== Overview ==

'''''Obliviate''''' is the verbal component of the Memory Charm, a spell which allows the erasure or modification of memory.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

First seen when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]] attempted to use it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], this spell, when done correctly, apparently allows a substantial amount of control over the subject's memories. We see it used a number of times through the series. The most prominent times are:

* as mentioned above, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], when Gilderoy Lockhart attempts to cast it on Ron and Harry so as to allow him to claim to have defeated the Monster in the Chamber. In this case, he is using a broken wand, which backfires; as a result, afterwards he is barely able to remember his own name.
* in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], when the Muggle keeper of the campground has his memory changed so that he forgets the odd magical things that he has seen the occupants of his campground doing.
* in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] casts it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]] so that she forgets that there were previous meetings of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]].
* in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] casts this spell on a pair of Death Eaters and an innocent waitress so that they will not recall having seen Harry.  She [[Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Deathly_Hallows/Chapter_21|later]] uses it against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] to make him forget the presence of Ron Weasley.

Like so many spells, a large part of the effect of this spell very likely depends on what the caster is thinking at the time the spell is cast. Presumably the caster must hold in their mind a representation of the memories needed to be changed, along with what the memories should be changed to.

== Analysis ==

Apparently, this spell is most often used to clean up any 'spillage' in front of Muggles. The International Statute of Wizardry is specifically designed to try and keep the Muggles unaware of the Wizarding world, so this spell is apparently reasonably often used on Muggles to keep them unaware of what the wizards have been doing.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# Is there a way to reverse the effect of this spell?

== Naming policy==
You might want to read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. Using slash convention has cerain benefits to your book:
* table of contents is simplier: if you write &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Introduction/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[German Tax Law]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; page, you will get link to &lt;tt&gt;German Tax Law/Introduction&lt;/tt&gt;
* on &lt;tt&gt;German Tax Law/Introduction&lt;/tt&gt; page our software will automatically generate link to main book page, &lt;tt&gt;German Tax Law&lt;/tt&gt;
* see [[Chess]], our [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|Book of the month]] for an example of use of slash convention

The English word ''algol'' comes from Arabic al ghûl. The Arabian ghoul is a desert-dwelling, shape-shifting demon that robs graves and feeds on the dead. Ghouls lure travelers into the desert wastes to devour them.  The star Beta Persei, commonly known as Algol, is named after this creature.  All things considered, an appropriate name for a progamming language.

== Overview ==

'''Professor Quirinus Quirrell''' taught [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|first year]]. His class was held on the third floor of the castle, right in the Great Foyer near the Gryffindor tower. 

Quirrell's wand is alder and unicorn hair. He is a Half-blood, and his birthday is 26 September. As a Hogwarts student, he was sorted into Ravenclaw. Quirrell never married or had children.

=== Notes on his Name ===

Professor Quirrell is never given a first name in the books, in the film, or in the video game. He does appear in two other places:

* A Wizards of the Coast trading card game based on the series included a card of Quirrell with the first name Quirinus. The Harry Potter Lexicon site states, however, that [http://www.hp-lexicon.org/help/tcg.html &quot;these cards are not canon&quot;]

* Master Foods produced a line of Chocolate Frog treats with collectable Famous Wizards cards; Quirrel being given the first name Slatero. J. K. Rowling states [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=96 that she wrote the information on those cards].

J. K. Rowling has confirmed, in ''Pottermore'', that Quirrell's first name is, indeed, Quirinus.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

A very timid person, Professor Quirrell first appears in the Leaky Cauldron, where he is pleased to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] comments at the time that he always seems nervous, ever since he took a year's holiday and met up with something he had been teaching about.

At the Arrival Feast, Harry notes that Quirrell looks rather odd, wearing a large purple turban on his head. It is while Professor Quirrell is speaking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] that Harry first feels the searing pain in his scar that becomes his companion, on and off, for the nearly all the seven years in this series.

Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] get into trouble with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] on the very first day of classes, when they are found trying to get through a locked door, which turns out to be the door to the forbidden third floor corridor. They are saved from being locked in the dungeons by Professor Quirrell, who happens to be passing by.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], Professor Quirrell says that his strange purple turban was a gift from an African prince for dealing with a troublesome zombie. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]] asked excitedly how he had fought the zombie, Quirrell turned all pink and started talking about the weather. (Note: this is the only mention of &quot;zombies&quot; in the series, and thus is highly suspect. The magical construct most closely allied to the Muggle concept of zombies is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferius]].) There is also a strange smell of garlic that hangs about the classroom; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Weasley twins]] insist that it is because Quirrell has stuffed his turban full of garlic to ward off [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Vampire|vampires]].

We don't hear much about his teaching, except that it is not as interesting as Harry and the rest of his class had expected; we do find out that he is concealing something, and that he and Professor Snape may both be looking for something, possibly the mysterious little package that Hagrid removed from Gringotts. 

He bursts into the Hallowe'en feast warning that a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|troll]] is in the dungeons; Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] defeat it and save [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], thus bonding the three.

At the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] match of the year, against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]], Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broom]] is jinxed and tries to buck him off. Hermione and Ron believe Snape is casting the jinx. In her haste to reach Snape and set his robes on fire to break his concentration, Hermione knocks over Quirrell.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|The Weasley twins]] charmed several snowballs to bounce off the back of Profesor Quirrell's turban, in the snowfall during Christmas break.

Harry overhears Quirrell arguing with Snape about where his loyalties lie, and later hears him arguing with someone else about something he does not want to do.

At the conclusion, Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass through a series of chambers to find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]. One chamber contains a Troll, who fortunately has been knocked out. Harry alone reaches the final chamber, where he finds Quirrell. Quirrell boasts about his skill with trolls, admitting that he let the one troll into the school at Hallowe'en, and that it was his troll that Harry passed. He also says that Snape had been useful as misdirection, &quot;flapping about like a great bat.&quot; Quirrell has been trying to kill Harry all year; Quirrell also jinxed Harry's broom during the Quidditch match against Slytherin, and Snape was attempting to counter the jinx. Quirrell's turban actually conceals [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] face that is attached to Quirrell's head, and Voldemort has been controlling Quirrell all year. Ordered to kill Harry, Quirrell is unable to touch him without getting burned; when Quirrell is preparing a killing curse, Harry grabs his face, causing him so much pain that he is disabled. Harry is also in much pain from his scar, triggered by Voldemort's nearness, and it causes him to pass out.

It is uncertain whether Quirrell actually dies here; it is suggested that he does, but while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] does explain much of what happened, he never actually states that Quirrell is dead.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Expounding to the Death Eaters as to what had occurred while he was disembodied, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] describes his stay on the back of Quirrell's head. He mentions that &quot;The servant died when I left his body&quot;. Though Voldemort never names Quirrell, referring to him always as his &quot;servant&quot;, context makes it certain that this refers to Quirrell.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Before the school year starts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discuss the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. While running down the list of Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers Ron and Harry have known, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]] mention &quot;one died,&quot; which could only be Quirrell.

In her first Defence Against the Dark Arts class of the year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] states that Quirrell was the only Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher that was up to standards for the Ministry. Harry gets into trouble for pointing out that he had Voldemort stuck to the back of his head.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

To convince [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] that Hogwarts is safe from Death Eaters, Harry tells him that Professor Quirrell is the only teacher who has died at Hogwarts. (This is not strictly true, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] clearly died at the school, though as it was of natural causes it likely would not concern Slughorn either way. It is true that Quirrell's death is the only one Harry knows of that could be attributed to Voldemort or his organization.)

== Strengths ==

Rather than magical ability, Quirrell's greatest strength was probably his intelligence, evidenced by his having been sorted into Ravenclaw House at Hogwarts, home to more intellectual students. Although timid in nature, he apparently had an adventurous spirit, traveling to many foreign countries whenever he could. 

Quirrell, during the course of the first book, had been carrying what remained of Lord Voldemort on the back of his head. As such, he could partially utilize Voldemort's powers: for instance, Voldemort being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimens]], could inspect other wizards' minds and communicate what he found to Quirrell.

== Weaknesses ==

Quirrell possessed an extremely timid and nervous disposition. And though intelligent, his magical powers may have been rather ordinary. This may all have contributed to his becoming susceptible to Lord Voldemort's powers, resulting in the disembodied Dark Lord riding on the back of Quirrell's head while he attempted to resurrect his own physical body. As a result, Quirrell had to bow to Voldemort's commands, whatever they were, and was subject to any punishment Voldemort chose to mete out. As he was a relatively weak-willed wizard, Quirrell attempted to attain distinction by attaching himself to a powerful being, though that power instead latched itself onto him.

Quirrell was never seen performing magic, so it is uncertain how powerful a wizard he actually was. However, he was apparently able to control [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|Trolls]], and most likely had been able to before his encounter with Voldemort, as he seems proud of that ability.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

The closest relationship Quirrell appears to have had was the one with Lord Voldemort after being controlled by him. Quirrell was basically Voldemort's slave, doing his bidding without question. To help deflect suspicion from himself, Quirrell adopted a stammering, rather bumbling pose. He admits that Snape's fluttering about like a huge black bat and acting suspiciously was actually useful to him, allowing Quirrell to carry out Voldemort's commands while others were focused on Snape. Quirrell and Snape seem competitive with one another, and as Snape grew more suspicious about Quirrell's behavior, they seem to have been arguing frequently.

Though he was likely always shy and rather aloof, Quirrell's increasingly quirky manner and sudden stammering seems to have distanced others from him, while it also aroused Snape's distrust. It appears Quirrell never had any close relationships with the other teachers or students at Hogwarts.

== Analysis ==

Having been a Ravenclaw, Quirrell was obviously quite intelligent, but he appears to have been a rather ordinary wizard whose knowledge about magic and defensive arts may have been more academic than applied. Although Quirrell was commandeered by Voldemort, his lackluster distinction in life may have made him a somewhat cooperative accomplice, seeing this as an opportunity to obtain some significance and power. Unfortunately, he misjudged Voldemort's true intentions, failing to see that the Dark Lord considered him as little more than a disposable lackey. This ultimately cost Quirrell his life. 

According to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], speaking in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the Defence Against the Dark Arts teaching post is apparently jinxed. Ever since Voldemort had been declined the job many years before, no teacher has lasted more than one year in that post. One question that has been raised is, given that jinx, how could Quirrell have remained in that post for more than a year? According to the author, he had not. In an interview,&lt;!-- reference needed --&gt; Rowling stated that Quirrell had requested a transfer to that post, and had been studying the source material so he could teach it, when he encountered Voldemort in Albania.

All the same, there is some question raised on some fan sites as to how long Quirrell had been in that post. [http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-quirrells-leave.html One very well reasoned essay] suggests strongly that Quirrell's &quot;year-long tour&quot; in preparation for his teaching of Defence Against the Dark Arts was not the year before Harry entered the school, but at least one year prior to that time. The essay predates publication of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', and does not attempt to reconcile Quirrell's postulated at least two-year tenure with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20|Dumbledore's statement]] &quot;we have never been able to keep a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.&quot; We could attempt that reconciliation here, by suggesting that Quirrell was perhaps only filling in as Defence teacher during the year before Harry's arrival, while another, possibly chronically ill, teacher held the actual post. However, we consider it more likely that we are simply seeing one place where the author temporarily lost track of her timeline.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Likely you've never met another stutterer. You've never seen a book about stuttering in a bookstore. You may be the first stutterer that your speech-language pathologist has met. You might feel that you're the only person in the world with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your speech-language pathologist printed a webpage for you with the time and place of stuttering support group. You put it off the first month, but this month you drive there. You drive by the house. You see a group of people in the living room. You sit in your car, not sure if you have the courage to walk into the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's back up to how you find a stuttering support group. The [http://www.nsastutter.org/ National Stuttering Association](http://www.nsastutter.org/) (800 364-1677) has more than 70 local support groups across the United States. Many stutterers say that the annual NSA convention is the best experience of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speak Easy International has stuttering support groups in the New York-New Jersey area. Call Bob Gathman, at (201) 262-0895.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [http://www.friendswhostutter.org/ National Association of Young People Who Stutter](http://www.friendswhostutter.org/) (866 866-8335) has support groups for children and teenagers who stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many speech clinics have their own stuttering support groups. These are often for practicing therapy. Practicing in a group is better than practicing alone because we learn best by seeing other people make mistakes and then improving. In contrast, seeing a speech-language pathologist (who likely doesn't stutter) perfectly executing a speech motor skill can make you feel like she has a gift you'll never have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're outside the United States, find a stuttering support organization in your country by visiting the [http://www.stutterisa.org International Stuttering Association] (http://www.stutterisa.org) website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the online support groups. [http://groups.yahoo.com/ Yahoo Groups] lists more than seventy stuttering e-mail lists, the most prominent and largest of these is [http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/stutteringchat Stuttering Chat], which has over 3000 members. The Usenet discussion group is [news:alt.support.stuttering alt.support.stuttering].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online support groups tend to be a few individuals who do 90% of the chatting, and hundreds of people who don't write anything. I remember when one individual used several e-mail addresses and fake names to have long arguments with himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Benefits of Support Groups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A support group will help you learn what works for other people. You'll get feedback on what you're doing. A group of people will generate new ideas that no individual would have thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a support group, you'll find that you've solved problems that other people face. Other people may have solved problems you face. Stuttering will no longer seem like one big problem, but rather will become a set of small problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A support group improves your emotional state. Hearing other people's experiences improves your perspective. Your setbacks don't seem so bad. Sharing positive experiences makes everyone in the group feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you feel frustrated or depressed, you have no idea what to do. Talking to individuals who've been in the same situation will help you see that you have choices (see the section [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Personal Construct Therapy|Personal Construct Therapy]]).&lt;/p&gt;

===Support Group Activities===

&lt;h4&gt;Talking About Your Stuttering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mild stutterers may be able to successfully hide stuttering, but listeners figure out that they're hiding something. Listeners may not know what the stutterer is hiding, but he'll come across as &amp;quot;phony&amp;quot; or dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listeners have a different message for severe stutterers. Severe stuttering disturbs listeners. They don't understand stuttering. They want to know if there's anything they can do to help you. But they're too polite to ask you about your disability. They want you to educate them. They don't want the proverbial &amp;quot;elephant in the living room&amp;quot; that no one will talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Disability Hierarchy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The least respected disabilities are non-physical and non-visible. Stutterers look normal, until we talk. Listeners feel shock seeing you go from normal behavior one moment to head jerks, facial spasms, stuck in repeating dysfluencies the next moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can move up the disability hierarchy. You can change your stuttering into a visible, non-physical disability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tell people that you stutter.&lt;/li&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, hiding your stuttering throws away the respect and support that people would otherwise give you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just about everything these days has a computer of some sorts in it. Your VCR, your car and even your washing machine or toaster may have a microcontroller or microcomputer in it to control it. These computer based systems are often referred to as Embedded Systems, because they have a computer embedded within something.
Programming embedded systems requires a different set of skills from standard PC programming, because you need to know a bit about the hardware (electronics and mechanical systems) that your program is running on or controlling. You often have to be very aware of what resources (such as memory, speed etc.) your program can use.
A large percentage of this work is done in C, using an operating system, but some requires assembly language. The subset named &quot;firmware&quot; will also include programming FPGA devices (Field Programmamble Gate Array).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The earliest versions of the Forth Programming Language (around 1970) ran on primitive minicomputers with no other OS or executive.  Systems at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's 11-meter radio telescope near Tucson, AZ, controlled precise movements of the telescope and dome as well as performing concurrent data acquisition and supporting analysis on a graphics terminal.

Mass storage (used for both program source and data) resided on 7- or 9-track magnetic tape, soon replaced by a drum and later by disks.  Mass storage was addressed in &quot;blocks&quot; (typically 1024 bytes), and a block number was a function of its physical location on the media.  This was an extremely simple and reliable approach.  The entire system, including drivers for disk and terminal, command line interpreter, resident compiler and assembler, multitasker, and applications such as control of the telescope, was so small it could run without overlays in under 32K bytes of memory.

Because of Forth's unique ability to run efficiently in such a resource-constrained environment, it has always been most popular in embedded systems, particularly hand-held or battery-powered devices such as the package-tracking devices used by FedEx Corporation.  It has also been used in numerous [http://forth.gsfc.nasa.gov/ space applications] by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasa NASA] and others.

Some companies, such as [http://www.newmicros.com/ New Micros, Inc.] sell inexpensive microprocessor boards with Forth already installed.  Others, such as [http://www.forth.com FORTH, Inc.] and [http://www.mpeforth.com/index.htm Microprocessor Engineering Ltd.], provide cross-compilers for embedded systems in which the Forth OS runs on the target but the compiler and other development tools run on a conventional PC.

== Chipset ==

The original IBM computer was based around the 8088 microprocessor, although the 8088 alone was not enough to handle all the complex tasks required by the system. A number of other chips were developed to support the microprocessor unit (MPU), and many of these other chips survive, in one way or another, to this day. The chapters in this section will talk about some of the additional chips in the standard x86 chipset, including the DMA chip, the interrupt controller, and the Timer.

This section currently only contains pages about the programmable peripheral chips, although eventually it could also contain pages about the non-programmable components of the x86 architecture, such as the RAM, the Northbridge, etc. 

Many of the components discussed in these chapters have been integrated onto larger die through the years. The DMA and PIC controllers, for instance, are both usually integrated into the Southbridge ASIC. If the PCI Express standard becomes widespread, many of these same functions could be integrated into the PCI Express controller, instead of into the traditional Northbridge/Southbridge chips.

The chips covered in this section are:

== Direct Memory Access ==
{{Wikipedia|Direct memory access}}

The '''Direct Memory Access''' chip (DMA) was an important part of the original IBM PC and has become an essential component of modern computer systems. DMA allows other computer components to access the main memory directly, without the processor having to manage the data flow. This is important because in many systems, the processor is a data-flow bottleneck, and it would slow down the system considerably to have the MPU have to handle every memory transaction.

The original DMA chip was known as the 8237-A chip, although modern variants may be one of many different models.

== DMA Operation ==

The DMA chip can be used to move large blocks of data between two memory locations, or it can be used to move blocks of data from a peripheral device to memory. For instance, DMA is used frequently to move data between the PCI bus to the expansion cards, and it is also used to manage data transmissions between primary memory (RAM) and the secondary memory (HDD). While the DMA is operational, it has control over the memory bus, and the MPU may not access the bus for any reason. The MPU may continue operating on the instructions that are stored in its caches, but once the caches are empty, or once a memory access instruction is encountered, the MPU must wait for the DMA operation to complete. The DMA can manage memory operations much more quickly than the MPU can, so the wait times are usually not a large speed problem.

== DMA Channels ==

The DMA chip has up to 8 DMA channels, and one of these channels can be used to cascade a second DMA chip for a total of 14 channels available. Each channel can be programmed to read from a specific source, to write to a specific source, etc. Because of this, the DMA has a number of dedicated I/O addresses available, for writing to the necessary control registers. The DMA uses addresses 0x0000-0x000F for standard control registers, and 0x0080-0x0083 for page registers.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Programmable Interrupt Controller}}

The original IBM PC contained a chip known as the '''Programmable Interrupt Controller''' to handle the incoming interrupt requests from the system, and to send them in an orderly fashion to the MPU for processing. The original interrupt controller was the 8259A chip, although modern computers will have a more recent variant. The most common replacement is the [[w:Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller|APIC]] (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) which is essentially an extended version of the old PIC chip to maintain backwards compatibility. This page will cover the 8259A.

==Function==

[[File:PIC Hardware interrupt path.svg|thumb|300px|Path of an interrupt, from hardware to CPU]]

The function of the 8259A is actually relatively simple. Each PIC has 8 input lines, called Interrupt Requests (IRQ), numbered from 0 to 7. When one of these lines goes high, the PIC alerts the CPU and sends the appropriate interrupt number. This number is calculated by adding the IRQ number (0 to 7) to an internal &quot;vector offset&quot; value. The CPU uses this value to execute an appropriate Interrupt Service Routine. (For further information, see [[X86 Assembly/Advanced Interrupts|Advanced Interrupts]]).

Of course, it's not quite as simple as that, because each system has two PICS, a &quot;master&quot; and a &quot;slave&quot;. So when the slave raises an interrupt, it's actually sent to the master, which sends that to the CPU. In this way, interrupts cascade and a processor can have 16 IRQ lines. Of these 16, one is needed for the two PIC chips to interface with each other, so the number of available IRQs is decreased to 15.

While [[x86 Assembly/Advanced_Interrupts#Disabling_Interrupts|cli and sti]] can be used to disable and enable ''all'' hardware interrupts, it's sometimes desirable to selectively disable interrupts from certain devices. For this purpose, PICs have an internal 8-bit register called the Interrupt Mask Register (IMR). The bits in this register determine which IRQs are passed on to the CPU. If an IRQ is raised but the corresponding bit in the IMR is set, it is ignored and nothing is sent to the CPU.

==IRQs==
Of the 15 usable IRQs, some are universally associated with one type of device:
* IRQ 0 ‒ system timer
* IRQ 1 — keyboard controller
* IRQ 3 — serial port COM2
* IRQ 4 — serial port COM1
* IRQ 5 — line print terminal 2
* IRQ 6 — floppy controller
* IRQ 7 — line print terminal 1
* IRQ 8 — RTC timer
* IRQ 12 — mouse controller
* IRQ 13 — math co-processor
* IRQ 14 — ATA channel 1
* IRQ 15 — ATA channel 2

==Programming==
Each of the system's two PICs are assigned a command port and a data port:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! PIC1 !! PIC2
|-
| Command || 0x20 || 0xA0
|-
| Data || 0x21 || 0xA1
|}

===Masking===

Normally, reading from the data port returns the IMR register (see above), and writing to it sets the register. We can use this to set which IRQs should be ignored. For example, to disable IRQ 6 (floppy controller) from firing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
in ax, 0x21
or ax, (1 &lt;&lt; 6)
out 0x21, ax
&lt;/source&gt;

In the same way, to disable IRQ 12 (mouse controller):

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
in ax, 0xA1
or ax, (1 &lt;&lt; 4)   ;IRQ 12 is actually IRQ 4 of PIC2
out 0xA1, ax
&lt;/source&gt;

===Remapping===

Another common task, often performed during the initialization of an operating system, is remapping the PICs. That is, changing their internal vector offsets, thereby altering the interrupt numbers they send. The initial vector offset of PIC1 is 8, so it raises interrupt numbers 8 to 15. Unfortunately, some of the low 32 interrupts are used by the CPU for exceptions (divide-by-zero, page fault, etc.), causing a conflict between hardware and software interrupts. The usual solution to this is remapping the PIC1 to start at 32, and often the PIC2 right after it at 40. This requires a complete restart of the PICs, but is not actually too difficult, requiring just eight &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt;s.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov al, 0x11
out 0x20, al     ;restart PIC1
out 0xA0, al     ;restart PIC2

mov al, 0x20
out 0x21, al     ;PIC1 now starts at 32
mov al, 0x28
out 0xA1, al     ;PIC2 now starts at 40

mov al, 0x04
out 0x21, al     ;setup cascading
mov al, 0x02
out 0xA1, al

mov al, 0x01
out 0x21, al
out 0xA1, al     ;done!
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

{{Wikipedia|Programmable Interval Timer}}

The '''Programmable Interval Timer''' (PIT) is an essential component of modern computers, especially in a multi-tasking environment. The PIT chip can be made ‒ by setting various register values ‒ to count up or down, at certain rates, and to trigger interrupts at certain times. The timer can be set into a cyclic mode, so that when it triggers it automatically starts counting again, or it can be set into a one-time-only countdown mode.

On newer hardware, a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Precision_Event_Timer HPET] (High Precision Event Timer), which is an evolution of the PIT concept, is likely to be available.

== Function ==
The PIT contains a crystal oscillator which emits a signal 1193182 hz. This output frequency is divided by three different values to provide three output channels to the CPU. Channel 0 is used as a system timer by most operating systems. Channel 1 was used to refresh the DRAM, but is no longer used and may not even be accessable. Channel 2 is used to control the PC speaker. Of these, channel 0 is the most frequently encountered.

To make the PIT fire at a certain frequency ''f'', you need to figure out an integer '''''x''''', such that 11931820 / '''''x''''' = '''''f'''''. This is a trivially solved problem which results in the formula:
:'''''x''''' = 1193182 / '''''f'''''

How this division actually works is that each divisor is saved in an internal register. On every clock pulse, the register is decremented. Only when it reaches 0 is the clock pulse allowed to continue on to the CPU. Higher divisors result in lower frequencies, and vice versa.

Note that because the divisor is 16 bits, and a value of 0 is interpreted as 65536, there are limits on the producible frequencies:
:max = 1193182 / 1 = 1193182 hz
:min = 1193182 / 65536 ≈ 18.2065 hz
This final value is also the resolution of the frequency, that is, each consecutive possible frequency differs by 18.2065 hz.

== Programming ==
The PIT is accessed via four ports, three for the three channels and one for commands:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Channel 0 || 0x40
|-
| Channel 1 || 0x41
|-
| Channel 2 || 0x42
|-
| Command || 0x43
|}

One commonly performed task is setting the frequency of the channel 0, the system timer. If a frequency of 100 hz is desired, we see that the necessary divisor is 1193182 / 100 = 11931. This value must be sent to the PIT split into a high and low byte.
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov al, 0x36
out 0x43, al    ;tell the PIT which channel we're setting

mov ax, 11931
out 0x40, al    ;send low byte
out 0x40, ah    ;send high byte
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

The Original x86 PC had another peripheral chip onboard known as the 8255A '''Programmable Peripheral Interface''' (PPI). The 8255A, and variants (82C55A, 82B55A, etc.) controlled the communications tasks with the outside world. The PPI chips can be programmed to operate in different I/O modes.</text>

Baseball is a ball game played between two teams, each of nine players.

== Basics ==
As everyone in the world knows, Dallas Diebold is the best baseball player in the universe. He plays baseball? Yes. He is way to sick at this game and even surpasses Gareth Thompson which is crazy. He is also the best at hockey, CHEL, badminton, Destiny, and flowing hard. Dallas is a legend at Starbucks. What a guy.

You need a glove, Dallas Diebold on your team (the catcher and first baseman use mitts) and a bat. The person with the baseball bat hits the ball and the person with the glove or mitt tries to catch the ball and do it 5 times (or your choice). The pitches that the pitcher throws are either balls or strikes.  A strike is a pitch that is thrown within the strike zone. Traditionally the strike zone is a pitch thrown across the plate and between the knees and uniform letters of the player and not outside of the sides of the home plate. A ball is a pitch thrown outside this area.  It is important to remember that final call on whether a pitch is a strike or ball is decided by the home plate umpire. 

The game baseball is played on a field called a diamond.  The infield is made up of a home plate, first base, second base and third base, set up in a diamond shape.  The total number of players that can play on the diamond at one time is 9 (defensive).  There is a pitcher (who throws the ball to the batter), the catcher, catches the ball thrown by the pitcher.  There is a first baseman who catches the balls hit to the infielders and mans first base.  The second baseman plays in between first and second base. Next to the second baseman on the other side of second base, between second base and third base is the shortstop.  This position was originally called the shortfielder because it was play in the outfield in front of the outfielders and behind the infielders. The outfield consists of three players: left, middle, and right field. All are located in the grass far beyond the diamond.

The bat is made of wood or aluminum.  At younger levels aluminum is used, while in professional leagues they use wooden bats.

The Major League Baseball (MLB) is recognized as the premier league to play baseball with the top talent in the world.  In the MLB, there are 30 teams in two separate leagues, the American League (AL) and the National League (NL).  Each of the 30 teams plays 162 games, not including the playoffs.  There are 6 divisions, 3 per league, with teams ranging from 3 to 6 in each league.  In the playoffs, there are 3 rounds prior to the World Series, which determines the champion for that year.  

In 2011 the St Louis Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers 4 games to 3 to win the World Series. In 2012 The Florida Marlins had their name changed to the Miami Marlins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Networks/Page}}

In a digital communications system, there are 2 methods for data transfer: '''parallel''' and '''serial'''. Parallel connections have multiple wires running parallel to each other (hence the name), and can transmit data on all the wires simultaneously. Serial, on the other hand, uses a single wire to transfer the data bits one at a time. 

== Parallel Data ==

The parallel port on modern computer systems is an example of a parallel communications connection. The parallel port has 8 data wires, and a large series of ground wires and control wires. IDE harddisk connectors and PCI expansion ports are another good example of parallel connections in a computer system.

== Serial Data ==

The serial port on modern computers is a good example of serial communications. Serial ports have either a single data wire, or a single differential pair, and the remainder of the wires are either ground or control signals. USB, FireWire, SATA and PCI Express are good examples of other serial communications standards in modern computers.

== Which is Better? ==

It is a natural question to ask which one of the two transmission methods is better. At first glance, it would seem that parallel ports should be able to send data much faster than serial ports. Let's say we have a parallel connection with 8 data wires, and a serial connection with a single data wire. Simple arithmetic seems to show that the parallel system can transmit 8 times as fast as the serial system.

However, parallel ports suffer extremely from '''inter-symbol interference''' (ISI) and noise, and therefore the data can be corrupted over long distances. Also, because the wires in a parallel system have small amounts of capacitance and mutual inductance, the bandwidth of parallel wires is much lower than the bandwidth of serial wires. We all know by now that an increased bandwidth leads to a better bit rate. We also know that less noise in the channel means we can successfully transmit data reliably with a lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio, SNR.

If, however, we bump up the power in a serial connection by using a differential signal with 2 wires (one with a positive voltage, and one with a negative voltage), we can use the same amount of power, have twice the SNR, and reach an even higher bitrate without suffering the effects of noise. USB cables, for instance, use shielded, differential serial communications, and the USB 2.0 standard is capable of data transmission rates of 480Mbits/sec!

In addition, because of the increased potential for noise and interference, parallel wires need to be far shorter than serial wires. Consider the standard parallel port wire to connect the PC to a printer: those wires are between 3 and 4 feet long, and the longest commercially available is typically 25 feet. Now consider ethernet wires (which are serial, and typically unshielded twisted pair): they can be bought in lengths of 100 feet, and a 300 foot run is not uncommon!

== &quot;Cubic Compiling&quot;? ==

This section (1.5 as the time of writing) looks like the output of a translator bot at best or a paper generator at worst. The text in this section is utterly uncomprehensible and I was not even able to find out what &quot;cubic compiling&quot; is supposed to be. There is an IDE by the name of CubicIDE, though, so this might be related spam. I suggest to delete this section altogether, but I am not sufficiently certain that this is not merely a heavily mistranslated, legit content.

: The only connection I saw to cubic compiling was that something was at O(n^3) - in particular an ad-hoc algorithm.  Unless the author of that article knows something I don't, a cubic O-notation would be a disaster for a recursive-compiler, especially when an interpreter would normally use O(n^2) at worst when doing variable lookups.  It's almost as if the section wants to say the parse tree is bad, but I see absolutely no indication why that would be the case.   Finally, &quot;eradicating&quot; 290000 articles?  Really, word salad doesn't do that.  Since it was always like that, nuke it from orbit just to be sure. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sigma 7|contribs]]) 15:07, 28 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

I do not know what [[User:Dmonego]] meant/intends in the Uses section: ''In Java and J2EE programming, the structured definition of bean properties is a very useful technique for comparing a single common property across several objects that do not and should not be related with inheritance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Circular Saws'''

Most people are familiar with the basic circular saw, sometimes called a &quot;skillsaw,&quot; though that is a brand, as when one refers to tissue as &quot;Kleenex.&quot; These saws are constructed with a pistol-type grip to the rear, and a trigger-button which activates the saw.

Another popular type of saw is the &quot;worm drive&quot; or &quot;framing&quot; saw. This saw is a variation on the circular saw, which is designed to fit in smaller spaces; the motor is at the back. Because there is no motor beside the blade, the saw's width when viewed from the front (the direction of the cut) is much smaller.

These saws, as other tools, are manufactured to varying levels of quality and durability. The plastic ones such as DeWalt are lighter, and for framers cutting in a bent over position that is good! However they do not take well to drops or imacts. A sturdier tool would definitely be one with a metal body such as Ridgid or Makita, though these models are noticeably heavier.

== Thats ok for some... ==

Firstly we all know how we are supposed to speak on the phone, we all know tech support don't care our cat is ill, they just want to know the problem, only the problem and then try to fix it, apparently. Given certain circumstances i think its ok to lose it on the phone with one, maybe even dream of microwaving them... on defrost... slowly... - See below.

Iv'e encountered many tech support centres covering various pieces of software/hardware/services, in my experiance the software/hardware tech support seem ok and im more than happy to jump through their hoops as long as i feel my problem is going somewhere and is being sorted out. However services, especialy some internet service providers are a nightmare.

Here is my story sad but true...

AOL Technical support stages one AND two need slapped with extream prejudice, after you get through which in my case was normally around 40mins stage one &quot;techs&quot; have no technical knowledge at all they are simply reading text from a screen which contains solutions to common problems, you say &quot;can't connect, iv'e had this problem for a total of 2 months, its not my line spoke to BT its fine, its not my modem i have 3 modems and 4 computers none work, its not the drivers iv'e re-installed them on all machines and tried each machine with each modem&quot; they say &quot;ahh yes i see we went through the tests with you yesterday and it didn't help, then we passed you on to a stage 2 tech. Hmm.. are your modem lights all on?&quot; im going to kill somone, more often than not they are in asia and weirdly enough have common names like &quot;Jim&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot; which are two i can remember, doesn't change the fact that i can't understand a word they say. Then they have an event/problem logging system which only stores your &quot;problem&quot; and the &quot;questions/hoops&quot; you jumped through for 2 days, if you're problem isn't resolved within that time frame they once again have NO idea of your situation, that said even though they have it in front of them, they lead you down the garden path it MUST be to just get on you're nerves because if you're answers are on screen there is no reason for them to ask you the same questions for the 20th time. After my connection working only 10% of the time for 2 months i had a note put on my account saying i was to be transfered to a stage 2 tech/rep without any messing around, same situation only they are more friendly and use more technical speach, and are normally western. They couldn't help either.

Hilarious thing about the entire saga was when it got fixed, i called up one day and i'd been waiting on hold so long i'd fallen asleep on the floor, when i get through the engineer has to wake me up because he can hear me snoring on the other end of the phone. i explain (this must be the 30th time now, and i can reel it all off with ease which makes tech angry because you're answering their questions before they ask them) after which he tells me there is ONE person in the entire AOL Company that can speak to me about my problem and he won't be available for 2 hours (who is that guy?!), i don't want to hang up because iv'e done that before, no one calls back so im back on hold for 1 hour 20 mins and im back asleep, no idea who this bloke was but within 10 mins i had 100% internet connectivity that... after months of calling BT to check my line, and ADSL status, by this time i had installed Windows 98, Me, NT, XP on all 4 of my machines just so it wasn't version dependant, had 3 different versions of the modem drivers, 3 modems, 10 cables, one of my machines had been online for the entire month because Stage 2 techs ask you to &quot;Leave it on so we can do ADSL testing&quot; and ONE bloke manages to sort it in 10 mins.

Now tech support being &quot;right most of the time&quot; is ok in some cases, but spread your company over many continents, throw in bad communication or no communication, horrible problem logging and your rules go out the window and people are trying their hardest to reach down the phone line grab your tounge and throttle you with it.

If the systems set up to help people are not &quot;Made by idiots for idiots&quot; great, iv'e no love for Mr.Technical Support if ITS NOT MY PROBLEM, ITS YOURS (we know its not you're fault as a person, but its your company, your in technical support, you're paid to fix things) NOW FIX IT!

Maybe there should be a set time limit on problems, say for example the problem eventually gets sorted in a few days after waiting months by some guy who is actually switched on today. then you should be allowed by law to remove all of the tech support guys you have spoken to in that time's teeth with a chisel.

P.S: at the time AOL UK was the only ISP that did broadband without capping and at a reasonable rate, i didn't argue i just wanted to download gigs of stuff.

:First level tech do NOT have no technical knowledge, I work there and my 1st call resolution rate is 93%. The other 7 is passing along to level 2 for line checks, and the occasional reinstall. We do NOT read from the screen, the screen offers guidelines, we have to know exactly how to solve the problems, and if we get agitated it is because we've had one two many people asking us what a modem is that day. These rules are spot on, I wish the IVR read them out before transfering people to an agent.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ada ==

Ada is a [[w:Strongly-typed programming language|strongly typed]] [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language suitable for [[w:embedded system|embedded system]]s, [[w:device driver|device driver]]s and other forms of [[w:system programming|system programming]].

===Type===

Ada is a full [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language implementing the following paradigmen: [[w:concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]], [[w:Distributed programming|distributed]], [[w:Generic programming|generic]] ([[w:template|template]] [[w:metaprogramming|metaprogramming]]), [[w:Imperative programming|imperative]] and [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] ([[w:Class (computer science)|class-based]]) programming.

===Execution Entry Point===

The procedure name of the entry point can be freely choosen.

===General Syntax===

The typical statement is completed by a semi-colon.  For the assignment of b to a use:

 a {{Ada/delimiter|1 = :=}} b {{Ada/delimiter|;}}

===Comments===

 {{Ada/comment|this is an inline comment.  Everything after the -- is a comment.}}

===Variable Declarations===

Declarations can appear at the beginning of an block.

Declare i as an integer: 

 {{Ada/kw|declare}} 
   I {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer {{Ada/delimiter|;}} 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|program}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/delimiter|;}} 

Here are two ways to declare i as an integer and give it an initial value of 0:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}} 
   I {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Integer {{Ada/delimiter|1 = :=}} 0 {{Ada/delimiter|;}} 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|program}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/delimiter|;}}

=== Method Declaration/Implementation ===

procedures and functions are declared by the keyword {{Ada/kw|procedure}} or {{Ada/kw|function}} respectively. See [[Ada Programming/Subprograms]] for details.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} A_Test (A, B: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer; C: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer) {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    C := A + B;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} A_Test;

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Minimum (A, B : Integer) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt;= B {{Ada/kw|then}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} B;
    {{Ada/kw|else}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} A;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Minimum;

Class methods are primitive operations (procedures and functions) declared in the same scope as the class record. See [[Ada_Programming/Object_Orientation]] for details.

=== Scope ===

Scops is decared by the use of packages which may consist of three parts: public specification ({{Ada/kw|package}}), private specification ({{Ada/kw|private}}) and body ({{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}}).

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Package_With_Body {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Set_A (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Basic_Record;
                     An_A : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Integer);
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_A (This : Basic_Record) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}} 
          A : Integer;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}} ;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Package_With_Body;

 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Package_With_Body {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Set_A (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Basic_Record;
                     An_A : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Integer)
    {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       This.A := An_A;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Set_A;
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_A (This : Basic_Record) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} This.A;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Get_A;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Package_With_Body;

See [[Ada_Programming/Packages]] for details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Symbian book at wikibooks. Originally started by the righteous folks from [irc://irc.freenode.net/#symbian #symbian] on [http://freenode.net freenode], this book hopes to contain some information about programming in Symbian C++. Mostly about features that aren't documented or are hard to find via digging forums.

== Getting Started ==
If you're just getting started, you're best off reading the Wikipedia article about [[w:Symbian|Symbian]]. There are lots of very useful links at the bottom of the page containing a great collection of tutorials and examples.

== Useful links ==
Some links you'll need:
*[http://developer.symbian.org The Symbian Foundation developer website]
*[http://www.newlc.com/article.php3?id_article=117 Symbian OS error codes] on NewLC.com.
*[http://discussion.forum.nokia.com Forum Nokia] The biggest Symbian-related discussion forum on the web.
*[http://symbianexample.com Symbian Example] The collection of stand-alone code examples.
*[http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Wiki_Home Forum Nokia Wiki]
*[http://blogs.forum.nokia.com/ Forum Nokia Wiki]
*[http://groups.google.com/group/symbian-cpp Symbian C++ Google Group]

== Platforms based on Symbian OS ==
There are several mobile platforms based on Symbian OS. The most popular ones are Nokia's S60 and UIQ Technology's UIQ. Nokia also has Series 40, which is not a Symbian platform, but is based on Nokia's proprietry closed OS. Series 40 supports J2ME. For more information about J2ME, read the [[J2ME Programming|J2ME wikibook]].

=== [[/S60|S60]] ===
Nokia's [[/S60|S60]], formerly known as Series 60, includes a wide range of phones with varying capabilities. SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-4,00.html Forum Nokia]. Especially if you plan to use the newer SDKs you'll need [http://www.forum.nokia.com/Tools_Docs_and_Code/Tools/IDEs/Carbide.vs/ Carbide.vs] or Carbide.C++.

=== UIQ ===
SonyEricsson owned UIQ, used e.g. by Sony-Ericsson, Motorola and BenQ. SDKs can be found at [http://www.uiq.com/uiqsdk UIQ.com].

=== [[/S80|Series 80]] ===
Nokia's [[/S80|Series 80]] is the communicator series which includes 9300, 9300i and 9500. SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-369,00.html Forum Nokia]. The 9200 -series has a separate [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-68,00.html SDK].

=== Series 90 ===
Nokia had Series 90 a while back which consisted of only two products, 7700 and 7710. Only 7710 was actually commercially sold. The SDK for Series 90 couldn't be found on Forum Nokia any more, and Series 90's development has been ceased.

== Symbian C++ and OS fundamentals ==

=== [[/Conventions|Conventions, types and classes]] ===
Symbian OS has a lot of coding and naming conventions. The OS also has its own equivalents for primitive types (mostly [[w:Typedef|typedefs]]), like &lt;code&gt;TInt&lt;/code&gt; (signed int) and &lt;code&gt;TText16&lt;/code&gt; (unsigned short int), and follows a convention for naming classes, for example &lt;code&gt;CMyComplexClass&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TMySimpleClass&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MMyInterface&lt;/code&gt;.

=== [[/Memory_management|Memory management]] ===
Symbian OS has certain memory management peculiarities. These include the cleanup stack and the usage of two-phase construction.

=== [[/Exception_handling|Exception handling]] ===
Symbian OS doesn't use standard C++ exceptions, but employs its own system known as the leave mechanism. Simply put, this consists of code that can possibly ''leave'' (roughly throw) and code that can ''trap'' leaves (roughly catch).

=== [[/Descriptors|Descriptors]] ===
Symbian OS' conception of strings are descriptors. These are data structures that can hold any binary data, but are used mostly for storing and manipulating text.

=== [[/Active_objects|Active Objects]] ===
Active Objects provide means for [[w:Cooperative multitasking|cooperative multitasking]]. Symbian OS itself supports [[w:Preemptive multitasking#Preemptive_multitasking|preemptive multitasking]], but Active Objects are usually the suggested method for executing various asynchronous tasks.

=== Client-server framework ===

=== [[Symbian/Resources|Resources]] ===
Like some other operating systems, Symbian OS uses resources for given, mostly UI-related, definitions. This section tries to explain how to define resources and use them.

== Symbian SDKs ==
Although each platform provides (or should provide) its own SDK, there are few things in common between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book arose from a discussion point in the Ecology Wikibook, which pointed to the need for 'conservation management' to be included.  I have close contact with university students and land managers, where the need seems to be for a text book on applied ecology that centres on the long-term sustainable management of the outcomes of things like, reclamation of industrial sites, and reintroductions of rare species.  This would obviously grow into a big project, with distinctive subject matter, so I decided to start it as a separate book.  It is at a very early stage, and I must say I miss the availability of integral Wiki software for making mind maps.  Its not so easy to reorganise what are essentially provisional basic topics, but 'there you go'--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 07:54, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

The contents page looks a bit strange, but I have followed the current Wiki naming policy for new books.  For each new page this means giving it a name that includes its parent pages, all the way back to the book name.  If this is done for a new page (module), a blank page will automatically appear, and it will also be automatically linked back to previous pages.--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 11:24, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

==Orphaned Modules==
I'm going through the list of [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned pages]] and there are four pages there apparently belonging to this book, but not linked from anywhere. Not being familiar with the subject, placing these modules correctly in the context of this project is probably not a task I should perform, but I will list the pages here so that the contributors to this book can find a suitable place for them.

*[[Applied Ecology/Conervation Management]]
*[[Applied Ecology/Disease Transmission Through Ecosystems]]
*[[Applied Ecology/Environmental Evaluation/Environmental Impact Assessment/]]
*[[Applied Ecology/Rehabilitation of Rare Species]]

==Ref Orphaned Modules==
I created these at the time when I was not familiar with formatting wikis.  I thought I had deleted them but clearly I do not know how to do this.

== [[User:Panic2k4]] sockpuppet block/Comment regarding Sockpuppets on Wikibooks English ==
I do not know the nature of the dispute and decided to provide my outside opinion. It is intended to be my opinions/advice in the matter. Nothing more.

From what I understand, [[User:Panic2k4]] was blocked and his/her sockpuppets continue to edit during the duration of his/her block. There has been checkuser evidence and confessions to back this sockpuppet allegation. However because of the absence of a policy on wikibooks some people feel the block of sockpuppets is unwaranted.

I am a commons admin, and we too do not have a policy on sockpuppets on commons. However aggressive sockpuppets are blocked on commons left right regardless of the absence of a policy to do so. There is no point in having a checkuser on wikibooks if such sockpuppets are not to be blocked.

--[[User:Cool Cat|Cool Cat]] 16:37, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
:Hi, You left me a comment on my talk page (user: Xania) over on Wikibooks about sockpuppets created by the, currently, banned user Panic.  Thanks for your comments.  The issue with Panic isn't really about his sockpuppets and he has made it very clear that they were created by him.  I think he was trying to prove a point (not sure what the point is) and also trying to be helpful (he did a lot of tidy up tasks with these puppets). [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:22, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
::Still sockpuppets should not be used to evade blocks regardless of the intent. No? --[[User:Cool Cat|Cool Cat]] 21:46, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I would say no to most occasions but this was civil disobedience without any wrong intentions and it is not covered on the policies so I don't see any harm, if it was used to continue the situation that resulted on the block or engage on any other actions that policies sees as block worthy then yes it should be regarded as bad but little could be done to stop it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

== Where's this all going? ==

Now the &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; page has gone, and redirects to Panic's talk page?  That seems odd to me.  Also, large fractions of the text that were there are no longer present (they are, of course, in the histories for those who go and look).  Seems that we're going backwards again.  We need this discussion to happen in one place, that won't move around, with some clearly defined goals and a visible, updated current status being prominent.  I do appreciate your willingness to help -- just trying to avoid repeating history (as recent history in this case has not been good for the community). -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 04:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
:I was asked to 'perhaps' move the discussion to Panic2k4's talk page so he can edit even when blocked. Since he removed the page I have restored it on the original location. --&lt;small&gt;[[User:Cool Cat|Cat]] [[User talk:Cool Cat|out]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

== Sorry about all that... ==
Sorry to have made you lose any of your time on that subject but at least it served to make some people address the issues, please consider participating into our (Wikibooks) policy building.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
:I am a person who prefers to avoid &quot;policies&quot; since when you set boundaries disruptive individuals dance around those very boundaries. If someone is being disruptive, common sense can easily deal with it. '''Common'''s deals with disruptive individuals very effectively for this very reason. My recommendation is to avoid writing out &quot;policies&quot; and deal with disruption on a case by case basis. --&lt;small&gt; [[User:Cool Cat|Cat]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cool Cat|chi?]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I would avoid an essay all together - that also establishes a more generalized set of boundaries. I am too new on wikibooks to vote - and even then I tend to avoid voting on issues.

::I'm monitoring your talk pages and I'm no longer blocked, or dependent on continuation of the imposed mediation, I will reply here or on my talk pages as you prefer, don't copy all the thread there please txs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:18, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Copying a discussion thread to both talk pages is quite a standard way to do it. I have been doing so in the past 2+ years. Fine, I'll reply only here.

::::Sorry if you are confused (I never used duplication of complete threads on a discussion prior to the moderation) and posting for +-4 years now :), I have replied to your last post (aren't you still monitoring my page?), well it is [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=787847&amp;oldid=787827 there]], you can reply there or here if you reply here I will delete the thread there and continue to reply here. Sorry if it is confusing (it is best than to have 2 duplicated threads running at least to me, you can move all posts of the thread from there to here if it makes you more comfortable if you chose to use your talk page that is, gezz even I am getting dizzy).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:24, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::I monitor no individual talk page. I Work on 4+ wikis and do not have that kind of time. The idea for duplication is better communication so that other people can also better follow it. In any case, I do not particularly care. I'll be replying to you here per your request. I am still waiting for you to answer my last question - or more like questions posed at you on the mediation page. --&lt;small&gt; [[User:Cool Cat|Cat]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cool Cat|chi?]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:43, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:Humm ?!? What do you want to mediate ? All issues are partially resolved, and the mediation was imposed to me at the time and is no longer needed or required at least on my side, I don't see you will be able to solve the huge cliff that exists between me and some users, I will be glad of any insight you may have on the events or issues but can't see the purpose of any mediation now.
:I thought that SB Jhonny told you that &quot;most&quot; things were resolved (I remember reading something on those lines). 
:Anyway if you still want to be of any help mending the bridges and be involved into dealing with the deeper problems or lets say divergent views, see for example this discussion [[Wikibooks_talk:Arbitration_Committee]] about freedom of participation vs status and for further and deeper insight on some of the view points I don't share with WK take a look at [[User_talk:Whiteknight#WB:RFA_posts]] it deals mostly on the level of trust and the segmentation of the community in special casts or power groups, the essay is also a good insight on what I believe and in general it deals in the core of all else. 
:Btw I remember reading somewhere, I think it was SB Jhonny, saying that you were more able to discuss legal matters and GFDL subjects is that right? If so I would like you to consider this 2 points.
:What constitutes a cover page (on wikibooks)?
:(I hope I'm not misrepresenting WK view but I think I got his point correct on that), WK defines that all wikibooks (the web site) is covered by a single GFDL license any content is therefor a module of that single work (much like wikipedia), I on the other hand say that there are 2 license one for all pages (lets call them modules) on site, but each book is excluded from that general license and falls into a specific license for each, as a stand alone work. WK validates his point on that all content committed is done under a specific notice (the one you see when you edit any page), I on the other hand disagree and defend that a specific notice has to be placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of the GFDL License.

::A lot of the legal arguments and beliefs involving GFDL have never been challenged in court. Weather each page is licensed individually or as a whole under GFDL doesn't really matter. However GFDL notice must be visible on each and every piece of material under that license. It would make more sense to license every book individually.

:::Ok will do, can you provide a space near the header or do you prefer I just add a post after the last one ?
:::I don't agree with your conclusion that &quot;Weather each page is licensed individually or as a whole under GFDL doesn't really matter&quot;, it can be so for you but you can't generalize and in Wikibooks that is a very important topic and has even implications on what is required to be stated, how the content is ordered and displayed, even on how we provide print versions of the books, or give credits to authors, or even give attributions. Just consider the topic of moving on site pages from books to books.
:::Humm notice is not the link or the full license text, were I said notice, I meant a statement of intentions by the creator(s).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:14, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
::::United States copyright law does not work based on intentions of creators. &quot;All text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.&quot; 
::::We also license images with different licenses. It would not be practical to license them all under a single license. Every page has a certain number of contributors who hold the copyright to the work they created. GFDL is not a surrender of copyright. It merely is a free license. Not only is every page individually licensed but every edit is individually licensed.

United States copyright law does not work based on intentions of creators ?!?, of course it does, in several instances even on the selection of the license or for example only copyright holders can prosecute infringers under the GFDL see the FSF page about that same point, when you license anything under GFDL you grant permission to publish and share the content under very specific rules, you don't give away ownership or any other right (as you say &quot;GFDL is not a surrender of copyright&quot;)...
Multiple licenses, yes agree, for instance in wikipedia dual license contributions require the users to express they wishes on their userpages that serves as the notice of intentions required by the GFDL license and the others.
#So in other words you agree that wikibooks is covered by a general license and a specific license to each book ?
#Do you agree that the notice on save page performs that function of the notice of intentions or a express agreement of the user to that general license as required and stated on the GFDL?
#Do you consider them exclusive or inclusive ?
#If exclusive do you agree that it falls under the definition of AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS as stated on the GFDL ?
#What then constitutes a title/cover page of a book ?
#Do you agree also that &quot;Provide a functional link back to the Wikibooks book or Wikibooks module (this satisfies the author credit requirement of our license)&quot; does not cover the independent work that a book constitutes?
#How do you define an author (or more specifically a book author at wikibooks) ?
(WK and I diverge in that he considers any edit grants authorship of a work, I define it as this:
Author - Author is the one that creates or contributes for the creation of a work, after creation and/or publication of the work, the one that assumes legal responsibility for it and rights over it, each subsequent alterations to the same work fall in several categories including revisions, re-editions, translations etc... It is considered that a existing work can only be co-authored with the previous authors if significant changes are made so it could be considered a derivative work.)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:53, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:Multiple licenses can only be used if they are GFDL compatible (non-commercial creative commons is obviously not compatible for instance). Once something is released under GFDL it is non-revoke-able and hence the intentions of the creator becomes irrelevant. 
:#The content of any wiki sponsored by the Wikimedia Foundation to my knowledge is licensed under GFDL. I do not see the point of this argument.
:#The &quot;notice&quot; on the save page serves to inform the person editing that what they are typing will be forever licensed under GFDL the second they press the save button. GFDL cannot be revoked.
:#I do not have the slightest idea what this one is asking.
:#Again I do not have the slightest idea what this one is asking.
:#A cover page of the book is the first page that generally contains art work and etc. This is trivial knowledge.
:#I am not sure what you are asking here.
:#Just like wikipedia, wikibooks is a cooperative environment. No book should be written by a single individual. &quot;Author&quot; is everybody involved - vandals (since vandalism will be removed from the final product)
:I do not understand what you are trying to get at. GFDL is non-revoke-able and all derivative works must be licensed under GFDL. Furthermore, GFDL allows derivative works.

::Were did you get the idea of revoking (I didn't ask anything on that direction) and the questions are strait forward, mostly require a yes or no answer.
::Yup I agree on the multiple license point, as for the intentions of the creator being irrelevant it's debatable lets take for example the recent post on the staff lounge of an author that intents to use Wikibooks to create his dual license book (I don't want to discuss that just to point out that it may not be so irrelevant as it has implications)
::So again can you help me on this ones.
::#I know that the content is licensed under the GFDL (I had to be blind not to get that :) ), what I asked is that do you agree that the license that covers the Wikibooks site and its modules is not the same that covers each independent book ?
::#The notice you already answered, and I agree.
::#If Wikibooks is an AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS the licenses are overlapping so are they exclusive or inclusive? from the GFDL text I take it is exclusive. (if not they would be called dependent works :) ) 
::#What constitutes a title/cover page  of a book at Wikibooks ?
::#(I'll reword this one as it is partially answered by some of the above questions) Do you agree also that &quot;Provide a functional link back to the Wikibooks book or Wikibooks module (this satisfies the author credit requirement of our license)&quot; as stated on [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] does not cover the requirements of the license of a book at Wikibooks ? (but only every other  page that is not part of a independent work.)
::#How do you define an author (or more specifically a book author at wikibooks) ? (and no Wikibooks is not like Wikipedia, Wikipedia deals with a collection of articles and Wikibooks deals with Books and each book has it's own authors and is covered by individual licenses and dependencies, like other books. They are indeed independent works) if you continue to share the statement above then this is also answered and I don't agree with you on this one.
::I'm not getting at one specific point. I would like to know your understanding of this situations, some are seen differently by several user (not only me).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I am not saying that you don't know it. Half of the issues involving GFDL involves this non-revokability.
:::1. I do not particularly see a legal difference if one considers it individually or as a whole. Each edit has their own individual copyright. Stitching them together into a single book creates a new copyright (GFDL allows that provided you attribute everybody), so it is perhaps both. Legaly, arguing either way doesn't quite matter.
:::3. All WMF sponsored wikis are writen in a collaborative and cooperative manner. People retain copyright for individual copyright but they release some rights according to GFDL. I do not understand what you mean by &quot;exclusive or inclusive&quot;
:::4. ? When publishing a book, you can change the title. I do not understand the significance of this.
:::5. Every bit of history would need to be linked - or a page that links to every bit of history would need to be linked. Sourcing a wiki-page that links to every page of the book is more than adequate citation.
:::6. What makes wikibooks different from wikipedia? They have the same license? 
:::Repetitively asking the same question will get you the same answer from me. I am not a lawyer, and very little material on GFDL has been challenged in court so dealing with GFDL as simplistically as possible is the smart thing to do.
:::If you have questions about GFDL and its implications, your best bet is to ask the [[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License|GFDL people]].

1. Consider moving a page from a book to the main namespace (the legal requirements) or from book to book (that one is easy one must give credit to the source book) and for example from wikipedia to a book (one must give credit to Wikipedia)...&lt;br&gt;
3. The GFDL creates specific requirements that must be met, considering that a book is a independent work (as defined on 7 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS) I see it as exclusive even if it is overlapped due to the virtualization of the framework we work in (wiki) so this has implication on how one must solve the requirements of the license in 2 specific &quot;spaces&quot; the Wikibooks and the &quot;book&quot; (they are considered 2 separated works), this has implications on point 1.&lt;br&gt;
4. Books on Wikibooks are published as soon they are edited (can be considered a modification or a derived work, depending on the level of contribution, so the question is simple on a book on Wikibooks how do you define the title or cover page as referred on the GFDL ? (this has several implications)&lt;br&gt;
5. Humm I don't agree with you there, (considering we are using a GFDL work as a target) to use any article of Wikipedia (I must only acknowledge Wikipedia as the source), to use something from the Wikibooks namespace (not a book page) I must only acknowledge Wikibooks, to use pages from any GFDL or with a similar license on a book under GFDL (even the one on wikibook) I must acknowledge the source books or authors (depending on how the source is structured and the level of utilization of content from the source), so the problem is simple, we have 2 licenses on for the Wikibooks namespace and one for each books, (on the books references to Wikibooks as source is not required)&lt;br&gt;
6. What makes it different is simple each article on Wikipedia doesn't have its own license, they are all under the namespace, books on wikibooks are stand alone works.&lt;br&gt;
Agree I thought you had a better understanding of the legal implications or the application of the license, but tanks for providing you views on the subject. In particular the point you consider Wikibooks and Wikimedia are equal in the its legal structure is a common mistake people do make. Well you didn't respond yet if you do want me to add my post on the mediation on the top or after the last one ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

I have tried to email the FSF on the US sometime ago but got a server error (the address is not recognized on the server) even if they publish it on the page, I will try FSF Europe next but I'm attempting to establish what the errors/view points/implications are.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:1. Collaborative book writing isn't something new. You are required to credit the source, not the authors. Weather its licensed individually or as a whole or both doesn't matter at all. Arguing either way is pointless since we do not have a basis for it anyways. 
:3 &amp; 4. Try challenging this point in a court. My or your opinions are irrelevant. Wikibooks is not the median for legal discussions.
:5. You are required to cite which page(s) you had been copying. Weather citing the entire book qualifies I do not know. People generally cite pages for verifiability purposes.
:6. I was unaware of blanket licensing on wikipedia. Every edit here or there gets its own copyright. People who contribute to either project care more about the common goal (a free encyclopedia/a free book/free whatever) than their individual copyrights. I do not have the slightest clue why you are so worked out about it
:Please do not waste peoples times with your theories on legal implications of GFDL. You are welcome to publish these theories and get them peer reviewed or alternatively challenge them in court. Questions you ask are unanswerable because we don't have legal cases for basis.

::Ok it seems you don't give the same importance that I give to the use of the GFDL and licensing issues and the need to be clear :and inform the users, it is my view that you are completely mistaken on the part of dual licenses, there can be incompatible licenses that are dual-licensed material. For example, you can have content which is licensed simultaneously under the GFDL and Microsoft EULA. All you are doing is offering multiple alternatives for legal republication of content.

::Your notion that all Wikimedia sponsored Wikis are under the terms of the GFDL is also incorrect. Wikinews is under the CC-by license, and some of the Wikimedia Foundation pages are a strict proprietary copyright... no license for republication at all. The Wikimania pages are &quot;free to use, but not to modify&quot;.

::You would have to agree here that at least making an administrative edit (adding or removing a category/VfD notice, etc.) does not constitute being considered an author. Certainly reverted vandals don't count. Take for instance this proposal [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code_2007#Authorship_determination  neta:Summer_of_Code_2007#Authorship_determination]] made by Robert (at least I'm not alone on the importance I give the issue), or [[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2003-June/010564.html or this post from three years ago from Richard Stallman]] that dismisses nearly all aggregation arguments that have been used for fair use and license combining on Wikipedia, or this bugzilla request here ([http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2993 Bugzilla:2993]).

::It seems as though deliberate action on the part of several &quot;upper&quot; Wikimedia Foundation members, that they explicitly are trying to stop any kind of authorship recognition. A proposal was even made here on Wikibooks to explicitly ban author pages entirely. (It was blocked).

::I have no problem with Wikimedia or even the community blocking or working to make attributing copyright harder (this ultimately will benefit us all, as consumers), I do consume more than I produce (and most people do if not closed in a box), what irks me is not stating that openly and let people know it, to me it is working equal to be in bad faith against the users. As an creator my main motivation to participate here was to build stuff and to be able to point to the things I create, by diluting the work one makes how does one state his achievements, or why bother to perform a greater contribution of content if any one can claim to have done it.

::I assure you if I had understood from the beginning the implications I would not have used Wikibooks and would have created the content outside even under the GFDL (I have no problem with the freedom of the license), for instance I contribute from time to time to wikipedia but I do it anonymously, what I don't like is the convenient way people brush aside the pieces they don't particularly like. (Referring mostly title/cover pages stating the authors or credits given, granting authorship based on the weak history logs, or just because of spell correction or even the rewording of the text, without taking into account the size of contributions, this to my view will only reduce contributors if they are properly informed of the facts, and I don't see a logical reason to do so since the license gives freedom to the content).

::This is also a poor way of educating people, I can't understand how can anyone claim to have built a house if all they did was hammer a handful of nails.

::&quot;Signing&quot; an author's page is required to be counted as an author (GFDL - This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.) the license states the authors page as the place to do it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Computer. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Computer~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

==Introduction==
Nokias Series 80 is the communicator series which includes 9300, 9300i and 9500. SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-369,00.html Forum Nokia]. The 9200 has a separate [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-68,00.html SDK].

==Collection of tips==

===Connection Preferences===
You should not tinker around with CCommsDbConnectionPrefTableView. The same code that works on S60 may run on S80 but won't accomplish anything worthwhile. Instead you should use TCommDbConnPref with RConnection.

===CEikAppUi===
A class derived from CEikAppUi has some issues with overriding one the ProcessCommandParametersL methods. It was something to do with the return values, at least ETrue didn't work quite as with S60. Will get back to this when i get around to testing again. Could be that ProcessMessageL override didn't go down too well either so if your app isn't starting be sure to check these methods out.

===Keyboard layout===
A quick reference of the keyboard layout in TKeyEvent.iScanCode:

*Esc         : 4
*Numbers 0-9 : 48-57
*Plus        : 131
*Backspace   : 1
*Tab         : 2
*Letters a-z : 65-90
*Enter       : 3
*Caps Lock   : 26
*Left Shift  : 18
*Minus       : 123
*Left        : 14
*Right       : 15
*Up          : 16
*Down        : 17
*Joy Left    : 170

==NOTICE==
This e-book is extremely incomplete.


==Introduction==
Nokia's S60, formerly known as Series 60, is a mobile platform based on Symbian OS. S60 includes a wide range of phones with varying capabilities. Most of these phones are made by Nokia, but S60 is also licensed to some other cell phone manufacturers, like Panasonic and Samsung. For general information about S60 see [[w:en:S60|the article in Wikipedia]].

The platform comprises of various libraries and pre-installed applications. Platform is open (but not open source), so 3rd parties can develop applications for it. Nokia offers software development kits for S60, and a list of SDKs can be found at [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-4,00.html Forum Nokia]. Especially if you plan to use the newer SDKs you'll need [http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-902,00.html Carbide.vs].

==Collection of tips==
===Resources===
S60 resource definitions can sometimes be pretty tedious to write, because of the total lack of proper documentation. The best place to look for information about resource definitions is examples, found in the Series60Ex directory of the SDK, but they too are far from perfect.
*'''CAknMessageQueryDialog'''
One control totally missing from the examples in some SDK version is CAknMessageQueryDialog, which is actually quite useful and once you know how, very easy to use. Here's how to define a working resource for this:
&lt;pre&gt;
RESOURCE DIALOG r_messagequery_dlg
  {
  flags = EGeneralQueryFlags | EEikDialogFlagNoBorder | EEikDialogFlagNoShadow;
  buttons = R_AVKON_SOFTKEYS_OK_EMPTY;
  items=
    {
    DLG_LINE
      {
      type = EAknCtPopupHeadingPane;
      id = EAknMessageQueryHeaderId;
      control = AVKON_HEADING
        {
        label = &quot;The Heading&quot;;
        };
      },
    DLG_LINE
      {
      type = EAknCtMessageQuery;
      id = EAknMessageQueryContentId;
      control = AVKON_MESSAGE_QUERY
        {
        message = &quot;The Actual Text&quot;;
        };
      }
    };
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that both the header and the message text can be set dynamically from code. The following code, however, uses the values given in the resource:
&lt;pre&gt;
CAknMessageQueryDialog* dlg = new (ELeave) CAknMessageQueryDialog;
dlg-&gt;ExecuteLD( R_MESSAGEQUERY_DLG );
&lt;/pre&gt;
===Camera===
On at least, two phones the support for the old RCameraServ has been dropped. If you link your app against cameraserver.lib it will not start on a 3230 or a 6260. Instead you should use the new CCamera class.

===CFbsBitmap===
*'''Transparency'''
When using newer than 6.1 SDKs (note: not sure if 9.1 still has this), loading the alpha channel (mask) of a PNG into a CFbsBitmap of color depth EGray16 doesn't work. You must use a colordepth of EGray256 for the mask, otherwise MiuoConvertComplete will always return with an error. After the conversion is complete you can convert back to EGray16.

*'''DataAddress()'''
On the new 9.1 SDK a call to CFbsBitmap::DataAddress() causes a crash if it's not preceded by a call to LockHeap() (remember to call UnlockHeap() when you're done with the address).

== [[:Image:Yellow.png]] ==

&lt;s&gt;I noticed that you tagged [[:Image:Yellow.png]] as public domain. However, I did not believe your argument that it was an &quot;uncreative work&quot;. Thus I removed the tag.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s&gt;But I am now aware that [[:Image:Yellow.png]] is a duplicate of [[:Image:50%.png]], which is copyrighted but licensed through the GNU Free Documentation License. Thus I tagged it {{tl|GFDL}} and redundant. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:42, 31 January 2006 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

:I zoomed in with an image viewer, and apparently these images are simple 9-pixel-by-9-pixel drawings of squares. You might be correct about {{tl|PD}}; there appears to be nothing significantly creative except possibly the choice of color. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:29, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== Non-commercial use ==

While I appreciate your efforts to try and get copyright clearance for several images, I want to let you know that non-commercial use only limitations are not permitted on Wikibooks.  There are several reasons for that, not the least of which is that it violates the terms of use for the GNU Free Document License.  

You can get some more information about why non-commercial use is harmful elsewhere, but this is an issue that has been discussed openly and widely on many forums throughout Wikimedia projects.  There are commercial ventures that do use this content, including ordinary Wikimedia users who simply want to charge for copying a bunch of CD's or DVDs full of Wikibook or Wikipedia content.  Not an arm or a leg for doing that, just to take care of the costs of running the burner and taking their time to make the physical media.  Or people who are trying to publish these books at even a nominal markup price.

If somebody is offering permission to copy images or other content, but is only willing to give a non-commercial license, we have to politely decline and apoligize for even taking their time.  If you have any other questions about this, feel free to drop a line on my talk page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:24, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Konstable. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Konstable~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

Eating human flesh is called cannibalism. This entry is not scholarly, it is a cannibal cookbook.

== Don't delete this valuable resource! ==

I'm shocked to see that there's a movement to delete this page. I realize placentas are probably not commonly eaten, but as far as I can see the only argument people have against it is that the idea offends their own sensibilities, and therefore they want all references to it removed. I'm standing up and saying i'm ''not'' offended; on the contrary I'm intruigued. I'm a vegetarian, but I have no objections to the consumption of human placenta with the consent of the mother (it would be unfair to eat animal placentas, as they are usually eaten by the mothers). In fact I, after reading this page, am now very much interested in partaking in a meal of human placenta at some point in my life. Thankyou wikicookbook, for opening my mind to these new possibilities :) please don't deprive others of that same experience! --[[User:86.135.178.19|86.135.178.19]] 21:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Color temperature.svg]]

Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency range. All objects emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. As the atoms are shaken by random thermal motion, the moving charge of the electrons causes them to emit a changing electromagnetic field. In general, the cooler the body, the slower the motion of its atoms and molecules, and the longer the wavelength of emitted radiation. Thus a human body emits mostly in the infrared part of the spectrum, making ''night vision'' cameras so valuable to the military and police. But the tungsten filament of an incandescent light bulb is at a much higher temperature (roughly 3000 K or about 5000 degrees F), causing it to emit mostly visible light.

Thus the spectrum and intensity of the emitted radiation can be used to determine the object's temperature from a distance. If a material is heated above 700 Kelvin, it begins to glow visibly - starting out as a dark red color and moving towards the blue end of the spectrum with increasing temperature. However, most objects radiate a wide range of temperatures, and the effective color perceived by the human eye may not be fully indicative of the true temperature. For example, the Sun appears white to most observers, but the wavelength at which it radiates most of its energy is about 5800 K or roughly 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which spectroscopically is equivalent to a green color. However, when the human eye detects the various wavelengths we receive from the Sun, in particular ratios of radiation emitted by the Sun, our eye-brain connection perceives it as white.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No one needs to be completely hemmed in by circumstances; no one needs to be the victim of his biography.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&amp;#151; George Kelly, The Psychology of Personal Constructs (1955)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every situation, you always have a choice of how to react. This insight is the basis of &lt;i&gt;personal construct therapy&lt;/i&gt; (PCT). The goal of PCT is to develop awareness of your choices in every situation. The antithesis is to always react the same way to stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make the same speech choices in high-stress situations, no amount of practice in a low-stress speech clinic will change your speech. E.g., if you always substitute words &amp;quot;when the going gets tough,&amp;quot; you're not going to use gentle onsets in a difficult situations, even after practicing 5,000 gentle onsets in the speech clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop awareness of your choices, describe a situation in which you stuttered. Imagine different ways you could have responded to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Role-play the scene with your speech-languge pathologist or in your support group. When someone sees a choice that hasn't been played, switch roles, for that person to play the new choice. E.g., the situation is answering the telephone at work. One person pretends to be a caller, and the other pretends to be the employee answering at Pasquale's Pizza. The employee uses slow speech. But another choice might be to switch to [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Three Stages of Motor Learning#Voice and Voiceless Consonants|voiced consonants]], i.e., answering the phone &lt;i&gt;Basdahllee's Bizza&lt;/i&gt;. You should be able to think of a half-dozen other possibilities. Role play every choice and see what feels best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Slow Down by Not Interrupting&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Conscious choice requires slow reactions. In a fast reaction to environmental stimuli, your brain will select the most myelinated (habitual) [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Open- and Closed-Loop Speech Motor Control#Open-Loop Motor Control|open-loop motor program]]. Interrupting people, or responding quickly in a conversation, is a fast reaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let people finish their sentences. Wait two seconds. Then start talking. Your fluency will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verbal Aikido&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Aikido|Aikido]] is a Japanese martial art. Combatants focus not on punching or kicking opponents, but rather on using their own energy to gain control of them or to throw them away from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbal aikido is the art of not arguing, but instead agreeing with someone who is verbally attacking you. Then you help the assailant attack you, until&amp;#151;surprise&amp;#151;he realizes that he's just been made to look like a fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., a middle-aged, overweight woman owned a chain of women-only health clubs. Middle-aged, overweight women could work out in these health clubs without feeling intimidated by young male bodybuilders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;shock jock&amp;quot; radio host invited the health club owner onto his show. He described her physical appearance, then asked why anyone would want to work out at a health club owned by a fat, ugly old lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She responded, &amp;quot;So we don't have to work out with boorish meatheads like you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This silenced the radio host long enough for her to say that overweight, middle-aged ladies have to exercise too, and the radio host was a perfect example of the men she didn't want to have to be around when she exercised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My example of the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering/Pre-School Stuttering#Modeling|parents responding to their teenagers' four-letter words]] is another example of verbal aikido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use verbal aikido to turn around the stress. E.g., a highway patrol officer pulls you over for speeding. Instead of trying to hide your stuttering, you make a joke: &amp;quot;I stutter, so I'm not going to try to talk you out of giving me a ticket.&amp;quot; Maybe this will put the officer in a good mood and let you go with a warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Changing Self-Descriptions&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Many stutterers improve their speech, yet continue to believe that their speech is worse than non-stutterers. Graduates of fluency shaping therapy programs sometimes have beautiful, clear speech that is easier and more pleasant to listen to than non-stutterers' speech. Yet they continue to believe that they can't do certain things, such as public speaking.{{ref|Andrews1974}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, stutterers who improve their speech attitudes have better speech a year after completing therapy, as compared to stutterers who maintain poor attitudes.{{ref|Guitar1978}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a description of yourself, and then describe who you expects to be in five years. Look for items that are opposite in the two descriptions. E.g., now you're now single, but in five years you hope to be married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then write a description of yourself as a stutterer, and then describe who you'd be if you didn't stutter. E.g., assertive vs. shy, or popular vs. lonely. These descriptions are your &lt;i&gt;personal constructs&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on changing your personal constructs. Again, imagine specific situations for each personal construct. E.g., if you wrote that you'd be assertive instead of shy, describe a recent situation in which you weren't assertive. Now role-play the scene with your speech-language pathologist or your support group. Imagine different ways to react in the situation and switch roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;Who Would I Be If I Didn't Stutter?&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;This is a favorite conversation topic at stuttering support groups. People initially say, &amp;quot;I'd be more successful at work,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I'd be more assertive with my husband and family,&amp;quot; and other &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt; aspects of stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fifteen minutes, people start saying, &amp;quot;If I didn't stutter, I'd be less compassionate,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I would never have developed my musical talent.&amp;quot; People realize that they chose a career in a &amp;quot;helping profession&amp;quot; (e.g., nursing or teaching), or they developed non-verbal skills, such as athletics or painting, because they stutter. They realize &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; aspects of stuttering. They see that stuttering can be a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a stutterer completed a speech therapy program, but refused to speak fluently. He said that his co-workers had listened to his stuttering for 20 years. He asked, &amp;quot;What would they think if I came to work speaking fluently?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another stutterer was earning $25,000/year as a computer programmer. His supervisor left, and the company wanted to promote the stutterer. He would receive a salary of $55,000/year. The management position required talking to clients on the telephone&lt;!--&gt; XE &amp;quot;telephones&amp;quot; &lt;!--&gt;. The company offered to pay for speech therapy and an anti-stuttering device. The stutterer refused the promotion, saying that he didn't want to talk to anyone. The company instead hired a less-qualified manager from outside the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these stutterers, the psychological issues surrounding stuttering are more disabling than their disfluencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Change Your Lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As your improve your fluency, ask your supervisor for tasks that require talking. Do social activities that involve talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training a new motor skill requires about [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Automatic, Effortless Fluency#How Long Does Autonomous Learning Take?|three million repetitions]]. To say three million words, you must talk at least four hours a day for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take an acting class. Take singing lessons. You'll have fun, and meet new people. You'll get over your speech-related fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll find some things other people can easily do that you can't, but you'll also find things you can easily do that other people can't. E.g., I took a public speaking course. I was able to project your voice, when other students are afraid to raise their voices. I was able to switch emotions (anger, sadness) easily and convincingly, when other students couldn't. And there were simple presentations that you couldn't understand a word I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteer to read to blind or elderly individuals. Volunteer at a hospital directing visitors where to go. Volunteer with your public radio station answering pledge week calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or moonlight at a job that requires talking. Find a job that requires being charming and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join social clubs that requires talking. Put Toastmasters at the top of your list. Members give a series of ten speeches, usually one speech per month. The speeches are four to ten minutes long. Each of the ten speeches teaches you a new skill, such as using gestures and body language, or being persuasive on a controversial topic. Judges always point out things you did well&amp;#151;and award lots of ribbons&amp;#151;as well as ways you can improve. You'll find that even if you stutter severely, you're better than non-stutterers at some aspects of public speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [http://www.nsastutter.org/ National Stuttering Association] has its own public speaking training program, which is quite different from Toastmasters. Ask for the &amp;quot;Speaking Circles&amp;quot; video.&lt;/p&gt;

Why help others?  Ever thought of how well a professor knows the information; think he or she knew it that well the first time they taught it?  I'll bet they didn't.  When you take the time to help or teach someone else you're repeating the concept or facts in your own mind, verbalizing it, and thinking through it critically.  The only caution I would give on helping others is if your professor grades on  curve.  You may help out the other too much and cut yourself out of the grade you deserve.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language; these include {{java:boolean}}, {{java:byte}}, {{java:char}}, {{java:short}}, {{java:int}}, {{java:long}}, {{java:float}} and {{java:double}}. These types serve as the building blocks of data manipulation in Java. Such types serve only one purpose &amp;mdash; containing pure, simple values of a kind. Because these data types are defined into the Java type system by default, they come with a number of operations predefined. You can not define a new operation for such primitive types. In the Java type system, there are three further categories of primitives:
* Numeric primitives: {{java:short}}, {{java:int}}, {{java:long}}, {{java:float}} and {{java:double}}. These primitive data types hold only numeric data. Operations associated with such data types are those of [[Java Programming/Basic arithmetic|simple arithmetic]] (addition, subtraction, etc.) or of [[Java Programming/Boolean expressions|comparisons]] (is greater than, is equal to, etc.)
* Textual primitives: {{java:byte}} and {{java:char}}. These primitive data types hold characters (that can be [[Unicode]] alphabets or even numbers). Operations associated with such types are those of textual manipulation (comparing two words, joining characters to make words, etc.). However, {{java:byte}} and {{java:char}} can also support arithmetic operations.
* Boolean and null primitives: {{java:boolean}} and {{java:null}}.

All the primitive types have a fixed size. Thus, the primitive types are limited to a range of values. A smaller primitive type ({{java:byte}}) can contain less values than a bigger one ({{java:long}}).

Integer primitive types silently overflow:

|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-52&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.52: Several operators.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
int i = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
System.out.println(i);
i = i + 1;
System.out.println(i);
System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

-2147483648
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

As Java is strongly typed, you can't assign a floating point number (a number with a decimal point) to an integer variable:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-53&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.53: Setting a floating point number as a value to an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (integer) type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age;
age = 10.5;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A primitive type should be set by an appropriate value. The primitive types can be initialized with a literal. Most of the literals are primitive type values, except [[Java Programming/Literals/String Literals|String Literals]], which are instance of the {{java:String}} class.

== Numbers in computer science ==
Programming may not be as trivial or boring as just crunching huge numbers any more. However, huge chunks of code written in any programming language today, let alone Java, obsessively deal with numbers. Be it churning out huge prime numbers,&lt;ref name=&quot;note-1&quot;&gt;As of edit (11 December 2013), the [[w:Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search|Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] project has so far identified the largest prime number as being 17,425,170 digits long. Prime numbers are valuable to cryptologists as the bigger the number, the securer they can make their data encryption logic using that particular number.&lt;/ref&gt; or just calculating a cost of emission from your scooter. In 1965, [[w:Gemini 5|Gemini V]] space mission escaped a near-fatal accident because of a programming error.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-2&quot;&gt;Gemini 5 landed 130 kilometers short of its planned Pacific Ocean landing point due to a software error. The Earth's rotation rate had been programmed as one revolution per [[w:solar time|solar day]] instead of the correct value, one revolution per [[w:sidereal time|sidereal day]].&lt;/ref&gt; And again in 1979, a computer program calculated the ability of five nuclear reactors to withstand earthquakes as overestimated; this caused the plants to be shut down temporarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-3&quot;&gt;A program used in their design used an arithmetic sum of variables when it should have used the sum of their absolute values. (Evars Witt, &quot;''The Little Computer and the Big Problem''&quot;, AP Newswire, 16 March 1979. See also Peter Neumann, &quot;''An Editorial on Software Correctness and the Social Process''&quot; Software Engineering Notes, Volume 4(2), April 1979, page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; There is one thing common to both these programming errors: the subject data, being computed at the time the errors occurred, was numeric. Out of past experience, Java came bundled with revised type checking for numeric data and puts lots of emphasis on correctly identifying different types of it. So you must recognise the importance of numeric data when it comes to programming.

Numbers are stored in memory using a binary system. The memory is like a grid of cells:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

Each cell can contain a ''binary digit'' (shortened to ''bit''), that is to say, zero or one:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;
|}

Actually, each cell '''does''' contain a binary digit, as one bit is roughly equivalent to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and an empty cell in the memory signifies &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. A single binary digit can only hold two possible values: a zero or a one.

Multiple bits held together can hold multiple permutations &amp;mdash; 2 bits can hold 4 possible values, 3 can hold 8, and so on. For instance, the maximum number 8 bits can hold (&lt;code&gt;11111111&lt;/code&gt; in binary) is &lt;code&gt;255&lt;/code&gt; in the decimal system. So, the numbers from 0 to 255 can fit within 8 bits.

It is all good, but this way, we can only host positive numbers (or unsigned integers). They are called ''unsigned integers''. Unsigned integers are whole number values that are all positive and do not attribute to negative values. For this very reason, we would ask one of the 8 bits to hold information about the sign of the number (positive or negative). This leaves us with just 7 bits to actually count out a number. The maximum number that these 7 bits can hold (&lt;code&gt;1111111&lt;/code&gt;) is &lt;code&gt;127&lt;/code&gt; in the decimal system.

Altogether, using this method, 8 bits can hold numbers ranging from &lt;code&gt;-128&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;127&lt;/code&gt; (including zero) &amp;mdash; a total of 256 numbers. Not a bad pay-off one might presume. The opposite to an unsigned integer is a ''signed integer'' that have the capability of holding both positive and negative values.

But, what about larger numbers. You would need significantly more bits to hold larger numbers. That's where Java's numeric types come into play. Java has multiple numeric types &amp;mdash; their size dependant on the number of bits that are at play.

In Java, numbers are dealt with using data types specially formulated to host numeric data. But before we dive into these types, we must first set some concepts in stone. Just like you did in high school (or even primary school), numbers in Java are placed in clearly distinct groups and systems. As you'd already know by now, number systems includes groups like the ''integer'' numbers (0, 1, 2 ... ∞); ''negative integers'' (0, -1, -2 ... -∞) or even ''real'' and ''rational'' numbers ([[w:Pi|value of Pi]], ¾, 0.333~, etcetera). Java simply tends to place these numbers in two distinct groups, '''integers''' (-∞ ... 0 ... ∞) and '''floating point''' numbers (any number with decimal points or fractional representation). For the moment, we would only look into integer values as they are easier to understand and work with.

== Integer types in Java ==
With what we have learned so far, we will identify the different types of signed integer values that can be created and manipulated in Java. Following is a table of the most basic numeric types: integers. As we have discussed earlier, the data types in Java for integers caters to both positive and negative values and hence are '''signed numeric types'''. The size in bits for a numeric type determines what its minimum and maximum value would be. If in doubt, one can always calculate these values.

Lets see how this new found knowledge of the basic integer types in Java fits into the picture. Say, you want to numerically manipulate the days in a year &amp;mdash; all 365 days. What type would you use? Since the data type &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; only goes up to 127, would you risk giving it a value greater than its allowed maximum. Such decisions might save you from dreaded errors that might occur out of the programmed code. A much more sensible choice for such a numeric operation might be a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;. Oh, why couldn't they make just one data type to hold all kinds of numbers? Wouldn't you ask that question? Well, let's explore why.

When you tell a program you need to use an integer, say even a &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, the Java program allocates a space in the memory. It allocates whole 8 bits of memory. Where it wouldn't seem to matter for today's memory modules that have place for almost a dozen trillion such bits, it matters in other cases. Once allocated that part of the memory gets used and can only be claimed back after the operation is finished. Consider a complicated Java program where the only data type you'd be using would be &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; integers. What happens when there's no space for more memory allocation jobs? Ever heard of the [[w:Stack overflow|Stack Overflow error]]s. That's exactly what happens &amp;mdash; your memory gets completely used up and fast. So, choose your data types with extreme caution.

Enough talk, let's see how you can create a numeric type. A numeric type begins with the type's name (&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and then provides with a name for the allocated space in the memory. Following is how it's done. Say, we need to create a variable to hold the number of days in a year.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-54&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.54: Days in a year.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
short daysInYear = 365;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Here, &lt;code&gt;daysInYear&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the variable that holds &lt;code&gt;365&lt;/code&gt; as it's value, while &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; is the data type for that particular value. Other uses of integer data types in Java might see you write code such as this given below:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-55&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.55: Integer data types in Java.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
byte maxByte = 127;
short maxShort = 32767;
int maxInt = 2147483647;
long maxLong = 9223372036854775807;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Integer numbers and floating point numbers ==
The data types that one can use for integer numbers are &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; but when it comes to floating point numbers, we use &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;. Now that we know that, we can modify the code in the [[#code-section-53|code section 3.53]] as:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-56&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.56: Correct floating point declaration and assignment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double age = 10.5;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Why not &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, you say? If we'd used a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, we would have to append the number with a &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; as a suffix, so &lt;code&gt;10.5&lt;/code&gt; should be &lt;code&gt;10.5f&lt;/code&gt; as in:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-57&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.57: The correct way to define floating point numbers of type &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
float age = 10.5f;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Floating-point math never throws exceptions. Dividing a non-zero value by &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;infinity&lt;/code&gt;. Dividing a non-infinite value by &lt;code&gt;infinity&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Question 3.7''': Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-7&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.7: Primitive type assignments.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
...

a = false;
b = 3.2;
c = 35;
d = -93485L;
e = 'q';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

These are five variables. There are a &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;. Retrieve the type of each one.
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;answer-7&quot;&gt;'''Answer 3.7: Primitive type assignments and declarations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-5&quot;&gt;
boolean a;
double b;
byte c;
long d;
char e;

a = false;
b = 3.2;
c = 35;
d = -93485L;
e = 'q';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
* &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can only be the &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; because only a boolean can handle boolean values.
* &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; can only be the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; because only a char can contain a character.
* &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can only be the &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; because only a double can contain a decimal number here.
* &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; because a &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; can not contain such a low value.
* &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is the remaining one so it is the &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;.

== Data conversion (casting) ==
Data conversion (casting) can happen between two primitive types. There are two kinds of casting:
* Implicit: casting operation is not required; the magnitude of the numeric value is always preserved. However, ''precision'' may be lost when converting from integer to floating point types
* Explicit: casting operation required; the magnitude of the numeric value may not be preserved

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-58&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.58: Implicit casting (int is converted to long, '''casting''' is not needed).'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1 highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
int  i = 65;
long l = i;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-59&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.59: Explicit casting (long is converted to int, '''casting''' is needed).'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
long l = 656666L;
int  i = (int) l;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The following table shows the conversions between primitive types, it shows the casting operation for explicit conversions:

Unlike C, C++ and similar languages, Java can't represent &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; and can't represent &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; as non-zero. Java can't cast from boolean to a non-boolean primitive data type, or vice versa.


For non primitive types:

When you go to a play, the opera, the ballet, or even a concert you notice the people on the stage performing. You may also notice the lighting effects, audio effects, costuming, makeup, and the set the performers are on. All of these things are part of the world of Technical theatre.

Technical theatre encompasses all that goes into making a staged production. The areas of technical theatre are scenery,lighting, properties,costuming,and sound. All of these areas work together in a production to establish the place, time period, and mood of the production. If successful the audience will not even notice many of the technical elements of the show. Instead they will come away having enjoyed the show. However, if one of the areas is incomplete or of a lesser quality than the rest the entire production can suffer. Each area relies on the others for support so it is important that everyone works together and communicates as a team; if the lighting designer uses blue light in their design and the costume designer creates a yellow dress, the audience will see an ugly green dress. Technical theatre therefore depends on teamwork and cross-communication for success.

== People in Technical Theatre ==
To put on a play it takes many people, doing many different jobs. Working together as a team the result can be very impressive. Each production organization is laid out differently, but most have people filling these roles. 

The '''Stage Director''' is the person responsible for the artistic vision, the meaning and thusly the purpose of presenting the production. While not a technical position, the Stage Director is still important in technical production in that he/she  coordinates the artistic efforts of the different designers and actors into one unified vision. 
The '''Production Manager''' works with the Stage Director and the various designers, coordinating all the various design elements,making sure the different designs are carried out as best as possible. This person coordinates the efforts of the different departments, and making certain the production maintins its production schedule and remains within the budget.
The '''Technical Director''' (or TD) works with the Scene designer and Properties designer, supervises the master carpenter and oversees the construction of the set. The TD frequently (in smaller organizations) may also take on other functions, such as supervising the set and props crews .

The '''Designers''' are the people that make the artistic decisions in their respective areas. The '''Scene Designer''' designs the sets for the different scenes. The '''Lighting Designer''' designs how the playing area and the actors will be lit. The '''Properties Designer''' obtains and sometime even creates the hand props held by the actors and props used on the stage. The '''Costume Designer''' designs the clothes that the people will wear, often designing or working closely with the designers of the hair and makeup as well. The '''Sound Designer''' chooses or makes the different sound effects that will play during the show, as well as determining who gets microphones, and how much amplification will be necessary. 

The crew heads are responsible for coordinating the efforts of the different crews of stagehands working under them in the implementation of the designers' work. The '''Master Carpenter''' directs the construction of the set. He/she may also coordinate the people that move the set during scene changes. The '''Scenic Charge''' is the person that oversees the painting of the set. The '''Master Electrician''' makes sure that the lighting instruments get placed where the designer needs them. They also oversee the people operating the lighting control board and any follow spots. The '''Audio Engineer''' oversees the layout of the sound system; during the show they will oversee the operator of the sound boards and make sure any microphones and other sound equipment is working. The '''Properties (or props) Master''' will gather the items that the actors will handle during the performance. Under direction of either the scenic designer they may also in charge of &quot;set dressings&quot; such as tables and chairs that the actors will interact with. The '''Costumer''' will coordinate the making of the costumes and the fitting them on the performers. 

The '''stagehands''' are the people that do the labor. These people are divided into several crews. The carpenters build the set, and move set pieces during the show. The painters paint the set the colors the designer specified. The electricians put the lights in the correct place, run the cables to power them, and operate the control board and any followspots. The audio crew will place speakers and microphones as well as run the cables to power them. In addition, they will operate the sound mixers. The wardrobe mistress supervises the stitchers and drapers who sew and mend and clean the costumes, and the dressers who help the actors get into them. The props crew will make sure the items the actors need are where they are supposed to be, and repair them if they get broken. 

== Set design and Construction ==
The design of a set for a production, often times, is one of the first steps taken by director and designer.  This is due to several issues.  First, the set is one of the few parts of the technical theatre which is specifically dictated by the script.  How many people must be on stage?  How many different entrances must be accommodated?  Where do those entrances lead?  Each of these questions (and others) must be addressed with the set design.  Secondly, the directors must have the set design prior to blocking the play so that the performers are blocked intentionally around the set pieces which will exist.

As with all design elements, the first step in creating a set design is to read the script several times.  The minimum number of times a designer should read the script is three before beginning work on a set design.  The first time through, the designer should read it for the story line and enjoyment.  

The second time through, the designer should begin gathering a better feel for the story.  Where does the story take place?  Are there any major set pieces that must be included?  What entrances and exits must exist?  How much space must be allowed for the number of characters on stage at any given time?

The third time through the script, the designer should begin writing down specifics about the space.  In coordination with the director, choices must be made about where off-stage locations exist, where will the more intense beats or moments take place on stage, and general traffic patterns throughout the space.  

Following this third reading, most designers will create a series of sketches...at least one per location...for the director to review.  These sketches should include not only the set but also stage props and furniture and possibly tentative actor locations for major points in the story.  After getting the director's approval of the sketches, scale drawings must be made.  These should include not just an overhead view of each scene but also front elevations of the scenes and, where necessary for construction, specific cut-away designs of complicated set pieces.  From these scale drawings, many designers will then create scale models so that the directors and designers have three-dimensional models to work from both for the sake of blocking and also building the set pieces.

All of these design steps should also include the lighting designer and scenic designer (in charge of providing the coloring scheme for the sets...sometimes the scenic and set designer is the same person) so that the design schemes for all of the elements are complementary.

==Property design, acquisition-construction==
The prop design of each show depends on the artistic style of both sets and costumes, as well as the requests and needs of the director and/or choreographer. At a first reading of the script, the property designer will make a general list of all mentioned items and those that can be inferred from narration. Basic background research will begin for the look of items from a set period and location. Communication with all departments and designers helps to eliminate various items that overlap into costumes or set Lists. An initial &quot;Prop list&quot; is generated and dispersed to each of the other designers as well as the director, and all relevant parties. After receiving notes from the various departments, the &quot;prop list&quot; is updated and a second reading of the script is done to double check information gathered is consistent with script requirement as written. Research continues and narrows in on items that will require special attention. Budget constraints require that many items be used from stock, borrowed or rented before a purchase of a new item is made. Some items that are not in the company stock and cannot be located are fabricated. Props from a period settings are not always widely available and often require some amount of research to determine what the item is, how it was used and where it can be located.

===Prop===
A property is designated depending on the theatre and the structure of design responsibility set by years of trial and error. It is common for a prop to be defined as anything that is not firmly adhered or 'nailed' down to a piece of setting. This may include all set dressings and furniture as well as hand held &quot;props&quot;. Other theatrical organizations may only designate that which the actor actually picks up as a 'prop'. The range in-between varies. Props may be an item usually associated with another department or require close work with them. Costume pieces may sometimes be the responsibility of the costume department to fabricate and then be tracked in rehearsal and performance by the prop department such as hat and purses, coats that come off or never worn but held as part of the costume. At other times in the script, a dress may be picked up and packed in a suit case on stage and never worn. The prop department would acquire one of the correct period, basic size, etc. and may possibly require the approval of the costume designer. Another example of a possible cross over would be a microphone. If live, it would require input from both the sound and electrics department but may be chosen and tracked by the prop department. The choice of microphone may require the input of the sound designer, set designer and the prop designer. 

In some theatres a prop may be among many different elements layered on top or around each other with backdrops and architectural elements, elaborate costumes, large ensembles as well as lighting. With theatre in the round the elements are distilled down to the most basic elements. The 360 degree &quot;line of site&quot; adds limitations to sets. While costumes may be as elaborate, theatre in the round has a much more limited area then a proscenium and cast size could be limited as well. These are a few reasons that make theatrical properties in this situation stand out more. It also puts a more direct spotlight on the item and in many cases is central to the development of plot or central character. 

Specialized props used as 'sight gags' could be a rubber chicken or a more elaborately conceived notion. Simple looking items, in many cases, require specialized work. Requirements, specific to a production may require an item be 'rigged' in one way or another. A burlap bag may require an inner lining smaller than the outer shell that may be stuffed to emulate content.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Nervous System'''

Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated response to the environment.

Basic unit of the nervous system is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron neuron], a highly specialized cell that uses both electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons &quot;listen&quot; to sensory organs or other neurons, and can simultaneously &quot;hear&quot; from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously. Likewise, a neuron can &quot;talk&quot; to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle cells or glands.

Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by ''glia''. Glia were once thought to only play a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells, and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann cells that provide a myelin sheath.

== Neuron structure ==
[[File:Complete neuron cell diagram en.svg|thumb|Neuron]]
*Dendrite will receive information from other axons
*Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
*Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
*Axon is surrounded by myelin.
**Contains nodes of Ranvier

Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.

Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ influx via channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.  

Synapses

Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neurotransmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.

Example : Neuromuscular synapses

Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia

== Central nervous system ==
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.

Brain
There are four lobes of the brain.
*Frontal lobe - decision making 
*Parietal lobe
*Temporal lobe
*Occipital lobe - vision

The areas of the brain are also dedicated to different functions.
*Precentral gyrus
*Postcentral gyrus

Protection
The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). CSF helps to float the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.

== Peripheral nervous system ==
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.

ANS - Autonomic Nervous System
The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and sympathetic. 

The sympathetic nervous system is the &quot;fight or flight&quot; or fright response and results in an increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the first neuron is short and the second neuron is long. 

The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system. 

Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an effect on the CNS. Drugs act by affecting the neuron and how likely it is to fire an action potential.

Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''If you have an English version of Windows XP and are having problems working with non western fonts this article is for you.'' 

Problem: You want to read and write for example in an Eastern European language but the non-western letters are displaying on the screen incorrectly. 

Why this happens is because Windows picks a default language page code for non-unicode programs. Your default is probably some version of English.

The program you're using is a little dumb, it wasn't written to be used in environments outside of its locale, it's not checking to see if it's using the right font version. So you need to change the default page code for non-unicode applications.

# go to control panel and select regional settings.
# select the advanced tab. 

It has a drop down box which probably says English, this needs to change to your desired language. In my case this was Polish. 

If it's not an option, you might need to change the input method to Polish too; on a Polish keyboard you can change this back to default to an English layout. Once this has been changed, applied and okayed you probably need to restart Windows. 

Try your program and hopefully this time your desired languages letters should be shown instead of the random symbols found in the western version of the font. 

For writing in the desired language use the language bar to swap between keyboard layouts. Substitute your desired language for Polish in this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi I spend a lot of time figuring out how to do things and search all over to find the information to do something. 

when I find out I could just leave it at that I have solved my problem 
however I feel it's better to make the solution open and easy to find for anyone. This seems an Ideal location to transform my many hours of digging into a few minutes light reading for someone else to solve similar problems

I also have a terrible memory and It's likely that a particular problem will crop up again within a couple of years for me and I have to dig again :)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Blackest knight. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Blackest knight~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

To enable iTunes to play [[w:Ogg|Ogg]] files, install the official [[w:Xiph QuickTime Components|Xiph QuickTime Components]]. This is straightforward, as outlined below.

If you wish to also associate a file type with Ogg, the process is somewhat more involved; see below.

==Install components==
# Make sure iTunes is not running.
# Install the official [[w:Xiph QuickTime Components|Xiph QuickTime Components]] from [http://www.xiph.org/quicktime/download.html Xiph.org]. iTunes is a [[w:QuickTime|QuickTime]] based application, these components and frameworks allow any QuickTime application to play Ogg files for that matter.
#Files may be dragged into the iTunes Library window or added via the '''File &gt; Add to Library…''' command.
#Enjoy your new music!

=== Conflicts ===
If you have installed older QuickTime Ogg components, there may be conflicts, so you will want to remove these. Read the installation/uninstallation instructions that came with the older packages, or check in the following directory for files with &lt;tt&gt;Ogg&lt;/tt&gt; in the name, and remove them: &lt;tt&gt;/Library/Components, /Library/QuickTime,&lt;/tt&gt; and similarly in your home directory.

==File type association – advanced==
iTunes by default does not have a file type association with Ogg files despite the fact that it has an Ogg icon. Enabling the association in [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] requires editing the &lt;tt&gt;Info.plist&lt;/tt&gt; file with a [[w:text editor|text editor]], not [[w:Property List Editor|Property List Editor]] (as it does not support copying and pasting branches of the XML tree).

#Right click on iTunes.app and choose &quot;Show Package Contents&quot;, open the Contents folder and then select the Info.plist file and make a copy of it.
&lt;!-- Further steps to be posted after I find the issue of macaddict that deals with this or I do it myself --&gt;
&lt;!-- Anyone know what the UTI is for Ogg? org.xiph.ogg? --&gt;
Modify your Info.plist by adding this :
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeExtensions&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;array&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;ogg&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;/array&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeIconFile&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;iTunes-generic.icns&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeName&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;OGG Audio File&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeOSTypes&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;array&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;ogg!&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;OGG!&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;ogg&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;OGG&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;Ogg &lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;/array&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeRole&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;Editor&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;LSIsAppleDefaultForType&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;Yes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can change the icon if you want also.

=Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence=

White is temporarily a pawn down. He may put this immediately to rights with:

:[[/4. Nxe4/]]

following up the inevitable 4...d5 with 5. Bxd5. But then 5...Qxd5, and the knight finds itself pinned against the vulnerable g2 square and must be defended with the weakening 6. f3 - not the kind of contortions White wants to be getting into as he tries to undermine Black's centre. So Nxe4 should not be played with the intention of recovering the pawn. By extension, White's solid third move was in fact a gambit!

The more active response to the loss of the pawn is

:[[/4. Qh5/]]!

And as White seeks to enact revenge with a series of checkmate threats, all hell breaks loose. This is one of the sharpest of all chess variations, right along side such bloodthirsty openings as the Sicilian Dragon and Evans Gambit.

At low playing levels, a variant commonly seen is [[/4. Bxf7/]]?!, followed by 4...Kxf7 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Qh5+ Kg8. With this method, White recovers the pawn, but his opponent has a powerful pawn centre, and his slightly exposed King does not offer enough compensation to White (7. Ng5 Qe7).&lt;ref&gt;Ludek Pachman, ''Eröffnungspraxis im Schach''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Football''' (also known as soccer or association football) is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score goals by using any part of the body besides the arms and hands to get the football into the opposing goal.

The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Other players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. 

If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organises a World Cup every four years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Holistic economics==

The economic history of the world is the entire history of the world, but seen from a certain vantage point; that of the economy. The ecological history of the world is the history of the world seen from an environmental viewpoint. Increasingly, this environmental viewpoint takes in the place of Homo sapiens in the entire cosmos.  To choose one or other vantage point, and no other, is of course to favour from the start a one-sided form of explanation.  However, economists and historians have stopped thinking of economics as a self-contained discipline and of economic history as a neatly defined body of knowledge, which one could study in isolation from other subjects. Economists cannot properly grasp economic phenomena unless they go beyond the economy.  With regard to political economy, which in the 19th century appeared to concern only material goods, it has turned out to embrace the social system as a whole, being related to everything in society.  The same can be said of biologists with respect to ecology, with its history of evolution, which is no longer regarded as primarily science, but as a philosophy of inter-relatedness. 

Political culture is an important variable in the analysis of the relationships between culture and ecology as it suggests underlying beliefs, values and opinions, which a group of people holds dear (such as shared ethnic and religious affinities).  For example, Catholicism treats the individual as social and transcendent.

Economics and ecology come together at their common linguistic root, ‘oikos’, which in both cases signifies a space where a complex of activities is undertaken concerned with the consumption of natural resources and their transformation for production and distribution.  

===Management===

Solidarity in human societies resides in the organisations established to manage the utilisation of natural resources.  Management, as a specific pattern of human activities, emerges in the archaic use of the word economy to define the ordering of household affairs; (via Latin from Greek oikonomia; domestic management, from oikos house + -nomia, from nemein to manage). Managerial behaviour, involves the setting of targets and the marshalling of inputs necessary to overcome limiting environmental factors.  It is central to activities that turn environmental resources into food, goods and services. Ecology comes from the same etymological root. As a human scientific endeavour it has prompted new institutions and organisations in society by which ecological thinking can be directed to manage ecosystems as human goods. In this respect, applied ecology is a powerful feedback from science to force cultural changes in the use of habitats and species. 

Tension within society comes, on the one hand, from the managerial applications of science for the commodification and industrialisation of nature, and on the other, to the applications of ecology for the preservation of intrinsic value in the living world. These two rival views of the relationship between humans and nature define the area of cultural ecology.

From all of these viewpoints, applied ecology is influencing the formation of new social organisations and their cultural expressions through managerialism as global and local strategies and site operations.  Some of these changes in society and culture come about because of direct applications of science.  However, other movements, such as 'deep ecology', with their promotion of intrinsic value in ecological order, do not come directly out of the science of ecology, but are suggested, inspired and fortified, by ecological ideas.  In native cultures their ideological aspects comprised beliefs, rituals, magical practices, art, ethics, religion and myths. These defined the permissible and acceptable relationships with nature, and they were part of local systems for conserving resources. In industrialised societies this role has been taken over by the cultural package of 'nature conservation', which includes the philosophies and legal systems of society directed at supporting order in habitats and their species.   This is the web of perception and action that locks individuals together in geographical space as societies.  It is focused on balancing the exploitation of environmental resources for production with the conservation of resources to ensure survival of the community.  This balancing act involves technological, sociological and ideological management systems.

The technological aspect of management is concerned with tools, materials and machines. The sociological aspect involves the relationships into which people enter especially in work and in the family. These two aspects encompass topics that deal respectively with the exploitation of resources through production and demand.  Changes in technology and social organisation will bring forth changes in the ideas and beliefs that connect people with local and planetary resources, and also define humans in the wider cosmos, but such ideas will always feed back on the social organisation, which moves forward.

The ideological aspects of the conservation of resources are expressed

* through ideas about 'nature' and 'place', as these have developed historically to provide philosophical, artistic and spiritual values for present day environmentalism;
* through science, as applied ecology; 
* and through ‘living in nature’ and applying traditional ecological knowledge to realise global and local strategies of resource management. 

All these aspects define the two major routes of Western reasoning about nature. On the one hand, since the 18th century, there has been a ready acceptance of the scientific drive for the domination of nature. On the other hand, the environmental outcomes of this mode of activity has precipitated the ecological search for intrinsic value and its preservation.  These two rival views of the relationship between humans and nature define a fluid mind-map to steer a global society toward sustainability. The rivalry comes from fragmentation of civil society in the pursuit of profit and status. Only as conscious agents of a cultural revolution, which promotes a balanced synthesis of the exploitative and conserving segments of society, can we harness our species' ecological potential for a sustainable future.

The twentieth century opened with a revolution in humankind’s attitude to the environment. It sprang spontaneously from all branches of culture and from all countries across a Europe.  The discoveries of Einstein in outer space corresponded with those of Jung into the inner space of the subconscious. Biology began to shape the modern perspective of our place in nature.  The arts themselves exploded into a new environmental dimension. No longer was the inquiring mind satisfied with appearance.  Scientists and artists began to define the relationship between people and environment that was more comprehensive than the search for natural resources. Thus artists, such as Paul Klee and Jean Miro, set out to combine the invisible with the visible, the abstract with the figurative. They let themselves be invaded by the living world and then processed it in a very subjective manner.

===The cosmic adventure===
 
There are profound connections between stars, atoms and life that place human culture in the grand outline of the development of the universe.  This perspective has been called the 'cosmic adventure'.  

The adventure began in a hot and undifferentiated broth of radiation. Eventually, on our tiny planet in a remote corner of a small galaxy, there developed the incredible complexity of life, consciousness and culture.  We now appreciate that the universe has moved toward increasingly more intense forms of ordered novelty.   In this respect, we can say that it does have a direction, particularly here on Earth, where there is significantly more ordered variety than there was three minutes after the big bang. We have arrived throughout the fifteen billion years of cosmic development as part of a process that has kept a balance between pairs of primeval qualities.  These qualities are:

* harmony and contrast;  
* order and unpredictability; 
* unity and complexity; 
* pattern and nuance; 
* homogeneity and diversity; 
* stability and novelty.  

The existence of the universe and everything in it depends on the internal ordering, or tuning of its components.  As far as we can see, it was six numbers imprinted in the 'big bang' that have maintained the trajectory of cosmic ecology as a balance of qualities. Two of the numbers relate to the basic forces; two fix the size and the overall texture of the universe and determine whether it will continue forever, and two more fix the properties of space itself.  If any one of these numbers was slightly different at the start there would be no stars and no life.  Our universe is a rarity with the right combination of the key numbers to ensure that it survives and has developed as an intricately structured whole. Terrestrial evolution is the story of one such molecular outcome, as are the political and technological endeavours of nations of the earth are the social outcomes.

Physics and chemistry existed before human evolution and in this sense they define the non-human purpose of the cosmos as a physico-chemical process.  Therefore, in thinking about cosmic purpose we must separate ourselves from the modern bias that nature is a value- neutral canvas.  It does not remain blank until we have painted it with our cultural and political inventions.  The core of human distinctiveness is that we are capable of thinking about the internal ordering of the universe and our planetary systems so as to understand how these qualities are expressed.  We are also able to add value to them.

This attitude has an important bearing on the way we view our social and biological heritage in their cosmic, ecological and social dimensions. There are currently two views about the direction of cosmic development and our place in it.  After the universe was energised from the void, the ordering of novelty followed the sequence of energy, particles, stars, planets, materials and life forms.  Process theology takes the view that a programme of development according to divine will governed the direction.  Process humanism takes the view that our universe is just one of an infinity of universes bubbling up at random from the void. Most would be untuned.  

Process theology says that the self-creativity of all constituents of the cosmos willed by God deserve our care because they are especially intense actualisations of divinely inspired creativity and cosmic beauty.  When nature suffers, God suffers.

Process humanism says that to gain an appropriate sense of our human worth we need to become aware of our creative potential to work towards global order.  Therefore, intervention to maintain a balance of qualities that define our biological and social heritage, by ordering novelty and unifying complexity, is actually a small part of the grand cosmic purpose. 

Both points of view provide us with a knowledge framework for applying ecological thinking to culture that is deeply rooted in cosmology. Also, they recapture the ancient spiritual sense that we live in a meaningful and intrinsically valuable world and do so in a manner entirely consonant with contemporary science.  Humanity's origins and practical capabilities require it to participate in sustaining the cosmic process as a balance of qualities that define our place in nature as much as our attitudes to the use of nature expressed in technology, art, architecture and literature.  In particular, this vision involves recognising that conservation of biodiversity is not just for humans or valueless apart from them.

==Social applications of ecology==

Ecology deals with the interactions between species and the necessary conditions of existence in the environment to which they are adapted. These adaptations comprise webs of perception and action evolved to ensure resources are available to maintain growth and reproduction. Behavioural interactions are at the heart of the interactions where they function to unite individuals into more or less stable social structures. In particular, behaviour determines and regulates the relations of individuals to one another. It provides such external adaptations to the physical environment, and such internal adaptations between the component individuals or groups to make possible an ordered social life. Each species has a behaviour structure that is an evolved harmonious whole in order to maintain the sum of its parts in biochemical equilibrium with its environment. This structure survives and flourishes because it successfully maintains external social solidarity among its members, and chemical integrity amongst its internal organs and cells.

'Ecology' is used to define a particular type or branch of the relationship between living organisms and their environment e.g. aquatic ecology; avian ecology.  Where the species is a community of Homo sapiens, sharing a common heritage of ideas, beliefs values and knowledge, the interrelationship is called cultural ecology.  It includes an environmental complex of human activities undertaken for profit. The activities are concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services and the management of natural resources (land, forest, water), finances, income, and expenditure of a community, business enterprise, etc.  This highlights the fact that the subject matter of both ecology and economics, which are themselves interrelated, cannot be isolated from all the other social, ideological and political problems. Evidence for this are the categories of ‘political ecology’ and ‘social ecology’, which have emerged from the social sciences, to highlight the relationships between political and social organisations and environmental issues.

Applied ecology, being an instrumental mode of systems thinking, has a role to play, as behavioural structures in stabilising the humankind-nature relationship.  It is central to an educational system for sustainability, which presents exploitative management and conservation management as two sides of the coin of economic development.  Applied ecology provides the operational tools for environmental organisations and institutions interacting within a society, and constituting it.  It thereby contributes to group solidarity for planetary survival by providing practical solutions to the challenges of the industrialised environment.  A full understanding requires placing applied ecology in the context of systems thinking about the organisation of natural resources and people for production.  It is about providing tools for modifying human production by people who are organising for nature conservation. Ecology drives national, and global strategies by which these groups respond to ethical values in nature.

===Cultural ecology=== 

Culture first emerges within the ecosystems of primates where it is expressed in the learned group behaviours of food- gathering and display, which are local to a species in a certain place. In humans, culture appeared as the integrated system of learned behaviour patterns characteristic of members of a society. The system of behaviour constitutes a way of life of any given social group. It is also a social heritage, transmitted from generation to generation by individuals and organisations.  This heritage is instilled into the minds of the young, not only by initiation and education, but also by the long, unconscious conditioning whereby each individual becomes the person he/she ultimately is. It thus becomes a form of social heredity. As an evolved harmonious whole it ensures that all the institutions interacting within a society, and constituting it, contribute to group solidarity.

New relationships are being forged between culture and ecology in response to social concerns that arise because of the present state of the earth household.  One of these responses is the concept of ‘sustainability’, which is not a scientific term, but more a focus of social problems arising from the large-scale use of natural resources. These issues can only be solved by new social organisations, local and global, established to manage industrial production within the limitations of Earth’s ecological infrastructure.   There also has to be a new holistic cross-disciplinary social model, where knowledge about human social evolution is categorised to connect the social sciences with disciplines such as law, history, geography, education, and biology.  A start in this direction was made by Ramchandra Guha (1994) who argues in favour of creating an ‘environmentally orientated sociology’ for a world in environmental crisis by placing ecological infrastructure at the base of the traditional pyramidal model of society.  

In such a pyramid, consisting of ‘nature’, ‘society’ and ‘culture, the two functional pillars of social organisation are the organisation of people for production (political economy) and the organisation of natural resources for production (natural economy).  Both of these economies draw upon what may be called the planetary economy. This model of cultural ecology is provisionally set out in Fig 11.1.  Geographers and anthropologists mean different (but complementary) things by &quot;cultural ecology.&quot; In general, &quot;cultural ecology&quot; studies the relationship between a given society and its natural environment. But geographers generally mean the study of how socially organized human activities affect the natural environment; anthropologists generally mean the study of how the natural environment affects socially organized behaviours (although, at its extreme, environmental determinism has fallen out of favour among most anthropologists).

===Social organisation===

Wherever we find a community, however primitive, however complex, we find more than an association of individuals, each pursuing a personal own life and possessing personal ideas; we find a social pattern, a coherent body of customs and ideas, an integrated unity or system in which each element has a definite function in relation to the whole environment, physical, biological and social.

But what determines the pattern? The anthropological explanation is 'the necessary conditions of existence of the social organism'. To this the social institutions must correspond. In turn, the necessary conditions of existence, at any stage of social development, depend on the geographical situation and the level of technology. This is true from the Stone Age to the present age of industrialism. Basic to every form of social organization is the method of obtaining those items essential for human survival. In other words, how do the people of a particular society exploit natural resources to produce their food, clothing, tools, and other items that they need in order to live as human beings?

These 'necessary conditions of existence' shape the relationship of people to each other and their command of natural resources. Individuals utilize nature, directly or indirectly, to produce the necessities of life, not in isolation from each other, not as separate individuals, but in common groups and societies with shared, or conflicting, cultural norms.

====Political ecology====

Political ecology is an umbrella term for a variety of projects that involve politics and the natural environment. ese projects generally fall within one of three types:
* attempts to study politics using the language and methods of [[ecology]] (in other words, the claim that, like species of plants and animals, societies and states can only be understood in terms of their place in a larger system including other societies or states)
* the study of political struggles for control over natural resources, or of political struggles whose outcome is determined by differential access to natural resources
* research on biodiversity and natural resource exploitation that is intended to inform public policy.

When geographers and anthropologists refer to &quot;political economy,&quot; they generally mean the study of how different polities (states or societies) in different parts of the world are actually parts of a global structure through which one polity exploits another polity. This approach to political economy comes out of the works of Immanuel Wallerstein and Andre Gundar Frank, who argues that European development was made possible by the underdevelopment or impoverishment of non-European societies.

Geographical and anthropological political ecologists argue that a cultural ecology informed by political economy will:

* look at cultures not only in their natural environment, but in their political environment as well
* look at how unequal relations among societies affect the natural environment
* look at how unequal relations (especially [[Social class|class]] relations) within a culture affect the environment

====Social ecology====

''This section is the first five paragraphs from an open article entitled ‘A Social Ecology’ by John Clark in M. Zimmerman et al., Environmental Philosophy, second edition (Prentice Hall, 1997)''

&quot;Humanity is Nature achieving self-consciousness.&quot; --Elisée Reclus

In its deepest and most authentic sense, a social ecology is the awakening earth community reflecting on itself, uncovering its history, exploring its present predicament, and contemplating its future. One aspect of this awakening is a process of philosophical reflection. As a philosophical approach, a social ecology investigates the ontological, epistemological, ethical and political dimensions of the relationship between the social and the ecological, and seeks the practical wisdom that results from such reflection. It seeks to give us, as beings situated in the course of real human and natural history, guidance in facing specific challenges and opportunities. In doing so, it develops an analysis that is both holistic and dialectical, and a social practice that might best be described as an eco-communitarianism.

===== The Social and the Ecological =====
A social ecology is first of all, an ecology. There are strong communitarian implications in the very term ecology. Literally, it means the logos, the reflection on or study of, the oikos, or household. Ecology thus calls upon us to begin to think of the entire planet as a kind of community of which we are members. It tells us that all of our policies and problems are in a sense &quot;domestic&quot; ones. While a social ecology sometimes loses its bearings as it focuses on specific social concerns, when it is consistent it always situates those concerns within the context of the earth household, whatever else it may study within that community. The dialectical approach of a social ecology requires social ecologists to consider the ecological dimensions of all &quot;social&quot; phenomena. There are no &quot;non-ecological&quot; social phenomena to consider apart from the ecological ones.

In some ways, the term &quot;social&quot; in &quot;social ecology&quot; is the more problematical one. There is a seeming paradox in the use of the term &quot;social&quot; for what is actually a strongly communitarian tradition. Traditionally, the &quot;social&quot; realm has been counterposed to the &quot;communal&quot; one, as in Tönnies' famous distinction between society and community, Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft. Yet this apparent self-contradiction may be a path to a deeper truth. A social ecology is a project of reclaiming the communitarian dimensions of the social, and it is therefore appropriate that it seek to recover the communal linguistic heritage of the very term itself. &quot;Social&quot; is derived from &quot;socius,&quot; or &quot;companion.&quot; A &quot;society&quot; is thus a relationship between companions--in a sense, it is itself a household within the earth household.

===== An Evolving Theory =====
Over the past quarter-century, a broad social and ecological philosophy has emerged under the name &quot;social ecology.&quot; While this philosophy has recently been most closely associated with the thought of social theorist Murray Bookchin, it continues a long tradition of ecological communitarian thought going back well into the nineteenth century. The lineage of social ecology is often thought to originate in the mutualistic, communitarian ideas of the anarchist geographer Kropotkin (1842-1921). One can certainly not deny that despite Kropotkin's positivistic tendencies and his problematical conception of nature, he has an important relationship to social ecology. His ideas concerning mutual aid, political and economic decentralization, human-scaled production, communitarian values, and the history of democracy have all made important contributions to the tradition. However, it is rooted much more deeply in the thought of another great anarchist thinker, the French geographer Elisée Reclus (1830-1905). During the latter half of the last century, and into the beginning of the present one, Reclus developed a far-ranging &quot;social geography&quot; that laid the foundations of a social ecology, as it explored the history of the interaction between human society and the natural world, starting with the emergence of homo sapiens and extending to Reclus' own era of urbanization, technological development, political and economic globalization, and embryonic international cooperation.

Reclus envisioned humanity achieving a free, communitarian society in harmony with the natural world. His extensive historical studies trace the long record of experiments in cooperation, direct democracy and human freedom, from the ancient Greek polis, through Icelandic democracy, medieval free cities and independent Swiss cantons, to modern movements for social transformation and human emancipation. At the same time, he depicts the rise and development of the modern centralized state, concentrated capital and authoritarian ideologies. His sweeping historical account includes an extensive critique of both capitalism and authoritarian socialism from an egalitarian and anti-authoritarian perspective, and an analysis of the destructive ecological effects of modern technology and industry allied with the power of capital and the state. It is notable that a century ago Reclus' social theory attempted to reconcile a concern for justice in human society with compassionate treatment of other species and respect for the whole of life on earth; a philosophical problem that has only recently remerged in ecophilosophy and environmental ethics. 

==Historical models of communitarianism==

Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.  In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected with, and supporting, a transport system based on private cars. Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years. Climatic change has started to unfold and the world is not a unified community with powers to produce a global technological fix.  Many are beginning to believe that in this scenario, sustainable development, with its adherence to annual year on year increases in spending power, is pointing in the wrong direction. Rather, what is needed is a sustainable economic retreat. This will require global strategies to adjust the relationship between production systems and natural resources to generate rates of waste emission that the biosphere can assimilate. 

In contrast, a market town in the 1850s was a small balanced community.  It represented the oldest kind of human institution, found absolutely everywhere throughout the world in all kinds of societies. Since the late Palaeolithic more than 100 billion human beings have lived on earth and the majority have spent their entire life as members of very small groups, rarely of more than a few hundred persons.  Their production systems were each composed of few people.  This picture is the staring point for ideas that there is a basic human need for small communities, which is encoded in our genes.  It is in our behavioural makeup that we still orientate towards a group; the small group of the village and the tribe.  Rural communities in the British 2001 Population Census are still small, yet market towns with their surrounding villages now lack any sense of communal focus or scale of production.  Their fragmented residential, commercial and cultural centres emphasise transportation by car so that the inhabitants also lack any sense of pedestrian scale.  Village and town are no longer serving as magnets for both people and ideas. People now seem to like isolation.  New housing infills are socially sterile. Everything is new clean and neat. Neighbours are usually only glimpsed as they walk to the car. Each house is a small fortress equipped with a barking dog or alarm system. The only visible activity is macho man cutting his lawns.  There are obviously great differences between old and new.  Leaving aside the crushing poverty, we can legitimately ask if a pre-industrial community was really a haven of creativity and neighbourly harmony, which could serve as a planning model for today’s social ills.  Have we really lost a unique combination of unity with social, visual and ecological variety?  Is there an historical small-town target that modern planners should use for social and ecological regeneration?  Planners, since their profession emerged in the late 19th century, have thought so. Nineteenth century society was based on ideas of mutual aid, political and economic decentralisation, human-scaled production and communitarian ideas (Fig 11.2). 

Fig 11.2 A small-town model of communitarianism.

[[Image:Fig11.2.jpg]]
 
These ideas of social ecology, as a recipe for human life, were first articulated at the end of the 19th century for an improved cooperative economy by the Russian geographer Peter Kropokin.  The Scottish planner, Patrick Geddes and his pupil Lewis Mumford developed them in Britain.  Americans have followed this path since the 1990s to restore the integrity of their basic institutions and turn back disturbing trends toward crime, social disorder, and family breakdown. The past decade has been an era of important social reforms: in the schools, in the criminal justice system, in family policy. In states and localities across the U.S.A, citizens have fought for greater emphasis on character, individual responsibility, and virtues and values in the public square. Partly as a result, on a host of &quot;leading social indicators”, such as rates of violent crime, rates of youth crime, levels of teenage pregnancy, and even student test scores, the nation is showing incremental but significant improvements. 

Communitarian ideas and policy approaches have been playing a major role in this growing North American movement of cultural and institutional regeneration. Communitarian thinkers are in the forefront of the ‘Character Education Movement’, which is fostering a return to the teaching of good personal conduct and individual responsibility in thousands of schools around the country. Likewise, communitarians have been playing a role in the new community-based approaches to criminal justice, which are showing solid success in restoring neighbourhood order and achieving real reductions in violent crime. In the area of family policy, communitarians have worked for policies to strengthen families and discourage divorce. They have led in devising fresh, incentive-based policies designed to discourage a casual approach to marriage and to promote &quot;children-first&quot; thinking and family stability, while at the same time preserving the rights of women and men.  The need for action has now reached the large politically influential community of the Evangelical Church, where a group of leaders, convinced of the science behind climate change, is trying to persuade its local membership to reduce their domestic carbon emissions.  Communitarianism has become a part of one of the most innovative movements working to renew and revitalize American society.

Yesterday in every town is now a piece of the history of this movement, and everyone who lived through the past twenty-four hours holds some of the public evidence that could be put towards learning about the past to better understand the present and shape the future.  The history of communities is in the making; it is not a dead thing to be pulled out and praised or deplored; it is the inhabitants who are custodians of the past, by the recording of the present. To make history part of the community’s social toolkit there has to be a reorientation of history towards ecology.  Social ecology is nothing more than an environmentally orientated study of a community, which explores a timeline of the relations between ecological infrastructure, politics, community organisations, the economy and culture.  The creation of small town models is therefore an important practical aim for the enrichment of cultural ecology as an educational resource.

==Systems thinking==

A '''system''' is any group of interdependent or interacting ''parts''. '''Parts''' are generally systems themselves and are composed of other parts, just as systems are generally parts or ''components'' of other systems. Systems thinkers consider that:

* a &quot;system&quot; is a dynamic and complex whole, interacting as a structured functional unit
* information flows between the different elements that compose the system 
* a system is a community situated within an environment
* information flows from and to the surrounding environment via semi-permeable membranes or boundaries
* systems are often composed of entities seeking equilibrium, but can exhibit oscillating, chaotic, growth or decay behaviours.

Systems thinking techniques may be used to study any kind of system; natural, scientific, social, or conceptual.  It was the biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s concepts of an open system and general systems theory that established systems thinking as a major scientific movement.  He set out to replace the mechanistic foundations of science with the following holistic vision:

“General system theory is a general science of ‘wholeness’ which up till now was considered a vague, hazy, and semi-metaphysical concept.  In elaborate form it would be a mathematical discipline in itself purely formal but applicable to the various empirical sciences.  For sciences concerned with ‘organized wholes’, it would be of similar significance to that which probability theory has for sciences concerned with ‘chance events’ (Berlalanffy, 1968).

The advantages of systems thinking are:

* It helps explain why changing a system frequently leads to counterintuitive system responses.  For example [[feedback loop]]s may operate to either keep the organization in check or unbalance it.
* Traditional decision-making tends to involve linear cause and effect relationships. By taking a systems approach, we can see the whole complex of bidirectional interrelationships. Instead of analysing a problem in terms of an input and an output, for example, we look at the whole system of inputs, processes, outputs, feedback, and controls. This larger picture will typically provide more useful results than traditional methods.
*  Systems thinking also helps integrate the temporal dimension of any decision. Instead of looking at discrete &quot;snapshots&quot; at points in time, a systems methodology will allow us to see change as a continuous process.
*Systems thinking  aims to gain insights into the whole by understanding the linkages and interactions between the elements that comprise the whole &quot;system&quot;.  
* Systems thinking can help avoid the silo effect, where a lack of organisational communication can cause a change in one area of a system to adversely affect another area of the system.

These advantages are particularly valuable in studying the evolution and organisation of ecosystems.  In this respect, some of the basic principles of ecology, such as interdependence, recycling, resilience and diversity are concerned with processes organised as open systems.  In communities, information and ideas flow through networks of systems with feedback loops, which enable individuals and organisations to adapt to changing situations.  In this respect, systems thinking, which is behind theories of biological complexity and Earth’s self-sustaining properties, also provides foundations for conservation policies and action plans.

==Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence==

Black is threatened with Qf7#. He has seven legal moves that prevent this - surely one of them must allow him to avoid ruin?

:4...Qe7 and 4...Qf6 allow Nxe4 winning a piece, as without the queen to defend d5 the fork trick has had its prongs bent. 
:4...g6 allows Qxe5+ picking up the knight.
:4...Ke7 allows Qxe5# picking up the game.
:4...d5 gives the pawn back for nothing as after 5. Bxd5 the threat is renewed.
:4...Ng5 is met by 5. d4 forcing the knight to e6. Even if knight and king both survive the subsequent complications, White can regain the pawn and enjoy a whopping lead in development.

So by a process of elimination, it has to be

:[[/4...Nd6/]]

Which has the enormous attraction of attacking the undefended c4 bishop.

=Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence=

White has had the tables rudely turned on him! White must move the bishop or allow Black to free himself by capturing it. Keeping up the pressure on f7 would be a good idea, and for reasons that will emerge later he wishes to keep d5 free...

:[[/5. Bb3/]]

[[/5. Qxe5/]] is also plausible but is a complete anti-climax; once the queens are exchanged (5. ... Qe7 6. Qxe7 Bxe7) Black's game will be easier by orders of magnitude. If black needs more action, he can try 5. ...Be7 6. Qxg7 Bf6 7. Qg4 Nc6 (threatening Ne5 and Nd4 attacking c2) but after
8. Bc2 Black has about nothing for the pawn (the Knight d6 blocking the d-pawn does not allow a faster development and the king is not safe).

'''The Purposes of the United Nations are:'''

#To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace; 
#To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace; 
#To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and 
#To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends. 

== Article 2 ==

'''The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance with the following Principles.''' 

#The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. 
#All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter. 
#All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered. 
#All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. 
#All Members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter, and shall refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action. 
#The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security. 
#Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter Vll.

==Vienna Game, Falkbeer Defence==

The position is imbalanced; Black is ahead by a pawn but behind in development. In searching for his next move he may choose two radically different developments: with

:[[/5...Nc6/]],

an apparently strength-cementing move, he enters into an extremely tactical opening, the so-called Frankenstein-Dracula variation, leading to a forced exchange sacrifice and a highly sharp position. On the contrary, with 

:[[/5...Be7/]] 

he opts for a quiet continuation.

The General Assembly may, nevertheless, permit such a Member to vote if it is satisfied that the failure to pay is due to conditions beyond the control of the Member. 


Procedure

=== Article 20 ===

Could this example be a bit confusing to newbies to the language? --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 12:44, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

==Questions==

How do you use the distance program in eclipse?  It isn't obvious how points can be entered the command prompt seems unresponsive.

- Any ideas? [[User:161.112.83.102|161.112.83.102]] 10:40, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

This didn't compile for me until I changed:

...
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
   private static int intValue(String data)
   {
     return Integer.parseInt(data);
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

To:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
   private static int intValue(String data)
   {
     return java.lang.Integer.parseInt(data);
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

That said I really don't know what I'm doing here, and just got the idea to try that off of some random googling.  Should the page be changed, or maybe there's a better fix.  --[[User:Keithonearth|Keithonearth]] ([[User talk:Keithonearth|talk]]) 19:09, 21 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Java allows users to document the classes and the members by using a particular syntax of comment.

== Syntax ==
A documentation comment is framed by slash-star-star and star-slash (i.e. /** ... */). The documentation is in the HTML format.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 8.1: Example.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-3, 5&quot;&gt;
/**
 *  A class to give an &lt;b&gt;example&lt;/b&gt; of HTML documentation.
 */
public class Example {
    /** ...Documentation of a member with the type integer named example... */
    public int example;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A documentation comment is placed just above the commented entity (class, constructor, method, field).

In a documentation comment, the first part is a description text in the HTML format. The second part is a list of special attributes whose name starts with an at sign (@):

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-1&quot;&gt;'''Code section 8.1: Documentation comment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-6&quot;&gt;
/**
 *  Get the sum of two integers.
 *  @param a The first integer number.
 *  @param b The second integer number.
 *  @return The value of the sum of the two given integers.
 */
public int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
;&lt;code&gt;Get the sum of two integers.&lt;/code&gt;: Description of the sum method.
;&lt;code&gt;@param a The first integer number.&lt;/code&gt;: Description attribute of the parameter a of the method.
;&lt;code&gt;@param b The second integer number.&lt;/code&gt;: Description attribute of the parameter b of the method.
;&lt;code&gt;@return The value of the sum of the two given integers.&lt;/code&gt;: Description attribute of the value returned by the method.

Here is a non exhaustive list of special attributes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
! Attribute and syntax
! In a comment of ...
! Description
|-
| @author ''author''
| class
| Name of the author of the class.
|-
| @version ''version''
| class
| Version of the class.
|-
| @deprecated ''description''
| class, constructor, method, field
| Flags the entity as deprecated (old version), describes why and by what replace it.

If the entity flagged as deprecated by this attribute is used, the compiler give a warning.
|-
| @see ''reference''
| class, constructor, method, field
| Add a link in the section &quot;See also&quot;.
|-
| @param ''id description''
| constructor and method
| Describes the method parameter.
|-
| @return ''description''
| method
| Describes the value returned by the method.
|-
| @exception ''type description''
| constructor and method
| Describes the reason of the throw of an exception of the specified type (&lt;code&gt;throws&lt;/code&gt; clause).
|}

See also [[Java Programming/Annotations/Introduction|annotations]] since Java 5.

== Documentation ==
The JDK provides a tool named javadoc which allows to generate the documentation of the well commented classes. The javadoc command without argument give the complete syntax of the command.

Example : for a class named &lt;code&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt; defined in a package named &lt;code&gt;org.wikibooks.en&lt;/code&gt; dans le fichier &lt;code&gt;C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\Example.java&lt;/code&gt; :

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-2&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 8.2: Example.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en;

/**
 *  An example class.
 */
public class Example {
    /**
    Get the sum of two integers.
    @param a The first integer number.
    @param b The second integer number.
    @return The value of the sum of the two given integers.
    */
    public int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The documentation can be generated in a specific folder (C:\ProgDoc for example) with the following command:
{{XConsole|1=&lt;span id=&quot;command-1&quot;&gt;'''Command 8.1: Documentation generation'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ javadoc -locale en_US -use -classpath C:\ProgJava -sourcepath C:\ProgJava -d C:\ProgDoc org.wikibooks.en
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

The options of this command are described below:
;&lt;code&gt;-locale en_US&lt;/code&gt;: The documentation in US English.
;&lt;code&gt;-use&lt;/code&gt;: Create the pages about the use of the classes and the packages.
;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;-classpath C:\ProgJava&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: The path of the compiled classes (*.class).
;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;-sourcepath C:\ProgJava&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: The path of the source classes (*.java).
;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;-d C:\ProgDoc&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: The path where the documentation must be generated.
;&lt;code&gt;org.wikibooks.en&lt;/code&gt;: The name of the package to document. It is possible to specify several packages, or one or several class names to document only those ones.

The description page of a package copy the description text from the file named &lt;code&gt;package.html&lt;/code&gt; which should be placed in the given folder. In our example, we should document the package in the file &lt;code&gt;C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\package.html&lt;/code&gt;.

Since Java 5&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#packagecomment&lt;/ref&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;package.html&lt;/code&gt; file can be replaced by a special Java file named &lt;code&gt;package-info.java&lt;/code&gt; containing only the package declaration preceding by a documentation comment.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-3&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 8.3: C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\package-info.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1-4&quot;&gt;
/**
 * This fake package is used to illustrate the Java wikibook.
 * at &lt;i&gt;en.wikibooks.org&lt;/i&gt;.
 */
package org.wikibooks.en;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Locating Information on Behalf of Clients''' is a core unit in both the Diploma and Advanced Diploma programmes.

== Introduction ==


This unit aims to develop your skills in '''working logically through the steps of a reference enquiry''', typical for a public library, using Internet resources. 


'''Reference and enquiry work''' has always been an integral part of the public library service. Nowadays many queries are answered using '''electronic''' rather than print sources. However, the '''processes''' and '''strategies''' used are the same with both print and electronic searches. So, any '''experience''' you have gained in answering queries through printed reference sources will enhance your competence in electronic searches.


Enquiry work can provide library staff with a great deal of '''job satisfaction'''. No two enquiries, or enquirers, are exactly the same – so searches for information are varied. Sometimes an information search will present a real intellectual challenge and require you to adopt an innovative or ingenious approach to tackling the enquiry. In such cases getting the required result for the enquirer is doubly rewarding. An effective enquiry service enhances the library’s '''reputation''' with its clients and creates a positive image for library staff – as professional, efficient and helpful people.


If you are a member of staff in a public library who deals with information enquiries from clients and answers them using the Internet, you will have developed some or all of the expertise required for this unit. Read through the following information carefully. It summarises the '''knowledge and skills''' which you need in order to produce evidence of your competence.

The unit involves interacting with library clients, establishing their information needs and using the Internet to search for the required information. This must be done in a real library environment and you will need access to the Internet, preferably broadband. Specifically you are asked to:


'''Define the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client'''

The main knowledge and/or skills required are:

*reference interview techniques
*open and closed questions
*determining the nature of information to be provided– quantity, level, format
*constraints – deadlines for completion, currency of information and language


'''Create a search strategy to fully satisfy the enquiry'''

The main knowledge and/or skills required are:

*choice of search terms
*structuring the search
*common search engines
*directories
*meta crawlers
*portals
*bibliographic databases


'''Evaluate the results of the search in terms of validity of information found and its appropriateness in meeting the client’s needs'''

The main knowledge and/or skills required are:

*validity of information - reliability, accuracy and currency
*measuring success of search in terms of client’s requirements – sufficiency, format and language
*structuring and saving of search results for presentation to client, later retrieval, future updating


'''Assessment'''

The unit is assessed through four short searches and one extended search. These will be searches related to typical information needs of public library clients. Some examples are:


'''Short Searches'''

Finding out:

*the current community charge rates in your locality
*the sequel to a novel which the client has recently read
*the post code of a firm for which the client knows name, street and town
*whether UK citizens require a visa to visit Thailand


'''Extended Search'''

A client wishes to explore the topic of asylum seekers in Britain. You would produce information giving Government policy, views of other political parties, statistics on immigration etc.


== Defining the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client ==


=== The Reference Interview ===


Defining the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client is often referred to as the '''reference interview'''. However, you may not carry this out face to face. Instead you may carry out the interview over the telephone or through a series of e-mails. It is undoubtedly easier and quicker though if you can manage to meet the client.


There are three main stages here:

*Finding out what the client wants to know
*Finding out why the client wants the information
*Finishing off the reference interview


==== Finding out what the client wants to know ====


Before you can answer a question posed by a client, you must '''find out exactly what that question''' is. Experienced colleagues will be able to tell you of many situations where there has been a '''misunderstanding''' with a reference client, resulting in wasted time and effort and sometimes embarrassment.  


Whichever means of communication you use, do remember that the reference interview is a '''two-way interaction''' or '''dialogue''' and you must take responsibility for the '''efficiency''' of the communication process. 


The interview is likely to begin with the client asking you a question. Your task is to probe further until you are '''fully satisfied''' that you are clear exactly what the client wishes to find out. Remember to ask for '''clarification''' from the client about the topic, e.g. ask them to spell uncommon words, expand on the topic under investigation etc.


==== Finding out why the client wants the information ====


It is extremely helpful if you can establish early on in the interaction the reason '''why the client wishes the information''' requested. Tact may be required here, however, as some clients may be unwilling to give this information. This is especially likely where the enquiry is of a '''sensitive or confidential nature''', such as a medical or financial problem. If the client appears uncomfortable or evasive when asked why the information is being sought, then it is unwise to probe further.


You should ascertain the '''starting point''' of the enquiry in order to avoid time being wasted on finding information which the client already knows. Ask whether the client has already undertaken any research on the topic and what the results of this were. This can give guidance on successful and unsuccessful information searching approaches. But do not write off a particular approach just because a client assures you that it has yielded no information. Remember the client is not an information specialist – you are! – and so the client may not have searched as thoroughly or as efficiently as you would.


==== Finishing off the reference interview ====


By the end of the reference interview you should be confident that the nature of the enquiry has been fully explored and that the information required by the client has been specifically defined. The reference interview also provides the opportunity to establish any special needs of the client e.g.: visual or auditory impairment.


And finally, do remember to record contact details for the client. In the excitement of exploring the enquiry and establishing the client’s precise needs, it is all too easy to forget this important information. So make sure that every reference interview ends by your recording name, address, telephone, fax, e-mail details, as appropriate. If you will be phoning the client, it is also polite to note when it is convenient for the client to receive your call.

=== Spoken and written communication ===

Good communication skills are key to the reference interview.  This topic provides a good opportunity for practising and refining your communication skills.

----
[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list the key factors you think would lead to good communication in a reference interview. Write these down on a piece of paper.

----



==== Factors leading to good communication ====


We think the important factors are:

*Appropriate spoken language
*Appropriate body language
*Good feedback especially on the telephone
*Good note taking skills 
*Clear and grammatical e-mails 


==== Spoken language ====


You should use language which is appropriate to the client, avoiding talking down to the client or, at the other extreme, baffling the client with specialist jargon. If you do have to use a term which the client may not understand, e.g. “bibliography”, be sure to explain it. 


For example, how would you explain “search engine” to a client who is not familiar with this term?


You might say something like “A search engine allows you to search for websites related to a particular topic. To use a search engine, you have to choose and type in appropriate key words describing the topic


==== Body language ====


In face-to-face situations, use appropriate body language designed to set the client at ease and promote effective communication. Smile and greet the client by name if possible. Lean forward slightly and use eye contact to show your interest in the conversation. Try to carry out the interview in a place where both you and the client are sitting comfortably and at the same level, preferably side by side.


What would you deduce from the body language of a client who fidgeted during the reference interview?


The most likely explanations are that the client:

*is in a hurry, perhaps because of another appointment
*may feel nervous in the library environment or about asking for your assistance with their query.


Test your understanding of body language with this simple quiz - http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/interviews/nvc.htm

==== Feedback ====


With telephone communications you will have to be careful in order to make sure that you fully understand what the client says because you will get no clues from their body language.  You should use appropriate feedback techniques to ensure understanding of the client’s responses. For instance, you might:

*Rephrase what the client has said and repeat this back to them
*Ask if you can read out a summary of the enquiry based on the notes you have made.


See if you can pick up clues from the tone of the client’s voice. Conversely, make sure that your tone is positive and encouraging. Smiling as you speak into the phone generates a pleasant tone of voice which encourages helpful responses.

==== Note taking ====


In both face to face and telephone interactions, it is essential to take '''written notes''' of the main points of the conversation. These notes are your reference for checking that you have fully understood the details of the client’s enquiry.


You may have to put the query on one side for actioning later or you may pass it on to a colleague to deal with. In both cases a written record will be essential.


==== Writing e-mails ====


If you are using e-mail to communicate with the client, it is important to establish a cordial tone while remaining concise and to the point. Writing clearly and grammatically is key to this, as is structuring your e-mail so that the client can follow it easily and respond appropriately.

The correct sequence for actioning an e-mail enquiry is as follows:

#Thank the client for the enquiry
#Summarise what the enquiry consists of
#Give your proposals for how you will action the enquiry 
#State when you will provide the search results 
#Request confirmation from the client that your proposed actions and timescale are acceptable

=== Open and Closed Questions ===


In the reference interview, you will use both '''open and closed questions'''. These have different uses. It is important to be able to distinguish between the two types of question and to use them appropriately.

'''Closed questions''' prompt yes/no or short factual answers, such as:

Q. What time did you come to the library? 
A. 9 o’clock


Q. Is your daughter called Amelia Austin? 
A. Yes


Closed questions are mainly used in the reference interview context to:

*elicit specific pieces of information from the client  
*gain confirmation that the your understanding of what the client has said is correct - an important feedback tool


The following are examples of closed questions:

''Do you use a left-handed mouse?''

This is a closed question which will be answered by yes or no. 


''What is the charge for printing a page of A4 text?''

This is a closed question which will be answered by a specific sum of money such as 10p.


'''Open questions''' encourage longer answers, such as:

Q. Why did you ask for a dictionary? 
A. I wanted to check whether there was a difference in meaning between “main” and “mane”.

The main uses of open questions in the reference interview context are to:

*establish rapport with the client
*set the scene for the enquiry
*gain background information which is relevant to the enquiry 

The following are examples of open questions:


''What will your students be using this information for?''

A typical reply might be: &quot;These are students undertaking an initial course in professional cookery. They will need the data to understand the calorific content of the foods in the recipe.”


''Can you tell me how you went about looking for this information?''

A typical reply might be: &quot;I started off looking up autism in the encyclopedias but the information was too general and not up to date enough. 


You will use both open and closed questions at appropriate times. When framing a question, always think of the type of response you hope to generate and word the question so as to encourage either a brief or an extended answer.


=== Nature of information required ===


Apart from the actual topic of investigation, there are other factors which need to be taken into account before a member of library staff will embark on the information search. 


There are three main factors:

*the quantity of information required
*the level of information required
*the format of information required



==== Quantity ==== 

What appears to be the same request for information could produce results differing in quantity by orders of magnitude. You must clarify the scale of information required by the client in order to fully satisfy their needs.  


It may be that reference to a single book or website is required. Alternatively many in-depth sources of information may be required so that the client can analyse a breadth of opinion on the search subject.  


Providing too much information is just as unhelpful as providing too little.

==== Level ====


It is essential that the information provided is at a level of complexity which enables the client’s full comprehension but does not patronise the client or tell them what they already know.  

The following points are a good guide:

*the client’s age (but remember age does not automatically bring wisdom!)
*the client’s educational attainment
*the client’s display of specialist knowledge
*the client’s linguistic ability
*whether the information is intended for the client themselves or for use by other people.


Tactful questioning can be used to make an estimation of the points listed above.


==== Format ====


The results may include information in various formats.


Difficulties may arise if the client has expressed an initial preference for a format in which the information is not actually available.  If the information is only available in a limited number of formats, you must alert the client to this and ascertain if any of these formats are acceptable.

If the search is not carried out with the client present, you must ascertain if the client can visit the library at a later time to access the search results or if the information must be in a format which can be e-mailed or posted to the client.


There are many formats available, including several as a result of the introduction of ICT.  Your search may direct the client to items of library stock, to be used in the library or borrowed for home use. This could include:

*Printed reference sources or information CD-ROMs
*Books, audio or video material for home borrowing
*Magazines and journals
*Pamphlets or leaflets


The search results may be bibliographies or lists of website references for the client to follow up. The results may be viewed on screen by client, in the form of text, audio or video.






== Create a search strategy to fully satisfy the client’s enquiry ==


=== Choosing search terms ===


Searching for information using the most appropriate key words is important in any reference enquiry. But it is arguably even more important in an Internet search than when you are looking through printed indexes. When carrying out a manual search, the human mind can make links and jump from one search term to another. Computers on the other hand stick strictly to the script and will only find information which matches what you have instructed them to look for.


Let’s look at how you can derive the search terms for an enquiry. You must be able to analyse a topic and break it down into its component parts.  At its simplest you just extract the significant words, usually the nouns and verbs, and use these as search terms.  An example would be a client asking for information about “How would you cook a vegetable like fennel?” Which word(s) would you choose as search term(s) in this enquiry?

The best choice would be &quot;cook&quot; and &quot;fennel&quot;  - these two words are the essence of the enquiry.  &quot;How would you&quot; is too general and &quot;vegetable&quot; would only be needed if there was some ambiguity over the nature of fennel.

The above is not necessarily true depending on the search tool you are using. For example if you use YouTube and type in - how do you... for almost any subject you will find video showing exactly what you want to know.

==== Examples of search terms ====


Here are some further examples of enquiries where you would be able to use one or more words from the client’s initial question as search terms. The search terms are in bold.

I need some advice on keeping a '''greyhound''' as a '''pet'''.

What are the '''symptoms''' of '''diabetes'''?

Who is the '''chief executive''' of '''CILIP''' (the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals)?

What '''colour''' is the flower commonly known as '''ragwort'''?


Of course, the question as posed by the enquirer may not contain words which are the best search terms. You may need to think of alternatives in the form of synonyms (words which mean the same) and words related to the terminology used by the client.

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''
	
List some reasons why synonyms and related words might be better search terms.

----

==== Synonyms ====

It is important to consider synonyms of a search term because the word given to you by the client may be one of many which describes the concept to be searched for, e.g. if a client wishes to know about illness, it may be useful to carry out a search with the word disease instead. 

 	
Try this example for yourself. Carry out two searches using the same search engine, the first with sports competitor as your search term and the second using sports opponent and look at the differences in the results. 


The term suggested by the client may be a less commonly used or out of date expression, so it is vital to think of more usual or appropriate synonyms. The client might ask about Ceylon when requiring information about the country now known as Sri Lanka. It would therefore be appropriate to search under both Ceylon and Sri Lanka.


If you have time test your knowledge of the English language here - http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/tests/synonyms.htm

==== Related terms ==== 

Sometimes it is useful to use a related term for the word given by the client. When a client asks for information on malnutrition in Africa, a related term could be used instead of the rather broad one.  An individual country could be substituted, such as Sudan.  Of course, you must take into account that using related terms can change the nature of your search. In this example, using Sudan will give you results which are influenced by the particular problems suffered by this country which differ from other parts of the continent.

Can you come up with one or more potentially useful related terms in searching for each of the following?

*web 2.0 applications in a library context
*genetically modified crops
*popular music in the 1960’s
*saving using insurance policies 
*capital punishment in the USA

Some examples are:

For web 2.0 applications you could use social media

For genetically modified crops: Frankenstein seeds, Monsanto, soya 

For popular music in the 1960’s: the name of any singer or group from this era – the Beatles, Dusty Springfield 

For capital punishment in the USA: death row, electric chair, gas chamber, names of individual states where capital punishment is used e.g. Texas

Another aspect to be considered when choosing search terms is that while the client may give you descriptive terms for the information required, it may be more effective to search on actual names of individuals or organisations or concepts.  Taking the earlier search regarding malnutrition in Africa, the description malnutrition could lead you to search using the key words World Health Organisation.   This will lead to the WHO site where information on diseases in specific African countries is quickly located.

Can you come up with a name of an organisation or individual which could be a useful specific term in searching for each of the following?

horse racing
the royal family
relativity theory
college courses


There are many related terms which apply to each of these. Here are the examples which we thought of:

Shergar, British Horse Racing Board

The name of any member of the royal family, such as the Prince of Wales

Albert Einstein

The name of your local college

Note that the previous three techniques depend both on your ability to interpret the client’s description and on your own general knowledge.  With experience and in discussion with knowledgeable colleagues, your skills will increase.

==== Ambiguity ====

You should also keep in mind that some words are ambiguous. China can mean a country in the Far East or pottery products. The English language is particularly rich in such ambiguities. In the reference interview you will have clarified the meaning of any such ambiguous words. Now at the search stage, you should either use a non-ambiguous synonym (if one exists) or add an additional search term to remove the ambiguity.

Some simple examples are:  

Cycle – is it the bicycle or a rotation?
Yarn –  could mean thread or a tall story.
Kids – could lead to children or young goats.

=== Structuring an Internet search  ===

As an information professional, you need to know all the shortcuts to information that client’s request.  This means more than just typing search terms into Google!  

Structuring the search involves the choice of different search engines, metacrawlers, directories and portals or, where you are already familiar with appropriate websites and their content, direct interrogation of these.

In order to search effectively on the Internet, you need to be familiar with the different types of websites used to search for information.  Three general types are the search engine, the metacrawler and the directory.  Each operates and is used in a different way, although several sites incorporate more than one type.  For example the Google site consists of both a search engine and a directory.


==== Search Engines ====

A '''search engine''' is a website that allows you to input words representing your search terms and uses these to come up with a list of websites which should be relevant to your search. Repeating the same search using different search engines may lead to different results due to the way in which the various search engines search the web and order the 
sites found. You should have experience of a selection of search engines to understand their similarities and differences.   It can be illustrative to make identical searches on a number of search engines and observe the different results.  

There are many different search engine sites.  It is important to have a grasp of a few of the most important sites, i.e.: those that lead quickly to useful information. This can be because they specialise in a particular sector are well funded and thus comprehensive. (Such sites are popular and so command large fees for their advertising services.)



----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Start by familiarising yourself with some of the popular search engines which will be important in your information searching. Go to each search engine listed below and try out the search term '''British planes'''. Do not bother to use capital letters in the search terms as the search engines do not really take them into account.


*'''Google''' at http://www.google.co.uk 

*'''Yahoo''' at http://uk.yahoo.com/ 

*'''Clusty''' at http://clusty.com/ 

*'''Ask Jeeves''' at http://www.ask.co.uk/ 

*'''Bing''' at http://www.bing.com/

Note down what you find in the layout and types of information displayed.

----

You will find four rather different results.  Even if the same results were displayed (which is unlikely given the slightly vague search term), each search engine presents the information in a different manner.

==== Differences between search engines====

Google and Yahoo are somewhat similar with a simple list but Google presents wikipedia pages and news near the top.

Ask Jeeves starts off with a list of commercial sites, all wanting to do business with you and only lower down shows you ‘real’ results.  But in its favour, there is a list of related searches down the right hand side.

Clusty is at first similar with a list of results and a few advertisements but there is a very useful feature in that down the left hand side, it clusters the results in categories which it has discerned.  


----
 
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3'''


Try Clusty out with the search term '''organ''' and you will see the value of the category feature.  Because organ is ambiguous as a search term, Clusty very neatly categorises its results into organ as a musical instrument and parts of the body.  You can see that in this way Clusty can lead you to a set of results more focused that the other three search engines.

----

Of course none of these search engines is perfect and it would unwise to rank one above another.

==== Compound queries ====

Note that our search terms consisted of two words, '''British''' and '''planes'''.  When you look down the results at all four websites, you will see that only sometimes are the two words adjacent and that some of the results only have one of the words present.  Most search engines have the convention that to indicate the compound term the words should be in quotes i.e.: '''“british planes”'''.  


----
 
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4'''

Try this out with '''jersey cows'''. Enter the two words with and without quotes and compare your results.

----


Try to get as much experience as you can in using different search engines. You will learn that although using only Google, say, will give you lots of results, the use of a few different engines may give you a better overview of the range of information available for any chosen search topic.


==== How search engines work ====

It is helpful to know a little about how search engines work.  In simple terms, they search the Internet and look at the websites and their contents.   They index the information they find on the site and in the metadata descriptions placed on each site by its creator. This information is used to lead from your search terms to the results.  Of course each search engine uses its own particular methods.  You can find out more about this either by doing a search or looking for information on the actual search engines.

This matching does have its pitfalls and if using ambiguous search terms you may get at best many useless results and at worst offensive ones.

 

==== Metacrawlers ====

Based on the maxim that more is better, Metacrawlers apply your search terms to several search engines simultaneously.  Metacrawlers come in many forms and are sometimes described as '''meta search engines'''.


----
 	
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4'''

Familiarise yourself with some of the popular metacrawlers which you can use in your information searching:

Go to each metacrawler listed below and try out the search term '''British planes'''.


*'''Dogpile''' at http://www.dogpile.co.uk/  

*'''Surfwax''' at http://www.surfwax.com/ 

*'''Mamma''' at http://www.mamma.com/ 

*'''Ixquick''' at http://www.ixquick.com/eng/


Note down what you find in the layout and types of information displayed.

----


Again there are different results and some very different layouts.  

One major reason for using metacrawlers rather than individual search engines is that you hope to get a good spread of the best information.  We would suggest that this works best early in a search to get and idea of the breadth of the information available. 

Using a metacrawler also saves you having to visit each of the individual search engines.

==== Web directories ====

Unlike search engines, web directories do not search for you but are arranged as an alphabetically ordered index to the web, developing into a '''tree structure''' of levels of sub-categories.  This is somewhat similar to the subject index in a print encyclopedia.

Directories can be very useful in allowing you to home in on the general area of a reference search.  However there are countless directory sites, many of which are poorly maintained.  Poor maintenance manifests itself with broken links or links to inappropriate material. You should make yourself familiar with the good examples of directories and we will examine some 
of these now.

General purpose directory sites are provided by many search engines: Google and Yahoo are examples.  Most confusingly they show both the categories which you can descend and a search facility which looks like the web search but is in fact used to search the categories.

 
----
	
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.5'''


Examine some of the general purpose web directories which you can use in your information searching:

Go to each directory listed below and try to look for information on flower arranging:



*Yahoo at http://dir.yahoo.com/ 

*Open directory at http://dmoz.org/  

----

==== Differences between directories and search engines ====

One key difference between the directory and the search engine is that the entries in the directory should be compiled ‘by hand’ and not through automated searching. This may be seen as an advantage if you consider that a human is better at categorising the sites i.e. spurious sites may be eliminated.

We feel that the really useful directories are the more focused examples, such as http://www.webdirectory.com  relating to environmental information.  You can also appreciate that browsing through the tree structure of the directory can be time-consuming and will not automatically lead to a result.

 
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.6'''


There is a tremendous amount of information available at http://searchenginewatch.com/ covering every conceivable aspect of information providing websites.

Have a look at this website for further tips.

----


An alternative approach is the use of Portals. 

 
==== Using portals ====

A portal is, at its most general, a website which offers grouped links leading to information. General purpose portals, such as www.msn.co.uk or www.yahoo.com, are often used as home pages by users and have links to life style sites. These sorts of general portals are rarely of use in answering information enquiries.

Some more specialised portals are tailored to be used say, to provide a child friendly web experience (e.g.: http://home.disney.co.uk/), as they give relative safety from inappropriate material. 

Other specialised portals focus on particular topic areas and it is these which can save you time in answering reference enquiries.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.7'''


Familiarise yourself with some of the portals which you can use in your information searching. Go to each portal listed below and get a feel for the information you could access through it.


*'''DirectGov''' at http://www.direct.gov.uk/Homepage/fs/en  

*'''Wine.Com''' at http://www.wine.com/ 
 
*'''Visit Scotland''' at http://www.visitscotland.com/ 
 
*'''Irish Abroad''' at http://www.irishabroad.com/ 
 
*'''Connects''' at http://www.connects.org.uk/ 
 

----


There are thousands of portals.  With experience you will get to know a number of useful ones for sourcing specific information.

==== Using bibliographic databases ====

Bibliographic databases permit the retrieval of information in a variety of formats and media. Some of these are commercial subscription services, e.g.: www.booksinprint.com. You must be aware which databases your library subscribes to. If you do not know this already, check it out now.

Other bibliographic databases which are free of charge include the catalogues of major libraries – such as the British Library’s catalogues containing over 12 million books, serials, printed music and maps.  University libraries usually have online catalogue access, as do public libraries.  Booksellers’ databases can also be useful sources of online bibliographic information.

 
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.8'''


Familiarise yourself with some of the bibliographic databases which you might use in your information searching: Go to each site listed below and get a feel for the information you could access through it.

*'''British Library''' at http://www.bl.uk/     
*'''Cardiff University Library''' at http://library.cf.ac.uk/   
*'''Blackwell’s''' at http://www.blackwell.co.uk/  

----

=== Frequently-used websites ===

It is useful to acquaint yourself with sites of major organisations which hold information relating to commonly asked enquiries.  Examples are government departments, your own local authority, major voluntary organisations and organisations of local interest.


---- 
[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.9'''


Familiarise yourself with some websites which will be important sources of information for you: 

Locate the Government’s '''Home Office website''' and find the telephone number for General Enquiries
Locate the website for your '''local authority''' and find a list of the local councillors
Locate the website for the '''UK Citizens Advice Bureau''' and find the location of your local bureau.
Locate the website for your '''nearest airport''' and find a list of destinations flown to.

Now expand on this by thinking of other likely sources of specialised information and check out these websites for yourself.

----


==== Internal searches ====

As well as using search terms in search engines, you should notice that you can conduct a search within a website using the internal search facility provided by the site. A good example is the search facility within www.scottish.parliament.uk which permits searching by subject terms within specific areas of the site and for specified types of documents. This site has both simple and advanced search facilities.
	
Use the Advanced Search facility to find '''debates in the chamber''' which relate to '''apprenticeships'''.


=== Website suffixes ===	

When you are looking at websites, it is useful have an understanding of implications of the common suffixes used in the addresses for websites (called URLs).  Some suffixes give a clue about the nature of the organisation which owns the website. Note, however, that for some suffixes there is no absolute fixed rule for their use. Thus you would find that gov.uk always indicates a local or national government site in the UK. By contrast, although .org suggests a non profit-making organisation, there is no guarantee that this applies to every .org website.

Here is a list of common organisational suffixes and their meanings.

*'''.ac'''		'''Academic''' 
*'''.biz''' 		'''Business''' 
*'''.co'''		'''Commercial''' 
*'''.com''' 		'''Commercial''' 
*'''.edu''' 		'''Educational''' 
*'''.gov''' 		'''Local or National Government''' 
*'''.int''' 		'''International''' 
*'''.net''' 		'''Network''' 
*'''.org''' 		'''Non profit making''' 

 


==== Geographical suffixes ====

There are also '''geographical suffixes''' with .uk for the United Kingdom and .ie for the Republic of Ireland. The United States is the only country which does not use a suffix. The .us suffix exists, but is seldom seen.

 
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.10'''
	

Go to http://www.norid.no/domenenavnbaser/domreg.html or another similar site and find the suffixes for Internet sites for the following countries:

*'''Australia'''
*'''Canada'''
*'''France'''
*'''Germany'''
*'''India'''
*'''Pakistan'''

----

== 1.3 Evaluate the results of the search ==


=== Validity of information ===


Information found on the Internet can sometimes be problematic. It is always important for the information professional to validate information found during a search, whether this results from printed or electronic sources. However, the information found in reference books and other printed materials in public libraries has usually undergone a rigorous selection process. Thus some of the validation of information has already taken place through the selection process.

This is not the case with Internet sites. Individuals or organisations can, at almost negligible cost, upload information to websites which are then accessible throughout the World. Such sites may present information which is out of date, biased to one point of view or just plainly wrong. So all information found on the Internet must be critically evaluated. This is an important role for the information professional. Non-specialists are less likely to query the information found on the Internet – perhaps they assume that it has been vetted in some way, just like the reference books in our libraries.

There are three main criteria for validating information: '''reliability''', '''accuracy''' and '''currency'''.


==== Reliability ====


There are a number of criteria which can be used to give you confidence in the '''reliability of the information''' on a website.

 	

----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list what you think are the criteria for establishing the reliability of a website.

----

 
==== Reliability criteria ====


We think that the following three points are very important:


*	'''the expertise and reputation of those connected with the website'''
*	'''evidence of lack of bias'''
*	'''evidence of equal emphasis towards all aspects of the search topic'''


 
==== Expertise and reputation ====


If you can see that the website is supported by a reputable organisation or contributed to by a person with known expertise then it is reasonable to accept the website as being reliable.  Examples would be where a website giving medical advice was run by a government department or a well respected charity e.g. '''NHS direct''' at http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/ or  '''Cancer Research UK''' at http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/ 

Another more trivial example is that you would expect to find reliable recipes at '''Delia Smith’s''' website http://www.deliaonline.com/ 

 
==== Lack of bias ====


Individuals can be '''biased''' in their opinions.  Even well known experts may '''represent only one aspect''' of a topic.

Many websites by their very nature present information from only one viewpoint and are thus biased.  While such information need not necessarily be excluded from the results presented to the client, you must indicate any identified bias and, if possible, provide information from other sources which present opposing points of view. This is particularly important when the client is seeking information on '''potentially contentious matters''' such as politics, religion, race or issues related to pressure groups.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''


As an exercise in looking for bias in websites, search for a pair of websites giving opposing points of view on the following topics.


*	keeping a monkey as a house pet
*	the need for the UK Monarchy
*	the greenness of nuclear fuel
*	the usefulness of homeopathy


----

 
==== Opposing views ====


The following example sites were available at the time of the latest review of this section.


*	Opposing views on keeping a monkey as a house pet can be found at '''Monkeyzone'''  http://www.monkeyzone.com/  and at http://www.aspca.org/adopt/adoption-tips/exotic-animals-pets the website of '''American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals '''.
*	Opposing views on the need for the '''UK Monarchy''' can be found at the official UK Monarchy site at http://www.royal.gov.uk  and a Marxist perspective at http://www.marxist.org.uk/  
*	Opposing views on the greenness of nuclear fuel can be found at the '''Greenpeace''' website http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/  and that of the '''World Nuclear Association''' http://www.world-nuclear.org/ 
*	Opposing views on the usefulness of homeopathy at the site of the '''British Homeopathic Association''' at http://www.trusthomeopathy.org/   and the '''National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF)''' Position Paper on Homeopathy found at http://www.ncahf.org/pp/homeop.html 


Although the exercise and the results may seem a little trivial, it is useful.  The problem when you are faced with queries about these sort of contentious issues is that you will initially retrieve a site as a result of your information search which gives only one side of the case.  You must then search for the opposite, just as you have done here.

==== Equal emphasis ====


Emphasis differs from bias in that it is '''omission of information''' rather than deliberate over-statement of one point of view.  For example, US sites may devote little space to British developments. Another pertinent example in UK public libraries is that sites for UK government departments may include information only for England on devolved issues.

You should be aware that '''emphasis can be more difficult to detect than bias'''.  A solution is to apply the technique of '''cross checking''' with other sites on the same topic.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.2'''


Look at the government website for the Department for Education https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education . Education is a devolved responsibility and thus varies considerably between the four UK nations. Much of the information on the DfES website applies only to England and sometimes Wales.


Compare the information about literacy strategy in schools with that given on:


*http://www.deni.gov.uk   	'''Department of Education Northern Ireland'''
*http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/education	'''Scottish Government Education and Training'''
*http://www.learning.wales.gov.uk 	'''Welsh Assembly Government Education and Skills '''


----

==== Accuracy ====


When you are looking for factual information you can usually assume that a reliable site based on the points above will attempt to provide correct data.  However, mistakes can be made and you should cross check data using more than one reliable site wherever possible.

 
==== Currency ====


In using the Internet you often come across websites which are seriously out of date.  In fact some of them are actually abandoned and will never be updated again.  When you use websites in your information searching, you must make sure that the information is current.  Of course with a reference book you can look at the publication date.  However for websites it is not just so easy.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list some points you could look for on a website to establish its currency.

----


==== Establishing currency ====

 
We can think of a few possible ways of establishing the currency of a website.  Obviously they depend on finding date information.  This can be explicit:

*	You can check the '''“Last revised”''' date on a website.  This is usually found on the first screen. Note that this may only indicate the last time a change was made to a particular part of the website and that it does not imply that '''all''' the content was updated on that date. 
*	You can look to see how recent are the '''publication dates''' of the documents referred to on the site
*	You can look out for '''dates quoted''' within text and make an estimate of currency
*	You might find a '''“Forthcoming events”''' list where all dates should be in the future, or in the very recent past.


In the absence of any explicit date information you may need to look at Indirect methods of establishing currency

 
==== Indirect methods of establishing currency ====


If there are no actual dates mentioned, you will need to look for more subtle indications that the site is regularly updated.

*	You can look for '''regulations or laws''' mentioned in the site and find their dates of introduction.
*	You can look for the '''names of institutions or Government departments.'''  These do change name and can be used to give a date range.
*	You can look for the '''names of personalities''' involved in the topic which can show currency.
*	Finally you can simply look for reference to '''recent news items''' which will date the site’s information.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.3'''


Look at http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/littlebritain/   This is a reputable site and it clearly states whether the site has been recently updated.

----

=== Measuring the success of a search ===


At the start of the enquiry process, during the reference interview you should have determined clearly the client’s requirements.  At the end of the enquiry process you must review the results of the search against these requirements in order to check that the search has been fully successful. 

In some cases you may not be able to fully satisfy the client’s requirements. If this happens, the reasons for this must be explained to the client e.g.: information does not exist in the format specified. You should propose some '''alternatives''' if these are possible.

There are three main criteria, '''sufficiency''', '''format''' and '''language'''.

 
==== Sufficiency ====


Is there '''enough information''' or '''too much?'''  If it is a straightforward fact being sought then you should have no difficulty here.  However for a more complex search you must make sure that you have not overdone the amount of data retrieved to prevent swamping the client and if necessary trim it a bit.  Conversely you must check that you have supplied enough information. If the client suggests that more would be appreciated, you can indicate tactfully that you have provided what was asked for but offer to search further if required.

 
==== Format ====


Make sure that the client’s requests for '''particular formats''', such as text, print-out, e-mailed results, audio or video have been met with.

 
==== Language ====


You should make sure that the client’s requests for information in a '''particular language''' have been followed.




 
=== Structuring and saving of search results ===


The raw data should be presented in a structured way which facilitates understanding by the client. In particular, it is important for the client to be informed of the '''source(s)''' of the information found.

For '''simple searches''', the result is likely just to be a '''short statement of fact'''. Here all that is required is that the information is presented '''clearly''' and '''unambiguously'''. However simple the information, we do recommended that it is given to the client in writing and that you keep a copy. That way there can be no argument later about the results. And having a written record means that the client does not have to depend on their memory to recall the information.

For searches which result in a considerable amount of information, you should present the results in some sort of '''logical order'''. Different orders suit different types of enquiry. 


==== Ordering results ====


You might adopt one or a combination of:


*	'''Following the progress of the search''' – “First I looked at the Food Standards Agency site and this told me….., then I moved on to the Association of Farmers Markets where I found…. etc.
*	'''Geographical order''' – grouping information from a country together
*	'''Chronological order''' – to show how a topic developed
*	'''Alphabetical order''' – if the result of the search is a list of references
*	'''By point of view''' – information on one side of the argument, then the opposing side.


These are only some possibilities and you should not feel compelled to choose one of these. The important thing is that your structure for presenting the information suits the topic and is helpful to the client.

 
==== Bibliographic references ====


If the results of your search include '''bibliographic references''', these should be quoted in a consistent and accepted style. You can find advice on this on the websites of most universities. A good example is Anglia Ruskin University http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm or you could try the University of Warwick at  http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/main/help/guidespublications/bib_cit/ 

It is important to realise that your search and its results represent useful work, which does not simply end when the results are handed over to the client.  We can think of two straightforward cases where reference will be made to your work in the future.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding write down two possible reasons for archiving searches for future use.

----

==== Archiving searches ====


Ignoring the possibility that the first client loses the data and wants another copy of it (this can happen!), the most likely scenario is that another client comes into the library and asks the very same query.  Here, if you have stored the enquiry information properly, you can simply go to the search and produce a copy of the results.

In this case, the search results should be archived in such a way that the search can be retrieved by appropriate key terms. These will be subject key words.

Ideally the library should have a formal system for recording the results of '''frequently asked questions'''. You should be aware if your library service does this and, if so, make sure that you know how to add your information search results to this.

 
==== Frequently asked questions ====


One good example of a library database of frequently asked questions is Edinburgh University’s “Previously AnsweRed Questions – PARQs”.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.4'''


Examine Edinburgh University’s “Previously AnsweRed Questions – PARQs” site on http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk/faqs/parqs.shtml and find the answer to the question “How much did the Forth Bridge cost?”

----

We think you will agree that this facility is very easy to use. Note how, in addition to answering the questions, the site points the enquirer to further sources of information by means of hyperlinks.

If your library service does not have a formal service-wide system like this, you should consider setting up a simple version for yourself and colleagues at your service point. This is relatively simple to do using a database package available in your library.

==== Updating data ====

 
Another situation where you may wish to revisit your search is where the same client reappears and wants you to '''repeat the enquiry''' at a later point in order to '''update the data''' or '''include new developments''' which have taken place since the original search was undertaken.

In this case it is important to save not just the '''search results''' but also the '''search strategy'''.  You will need to repeat the strategy in order to update the information found the first time.

You may find that certain enquiries have a habit of repeating at the same time each year. An example would be where pupils always undertake a school project on a particular topic at the beginning of each academic year. You know that every September a group of 12 year olds will descend on your library desperately seeking information on young people and drugs in the locality. In this case, you can even prepare yourself in advance by repeating your search '''before''' the question is posed, so that you are prepared to assist the young people with their information needs.

* The name of this chapter is Stylesheets from the main chapter list, but it is listed as XSL at the top of the page upon entering the chapter.  Making hese items the same would help avoid confusion over which chapter a user is currently reading.

* When discussing line numbers from lines of code, the line numbers need to be listed to the left of the code.

* Under the XML to XML section, the sentence, &quot;These are copya nd copy-of,&quot; needs to be fixed.

* In the Templates section, the sentence, &quot;This allows you to process a node more once,&quot; nees to be fixed.

* Under the sorting section, the separation of those lines of code is confusing to look at.  It should be represented like the other lines of code and include its sample output after the code.

* Under Parameters and Values, fix the separated code into one solid section.

'''No Answers are given for the Exercises.  Future classes should answer them and add them to the wiki  book'''

&lt;b&gt;Editorial Board Revisions - Viji&lt;/b&gt;

'''some minor changes:'''

(2) what does XSLFO stand for

(3) &quot;one for a Unix man page&quot; probably should be 'main'
:Actually, it refers to [[w:Manual page (Unix)|Unix &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; pages]]. I changed it to &quot;manual page&quot; to be less ambiguous. --[[User:Jarkko Piiroinen|Jarkko Piiroinen]] 06:37, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

(4) eliminate the references to the code using line numbers - do not put line numbers in the code they dont match up or if incorporated directly they dont allow the user to copy and paste into an editor easily - you can copy and paste the code refered to here or just make it clear what you are refering to, by now people should be accustomed to finding tags

(5) &quot;This means that all elements must have a start-tag&quot; - I think it means to say &quot;an end tag&quot;

(7) the headline &quot;i the numeric value to be formatted&quot;, is the &quot; i &quot; extraneous? and what is going on with * numbers hanging out there by itself and * patterns under this heading (something seems awry here)

(8) change examples to fit with the tourguide model  - especially the CD collection example is straight from W3Schools, even that weird green color

(9) after fixing the parameter section code into one solid code, then describe each part - reference the code in the explanation (can use the code frags to reference)

Remember to move the exercises to another link and link to answers - refer to the single entity chapter for the format.

*  I don't like using line numbers to refer to parts of code examples - it just forces the reader to count lines; I would rather see the code copied and pasted then commented on.  what do you think

*  the XSL material removed from chapters 3 thru 6 were not all incorporated such as: regex, operator (=, 
!=, &amp;lt;, etc.) - could we check to make sure that these are incorporated?</text>

The '''Advanced Certificate''' and the '''Advanced Diploma''' in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries''' were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

Further information can be obtained from '''angela.lees@sqa.org.uk'''

&lt;big&gt;-----------------------------CHANGES TO THE QUALIFICATION-----------------------------------&lt;/big&gt;

The Certificate and Diploma have been superceded by the Professional Development Award in Applications of ICT in Libraries at levels 7 and 8 (English and Welsh levels 4 and 5). They consist of much the same content as the certificate and diploma but the PDAs include two new units:

:Digital Culture: Online Communication: In this unit you will focus on the “new literacies” created by digital technologies. You will consider Web 2.0 tools, including social networks, online publishing, online collaboration and virtual worlds.
:
:Digital Culture: Online Collaboration: This unit considers the sociology and operation of virtual communities. You will discuss the uses of Web 2.0 and online collaboration tools within your workplace.

To achieve the level 7 award you must complete three mandatory units:

⋅Locating Information on Behalf of Clients
⋅Using ICT in Library Practice &amp; Professional Development
⋅Supporting Clients in the safe &amp; Legal use of ICT

and one of:

⋅Supporting Reader Development
⋅Digital Culture: Online Communication

&lt;big&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/big&gt;

=== What are these qualifications? ===


These qualifications are based on the training already carried out as during the People’s Network programme. They have been developed by the [http://slainte.org.uk Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)] and are accredited by the  [http://www.sqa.org.uk Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)]. The level of the qualifications is roughly equivalent to a UK Higher National Certificate or Diploma (HNC/HND), a US Associate Degree or years 1 and 2 of a UK or US undergraduate degree. Credit for approximately one year of study may be transferable to other academic programmes.


The '''Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), SLIC, CyMAL''' (the Welsh body) and '''DCAL''' (the Northern Ireland department) supported the development of the qualifications for use throughout the UK. SQA is currently exploring accreditation with the '''QCA (Qualifications &amp; Curriculum Authority)''' and articulation into higher education. The qualifications have been reviewed by content advisers from across the UK in order to balance any variation in the context of library service delivery and the learning materials contain UK-wide examples of best practice.

=== Who are they for? ===


These qualifications are appropriate to library staff in any sector: public libraries, higher education, further education, schools, health libraries, national libraries etc. They are suitable for experienced staff (by showing how ICT can used in traditional library work)and they are also suitable for '''new entrants''' to the profession. They may also be of interest to English-speaking library staff in other countries.


Candidates would normally be expected to have reached a reasonable level of general education, for example A-Level or SCE Higher and possess reasonable ICT skills, such as PC Passport or ECDL.

=== What is the content? ===


The '''Level 7 in Applications of ICT in Libraries''' consists of six 8 credit units, each roughly equivalent to 80 hours of study, as follows: 

Mandatory units:

*Locating information on behalf of clients [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Locating Information]]
*Using ICT in professional practice [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Using ICT in Professional Practice]]
*Supporting clients in the safe and legal use of ICT [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Safe and Legal Use of ICT]]


Optional Units (learners undertake one of these units):

*Supporting reader development [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Supporting Reader Development]]
*Supporting client learning [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Supporting Client Learning]]
*Digital Culture: digital communication

The '''Level 8 in Applications of ICT''' in Libraries includes three 16 credit units (160 hours of study) and one 8 credit unit (80 hours of study):

Optional Units (learners undertake one of these units):

*Net Navigator [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Net Navigator]]	
*Educator [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Educator]]
(candidates must choose one of these)

Mandatory units:

*Graded Unit – Reflective Project [[Applications of ICT in Libraries/Graded Unit Project]]
*Digital Culture: digital collaboration


Summaries of the '''unit content''' can be found later in this document.

=== What support material is available? ===

A wide range of support material is available, including top-up learning material, assessment tools and electronic log-books to record assignments for authentication in the workplace. The top-up learning material is available in Wikibook format.

=== How are they assessed? ===


Almost all of the assessment is of a practical nature and involves the completion of logbooks relating to workplace activities, essays and reports. Most assessments can be submitted online.


=== How do they relate to professional qualifications? ===

=== What are the benefits? ===


There are a number of benefits for individual and employers in supporting this development. Staff will have the chance to have their People’s Network learning accredited, improve their qualifications, gain academic credits for transfer into other courses or improve their promotion prospects. From the employer's perspective, the qualifications will contribute towards workforce development and meeting corporate quality agendas such as Investors in People and Charter Mark.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Foreword ==
&quot;When I tell you this story, remember it may change.&quot; - Sherman Alexei, ''Captivity''

When creating a completely original history, many people have a tendency to make either an ideal or a completely un-ideal world or society. One of the first things to realize is that you're working with an entire world. In creating its history, you are permitted to include multiple civilizations, each of which can be classified as ideal, un-ideal, or something in between. Or, you can make a single, unified civilization. Again, this civilization can change with time in whether it was good, bad, or just something else, as could any civilization in the first scenario. The possibilities are endless. 

You can base it in earth's history, and make allusions to earth humans being in the far past, almost forgotten (Rene Barjavel's novel ''The Ice People'' is a great example of this). Or, it can be totally original. When you start, however, it is usually a good idea to have at least some conceptions of what you want to create, so that you can get a rather decent Conhistory going. 

Remember, you may rewrite any part of this at any time, as none of it has to be true: remember also that the way history is told has much to do with who is telling it. Winston Churchill said &quot;History is written by the victors&quot;, but the conquered people also have their story to tell.

Be ready to be challenged if you include controversial subjects, such as an idealized world that uses a certain political structure. Well, let us begin constructing your &quot;ConHistory&quot;.

== Before You Write ==

=== Prepare for Writing ===

It is recommendable to get a notebook if you want to do this by hand. If you will do it on the computer, you may benefit from  using multiple files to write separate parts, but you may want to still have them open to gaze over. If you want to make this very long and drawn out, get ready for a lot of writing.

=== Your Civilization(s) in the Present ===

You don't need to write this for your Conhistory, but it helps to know where your history will lead up (or down) to in the end. If you skip this, you are being brave in not knowing where your conhistory will lead, or you know how it will lead, if only vaguely. If you have made a conlang of any sort, use things from it to help to shape what this world is now like. Consider politics, economics, sciences, art, and geography. Don't be afraid of verisimilitude in your ideal society, or glimmers of hope in your corrupt society. Don't be afraid to have something in the middle. Consider all that you know you want this to be. You can be as creative as you want here, and you can revise it alongside your Conhistory.

== Before your Civilization(s) (Past) ==

The rest of this wikibook covers most of this information. It is common for a Conhistory to reflect Earth's history, since we know that Earth's history is possible because it happened. You may have ideas about alternative progressions of technology and the like, but it is not a bad idea to start with the people in a small-scale state, being nomadic hunters, or maybe what they were before that. Often, you could include some kind of creation story/myth here, if you are going back that far (Tolkien would say that some kind of creation myth is imperative). Anything goes; you can start in the distant past, or later on in your conhistory, progressing through various ideas and events that lead up to your current society.

* Perhaps the most common mistake when moving from one language to another is to try to make the new language look or act too much like the previous language in use.  When switching to Fortran (for whatever reason) consider doing things the Fortran way, rather than as you would in some other language.
* In Fortran, variables need not be declared.  A new variable beginning with &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; (the &quot;in&quot; group) is an &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;.  A variable beginning with some other letter is a &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;.  So, the disadvantage is that a typo could result in a new variable.  The advantage is that coding is fast and easy, in that for most cases, no variables need be declared.  If you want Fortran to act like declaration required languages, use &lt;code&gt;IMPLICIT NONE&lt;/code&gt; at the top of each program, function, and subroutine.
* Arrays are indexed from 1 to ''N'', not 0 to ''N''−1.
* Arguments passed to functions and subroutines are passed by reference and not by value.  Additionally, languages like C typically push each of their arguments onto the stack.  Many (if not most) Fortran implementations build an array of argument addresses, and push the address of that array (only) onto the stack.  This uses slightly more storage, but less executed code if you average more than 1 argument.  The C-user error occurs when you think you know the addresses of argument references.
* Note that arguments may need to be declared, and might not, as per the rules above.
* For fixed form code, the first 6 columns have special meanings, and you can only use the first 72 columns.
* Trying to use allocation too much.  When in Fortran, try to use static allocation of arrays whenever possible.
* Thinking you know how big a variable is -- Here are the rules:  &lt;code&gt;LOGICAL&lt;/code&gt; can be any number of bytes.  &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt; is at least as big as &lt;code&gt;LOGICAL&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; is at least as big as &lt;code&gt;INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;DOUBLE PRECISION&lt;/code&gt; is at least as big as &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;.  And finally, &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt; is twice as big as &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt;.  Typically, the sizes are 1, 4, 4, 8, and 8 bytes, respectively, but don't rely on that if you're writing portable code.  A related mistake is thinking that &lt;code&gt;LOGICAL*4&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;REAL*8&lt;/code&gt; gives you data 4 or 8 bytes wide.  The number following the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;u&gt;suggestion&lt;/u&gt;, not a requirement.

==Variables==
C / C++
 int i;
 double x[3];
 double *y = NULL;
 y = new double[3];
 delete[] y;
 { 1, 2, 3}; // &lt;- Do the semantics match exactly?
Fortran (with two examples of allocation and deallocation -- don't use both at once)
 INTEGER i
 DOUBLE PRECISION x(3)
 DOUBLE PRECISION, DIMENSION(:), ALLOCATABLE :: xx
 DOUBLE PRECISION, POINTER, DIMENSION(:) :: y =&gt; null()
 ALLOCATE(xx(3))
 DEALLOCATE(xx)
 ALLOCATE(y(3))                    ''! memory allocation for pointer - similar syntax to array allocation''
 DEALLOCATE(y)                     ''! again similar syntax as for array allocation / deallocation'' 
 (/ 1, 2, 3 /)

'''Caveat''': Fortran's arrays are more flexible than plain C arrays. By default they are indexed from 1 not 0.

They may be declared to be indexed by different means:

 REAL, DIMENSION(-2:10) :: A

means you can use A(10) as well as A(-2).

Multidimensional arrays should be declared this way:

 REAL A(5,7,10)

You will have 5*7*10 elements from A(1,1,1) to A(5,7,10).  Note memory is laid out in a way unique to Fortran.  The element in memory following A(1,1,1) is A(2,1,1), and not A(1,1,2).

You can use parts of array this way:

 REAL A(10,10)
 REAL B(3,3)

 B(1:3,2:3)=A(4:6,7:8)

will act as

 DO i=1,3
   DO j=2,3
     B(i,j)=A(i+3,j+5)
   END DO
 END DO

Which is the same as the archaic but shorter form

 DO 1 i=1,3
   DO 1 j=2,3
     1 B(i,j)=A(i+3,j+5)

==Functions &amp; Subroutines ==
In Fortran, &lt;code&gt;FUNCTION&lt;/code&gt;s return a value whereas &lt;code&gt;SUBROUTINE&lt;/code&gt;s do not. In C/C++ this is simply the distinction between returning a value or returning &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;. In Fortran, the name of the function is assigned to return a value from a function.
When calling, a subroutine is called with the &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; keyword whereas a function is called as in C/C++. When there are no arguments, an empty parenthesis is not needed.

C/C++:
 int foo(int i, int j) {
   ...
   return 42;
 }
 // then later:
 int x = foo(1, 2);
Fortran:
 INTEGER FUNCTION foo(i, j)
 ...
 foo = 42
 END
 C then later:
 k = foo(1, 2)
C/C++:
 void bar(double j) {
   ...
 }
 void baz() {
   ...
   return; // Can return in the middle.
   ...
   return; // Optional for a function returning void.
 }
 // then later:
 bar(42.0);
 baz();
Fortran:
 SUBROUTINE bar(x)
 ...
 RETURN
 ...
 END
 SUBROUTINE baz
 ...
 END
 C then later:
 CALL bar(42.0)
 CALL baz

== Control structures ==
=== if &amp;rarr; if, then, else, end if ===
C / C++
 if (...) {
   ... 
 } else if ( ... ) { 
   ...
 } else { 
   ...
 }
Fortran
 if (...) then

=== switch &amp;rarr; select case, case, end select ===
C/C++
 switch (...) {
 case ...:
   ...;
   break; // Without &quot;break&quot;, control &quot;falls through&quot; to the next case.
 default: // The &quot;default&quot; case is optional but advisable.
   ...;
   break; // Not necessary for the last case.
 }
Fortran
 select case(...)
    case (...)
       ...
    case default
       ...
 end select

== Iteration ==
=== for &amp;rarr; do, end do ===

Fortran
 do i=1,10
    ...
 end do

      <text xml:space="preserve">When going over the chapter, I noticed it's chock full of info, but a little tough to pay attention to the whole thing.  I plan on keeping the bulk of it but simplifying some of the real technical stuff.  Also, I plan on putting in some simpler definitions for some of the more important terms such as an &quot;element.&quot;  as far as the structure goes, it's fine except for some minor details like misnumbering of bulleted points.

'''Revisions by editorial board - Moussa'''

I think we will all agree on the fact that the chapter is too technical. While trying to write it in a simpler way, also try to had more spacings. 

* Add objectives and banner
* You should be very careful about putting new definitions: Just keep in my mind to name sources if you are using any; it would be much better to come up with your own – the editorial can review them for correctness.
* You should we do something about the contents, the titles look very confusing.
* Get rid of the coloring of xmlns:xsd, targetNamespace, ... just keep it black and bold.

==Professor==

I think the references to NetBeans should be deleted. This will help to simplify the chapter and make it editor-independent. 
I agree that the structure is OK.
The key is to explain these concepts in simple terms. The original author did quite a good job.

[[user:Rick|rtw]] 19:20, 5 Feb 2006 (UTC)

==Final comments - Moussa==
The new word shoud be in bold without color. The exercises should be a link and also another one for the answers. You can refer to the &quot;Author Guidelines&quot; for more details. I was expecting a bit more changes in the content, the name given in the bullets are not very consistent with what has been done in previous chapters.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smaller Landform Features ==

=== Mountains and Valleys ===

Mountains form near where tectonic plates collide, this may lead to earthquakes, floods and volcanic eruptions (or even tsunamis if near sea). Older mountain ranges tend to be eroded, and solitary mountains are usually volcanic. They often limit precipitation in the surrounding area, so deserts nearby are not uncommon. Until technology is developed which allows relatively safe passage through mountainous areas, mountains make for excellent natural defences for early civilizations. Any people who live in these areas and who do not rely on lower altitudes to grow food or keep livestock may be able to survive long periods of time without being invaded by others.

=== Rivers and Lakes ===

A few rules to follow concerning rivers is that they always flow downhill and never branch except when near a body of water. Because they nourish the soil around them and provide a method of transportation, settlements will often form around them. Trade can flow easily around rivers and people travel with them leading people further afield.

=== Climate (And Differences) ===

Most civilizations flourished on the enhancement of the elements. Arabs found water in the desert, Dutch Land out of marsh and so on. If a civilization lived in several environments it could enhance one and leave the rest uninhabited or enhance many and prosper. 

=== Natural Resources ===

Civilizations tend to use nearby resources wherever possible: A civilization with access to trees may build wooden houses whereas a civilization near a river uses bricks and writes on clay tablets.
Scarce resources have to be obtained by trade or by military means.

=== Proximity to Others ===

== Greater Landform Features ==

=== The Fertile Crescent ===

If designing an entire world from the earliest days of civilization or an extremely old nation, thought should be given to where on the planet civilization is likely to evolve first.

Civilization is widely believed to have originated in the Middle East, more specifically in a band of land called the Fertile Crescent. This area encompasses four major rivers. Starting with the Nile River in the west, the Crescent contains the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and finishes with the Indus River in the east. All rivers, when they flood, deposit large amounts of mineral-rich silt on the flood plan, which are excellent areas to grow crops. It is believed that having so many of these highly fertile rivers in a concentrated area, allowed the early inhabitants the opportunity to grow more food per hectare with the same amount of labour that would normally be required. Thus, as fewer people were required to toil the land, labour could diversify and individuals could begin to specialise in other roles, such as warfare, science and medicine.

=== East and West vs. North and South ===

It has been said that one of the reasons that Eurasia tended to develop more quickly than the Americas as a whole, was the difference in their shapes. Eurasia mostly had distance going east and west, while the Americas went mostly north and south. When going north and south, there are various climate changes, so people generally don't travel far in those directions within a lifetime of their own accord. When going east and west, people are more prone to traveling great distances because the climate varies less often. Thus, technological and ideological advances are more likely to extend east and west, instead of north and south. Thus, Eurasia was more likely to share its advances. For example, the Maya developed a system of writing that never went south to the Inca, or north to the various areas there. However, writing in Eurasia spread easily after development. Writing, in and of itself, (not unlike computers or the printing press), speeds up technological advances because things can be saved through time verbatim in the written word, as opposed to more questionable oral tradition.

Jared Diamond, in his 1997 book &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot;, put forward the theory that while agriculture appeared around the world, it was the amount of animals and crops available for domestication that gave early Eurasians an advantage.  In contrast, early Native Americans struggled to develop maize as a viable food.  It needed to be planted one-by-one by hand (which is labour-intensive) and is low in nutrients.  In Eurasia, however, the inhabitants had wheat and barely which was not only highly nutritious by could be sown by scattering the seeds in a field.  This allowed more food to be grown, thus supporting a higher population.  Furthermore, grains can be kept for a much longer period than tropical foodstuffs such as bananas.  What may also have aided growth in early Europe, Diamond argues, are the similar climates found at different latitudes of the continent.  If temperatures and conditions remain the same for the majority of the year, then the same crops can be grown in much wider areas.  The domesticity of animals also may have played their part in that while sub-Saharan Africa has primarily wild animals (lions, hippos and elephants for example), the animals of Europe were much easier to tame.

=== Ocean vs. Land ===

Obviously, unless you have amphibious creatures and/or vehicles, going over the ocean is not the same as going over the land. Oceans pose interesting military possibilites. If one nation develops an extensive navy, that nation may be able to rule the seas and use it for trade and transportation, whilst limiting the ability of others to do the same without permission. To other nations, the seas now become a limiter. To nations without the ability to construct seafaring vessels, it may become almost impossible to cross the seas. If your race is somehow water-based, the opposite may be true. Either way, it is almost impossible to amass great numbers across a distance in a short time over water without a great ability to transport people. Fishing is also a way of making a living for people. Coastal cities often develop for their ability to transport goods from land to sea quickly. Japan is especially capable of this, for example, because virtually every point in that country is less than two hundred miles from the coast. They also have a very large fishing industry.

The following '''Fortran code examples''' or sample programs show different situations depending on the compiler. The first set of examples are for the Fortran II, IV, and 77 compilers. The remaining examples can be compiled and run with any newer standard Fortran compiler (see the [[Fortran#Free (open-source) compilers|end of the main Fortran article]] for lists of compilers). By convention most contemporary Fortran compilers select the language standard to use during compilation based on source code file name suffix: FORTRAN 77 for &lt;code&gt;.f&lt;/code&gt; (or the less common &lt;code&gt;.for&lt;/code&gt;), Fortran 90 for &lt;code&gt;.f90&lt;/code&gt;, Fortran 95 for &lt;code&gt;.f95&lt;/code&gt;. Other standards, if supported, may be selected manually with a command line option.

== FORTRAN II, IV, and 77 compilers ==

NOTE: Before FORTRAN 90, most FORTRAN compilers enforced '''fixed-format source code''', a carryover from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_card IBM punch cards]
* comments must begin with a '''*''' or '''C''' or '''!''' in column 1
* statement labels must occur in columns 1-5
* continuation lines must have a non-blank character in column 6
* statements must start in column 7
* the line-length may be limited to 72 characters (derived from the 80-byte width of a punch-card, with last 8 characters reserved for (optional) sequence numbers)

If errors are produced when you compile your FORTRAN code, first check the column alignment.
Some compilers also offer free form source by using a compiler flag
===Area Of a Triangle program===
====Simple Fortran II program====
'''One data card input'''

If one of the input values is zero, then the program will end with an error code of &quot;1&quot; in the job control card listing following the execution of the program. Normal output will be one line printed with A, B, C, and AREA. No specific units are stated.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortranfixed&quot;&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

==&quot;Retro&quot; FORTRAN IV==
A retro example of a FORTRAN IV (later evolved into FORTRAN 66) program deck is available on the [[w:IBM 1130|IBM 1130]] page, including the IBM 1130 DM2 JCL required for compilation and execution.  An IBM 1130 emulator is available at [http://ibm1130.org/ IBM 1130.org] that will allow the FORTRAN IV program to be compiled and run on a [[w:Personal computer|PC]].

===Hello, World program===
In keeping with computing tradition, the first example presented is a  simple program to display the words &quot;Hello, world&quot; on the screen (or printer).

====FORTRAN 66 (also FORTRAN IV)====

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortranfixed&quot;&gt;
 C     FORTRAN IV WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PROGRAMMING
 C     LANGUAGES TO SUPPORT SOURCE COMMENTS
       WRITE (6,7)
     7 FORMAT(13H HELLO, WORLD)
       STOP
       END
&lt;/source&gt;

This program prints &quot;HELLO, WORLD&quot; to Fortran unit number 6, which on most machines was the [[w:line printer|line printer]] or [[w:Computer terminal|terminal]].  (The [[w:Punch card|card reader]] or [[w:Computer keyboard|keyboard]] was usually connected as unit 5).  The number 7 in the &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statement refers to the statement number of the corresponding &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement.  &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statements may be placed anywhere in the same program or function/subroutine block as the &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statements which reference them.  Typically a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement is placed immediately following the &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statement which invokes it; alternatively, &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statements are grouped together at the end of the program or subprogram block.  If execution flows into a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement, it is a [[w:NOP|no-op]]; thus, the example above has only two executable statements, &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt;.

The initial &lt;code&gt;13H&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement in the above example defines a [[w:Hollerith constant|Hollerith constant]], here meaning that the 13 characters immediately following are to be taken as a character constant (note that the Hollerith constant is not surrounded by delimiters).  (Some compilers also supported character literals enclosed in [[w:Quotation mark|single quotes]], a practice that came to be standard with FORTRAN 77.)

The space immediately following the 13H is a carriage control character, telling the I/O system to advance to a new line on the output. A zero in this position advances two lines (double space), a 1 advances to the top of a new page and + character will not advance to a new line, allowing overprinting.

====FORTRAN 77====

As of FORTRAN 77, single quotes are used to delimit character literals, and inline character strings may be used instead of references to &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statements.  Comment lines may be indicated with either a &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; or an asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) in column 1.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortranfixed&quot;&gt;
      PROGRAM HELLO
*     The PRINT statement is like WRITE,
*     but prints to the standard output unit
        PRINT '(A)', 'Hello, world'
        STOP
      END
&lt;/source&gt;

====Fortran 90====

As of Fortran 90, [[w:quotation mark|double quotes]] are allowed in addition to single quotes.  An updated version of the ''Hello, world'' example (which here makes use of ''list-directed I/O'', supported as of FORTRAN 77) could be written in Fortran 90 as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 program HelloWorld
   write (*,*) 'Hello, world!'   ! This is an inline comment
 end program HelloWorld
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fortran 77 examples==
===Greatest common divisor===
The following introductory example in FORTRAN 77 finds the [[w:greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] for two numbers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; using a verbatim implementation of [[w:Euclidean algorithm#Description of the algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortranfixed&quot;&gt;
*     euclid.f (FORTRAN 77)
*     Find greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm

      PROGRAM EUCLID
        PRINT *, 'A?'
        READ *, NA
        IF (NA.LE.0) THEN
          PRINT *, 'A must be a positive integer.'
          STOP
        END IF
        PRINT *, 'B?'
        READ *, NB
        IF (NB.LE.0) THEN
          PRINT *, 'B must be a positive integer.'
          STOP
        END IF
        PRINT *, 'The GCD of', NA, ' and', NB, ' is', NGCD(NA, NB), '.'
        STOP
      END

      FUNCTION NGCD(NA, NB)
        IA = NA
        IB = NB
    1   IF (IB.NE.0) THEN
          ITEMP = IA
          IA = IB
          IB = MOD(ITEMP, IB)
          GOTO 1
        END IF
        NGCD = IA
        RETURN
      END
&lt;/source&gt;
The above example is intended to illustrate the following:
* The &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; statements in the above use '&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;' as a format, specifying ''list-directed formatting''.  List-directed formatting instructs the compiler to make an educated guess about the required input or output format based on the following arguments.
* As the earliest machines running Fortran had restricted character sets, FORTRAN 77 uses abbreviations such as &lt;code&gt;.EQ.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.NE.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LE.&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.GE.&lt;/code&gt; to represent the relational operators =, ≠, &lt;, &gt;, ≤, and ≥, respectively.
* This example relies on the [[w:Fortran_language_features#Implicit_and_explicit_typing|implicit typing mechanism]] to specify the INTEGER types of &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IB&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ITEMP&lt;/code&gt;.
* In the function &lt;code&gt;NGCD(NA, NB)&lt;/code&gt;, the values of the function arguments &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NB&lt;/code&gt; are copied into the local variables &lt;code&gt;IA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IB&lt;/code&gt; respectively.  This is necessary as the values of &lt;code&gt;IA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IB&lt;/code&gt; are altered within the function.  Because argument passing in Fortran functions and subroutines utilize [[w:evaluation strategy#Call by reference|call by reference]] by default (rather than [[w:evaluation strategy#Call by value|call by value]], as is the default in languages such as [[w:C programming language|C]]), modifying &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NB&lt;/code&gt; from within the function would effectively have modified the corresponding ''actual arguments'' in the main &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; unit which called the function.

The following shows the results of compiling and running the program.

&lt;source lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;
$ g77 -o euclid euclid.f
$ euclid
 A?
24
 B?
36
 The GCD of 24 and 36 is 12.
&lt;/source&gt;

===Complex numbers===
The following FORTRAN 77 example prints out the values of &lt;math&gt;e^{j i \pi / 4}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;j = \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) for values of &lt;math&gt;i = 0, 1, \ldots, 7&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortranfixed&quot;&gt;
*     cmplxd.f (FORTRAN 77)
*     Demonstration of COMPLEX numbers
*
*     Prints the values of e ** (j * i * pi / 4) for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7
*         where j is the imaginary number sqrt(-1)

      PROGRAM CMPLXD
        IMPLICIT COMPLEX(X)
        PARAMETER (PI = 3.141592653589793, XJ = (0, 1))
        DO 1, I = 0, 7
          X = EXP(XJ * I * PI / 4)
          IF (AIMAG(X).LT.0) THEN
            PRINT 2, 'e**(j*', I, '*pi/4) = ', REAL(X), ' - j',-AIMAG(X)
          ELSE
            PRINT 2, 'e**(j*', I, '*pi/4) = ', REAL(X), ' + j', AIMAG(X)
          END IF
    2     FORMAT (A, I1, A, F10.7, A, F9.7)
    1     CONTINUE
        STOP
      END
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example is intended to illustrate the following:
* The &lt;code&gt;IMPLICIT&lt;/code&gt; statement can be used to specify the implicit type of variables based on their initial letter if different from the default implicit typing scheme described [[w:Fortran_language_features#Implicit_and_explicit_typing|above]].  In this example, this statement specifies that the implicit type of variables beginning with the letter &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; shall be &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;.
* The &lt;code&gt;PARAMETER&lt;/code&gt; statement may be used to specify constants.  The second constant in this example (&lt;code&gt;XJ&lt;/code&gt;) is given the complex-valued value &lt;math&gt;0 + j1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:imaginary unit|imaginary unit]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The first number in the &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; statement specifies the number of the last statement considered to be within the body of the &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; loop.  In this example, as neither the &lt;code&gt;END IF&lt;/code&gt; nor the &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; is a single executable statement, the &lt;code&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/code&gt; statement (which does nothing) is used simply in order for there to be some statement to denote as the final statement of the loop.
* &lt;code&gt;EXP()&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the exponential function &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt;.  In FORTRAN 77, this is a ''generic function'', meaning that it accepts arguments of multiple types (such as &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; and, in this example, &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;).  In FORTRAN 66, a ''specific function'' would have to be called by name depending on the type of the function arguments (for this example, &lt;code&gt;CEXP()&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;-valued argument).
* When applied to a &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt;-valued argument, &lt;code&gt;REAL()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AIMAG()&lt;/code&gt; return the values of the argument's real and imaginary components, respectively.

Incidentally, the output of the above program is as follows (see the article on [[w:Euler's formula|Euler's formula]] for the geometric interpretation of these values as eight points spaced evenly about a unit circle in the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]]).

&lt;source lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;
$ cmplxd
e**(j*0*pi/4) =  1.0000000 + j0.0000000
e**(j*1*pi/4) =  0.7071068 + j0.7071068
e**(j*2*pi/4) =  0.0000000 + j1.0000000
e**(j*3*pi/4) = -0.7071068 + j0.7071068
e**(j*4*pi/4) = -1.0000000 - j0.0000001
e**(j*5*pi/4) = -0.7071066 - j0.7071069
e**(j*6*pi/4) =  0.0000000 - j1.0000000
e**(j*7*pi/4) =  0.7071070 - j0.7071065
&lt;/source&gt;

Error can be seen occurring in the last decimal place in some of the numbers above, a result of the &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt; data type representing its real and imaginary components in single precision.  Incidentally, Fortran 90 also made standard a double-precision complex-number data type (although several compilers provided such a type even earlier).

==Fortran 90/95 examples==
===Summations with a DO loop===
In this example of Fortran 90 code, the programmer has written the bulk of the code inside of a DO loop.  Upon execution, instructions are printed to the screen and a SUM variable is initialized to zero outside the loop.  Once the loop begins, it asks the user to input any number.  This number is added to the variable SUM every time the loop repeats.  If the user inputs 0, the EXIT statement terminates the loop, and the value of SUM is displayed on screen.

Also apparent in this program is a data file.  Before the loop begins, the program creates (or opens, if it has already been run before) a text file called &quot;SumData.DAT&quot;.  During the loop, the WRITE statement stores any user-inputted number in this file, and upon termination of the loop, also saves the answer.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
! sum.f90
! Performs summations using in a loop using EXIT statement
! Saves input information and the summation in a data file

program summation
implicit none
integer :: sum, a

print*, &quot;This program performs summations. Enter 0 to stop.&quot;
open(unit=10, file=&quot;SumData.DAT&quot;)

sum = 0

do
 print*, &quot;Add:&quot;
 read*, a
 if (a == 0) then
  exit
 else
  sum = sum + a
 end if
 write(10,*) a
end do

print*, &quot;Summation =&quot;, sum
write(10,*) &quot;Summation =&quot;, sum
close(10)

end
&lt;/source&gt;

When executed, the console would display the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 This program performs summations.  Enter 0 to stop.
 Add:
1
 Add:
2
 Add: 
3
 Add:
0
 Summation = 6
&lt;/source&gt;

And the file SumData.DAT would contain:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
1
2
3
Summation = 6
&lt;/source&gt;

===Calculating cylinder area===
The following program, which calculates the surface area of a cylinder, illustrates free-form source input and other features introduced by Fortran 90.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program cylinder

! Calculate the surface area of a cylinder.
!
! Declare variables and constants.
! constants=pi
! variables=radius squared and height

  implicit none    ! Require all variables to be explicitly declared

  integer :: ierr
  character(1) :: yn
  real :: radius, height, area
  real, parameter :: pi = 3.141592653589793

  interactive_loop: do

!   Prompt the user for radius and height
!   and read them.

    write (*,*) 'Enter radius and height.'
    read (*,*,iostat=ierr) radius,height

!   If radius and height could not be read from input,
!   then cycle through the loop.

    if (ierr /= 0) then
      write(*,*) 'Error, invalid input.'
      cycle interactive_loop
    end if

!   Compute area.  The ** means &quot;raise to a power.&quot;

    area = 2 * pi * (radius**2 + radius*height)

!   Write the input variables (radius, height)
!   and output (area) to the screen.

    write (*,'(1x,a7,f6.2,5x,a7,f6.2,5x,a5,f6.2)') &amp;
      'radius=',radius,'height=',height,'area=',area

    yn = ' '
    yn_loop: do
      write(*,*) 'Perform another calculation? y[n]'
      read(*,'(a1)') yn
      if (yn=='y' .or. yn=='Y') exit yn_loop
      if (yn=='n' .or. yn=='N' .or. yn==' ') exit interactive_loop
    end do yn_loop

  end do interactive_loop

end program cylinder
&lt;/source&gt;

===Dynamic memory allocation and arrays===
The following program illustrates dynamic memory allocation and array-based operations, two features introduced with Fortran 90.  Particularly noteworthy is the absence of &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;THEN&lt;/code&gt; statements in manipulating the array; mathematical operations are applied to the array as a whole.  Also apparent is the use of descriptive variable names and general code formatting that comport with contemporary programming style.  This example computes an average over data entered interactively.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program average

! Read in some numbers and take the average
! As written, if there are no data points, an average of zero is returned
! While this may not be desired behavior, it keeps this example simple

  implicit none
  integer :: number_of_points
  real, dimension(:), allocatable :: points
  real :: average_points=0., positive_average=0., negative_average=0.

  write (*,*) &quot;Input number of points to average:&quot;
  read (*,*) number_of_points

  allocate (points(number_of_points))

  write (*,*) &quot;Enter the points to average:&quot;
  read (*,*) points

! Take the average by summing points and dividing by number_of_points
  if (number_of_points &gt; 0) average_points = sum(points)/number_of_points

! Now form average over positive and negative points only
  if (count(points &gt; 0.) &gt; 0) positive_average = sum(points, points &gt; 0.) &amp;
        /count(points &gt; 0.)
  if (count(points &lt; 0.) &gt; 0) negative_average = sum(points, points &lt; 0.) &amp;
        /count(points &lt; 0.)

  deallocate (points)

! Print result to terminal
  write (*,'(''Average = '', 1g12.4)') average_points
  write (*,'(''Average of positive points = '', 1g12.4)') positive_average
  write (*,'(''Average of negative points = '', 1g12.4)') negative_average

end program average
&lt;/source&gt;

===Writing functions===
Modern Fortran features available for use with [[w:subroutine|procedures]], including deferred-shape, protected, and optional arguments, are illustrated in the following example, a function to solve a system of linear equations.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
function gauss_sparse(num_iter, tol, b, A, x, actual_iter) result(tol_max)

!  This function solves a system of equations (Ax = b) by using the Gauss-Seidel Method

   implicit none

   real ::  tol_max

!  Input: its value cannot be modified from within the function
   integer, intent(in) :: num_iter
   real, intent(in) :: tol
   real, intent(in), dimension(:) :: b, A(:,:)

!  Input/Output: its input value is used within the function, and can be modified
   real, intent(inout) :: x(:)

!  Output: its value is modified from within the function, only if the argument is required
   integer, optional, intent(out) :: actual_iter

!  Locals
   integer :: i, n, iter
   real :: xk

!  Initialize values
   n = size(b)  ! Size of array, obtained using size intrinsic function
   tol_max = 2. * tol
   iter = 0

!  Compute solution until convergence
   convergence_loop: do while (tol_max &gt;= tol .and. iter &lt; num_iter); iter = iter + 1

      tol_max = -1.  ! Reset the tolerance value

!     Compute solution for the k-th iteration
      iteration_loop: do i = 1, n

!        Compute the current x-value
         xk = (b(i) - dot_product(A(i,:i-1),x(:i-1)) - dot_product(A(i,i+1:n),x(i+1:n))) / A(i, i)

!        Compute the error of the solution
!        dot_product(a,v)=a'b
         tol_max = max((abs(x(i) - xk)/(1. + abs(xk))) ** 2, abs(A(i, i) * (x(i) - xk)), tol_max)
         x(i) = xk
      enddo iteration_loop
   enddo convergence_loop

   if (present(actual_iter)) actual_iter = iter

end function gauss_sparse
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that an ''explicit interface'' to this routine must be available to its caller so that the [[w:type signature|type signature]] is known.  This is preferably done by placing the function in a &lt;code&gt;MODULE&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;USE&lt;/code&gt;ing the module in the calling routine.  An alternative is to use an &lt;code&gt;INTERFACE&lt;/code&gt; block, as shown by the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program test_gauss_sparse
    implicit none

!   explicit interface to the gauss_sparse function
    interface
        function gauss_sparse(num_iter, tol, b, A, x, actual_iter) result(tol_max)
           real ::  tol_max
           integer, intent(in) :: num_iter
           real, intent(in) :: tol
           real, intent(in), dimension(:) :: b, A(:,:)
           real, intent(inout) :: x(:)
           integer, optional, intent(out) :: actual_iter
        end function
    end interface

!   declare variables
    integer :: i, N = 3, actual_iter
    real :: residue
    real, allocatable :: A(:,:), x(:), b(:)

!   allocate arrays
    allocate (A(N, N), b(N), x(N))

!   Initialize matrix
    A = reshape([(real(i), i = 1, size(A))], shape(A))

!   Make matrix diagonally dominant
    do i = 1, size(A, 1)
        A(i,i) = sum(A(i,:)) + 1
    enddo

!   Initialize b
    b = [(i, i = 1, size(b))]

!   Initial (guess) solution
    x = b

!   invoke the gauss_sparse function 
    residue = gauss_sparse(num_iter = 100, &amp;
                           tol = 1E-5, &amp;
                           b = b, &amp;
                           A = a, &amp;
                           x = x, &amp;
                           actual_iter = actual_iter)

!   Output
    print '(/ &quot;A = &quot;)'
    do i = 1, size(A, 1)
        print '(100f6.1)', A(i,:)
    enddo

    print '(/ &quot;b = &quot; / (f6.1))', b

    print '(/ &quot;residue = &quot;, g10.3 / &quot;iterations = &quot;, i0 / &quot;solution = &quot;/ (11x, g10.3))', &amp;
        residue, actual_iter, x

end program test_gauss_sparse
&lt;/source&gt;

===Writing subroutines===
In those cases where it is desired to return values via a procedure's arguments, a subroutine is preferred over a function; this is illustrated by the following subroutine to swap the contents of two arrays:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
subroutine swap_real(a1, a2)

   implicit none

!  Input/Output
   real, intent(inout) :: a1(:), a2(:)

!  Locals
   integer :: i
   real :: a

!  Swap
   do i = 1, min(size(a1), size(a2))
      a = a1(i)
      a1(i) = a2(i)
      a2(i) = a
   enddo

end subroutine swap_real
&lt;/source&gt;

As in the previous example, an ''explicit interface'' to this routine must be available to its caller so that the [[w:type signature|type signature]] is known.  As before, this is preferably done by placing the function in a &lt;code&gt;MODULE&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;USE&lt;/code&gt;ing the module in the calling routine.  An alternative is to use a &lt;code&gt;INTERFACE&lt;/code&gt; block.

===Internal and Elemental Procedures===
An alternative way to write the &lt;code&gt;swap_real&lt;/code&gt; subroutine from the previous example, is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
subroutine swap_real(a1, a2)

   implicit none

!  Input/Output
   real, intent(inout) :: a1(:), a2(:)

!  Locals
   integer :: N

!  Swap, using the internal subroutine
   N = min(size(a1), size(a2))
   call swap_e(a1(:N), a2(:N))

 contains
   elemental subroutine swap_e(a1, a2)
      real, intent(inout) :: a1, a2
      real :: a
      a = a1
      a1 = a2
      a2 = a
   end subroutine swap_e
end subroutine swap_real
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example, the &lt;code&gt;swap_e&lt;/code&gt; subroutine is elemental, i.e., it acts upon its array arguments, on an element-by-element basis.  Elemental procedures must be [[w:Pure function|pure]] (i.e., they must have no side effects and can invoke only pure procedures), and all the arguments must be scalar. Since &lt;code&gt;swap_e&lt;/code&gt; is internal to the &lt;code&gt;swap_real&lt;/code&gt; subroutine, no other program unit can invoke it.

The following program serves as a test for any of the two &lt;code&gt;swap_real&lt;/code&gt; subroutines presented:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program test_swap_real
    implicit none

!   explicit interface to the swap_real subroutine
    interface
        subroutine swap_real(a1, a2)
            real, intent(inout) :: a1(:), a2(:)
        end subroutine swap_real
    end interface

!   Declare variables
    integer :: i
    real :: a(10), b(10)

!   Initialize a, b
    a = [(real(i), i = 1, 20, 2)]
    b = a + 1

!   Output before swap
    print '(/&quot;before swap:&quot;)'
    print '(&quot;a = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', a
    print '(&quot;b = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', b

!   Call the swap_real subroutine
    call swap_real(a, b)

!   Output after swap
    print '(// &quot;after swap:&quot;)'
    print '(&quot;a = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', a
    print '(&quot;b = [&quot;, 10f6.1, &quot;]&quot;)', b

end program test_swap_real
&lt;/source&gt;

===Pointers and targets methods===
In Fortran, the concept of [[w:Pointer (computing)|pointers]] differs from that in [[C programming language|C]]-like languages.  A Fortran 90 pointer does not merely store the memory address of a target variable; it also contains additional descriptive information such as the target's rank, the upper and lower bounds of each dimension, and even strides through memory.  This allows a Fortran 90 pointer to point at submatrices.

Fortran 90 pointers are &quot;associated&quot; with well-defined &quot;target&quot; variables, via either the pointer assignment operator (&lt;code&gt;=&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) or an &lt;code&gt;ALLOCATE&lt;/code&gt; statement.  When appearing in expressions, pointers are always dereferenced; no &quot;pointer arithmetic&quot; is possible.

The following example illustrates the concept:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
module SomeModule
   implicit none
 contains
    elemental function A(x) result(res)
        integer :: res
        integer, intent(IN) :: x
        res = x + 1
    end function
end module SomeModule

program Test
   use SomeModule, DoSomething =&gt; A
   implicit none

   !Declare variables
   integer, parameter :: m = 3, n = 3
   integer, pointer :: p(:)=&gt;null(), q(:,:)=&gt;null()
   integer, allocatable, target :: A(:,:)
   integer :: istat = 0, i, j
   character(80) :: fmt

!  Write format string for matrices
!  (/ A / A, &quot; = [&quot;, 3( &quot;[&quot;,3(i2, 1x), &quot;]&quot; / 5x), &quot;]&quot; )
   write (fmt, '(&quot;(/ A / A, &quot;&quot; = [&quot;&quot;, &quot;, i0, &quot;( &quot;&quot;[&quot;&quot;,&quot;, i0, &quot;(i2, 1x), &quot;&quot;]&quot;&quot; / 5x), &quot;&quot;]&quot;&quot; )&quot;)') m, n
 
   allocate(A(m, n), q(m, n), stat = istat)
   if (istat /= 0) stop 'Error during allocation of A and q'
 
!  Matrix A is:
!  A = [[ 1  4  7 ]
!       [ 2  5  8 ]
!       [ 3  6  9 ]
!       ]
   A = reshape([(i, i = 1, size(A))], shape(A))
   q = A

   write(*, fmt) &quot;Matrix A is:&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, ((A(i, j), j = 1, size(A, 2)), i = 1, size(A, 1))

===Module programming===
A [[w:Modular programming|module]] is a program unit which contains data definitions, global data, and &lt;code&gt;CONTAIN&lt;/code&gt;ed procedures.  Unlike a simple [[w:include file|&lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; file]], a module is an independent program unit that can be compiled separately and linked in its binary form.  Once compiled, a module's ''public'' contents can be made visible to a calling routine via the &lt;code&gt;USE&lt;/code&gt; statement.

The module mechanism makes the [[w:type signature|explicit interface]] of procedures easily available to calling routines.  In fact, modern Fortran encourages every &lt;code&gt;SUBROUTINE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FUNCTION&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;CONTAIN&lt;/code&gt;ed in a &lt;code&gt;MODULE&lt;/code&gt;.  This allows the programmer to use the newer argument passing options and allows the compiler to perform full type checking on the interface.

The following example also illustrates derived types, overloading of operators and generic procedures.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;

We already discussed some of the general principles of archiving, now we'll make it happen for our drawing documents. Once we have the ability to archive shapes, we will find that implementing things such as cut and paste become straightforward.

You'll recall that when we added code to MyDocument to read and write the document to and from a file, we used a pair of objects called an NSKeyedArchiver and an NSKeyedUnarchiver. At that point, we simply archived our entire 'objects' array as the so-called ''root'' object. We didn't really care what happened behind the scenes - the archiver turned the array into an NSData object which we handed off to Cocoa which wrote the data to a file. When we opened a file, the unarchiver rebuilt our array which we then used as our objects array. So we should be able to save a drawing as a file and open it again, shouldn't we? No, not yet. The problem is that so far we haven't archived the actual properties of our shapes. WKDShape is a class we designed, so Cocoa doesn't yet know how to archive it. Thus if we try and save our drawings, we'll be disappointed that we get a blank document back when we open them again.

We tell Cocoa how to archive our shapes by writing a little code. We need these two methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder;
- (id)			initWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder;
&lt;/pre&gt;

These two are part of a ''formal'' protocol, NSCoding. We already met an informal protocol, which is just some methods that we agreed amongst ourselves to implement. A formal protocol is similar, except that it is strictly enforced - an object that implements a formal protocol MUST do so. In order to tell Cocoa that we want to be part of the formal protocol, we modify our class declaration like so:

 @interface WKDShape : NSObject &lt;NSCoding&gt;

This says we are going to be implementing the formal protocol ''NSCoding''. If we fail to do so, we'll get an error at compile time and will be unable to build our application.

Earlier we used NSKeyedArchiver, and its counterpart NSKeyedUnarchiver. Examination of the header files for these will show that  these are in fact subclasses of a more general class called an NSCoder. This is what is passed to the two methods above, the pair of which are required to implement the NSCoding protocol. All we need to do is to tell the coder which properties to add to its archive, it does the rest. We give each property a name or ''key'', and then use that key to retrieve the same property later. The properties we need to save for each shape are:

* its size
* its position
* its fill and stroke colours
* its stroke width

NSCoder has methods such as encodeObject:ForKey: and encodeFloat:forKey: that will handle the hard work. So here are our archiving methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder
{
	[coder encodeRect:[self bounds] forKey:@&quot;bounds&quot;];
	[coder encodeObject:[self fillColour] forKey:@&quot;fill_colour&quot;];
	[coder encodeObject:[self strokeColour] forKey:@&quot;stroke_colour&quot;];
	[coder encodeFloat:[self strokeWidth] forKey:@&quot;stroke_width&quot;];
}


- (id)			initWithCoder:(NSCoder*) coder
{
	[self init];
	[self setBounds:[coder decodeRectForKey:@&quot;bounds&quot;]];
	[self setFillColour:[coder decodeObjectForKey:@&quot;fill_colour&quot;]];
	[self setStrokeColour:[coder decodeObjectForKey:@&quot;stroke_colour&quot;]];
	[self setStrokeWidth:[coder decodeFloatForKey:@&quot;stroke_width&quot;]];
	
	return self;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first, encodeWithCoder, is used when saving. The properties are saved to the coder using the keys given here, which are just strings that identify the property. The decode method is the reverse. Note that it is an init method, which makes sense - the object is created from the data stream by the coder, so it needs to be initialised using the saved properties. Normally, an object will call [super initWithCoder:coder] and [super encodeWithCoder:coder] before doing anything else, so that proprties of all the subclasses are also saved as needed. In this case, because we have inherited from NSObject, which doesn't implement &lt;NSCoding&gt;, we don't need to do this (in fact it would be an error to do so). That's why in this case we call [self init] instead.

Now if you compile and run, you'll find that saving a drawing to a file works - when you open that file again, your drawing reappears exactly as it was when it was saved, including all the properties such as colours, etc.

==Cut and Paste==

Cut and Paste leverages archiving so that we can move objects between documents, etc. Now we are able to archive a WKDShape, we are also able to archive any set of these shapes reliably and easily. Recall that an NSKeyedArchiver converts a &quot;root object&quot; of some kind to a NSData object, which is just a block of data containing an encoded version of that object. NSData is written to a file in the case of saving the document, but if we write it to an object called a ''pasteboard'' instead, we have put that data on the clipboard, thus implementing a cut or copy. Paste is the reverse operation, similar to dearchiving a file; we unarchive the clipboard data and add the objects so created to the document.

Cut and Paste are commands, so we implement them as action methods in MyDocument. Add the following to the class definition in MyDocument.h and SAVE the file:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	cut:(id) sender;
- (IBAction)	copy:(id) sender;
- (IBAction)	paste:(id) sender;
- (IBAction)	delete:(id) sender;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We will be implementing all four. Note however that a cut is equivalent to a copy followed by a delete, and a delete is just a case of deleting the objects in the selection, so the only 'hard' work is in the copy: and paste: methods. Before we implement them, let's hook them up in IB.

double-click 'MainMenu.nib' to open it (if it's not open already in IB), and double-click the 'FirstResponder' icon. Recall that we use FirstResponder whenever commands can be implemented in a variety of places that depend on the context. This is just such a time, since cut and paste etc can be implemented in all sorts of ways by all sorts of objects. As it happens, you'll find that we don't need to do anything - cut, paste etc are all prewired for you when Mainmenu.nib was created. Verify that the menu commands are indeed connected to these methods.

In Xcode, flesh out these four methods in MyDocument.m. For now, don't add any code. Compile and Run the project. You'll now see that the Cut, Paste commands are available in the Edit menu. In fact we'd rather that these only became available when there was something selected to actually cut, but for now we'll accept the default behaviour until we have built and tested the code.

The object responsible for the clipboard behaviour in Cocoa is NSPasteboard. There are in fact a number of pasteboards for different tasks but the one we need is the basic one, called the 'general' pasteboard. When we receive a 'cut' command, we archive the selection into an NSData object, then place this data on the general pasteboard. Because this data is private to our application, we don't need to worry at this stage about converting it to a form that would be readable by other applications, such as TIFF or PDF.

Here is the implementation for our edit methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	cut:(id) sender
{
	[self copy:sender];
	[self delete:sender];
}


- (IBAction)	copy:(id) sender
{
	if ([[self selection] count] &gt; 0 )
	{
		NSData* clipData = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:[self selection]];
		NSPasteboard* cb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
		
		[cb declareTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;, nil] owner:self];
		[cb setData:clipData forType:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;];
	}
}


- (IBAction)	paste:(id) sender
{
	NSPasteboard* cb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
	NSString* type = [cb availableTypeFromArray:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;, nil]];
	
	if ( type )
	{
		NSData* clipData = [cb dataForType:type];
		NSArray* objects = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:clipData];
		NSEnumerator* iter = [objects objectEnumerator];
		id obj;
		
		[self deselectAll];
		
		while( obj = [iter nextObject])
		{
			[self addObject:obj];
			[self selectObject:obj];
			[(WKDShape*)obj repaint];
		}
	}
}


- (IBAction)	delete:(id) sender
{
	NSArray* sel = [[self selection] copy];
	NSEnumerator* iter = [sel objectEnumerator];
	id obj;
	
	while ( obj = [iter nextObject])
		[self removeObject:obj];
		
	[sel release];
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

cut: is simply a copy: followed by a delete:

copy: first checks that the selection isn't empty, and if not, it archives the selection to an NSData object using a keyed archiver. Then it obtains the general pasteboard. To put data on the pastebaord, you first declare the types that the data will have. This allows multiple representations to be placed on the clipboard of the same data - the receiver can decide which representation suits it best - for example a graphics program might want a TIFF image of the data, whereas a word processior might want a text representation, etc. Here, we only have one representation, which is a private format we call &quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;. Thus the &quot;list&quot; of types in fact only contains one item. Once we have declared the type, we can put the data on the pasteboard associated with that type.

paste: reverses this procedure. First it obtains the general pastebaord and checks that data of the type &quot;wikidrawprivate&quot; does exist. If not, it does nothing, so it won't attempt to paste data from another application that it cannot understand. Then we download the data fron the pasteboard, and unarchive it. We know it's an array of shape objects - whatever the copied selection contained in fact. We need to ADD these objects to the document, so we just iterate over the array and add and select the objects we come across. We also first deselect all the objects in the document so that the user gets the expected result - the pasted objects are selected after the paste.

The delete: method deletes the selected objects from the document. It does this by iterating over a COPY of the selection array. A copy is needed here because removing an object also deselects it - if we didn't make a copy we'd be modifying the same array that we are iterating over and things wouldn't work correctly. Once we've removed the objects from the document, we are done with the copy so we release it.

Compile and run the project and confirm that you have the ability to cut and paste objects between different documents.

Further exercises:

* Modify the code so that it also exports a PDF representation of the selection. This is moderately involved, but not that difficult. Hint: look at NSView's writePDFInsideRect:toPasteboard: method

* More complex: Add drag and drop behaviour. This is almost the same as Cut and Paste, and uses the 'drag' pasteboard. Override methods from NSView to get notified when to create the drag data and when to receive data dragged to the view.

Dustin K. Pitts
January 28, 2006

The following things are suggestions for the revision of my chapter over one-to-one relationships.

# Have a brief overview of what XML is.  Define the XML Schema, XML Style Sheet, and the XML Document.
# Have a better definition of the one-to-one relationship.  Relate it to the data model that is given.
# Reword the introduction so that the goals of the chapter a little more clear.
# In the new elements and attributes part of the Schema the third bullet should be its not it’s. 
# Have a separate category for the restrictions in the XML Schema.  It will set them apart more and allow for more organization.  Maybe a label or something would help this.
# Bold the titles of the restrictions so you can easily find them.
# Have a separate category for the If Statement.  Make it stand out. 
# Have a more in depth summary so that someone skimming the chapter can get a more general idea of what is going on.

==Editorial Board Suggestions==
MIST 5730 Advanced Data Management, University of Georgia, in response to Dustin

# The overview of XML is covered in a previous chapter. You could link to this information at the beginning of the chapter.

==Excellent Start==
Hi Dustin,

First of all.  Great Job!  Keep up the good work.

Yes, I agree that we need to start out with some basics of XML Schema.  I got very confused by the title.  Creating one-to-one relationships is not the right topic.

I think that restrictions are an advanced topic.  I don't even teach it in my beginning classes.

Here are the key concepts I introduce in one-day (8 hour class) on XML Schemas:
# History of XML and XML Schema
# XML Schema as compared to a DTD?  Why are Schemas better?
# What is it used for? (Validation of structure and data type checking)
# What is the structure of an XML Schema file?
# How do you add elements and attributes?
# How do you assign simple data types (string, boolean, integer and date)
# Adding enumerations
# Adding a pattern to validate a zip code
# How do you use an XML schema to validate an XML file (need a lab)
# What else are schemas used for (e.g. data mapping)

At the end of the class students feel they can create a simple XML Schema to validate some simple data.

I am looking forward to working with you on this.  Let me know if you want me to make any changes.  Collaborative writing is a challenge.

==Professor's comments==

We need to make clear to the reader that the schema is mapping only a portion of the model (the 1:1 aspect). Maybe the model should be redrawn with a color box around country and destination. If you want, I can do this, as all the models need to be maintained by one person. 
The prerequisites section should go in the first chapter and include topics such as knowledge of HTML and data modeling. It can be assumed that the preceding chapter is a prerequisite for the current chapter.
Section summaries are useful and there is an [[XML:_Managing_Data_Exchange/Author_guidelines#Section_summary | author guideline]] on how to make these standout in the text.

==Editorial Board Comments - Christina==

2/21/06

Dustin, thanks for making all of the changes that we suggested. I also like Dr. Watson's suggestion to highlight the 1:1 relationship in the data model presented in this chapter. And perhaps the data model could be truncated. For example, I don't know that it's necessary to include the &quot;hotel&quot; entity--if this were removed, the schema and document could also be simplified. 

I removed references in the chapter in regards to style sheets and Java parsing because there is no longer content in the chapter to explain these topics.</text>

So far we have built a fairly crude drawing program, but one that is starting to look like a real application. We have covered many of the core principles of Cocoa that you'll need to write any application. If you look at how much code we've actually written, it's not that much, yet our application is already quite functional. In this section, we'll look at adding finesse - those touches that separate real, well-designed and implemented applications from those lesser amateur efforts we've no doubt all seen.

==Undo==

The first thing to tackle is Undo. A real application should allow almost all actions to be undoable, in the spirit of forgiveness of the user. Without Undo, your application is likely to be discarded in favour of another one that has it, as punishing the user for mistakes, or not allowing them to experiment is a cardinal design sin!

Undo is traditionally one of the &quot;hard&quot; parts of implementing an application. Cocoa helps us massively here, and so Undo is not so hard. Usually, adding Undo as an afterthought is not a good idea - you need to design your application from the ground up to cope with the undo task. So far we have not mentioned Undo, but we have in fact designed our application to allow it to be added easily.

The principle of Undo is straightforward - whenever we do anything to change the state of the data model, the previous state is recorded so it can be put back. We can record this previous state in different ways, either just record the whole state, or parts of it along with tags to tell us what was changed, or we can record actions and perform the opposite action to implement Undo. We'll be using a combination of these things. Cocoa automatically combines several undoable &quot;recordings&quot; into one Undoable action for each event, which really makes life very simple for us - we simply need to make sure the recording happens at each editable point of interest.

We'd like the following to be undoable:

* adding new objects
* deleting objects
* changing the position or size of an object
* changing the stroke and fill colours
* changing the stroke width

Note that we could also make the selections themselves undoable, but in this exercise we won't do this.

In Cocoa, the object responsible for handling Undo is the ''undo manager''. It is embodied in the class NSUndoManager. The way it works is by storing ''invocations''. We already discussed how Objective-C uses runtime binding of class methods. An invocation is just a stored description of a method call. When the invocation is &quot;replayed&quot; the stored method call is actually made. The invocation not only records the target and method to be called, but also all of the method's parameters at the time the invocation was recorded. Thus we can create an invocation which when called, will undo the current action we are performing. Both the action and the invocation to undo the same action are created at the same time.

First let's add the code for undoing adding and deleting objects. Here is the modified code in MyDocument.m for addObject and removeObject:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		addObject:(id) object
{
	if(![_objects containsObject:object])
	{
		[[self undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
							selector:@selector(removeObject:)
							object:object];
		
		[_objects addObject:object];
		[_mainView setNeedsDisplayInRect:[object drawBounds]];
	}
}

- (void)		removeObject:(id) object
{
	if([_objects containsObject:object])
	{
		NSRect br = [object drawBounds];
		
		[[self undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
							selector:@selector(addObject:)
							object:object];

		[self deselectObject:object];
		[_objects removeObject:object];
		[_mainView setNeedsDisplayInRect:br];
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We obtain an undo manager by calling [self undoManager]. Every document has its own undo manager instance already set up, we just need to use it. We then use the registerUndoWithTarget:selector:object: method to build an invocation that the undo manager stores. When we add an object, we build an invocation to removeObject. When we remove an object, be build an invocation to addObject. In other words, we record the OPPOSITE of what we are doing. We have also added code here to refresh the main view when the objects come and go, so that we can see the effect that our actions have.

Compile and run the project. Create some shapes. Now Undo them. You'll find you can Undo and Redo as many actions as you want - everything works as you would expect for the Undo command. Not bad for just two lines of code!

Note that when Undo is performed, it calls, say removeObject, which in turn records another addObject undo action. This is how redo works - NSUndoManager knows the context it is called in, so can add tasks to the appropriate stack. Now let's make editable actions Undoable. For this, we'll need to add code to WKDShape, and at present shapes don't have an undomanager, nor do they know anything about the document they are part of, so they can't obtain one. So the first thing we need to do is to provide a way to allow shapes to obtain an appropriate undo manager.

In WKDShape.h, add a data member to the class called _owner, typed as NSDocument*. Add accessor methods setOwner: and owner. In the .m file, add the implementation:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setOwner:(NSDocument*) doc
{
	_owner = doc;
}


- (NSDocument*)	owner
{
	return _owner;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In MyDocument.m, add a line to addObject that calls setOwner with self - this makes sure that whenever an object is added to a document, the object is updated with which document it belongs to. Note that since everything that ever adds an object to a document calls this method, including paste for example, this information is always up to date. This is a strong design principle - always try to minimise the number of places in your code that change the data model by factoring code into a few key methods. Then you can add code to those methods in the knowledge that they will always be called, and nothing can get in &quot;through the back door&quot;. If we hadn't done this, implementing Undo would be very much harder than it has been so far.

Now we have a way for a WKDShape to obtain its owning document's undoManager, we can implement undo easily.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setFillColour:(NSColor*) colour
{
	[[[self owner] undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
								selector:@selector(setFillColour:)
								object:_fillColour];
	
	[colour retain];
	[_fillColour release];
	_fillColour = colour;
	[self repaint];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, we don't set up the undo using a different method, we use the same method, but with the OLD value of the colour. When the undo command is called, it calls this same method, passing back the original colour. The code for the stroke colour is identical.

The case for the stroke width is slightly more involved, because the undo manager doesn't directly store simple scalar values such as a float. Instead we need to pack the value up into an object. Cocoa provides a simple class for doing just this - NSNumber. As we need to be able to call a method that takes an object parameter, we must now create one. We'll refactor the code so that all the calls to set the stroke width now go through it.

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setStrokeWidth:(float) width
{
	[[[self owner] undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
								selector:@selector(setStrokeWidthObject:)
								object:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:_strokeWidth]];
	_strokeWidth = width;
	[self repaint];
}


- (void)		setStrokeWidthObject:(NSNumber*) value
{
	[self setStrokeWidth:[value floatValue]];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't forget to add the method setStrokeWidthObject: to your class declaration. Now if anyone calls setStrokeWidth, the old value is turned into an NSNumber object and used to build the undo invocation on setStrokeWidthObject: When Undo is called, setStrokeWidthObject: unpacks the encapsulated value and calls setStrokeWidth:, so everything works correctly.

Compile and go to test that changing properties using the inspector is now fully undoable. They should be!

Notice how Cocoa has separated each editing action into different Undo commands for you. If you drag around in the colour picker for example, the colour of the object will change many, many times until you stop dragging. But only one Undo command is needed to put back the previous colour - it doesn't visibly &quot;replay&quot; all of the individual intermediate colours.

There is one thing that isn't so great now however. If we Undo an editing change, the Inspector doesn't change! If we think about it, it's obvious why - previously we only set up the inspector to respond to selection changes which also set up the state of the controls. After that the inspector changes the object's state so they were always in &quot;synch&quot;. Undo isn't changing the selection state, but it is changing the object's state behind the inspector's back, so we need to tell the inspector to resynch when this occurs. To do this we need to add a new notification that the inspector can respond to.

This is very similar to the &quot;repaint&quot; notification - in fact it would be possible to use that one in this case, but since semantically it does have a different meaning, it is good practice to make it a separate notification. If later you extended the design you might find combining the notifications led to awkward problems. So create a new notification name and a method for sending it. I called it resynch. Call this method from every place that the object state can be changed from - setFillColour:, setStrokeColour:, setStrokeWidth: In the inspector, create a new responder method - I called it resynch: - taking a single NSNotification parameter. Subscribe to the resynch notification in the awakeFromNib method as before. The resynch: method looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		resynch:(NSNotification*) note
{
	WKDShape* shp = (WKDShape*)[note object];
	
	if ( shp == editShape )
		[self setupWithShape:shp];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can se, it's very simple - we find out which object was changed. If it's the one we are in fact currently editing, we simply call our setup method so that the control states match the object's state. Compile and run again to verify that this time, Undoing an edit operation also reflects the change in the Inspector.

Finally, we need to Undo moves and resizes of the object. By factoring all of this information through the setBounds: method, we have just one place to add the undo recording to. As with setStrokeWidth, we'll need to use an NSValue object to store the old rect.

Here's the refactored and modified code in WKDShape:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		setBounds:(NSRect) bounds
{
	[self repaint];
	[[[self owner] undoManager] registerUndoWithTarget:self
								selector:@selector(setBoundsObject:)
								object:[NSValue valueWithRect:[self bounds]]];
	
	_bounds = bounds;
	[self repaint];
	[self resynch];
}


- (void)		setBoundsObject:(id) value
{
	[self setBounds:[value rectValue]];
}


- (void)		setLocation:(NSPoint) loc
{
	NSRect br = [self bounds];
	
	br.origin = loc;
	[self setBounds:br];
}


- (void)		offsetLocationByX:(float) x byY:(float) y
{
	NSRect br = [self bounds];
	
	br.origin.x += x;
	br.origin.y += y;
	[self setBounds:br];
}


- (void)		setSize:(NSSize) size
{
	NSRect br = [self bounds];
	br.size = size;
	[self setBounds:br];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Compile and run... create a shape and move it. Now Undo. Is the action undoable in the way you expected? No, it's not. The action is undoable, but unlike the colour case, each individual small amount of motion has been recorded as a separate Undo task. The Undo manager has failed to group the motions into one big single action. Why is that? NSUndoManager groups all undo actions that occur within a single event. However, dragging an object consists of multiple events. We can't change that, but we can change the way that the undo manager groups things by giving it some hints.

In WKDDrawView.m, in the method mouseDown:, add the following line at the top of the method:

 [[[self delegate] undoManager] beginUndoGrouping];

and in the mouseUp: method, add the following line at the bottom of the method:

 [[[self delegate] undoManager] endUndoGrouping];

This will fix the problem - compile and run to verify. What this does it do tell the undo manager to group any undo recording it receives from now until the call to endUndoGrouping. We beging grouping on a mouse down, and end on a mouse up, so all the actions that occur during the drag will end up in the same group, and will be replayed under the single Undo command. Each individual offset of the shape is still recorded, but when played back the entire move is replayed so the effect for the user is the expected behaviour.

Finally, you'll probably have noticed that the menu command only shows a generic &quot;Undo&quot;. It would be nice if we could give our users a more meaningful indication of what the Undo operation will accomplish. To do this, we pass a string to the undo manager which is uses to build the menu command text. Whatever was the most recent string it received in a group will be the one used. The method is NSUndoManager's setActionName: method. For now we will just hard-code the strings for each action - in a real app we'd need to allow this to be localizable.

In WKDShape, this is straightforward. For example, in setFillColour, add:

 	[[[self owner] undoManager] setActionName:@&quot;Change Fill Colour&quot;];

just after the current undo recording operation. For all similar state changes, you can add a line with a string indicating the thing actually changed. Remember that the user will see this; you don't need to include &quot;Undo&quot; or &quot;Redo&quot;. To distinguish between resizing and moving a shape, you can include this line in the appropriate routines - they don't need to go directly in setBounds: also, don't forget the code where a handle is dragged interactively - mouseDragged:

The MyDocument changes are similar with one small kink - because we are using the 'opposite' method approach, we need to tell apart the case of undo/redo and a normal call and make sure we only update the string if we were called normally - i.e. not from an undo invocation. To do this, we use:

&lt;pre&gt;
		if (! [[self undoManager] isUndoing] &amp;&amp; ! [[self undoManager] isRedoing])
			[[self undoManager] setActionName:@&quot;Delete Object&quot;];
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run again to check that everything works as expected.

As a bonus, you'll notice that now, changes to the document automatically result in you being asked if you want to save changes when you quit or close a document. This is because by recording undo tasks, you are also notifying the document that its state is different from the disk file. Previously, it had no way to tell. Cocoa now steps in and adds that small piece of functionality for you &quot;for free&quot;. Neat!

Further exercises:

* Add the ability to undo selection changes. This will often result in a more usable application in practice.

==Printing==

Real applications should print. Again, in a traditional Mac application, adding the ability to print was usually hard work, and very often added as an afterthought, making it harder still! Cocoa is much easier, since there is no major difference between its on-screen graphics model and the printing model. In fact we already have most of the code written.

Printing is handled by an object called an NSPrintOperation, working in conjunction with an NSView. The view draws the content to the paper. For our simple exercise, we need very little code, since the default pagination scheme of tiling across pages is adequate. As you might imagine Cocoa provides numerous alternative approaches, but these are rather beyond the scope of just getting basic printing working.

As we have a document-based application, we use the printDocument: action method to get things going. Here's the code:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (IBAction)	printDocument:(id) sender
{
    NSPrintOperation *op = [NSPrintOperation printOperationWithView:_mainView
												printInfo:[self printInfo]];
    
	[op runOperationModalForWindow:[self windowForSheet]
         delegate:self
         didRunSelector:
         @selector(printOperationDidRun:success:contextInfo:)
		 contextInfo:NULL];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

We create an NSPrintOperation, passing it our main view which will render the drawing. Once we have  this, we then just run it using a sheet dialog. That takes care of the rest. The sheet requires a completion routine, but in this case we don't need it to actually do anything, so we simply provide it as an empty method:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (void)		printOperationDidRun:(NSPrintOperation*) printOperation
                success:(BOOL)success
                contextInfo:(void *)info
{
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't forget to add this to your class definition.

That's it! Compile and run it and you'll find that you can print out your drawings.

There's one thing that isn't so great here, and this is that it prints the selection handles. Really, we don't need to see these handles when a drawing is printed, so we'll now just modify the main view drawing code so that it doesn't bother to render these when it's printing. This turns out to be very simple:

&lt;pre&gt;
	while( shape = [iter nextObject])
	{
		if ( NSIntersectsRect( rect, [shape drawBounds]))
			[shape drawWithSelection:[selection containsObject:shape] &amp;&amp;
                                                                    [NSGraphicsContext currentContextDrawingToScreen]];
	}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the main loop inside our view's drawRect: method. We just add a check whether the current graphics context is drawing to the screen. If not, it must be drawing to the printer, so the objects are rendered without the handles, regardless of their selection state.

==Menu item maintenance==

We have seen how Cocoa automatically enables menu items that can find a target in the current context. That's pretty neat, but not always enough. For example, when we implemented Cut and Paste, we found these commands always enabled even if there was no selection to cut, or nothing on the clipboard we could paste. We'll now see how we deal with that.

Whenever a menu is displayed, the target is given a chance to overrule the normal enabling behaviour. It does this by implementing a method called validateMenuItem: which is called for each item. You can return YES to enable the item, NO to disable it. So in MyDocument, we add:

&lt;pre&gt;
- (BOOL)		validateMenuItem:(NSMenuItem*) item
{
	SEL act = [item action];
	
	if ( act == @selector(cut:) ||
	     act == @selector(copy:) ||
		 act == @selector(delete:))
		return ([[self selection] count] &gt; 0 );
	else if ( act == @selector(paste:))
	{
		NSPasteboard* cb = [NSPasteboard generalPasteboard];
		NSString* type = [cb availableTypeFromArray:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;wikidrawprivate&quot;, nil]];

		return ( type != nil );
	}
	else
		return YES;
}

&lt;/pre&gt;

As here, it's a good idea to compare the action selectors to determine which action the menu item is targetting, instead of looking at the menu item strings or position. An alternative would be to use the item's tag, but that would require that you carefully set these up in IB. By using the selector, you are immune from text and positional changes you might make to the menu - as long as it remains targetted at the same action method, it will behave correctly with respect to what that method actually achieves.

Here, if the item is targetting the cut, copy or delete methods, we see if there are any items in the selection array. If so, we enable the item, otherwise we disable it. For the paste case, we peek at the pasteboard to see if it has data of type 'wikidrawprivate' available - if so we can paste, so we enable that item.

You can implement a similar method in any target of a menu command so finely control the enabling of a menu item. You can also use the opportunity to change the text of a menu item to reflect some information you have in your data model if you like.

==Getting Started==
With Java, it is as easy as pie to get started. However, if you encounter difficulty in getting started with Java, you may find useful help and tips in this chapter. Our authors have tried their best to include as much useful content as possible in this chapter for your reference. But, nevertheless, if problems persist, please consult the authors using the [[Talk:Java Programming/Getting Started|discussion]] page above.

This section is a quick start to using Java:
installing Java software, compiling and running programs,
and some small sample programs to illustrate the basics of getting started with Java.

The previous chapter ''&quot;[[../Getting started|Getting started]]&quot;'' was a primer course in the basics of understanding how Java programming works. Throughout the chapter, we tackled a variety of concepts that included:
* Objects and class definitions;
* Abstract and data types;
* Properties;
* Methods;
* Class-level and method-level scopes;
* Keywords; and,
* Access modifiers, etc.

From this point on, we will be looking into the above mentioned concepts and many more in finer detail with a deeper and richer understanding of how each one of them works. This chapter on '''Language fundamentals''' introduces the fundamental elements of the Java programming language in detail. The discussions in this chapter will use the concepts we have already gathered from our previous discussions and build upon them in a progressive manner.

==The Java programming syntax==
In [[w:Linguistics|linguistics]], the word '''syntax''' (which comes from [[w:Ancient Greek|Ancient Greek]] ''[[wikt:σύνταξις|σύνταξις]]'' where ''σύν'' [syn] means &quot;together&quot;, and ''τάξις'' [táxis] means &quot;an ordering&quot;) refers to &quot;the process of arranging things&quot;. It defines the principles and rules for constructing phrases and [[w:Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in [[w:Natural language|natural languages]].

When learning a new language, the first step one must take is to learn its '''programming syntax'''. ''Programming syntax'' is to programming languages what ''grammar'' is to spoken languages. Therefore, in order to create effective code in the Java programming language, we need to learn its syntax — its principles and rules for constructing valid code statements and expressions.

Java uses a syntax similar to the [[C Programming|C programming language]] and therefore if one learns the Java programming syntax, they automatically would be able to read and write programs in similar languages — C, [[C++ Programming|C++]] and [[C Sharp Programming|C#]]

The next step one must take when learning a new language is to learn its keywords; by combining the knowledge of [[Java Programming/Keywords|keywords]] with an understanding of [[Java Programming/Syntax|syntax]] rules, one can create [[Java Programming/Statements|statements]], Programming Blocks, Classes, Interfaces, et al.

Use [[Java Programming/Packages|packages]] to avoid name collisions. To hide as much information as possible use the [[Java Programming/Access Modifiers|access modifiers]] properly.

Create [[Java Programming/Methods|methods]] that do one and if possible only one thing/task. If possible have separate method that changes the object state.

In an object oriented language, programs are run with objects; however, for ease of use and for historic reasons, Java has [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive types]]. Primitive Data Types only store values and have no methods. Primitive Types may be thought of as Raw Data and are usually embedded attributes inside objects or used as local variables in methods. Because primitive types are not subclasses of the object superclass, each type has a Wrapper Class which is a subclass of Object, and can thus be stored in a collection or returned as an object.

Java is a strong [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types|type]] checking language. There are two concepts regarding types and objects. One is the object type and the other the template/class the object was created from. When an object is created, the template/class is assigned to that object which can not be changed. Types of an object however can be changed by type casting. Types of an object is associated with the object reference that referencing the object and determines what operation can be performed on the object through that object reference. Assigning the value of one object reference to a different type of object reference is called type casting.

The most often used data structure in any language is a character string. For this reason java defines a special object that is [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.String|String]].

To aggregate same type java objects to an array, java has a special [[Java Programming/Arrays|array]] object for that. Both java objects and primitive types can be aggregated to arrays.

== Classes and Objects ==

An object-oriented program is built from objects. A class is a &quot;template&quot; that is used to create objects. The class defines the values the object can contain and the operations that can be performed on the object.

After compilation, a class is stored on the file system in a '(class-name).class' file.

The class is [[Java Programming/Class Loading|loaded]] into memory when we are about to [[Java Programming/Creating Objects|create]] the first object from that class, or when we call one of its static functions.

During class loading all the class static variables are initialized. Also operations defined in a &lt;code&gt;static { ... } &lt;/code&gt; block are executed. Once a class is loaded it stays in memory, and the class static variables won't be initialized again.

After the class is loaded into memory, objects can be created from that class. When an object is created, its member variables are initialized, but the class static variables are not.

When there are no more references to an object, the garbage collector will [[Java Programming/Destroying Objects|destroy]] the object and free its memory, so that the memory can be reused to hold new objects.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In the previous chapters, we have discovered the [[Java_Programming/Arrays|array]]. An array stores a group of primitive types. To group objects, or to reference a group of objects, we can use Java aggregate classes. There are two main interfaces, those are &lt;code&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&lt;/code&gt; . Implementations for those interfaces are not interchangeable.

== Collection ==
The implementations of &lt;code&gt;java.util.Collection&lt;/code&gt; interface are used for grouping simple java objects.

; Example: We can group together all patients in a Hospital to a &quot;patient&quot; collection.

== Map ==
The implementations of &lt;code&gt;java.util.Map&lt;/code&gt; interface are used to represent mapping between &quot;key&quot; and &quot;value&quot; objects. A Map represents a group of &quot;key&quot; objects, where each &quot;key&quot; object is mapped to a &quot;value&quot; object.

; Example: For each patient, there is one and only one main nurse assigned to. That association can be represented by a &quot;patient-nurse&quot; Map.

== Choice ==
A collection is better when you have to access all the items at once. A map is better when you have to randomly access an item regularly.

Before selecting a particular collection implementation, ask the following question:
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
''Can my collection contain the same elements, i.e. are duplicates allowed?''

''Can my collection contain the {{java:null}} element?''

''Should the collection maintain the order of the elements? Is the order important in any way?''

''How do you want to access an element? By index, key or just with an iterator?''

''Does the collection need to be synchronized?''

''From a performance perspective, which one needs to be faster, updates or reads?''

''From a usage perspective, which operation will be more frequent, updates or reads?''

&lt;/div&gt;

Once you know your needs, you can select an existing implementation. But first decide if you need a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;, or a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that the above associations are explicit. The objects them-self do not have any knowledge/information about that they are part in an association. But creating explicit associations between simple java objects is the main idea about using the aggregate/collection classes.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The ideal time to catch an error is at compile time, before you even try to run the program. However, not all errors can be detected at compile time. The rest of the problems must be handled at run time through some formality that allows the originator of the error to pass appropriate information to a recipient who will know how to handle the difficulty properly.

Improved error recovery is one of the most powerful ways that can increase the robustness of your code. Error recovery is a fundamental concern for every program you write, but it's especially important in Java, where one of the primary goals is to create program components for others to use. ''To create a robust system, each component must be robust''. By providing a consistent error-reporting model using exceptions, Java allows components to reliably communicate problems to client code.

==Flow of code execution==
In Java, there are two main flows of code executions.
* Normal main sequential code execution, the program doing what it meant to accomplish.
* Exception handling code execution, the main program flow was interrupted by an error or some other condition that prevent the continuation of the normal main sequential code execution. 

; Exception : Exceptions are Java's way of error handling.  Whenever an unexpected condition occurs, an exception can be thrown with an exception object as a parameter. It means that the normal program control flow stops and the search for a {{java:catch}} block begins. If that is not found at the current method level the search continues at the caller method level, until a matching {{java:catch}} block is found. If none is found the exception will be handled by the JVM, and usually the java program terminates. 

:When a {{java:catch}} &quot;matching&quot; block is found, that block will be executed, the exception object is passed to the block as a parameter. Then normal program execution continues after the {{java:catch}} block. ''See Java [[Java Programming/Keywords/try|exception handling syntax]].''

; Exception Object : This is the object that is &quot;thrown&quot; as a parameter from the error, and passed to the {{java:catch}} block. Exception object encapsulates the information about the error's location and its nature.  All Exception objects must be inherited from the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Throwable&lt;/code&gt;. See the [[#figure-1|UML diagram]] below.
{{Java/Illustration
|number=&lt;span id=&quot;figure-1&quot;&gt;6.1&lt;/span&gt;
|caption=Java exception classes
|image=[[Image:Java exception classes.svg|center]]
}}

; Matching rule : A thrown exception object can be caught by the {{java:catch}} keyword and specifying the exception object's class or its super-class.

; Naming convention : It is good practice to add Exception to all exception classes. Also the name of the exception should be meaningful, should represent the problem. For example &lt;code&gt;CustomerNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; indicate that customer was not found.

Reflection is a new concept in Java, and did not exist in classical compiled languages like C, and C++. 
The idea is to discover an object's attributes and its methods programmatically.</text>

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Reusability comes at the core of any modern computer language's framework. It is often desirable to use components you previously built in recurring environments. In [[w:Rapid_Application_Development|Rapid Application Development]], these prove more helpful as you can drag them off a list of components and use it elsewhere in your project. Such level of reusability is added into the Java Programming language with the help of the JavaBeans architecture.

JavaBeans are the mainstream Java component model, introduced in 1996 by Sun Microsystems. JavaBeans are defined as follows:

''&quot;A JavaBean is a reusable software component that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool.&quot;''

Together with the component model, Sun released a simple visual composition tool, the BeanBox. It is mostly intended for experimenting with Beans rather than offering a professional IDE. For real world applications, one should better deploy on one of the Java IDEs like Visual Age or JBuilder that support the visual composition of JavaBeans.

As we will see, JavaBeans do not essentially differ from standard Java classes, which makes the component model quite easy to use. What sets a JavaBean apart from normal Java classes is that a JavaBean follows the [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-138795.html Oracle JavaBeans Standard] (the term ''JavaBean'' or simply ''bean'' also refers to the instances of a JavaBean class). There is a set of features and conventions adopted for facilitating reuse:

* Presence of a no argument constructor;
* Support for persistence;
* Properties manipulated by getter and setter methods;
* Support for introspection;
* Events as the mechanism of communication between beans;
* Support for customization via property editors.

The JavaBeans standard provides a framework for creating objects to be used by GUI tools, including Java development environments. But in more common usage, a bean is a serializable class that follows the JavaBeans naming conventions for its properties. These naming standards make it easy to use Java [[Java Programming/Reflection|introspection]].

== Implementation ==

To follow these standards, the bean needs one or more ''properties'' abstractions which represent different state values of an object. A property has a name (a valid Java identifier) and a type (either a [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types|reference type]], a [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]] or an [[Java Programming/Arrays|array type]]). By default, the properties of a JavaBean class are inferred by the presence of either a getter method, a setter method, or both:
* A getter method which is used to obtain the value of the property from a bean. The name is usually of the form &lt;code&gt;get''PropertyName''&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the getter method for the String property &lt;code&gt;whiskey&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;public String getWhiskey()&lt;/code&gt;. For boolean properties (those whose type is [[Java Programming/Keywords/boolean|boolean]], the convention is to use the naming pattern &lt;code&gt;is''PropertyName''&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;isDiscounted()&lt;/code&gt; would be the getter method for a boolean property named &lt;code&gt;discounted&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the method signature of most getters is &lt;code&gt;public ''PropertyType'' get''PropertyName''()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;public boolean is''PropertyName''()&lt;/code&gt;.
* A setter method which is used to assign a value to a bean's property. A setter method is a method of the form &lt;code&gt;public void set''PropertyName''(''PropertyType'' value)&lt;/code&gt;. For the previous example, the setter could be invoked as &lt;code&gt;setWhiskey(&quot;bourbon&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;.

As per the JavaBeans standard, getters and setters defined as described above automatically determine the properties of the class. However, by creating &lt;code&gt;java.beans.PropertyDescriptor&lt;/code&gt; classes, you can specify alternate implementations by explicitly declaring the property names and the getter and/or setter methods for each property.

Properties are often implemented with [[Java Programming/Scope|private]] [[Java Programming/Variables|instance variables]], but this is not required.

== A Simple JavaBean ==

This is an example of a simple JavaBean type with the properties &lt;code&gt;int age&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;String color&lt;/code&gt;.

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.12: Puppy.java'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class Puppy implements java.io.Serializable {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 348652158488L;

  private String color;

  private int age;

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }

  public void setColor(String color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Persistence ==
The requirements for an object to be a bean is to define a public parameterless constructor, so that beans can be instantiated by builder tools in an uncomplicated way (In the Point bean, the parameterless constructor is given implicitly). Secondly, one of the interfaces &lt;code&gt;java.io.Serializable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;java.io.Externalizable&lt;/code&gt; need to be implemented. The interfaces do not prescribe the implementation of any methods, but are an approval, that the bean may be saved in persistent storage as in a file or database. In doing so, the bean can be restored after an application was shut down or transferred across networks. The ability to store state of a component in persistent storage is called ''persistence''. Java offers a standard serialization mechanism, which makes it very easy to serialize objects. Alternatively, a component can be stored in a customized manner (e.g. in xml format) by implementing the &lt;code&gt;Externalizable&lt;/code&gt; interface.

== Properties ==
The ''properties'' of a bean are all private fields that are accessible and modifiable by public methods. These getter and setter methods should be marked as such by following a simple naming convention: for some property named, say, &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; there should be a &lt;code&gt;getXxx()&lt;/code&gt; which returns the property value and a &lt;code&gt;setXxx()&lt;/code&gt; which sets the property.
 
== Introspection ==

In Java and J2EE programming, you can call a method on an object only if it is casted to a class or an interface that declares it. The structured definition of bean properties is very useful for comparing a single common property across several objects that are not and should not be related by inheritance.

For example, a program may contain both a bean representing a company's employees, and another containing a list of buildings that a company occupies. A programmer writing a function called &lt;code&gt;listAssetNames()&lt;/code&gt; wants to write a simple way of getting the field &quot;name&quot; from several beans that can get the field from both Employee and Building beans, and that can be easily adapted to get the same field from other types of beans that may not be written yet.

While this could be done by rewriting both Employee and Building so that they each inherit from one class named NamedObject, or by creating a NamedObject interface, both methods have their own problems. Using inheritance is limiting, as each child class can only inherit from one parent class, which limits the number of different classes that can share properties, as well as the number of common properties that can be shared. Furthermore, using inheritance to express relationships other than a simple &quot;is-a&quot; relationship can be confusing, as can looking through dozens of class definitions to find where a single &quot;dumb&quot; getter function is implemented. Creating an interface fixes the problems caused by the multiple inheritance rule, as a class can use any number of interfaces, but it still requires every shared property to be explicitly spelled out.

The simplest, most elegant way to deal with this type of relationship is to read the bean properties using introspection. The jakarta [http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/ BeanUtils] package is a common way of handling objects that need to be related in this way, as it takes advantage of the regularity of JavaBean naming conventions.

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.13: Get property from a JavaBean'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public static Object getProperty(Object o, String propertyName) {
   if (o == null ||
       propertyName == null ||
       propertyName.length() &lt; 1) {
      return null;
   }
   // Based on the property name build the getter method name
   String methodName = &quot;get&quot; +
                      propertyName.substring(0,1).toUpperCase() +
                      propertyName.substring(1);
   Object property = null;
   try {
      java.lang.Class c = o.getClass();
      java.lang.reflect.Method m = c.getMethod(methodName, null);
      property = m.invoke(o, null);
   } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
     // Handle exception
   }  catch (SecurityException e) {
     // No permission; Handle exception
   }
return property;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

or

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.14: Use [http://commons.apache.org/beanutils/ Apache Commons BeanUtils]'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import org.apache.commons.beanutils.PropertyUtils;

try {
  Object myValue = PropertyUtils.getSimpleProperty(o, propertyName);
} catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
  // Handle exception
} catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
  // Handle exception
} catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
  // Handle exception
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Events ==
JavaBeans interact with each other by means of ''events''. Events are notifications, a component can give to other components, that something interesting has happened. An example for an event might be a mouse click on a button or the closing of a window. Beans can be source and target of events. To be informed about an event, a bean has to register at another Bean as a ''listener''.

The Java event model realizes the observer design pattern with the effect that the inter-component coupling is reduced. Method calls require tight coupling, as caller and receiver need to know each other at compile time, while with events all communication happens solely via interfaces.

A special kind of event are &lt;code&gt;PropertyChangeEvents&lt;/code&gt;. They are used to restrict some properties to take only specific values, for example for a month integer values between 1 and 12. Every time, such a ''bound property'' is modified, notifications to all registered ''PropertyChangeListeners'' will be send.

== Customization ==
Customization is done via ''Property Editors''. A property editor is a tool for customizing at design time a particular property type. Property editors are activated from so-called ''property sheets'', which display all properties of a bean. If a property is selected for customization, the property sheet finds out the type of the property, displays the appropriate property editor with the property's current value.

== Additional Remarks ==
A big strength of the JavaBean component model is that it is designed for simplicity. Developing JavaBeans is very simple, because a lot of behavior (like the platform independence or packaging mechanism) is supported in the Java Programming Language by default. However, one can optionally equip beans with additional objects like ''BeanInfos'' or custom ''PropertyEditors'' to use the component model in a more flexible way. A second facility is that Sun designed the whole Swing GUI library according to the JavaBeans component model. Thereby Swing components can easily be composed in visual builder tools.
 
However, JavaBeans do not realize all features of a component model. A drawback is that JavaBeans are restricted to the Java programming language, while an important goal of components is the independence of an implementation language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''5-Color Format''' exists in slightly different variations in the online and offline Magic communities. 5-Color was initially a fan-created format, not supported by the DCI. The basic rules could be summarized as follows:

*Decks must contain a minimum of 250 cards
*Decks must have no less than 20 cards of each color
*No more than four of each non basic land card
*The game is played for ante, and ante cards, including Contract from Below, are legal

A full list of rules, including banned and restricted cards, is maintained at: http://www.5-color.com/

Due to the popularity of this non-sanctioned format, WotC created a similar format in the Magic online game.
