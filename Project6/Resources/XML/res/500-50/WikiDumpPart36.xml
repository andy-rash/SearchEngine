This is like [[Rueda de Casino/Dame Dos|dame dos]], but instead of missing out one partner, the leader misses out two.  The same technique is used for this as for [[Rueda de Casino/Dame Dos|dame dos]].

 Note: This move can be dangerous, be careful.

==An exhortation, if you will.==

If you google up &quot;latin subjunctives,&quot; the first entry points to Wikibooks Latin, and the second to this page. Needless to say, this is shamefully inadequate coverage of the subjunctive. I made the edits from October 4th in the history, but it's clear that that's far from enough. It also should probably be better organized. Maybe split up subjunctive form and subjunctive uses? 

Point is, if this is topping the Google ranks, then it had better live up to it. Or else people aren't going to be getting very lucky. [[User:4.156.117.143|4.156.117.143]] 04:49, 14 March 2006 (UTC)




Have ''any'' of you learned subjunctives ''before'' doing active and passive verbs? I certainly haven't. The chapter order here makes no sense.

Also, how did it go from the version of this page in May to what it was a few days ago? When/why did that happen?

And where do we go over the uses of the subjunctive? Hortatory, indirect commands, jussive, c-clauses, quominus clauses, etc? I thought I saw a page for that earlier, but now I can't find it.
 [[User:216.20.1.213|216.20.1.213]] 11:27, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

== Moods ==

I reverted the edit which said Latin has 5 moods.  I may be wrong.  As far as I know there are 3 moods (indicative, imperative and subjunctive) but some might claims that the ''infinitive, gerund, participle, gerundive and supine'' are moods also.  If there's a Latin expert who knows better then please go ahead and correct it.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:09, 16 November 2011 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North American Cuisines]]

'''Chicken and Andouille Sausage Gumbo''' is a soup or [[Cookbook:Stews | stew]] which is is prepared using [[Cookbook:Roux | roux]].

== Ingredients ==
* 1 cup (240 ml) canola oil
* 1 cup (240 g) [[Cookbook:Flour | flour]]
* [[Cookbook:The Trinity | Trinity]] (all chopped to 1/4&quot; inch)
:* 2 bell pepper
:* 1 large onion
:* 4 stalks of celery
* Chicken stock or equivalent
* Chicken breasts (about 2 lbs or 1 kg)
* Andouille sausage or other spicy sausage (about 1/2 lb or 1/4 kg)
* [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper | cayenne pepper]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Salt | salt]] to taste

== Procedure ==
# Brown outside of chicken breasts in small amount of oil then set aside.
# Make a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] in a large saucepan.
# Add Trinity to roux and soften. 
# Slowly stir in water.
# Cut up chicken breasts and add to gumbo to cook until done.
# Slice up sausage and add 1/2 hour later.
# Simmer. Serve in a bowl with a little rice and green onions on top. Gumbo will be better if left over night and eaten the next day.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
*Refer to reputable cooking website for genuine recipes.  This one is very simplified and will really disappoint.
*Hot sauce can be added to taste.
*[[Cookbook:Filé|Filé]] may be added to thicken individual servings as served.
*Use home-made chicken stock instead of water.  Water has no flavor by itself, and store-bought chicken stock has way too much salt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What to do now?==

Where to we go from here?  I would like to start a new &quot;Wikijunior&quot; book by November 1st, but I don't want to run roughshod over anybody else right now, nor show &quot;favoritism&quot; to any particular book suggestion.  The point here is that we want to have an orderly process of new Wikibooks coming &quot;on-line&quot; so that we don't overwhelm ourselves with so much work that we can't get it all done, but at the same time try to expand the community so people with diverse interests may want to participate.

Ultimately, I would like to do something like the current &quot;Book of the Month&quot; voting process, where we can vote on what the next title for Wikijunior should be.  Any other thoughts?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:51, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, voting is a good idea. We're all more likely to contribute to books we've voted for. After all, you wouldn't vote for it unless you thought it was interesting or doable. But based on the current amount of participants, I don't think having a ''monthly'' vote would be a good idea. Maybe more like three our four months would be a good time to vote. That seems to be how long it takes for a Wikijunior book to get off the ground. If more regular participants show up, then one to two months.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 23:19, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

::How about quarterly votes for now?  That way we can try to &quot;publish&quot; about 4 Wikijunior books per year.  With the current level of participation with the Wikijunior books, I think that may be possible, particularly if we start to get some publicity from some of the existing Wikijunior books, and that means we have already some &quot;in the pipeline&quot; that are ready to go as well.  If support is strong, we can scale back the time between votes, but it may mean that we have higher quality books anyway if we keep the number down.  I just want to make '''''some''''' way for new titles to be suggested and to keep the process moving.  Being totally stagnant with no new titles is going way too far.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:00, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Quarterly votes sound good. I think one of the reasons we don't have alot of partcipants is because we've had the same three topics up for about a year. (Ancient Civilizations doesn't count :)) And really, most people are turned off by the fact that there's nothing much left to write. Fact-checking and copy editing, how exciting! But still, having new topics will hopfully encourage more long-term participation in Wikijunior.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 04:27, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter]] ==

I just added this page to help decide what new project we should start.  In some ways, I would like this to be a vote that ends on December 1st rather than January 1st, but simple calendar quarters that end in January, April, July, and October do make sense and are fairly standard.  Feel free to change the rules or anything about this page as well.  I'm just trying to '''__BE BOLD__''' and get something accomplished. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:25, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

== New Category Suggestion ==

I am putting this on the discussion page instead of the New Title page because it is for a new category to list on the main page, instead of a single new book. I suggest we add a '''Unit Study''' or '''Lesson Plan''' category. I have been spending quite a bit of time proofreading the Solar System book this week in some attempt to get the &quot;almost done&quot; books all the way to &quot;finished&quot;. The teacher in me cannot help writing a lesson plan in my head that uses this book as the main source as I go along. I realize that lesson plans require a bit more knowledge on how to actually teach children than writing the text does, but it would be an excellent resource to add anyway. Both companion lesson plans to the existing Wikijunior canon and stand-alone unit studies could be listed in the category. [[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 22:30, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

== Unfinished Book Proposals ==
I have created a section for suggested book titles that lack enough information to be included in the voting, that are unfinished, that do not have any registered users listed as interested participants. I would also like to include a section for withdrawn proposals (There is one.) I would also like to list all the non-cannonical books under Unfinished Book Proposals (if they are not already listed.) I have also created an &quot;Adopted Wikijunior Titles&quot; section. I think Breaking it up like this makes it a lot more manageable. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 03:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC) 

== Naming Consistency and Sort Order ==
I think that all the suggested book titles should leave off the &quot;Wikijunior&quot; at the front. So instead of [[Wikijunior Bugs]] I would favor [[Wikijunior Bugs|Bugs]]. Also, I think each section should be in alphabetical order.

== Archival and Rework ==

I have changed this page up quite a bit. If anyone hates it, feel free to revert. I have archived off the old book suggestions and changed the template for new suggestions. My intent is to create new book suggestions based on the books that got more than two votes last quarter and the books that have already been started, but never received book of the quarter. The reason that I have done this is because I would like us to generally have a higher quality of book suggestions and a lower quantity. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:32, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Tiger_Desktop.png|none|thumb|830px|Fig. 1 - The Tiger Desktop.]]
If you think the Mac desktop looks good enough to eat, you're not alone. The Mac desktop is arguably the prettiest in the business, with translucent accents and candy-colored graphics. But what do the things on desktop actually do? This chapter explains the two main elements, the Dock and the Menu Bar, in full detail.

=The Dock=
[[Image:Tiger_Dock.png|center|thumb|830px|Fig. 2 - The Dock. Since the Dock is highly customizable, the one shown here may not look exactly like yours.]]

The ribbon of icons at the bottom of the screen is called the “Dock”. It combines many of the elements found in other operating systems into one compact little bar. Let's take a look at what the Dock can do and how it can do it.

If you look carefully at the Dock, you’ll see it’s cut in two by a thin, dark line. Each side of the Dock does very different things.

==The Left Side==
We’ll start by looking at the left side. All of the icons in the left side of the Dock are for various applications (programs). You can do two things with these icons:

* Launch Applications - If you click on an unopened application’s icon, that application will launch (open) right then and there. The icon will bounce as the application launches.

* Switch Between Open Applications - If an application is ''already'' open (indicated by a tiny black triangle under the icon or a blue dot), clicking its icon will &quot;switch&quot; to that application (bring its windows out in front of all others).

{{Mac Note Box|The Applications you see on your Dock actually live in a special folder on your hard drive (called the Applications folder), which you'll learn more about in [[Mac OS X Tiger/Using the Finder|Chapter 3]]. The applications appear on the Dock as well for your convenience.}}

Of course, ''you'' get to pick which applications appear on ''your'' Dock. Apple starts you out with a few it thinks you’ll like, but you're encouraged to pick your own. Let’s say you’re a frequent user of Adobe Photoshop. Rather then root through your Applications folder every time you need to open Photoshop, you can put its icon on your Dock, so you can open it with just one click.

How does one go about doing this? To add an application’s icon to the Dock, you simply drag it out of your Applications folder and drop it over the Dock where you want it to appear. The icons already in the Dock even scoot out of the way to make room! The application is still in the Applications folder as always, but now ''also'' appears in the Dock for quick access. 

To remove an application that you don’t want on your Dock anymore, simply drag its icon outside of the Dock and drop it anywhere, and it will evaporate in a puff of cartoon smoke (remember that the real Application is unaffected). You can also reorganize icons already in the Dock by dragging them horizontally.  This doesn't work if an application is running, which we'll get to later.

{{Mac Note Box|If the icons in the Dock refuse to budge, then the most likely explanation is that the “Administrator” (owner) of your computer has banned you from customizing your Dock.}}

It's also important to know that &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;whenever you open an application that’s not usually in the Dock, its icon appears in the Dock temporarily. When you quit the application, the icon automatically disappears&lt;/font&gt;.  This is the single most confusing thing about the Dock. Why does Mac OS X do this? Remember that the left side of the Dock not only lets you launch applications, but also switch between ones that are already opened. If you can't switch between ''every'' open application, regardless of whether they're used enough to warrant a permanent spot in the Dock or not, then the Dock fails as a good application switcher. While this is a bit difficult to understand, think about it carefully until you see how it makes sense.

==The Right Side==
Having discussed the left side of the Dock, it's time to look at the right side. The right side has absolutely nothing to do with switching or launching applications; its duties are much less important. It has four tricks up its sleeve:

* The Trash - The right side of the Dock has a little trash can icon glued into it. Covered fully in [[Mac OS X Tiger/Using the Finder|Chapter 3]], this icon is used to delete files on your Mac.

* Files - Just like the left side of the Dock lets you keep your favorite programs handy, the right side is the perfect place to park your favorite files and folders. You can drag files in and out just like you would an application in the left side of the Dock. To open a file or folder in the Dock, simply click on it.

* Links - In addition to files, the right side of the Dock can keep links to your favorite websites handy. Adding a link is as simple as dragging it into the right side. To remove a link, which looks like a circular springboard bearing an &quot;@&quot; sign, simply drag it out.

* Windows - When you minimize a window, a little thumbnail appears in the right side of the Dock. Minimizing is explained in the [[Mac OS X Tiger/The Mac Interface|next chapter]].


{{Mac Trick Box|If you right-click an icon in either side of the Dock, it will sprout a menu with some nifty options. The options vary dramatically depending on what the icon is. For instance, the menu for the iTunes icon will let you control the music that’s currently playing. Or how about if you right-click a folder in the right side of the Dock? The menu contains commands for quick access to every single file in that folder. Experiment and see what other menus you can discover!}}

==Customizing the Dock==
Now you understand the Dock’s many abilities. But as if choosing which icons go in your Dock isn’t enough, you can even modify the appearance of the Dock itself! If you want really fine-grained control over the Dock, you’ll need to delve into something called System Preferences, detailed later on in its own chapter. But many tweaks can be performed right from the Desktop.

A majority of the Dock controls on your Desktop reside in the &quot; &gt; Dock&quot; menu up in the Menu Bar. These include:

* Turn Magnification On - When you select this, your Dock responds with a neat “bulge” effect as you move your cursor over it. You’ll either love it or hate it. If this option is already active, it's replaced with “Turn Magnification Off”, which, as you might guess, turns the effect off.

* Turn Hiding On - If you have a small monitor, you’ll love this feature. It makes the Dock disappear completely unless you let your cursor rest right next to the edge of your screen where your Dock is. The Dock will then temporarily pop out so you can work with it.  If this option is already active, it's replaced with “Turn Hiding Off”. You can also toggle this option on and off using ⌘⌥D.

* Position on Left, Position On Bottom, Position on Right - These three options let you select where on the screen the Dock appears. A checkmark appears next to the currently selected one. Most people leave their Dock on the bottom, but some people prefer their Dock on the side. 

* Dock Preferences -  A handy shortcut to Dock Preferences (part of System Preferences).

But there's one option you can't adjust in the &quot; &gt; Dock&quot; menu, and it's possibly the most important. If you would like to adjust the size of the Dock, click and drag the thin dividing line in the Dock up (to enlarge) or down (to shrink).

{{Mac Trick Box|If you hold down Shift while dragging the dividing line, you can change the position of the Dock on screen.}}

=The Menu Bar=
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;The thin, white, strip running across the top of the screen is called the &quot;Menu Bar&quot;.&lt;/font&gt; It's a very important part of Mac OS X indeed. It contains a large number of commands and options, organized into &quot;menus&quot;. Read on to learn more.

==Using Menus==
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Menu.png|thumb|272px|right|Fig. 3 - A menu in the menu bar.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;If you've used a computer before, you'll know that menus are lists of items (usually commands or options) which the user can choose from&lt;/font&gt;, just like a menu at a restaurant is a list of meals which a customer can choose from. Menus are found in many different places in Mac OS X, but by far the most popular place is in the Menu Bar. 

The Menu Bar is a unique Mac OS X feature. In other operating systems, ''every window'' has its own menu bar. This causes a lot of unsightly clutter and wasted space, since you can only use one window's menu bar at a time anyway. So Apple designers gave the Mac one big Menu Bar at the very top of the screen. Depending on what window you are working with, different menus appear in the Menu Bar, alongside certain menus that appear no matter what you are currently doing.

Each menu in the Menu Bar is identified by a word or symbol. These are called &quot;titles&quot;. The title of the menu in Fig. 3 is &quot;Finder&quot;. Click on a menu's title, and the menu appears directly underneath, somewhat like a pull-down window shade. The menu will stay open until you '''a)''' choose a command by clicking on it, or '''b)''' close the menu by clicking elsewhere. If one menu is already open, you can switch to another menu simply by rolling your mouse over any other menu's title. 

If a command in a menu can be activated using a keyboard shortcut (or &quot;keystroke&quot;), then the keystroke appears to the right of the command itself. As you can see, the keystroke for activating the command &quot;Hide Finder&quot; in the menu shown in Fig. 3 is &quot;⌘H&quot;. 

{{Mac Note Box|For information on how to execute a keyboard shortcut, see the &quot;Shortcut Shorthand&quot; section on this wikibook's main page.}}

A few more menu tips, in no particular order:
*Commands that open dialog boxes or sheets always end with an elipsis (...).
*Some menus are hierarchal; that is, a menu can be nested ''inside'' another menu. These nested menus are called &quot;sub-menus&quot;, and are marked by small arrows.
*Some commands found in menus toggle on or off when you choose them. A checkmark next to the command's name indicates that it is &quot;on&quot;.
*If a command is not applicable at the moment, it appears dimmed. If all commands in a menu are not applicable, the menu's title appears dimmed, but you can still open the menu to take a peek at what it contains.
*Sometimes (but rarely), a few commands in a menu change slightly when you hold down a modifier key. For instance, the &quot;Minimize&quot; command in most applications' &quot;Window&quot; menu turns into a &quot;Minimize All&quot; command when you hold down the Option key.
*If a menu is too large to see all at one time, arrows appear at the top and bottom. Roll over an arrow, and the menu will &quot;scroll&quot; through the availible options.

==The Menu Bar from Left to Right==
Now that you know how to operate menus in the Menu Bar, we'll go across the Menu Bar from left to right and look at each menu you'll see.

===The  Menu===
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Menu_Bar.png|center|thumb|675px|Fig 4. The left side of the menu bar.]]
At the far left side of the menu bar is the  menu, which is represented by a blue Apple logo. It contains twelve items relevant to the entire Mac environment, and is always visible. The commands within let you turn off or restart your computer, log out, tweak some settings, update your software, etc. Here's a complete list:

* About This Mac - This opens a dialog box with a few bits of information about your Mac. The dialog box also has a button that opens System Profiler, a utility that can tell you the exact specifications of your Mac.
* Software Update - A link to Software Update, a dialog box which, oddly enough, is for updating your Mac’s software.
* Mac OS X Software - Takes you to a special page on Apple’s website expressly for downloading Mac software, most of which is free.
* System Preferences - Opens System Preferences, (See [[Mac OS X Tiger/System Preferences|Chapter 7]]).
* Dock - A menu within a menu. This was discussed when we talked about the Dock, earlier in this Chapter.
* Location - This is used in networking. (See [[Mac OS X Tiger/Networking your Mac|Chapter 9]]).
* Recent Items - A list of recently used files and applications.
* Force Quit  - If an application is misbehaving and refuses to quit, you can &quot;Force Quit&quot; it to pull the plug on it and let it die. Choosing this command opens a small force quit dialog box, which presents a list of running applications. Choose the one you want to force quit and press the pulsating blue &quot;Force Quit&quot; button to finalize your decision. When you're finished, close the dialog box and get on with your life. This is a safe procedure, and it won't affect Mac OS X as a whole or any other applications you have running.
{{Mac Trick Box|If you hold down Shift, this becomes Force Quit [Current App], which Force Quits the app that you are using.}}
* Sleep, Restart, Shut Down - These are pretty self-explanatory. They make your Mac sleep, restart, or shut down.
* Log Out [Your Name Here] - If you have multiple accounts on your Mac (See [[Mac OS X Tiger/User Accounts|Chapter 8]]), you can log out and let someone else onto your Mac with this command.

===The Application Menu===
To the right of the  menu is the Application menu. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;This menu's title is the same as the name of the application you are currently using&lt;/font&gt;. For example, if you're using iTunes, the menu is called “iTunes&quot;. The menu contains commands relevant to the application itself: you can find information about it, quit it, hide it, and adjust its preferences.

===Other Menus===
Next to the Application menu are a few other menus containing commands for application you're currently using. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;While every app uses a different set of menus, there are some menus used often throghout most programs&lt;/font&gt;. This section lists the six most commonly used menus (from left to right in the most common order) and the kind of commands you're most likely to find in them.
====File Menu====
The File menu contains commands pertaining to an individual file that you're working on. You'll find commands related to creating new files and opening, closing, saving, and printing ones that are currently open.

====Edit Menu====
The Edit menu contains commands pertaining to an application's data, and the clipboard. You can use the edit menu to:

*Undo and Redo actions you perform
*Select All of a window or text field's contents
*Insert special characters such as é,æ,€, and ⌘
*Manipulate the contents of the clipboard, which helps you move content between windows and applications.
**Cut - Removes the selected data and puts it in the clipboard, overwriting whatever was on the clipboard before.
**Copy - Makes a duplicate of the selected data and stores it in the clipboard, overwriting whatever was on the clipboard before.
**Paste - Inserts the contents of the clipboard into where you are currently working. The contents of the clipboard remain, so you can paste the same thing multiple times.
**Paste and Match Style - Found in some text-editing applications, the Paste and Match style command pastes the text and adjusts its style to match the style of the surrounding text.
**Delete - Deletes whatever is selected (the contents of the Clipboard are unaffected).

====Format Menu====
Text-editing apps often include this menu for adjusting the formatting (appearance) of text. However, this menu is often changed beyond recognition in non-Apple applications, which insist on using their own set of commands in totally different places. The Apple-sanctioned commands for this menu are:

*Format selected text with different fonts, sizes, colors, and effects
*Copy the style of one block of text and &quot;paste&quot; (apply) the exact same styling to another block
*Adjust alignment and the window's ruler (if the window indeed has one)
*Copy the ruler (alignment settings) of one block of text and paste it to another

====View Menu====
The View menu contains commands that let you choose what you see on your screen and how you see it.

====&lt;Other Menus Go Here&gt;====
Applications that use menus not described in this chapter always stick them here, between the View menu and the Window menu.

====Window Menu====
This menu contains commands for managing all of an application's open windows (windows are explained in more detail in the next chapter). You can:

*Minimize and Zoom windows
*Bring all of an application's windows to the front of the stack, with or without arranging them for easy access

The window menu also contains a complete list of windows for the current application. Choosing a window brings it out in front of all others. The frontmost window is marked with a check, minimized windows are marked with a diamond, and windows containing unsaved changes are marked with a circular dot.

====Help Menu====
The Help Menu contains commands for opening the help system for the current Application.

===The Gap===
This white space separates everything explained above from everything explained below.

===The Menu Bar Extras===
The menus on the right side of the menu bar look a little bit different, since they consist not only of words but of symbols. These are called “Menu Bar Extras”. Menu Bar Extras are always in your menu bar, and let you do things like change your computer's sound volume, see the time, view your laptop’s battery life, etc. Coverage for them is scattered throughout this Wikibook.

{{Mac Note Box|If there isn't enough room on your screen to show the complete contents of the menu bar, the menu bar extras are temporarily hidden to make room.}}

[[Image:Tiger_Righthand_Menu_Bar.png|center|thumb|675px|Fig 5. The right-hand side of the menu bar. You can customize it with different menulets, so yours may not look exactly like this one.]]

===The Spotlight Menu===
Finally, at the far right of the menu bar, is the Spotlight menu, which looks like a little white magnifying glass in a blue circle. It lets you use Spotlight search technology, a new feature in Tiger, and is covered in the [[Mac OS X Tiger/The Mac Interface|next chapter]].

The Python Standard Library is a collection of script modules accessible to a Python program to simplify the programming process and removing the need to rewrite commonly used commands. They can be used by 'calling' them at the beginning of a script.

A list of the Standard Library modules can be found at http://www.python.org/doc/.

The following are among the most important:
* time
* sys
* os
* math 
* random
* pickle
* urllib
* re
* cgi
* socket

== '''d'Alembert Solutions''' ==


In 1747, [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/D'Alembert.html Jean Le Rond d'Alembert]published a solution to the one-dimensional wave equation. 

The general solution, now known as the d'Alembert method, can be found by introducing two new variables:


&lt;math&gt;\xi=ct-x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta=ct+x\,&lt;/math&gt;

                           
and then applying the chain rule to the general form of the wave equation. 

From this, the solution can be written in the form:

                           
&lt;math&gt;y(\xi,\eta)= f(\xi)+g(\eta)\,=f(x+ct)+g(x-ct)&lt;/math&gt;  


where f and g are arbitrary functions, that represent two waves traveling in opposing directions.   


A more detailed look into the proof of the d'Alembert solution can be found [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/dAlembertsSolution.html here. ]

== ''' Example of Time Domain Solution''' ==

If f(ct-x) is plotted vs. x for two instants in time, the two waves are the same shape but the second displaced by a distance of c(t2-t1) to the right.



The two arbitrary functions could be determined from initial conditions or boundary values.

== Procedure ==

# Add ingredients to a 2-pound capacity [[Cookbook:Bread Machine|bread machine]] in the order listed, select dough cycle, and press start. 
# Remove when cycle is complete.
# Preheat oven to 400 [[Cookbook:F|°F]] (200 [[Cookbook:C|°C]]) 
# When dough is finished, form into desired shape on a floured surface, and place on baking sheet or pizza stone. &lt;ref group=note&gt;There is no [[wikipedia:Proofing_(baking_technique)|proofing]] time specified.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[cookbook:Bake|Bake]] until lightly brown and firm. Cooking time will vary with altitude (20-40 minutes). 
# Cool and enjoy.

==Variations==

*To make a twist loaf, roll dough into a cylindrical shape with your hands, but make one end of the cylinder thicker than the other. Then divide the cylinder with a knife down the center of the thicker end, creating a ring with a protruding cylinder. Braid and bake.
*Brush loaf with an eggwash (1 egg + a scant amount of water) or egg white, melted margarine or butter, or olive oil for a crisper crust. 
*Sprinkle brushed loaf with minced garlic, chopped herbs, ground spices, grated cheese, ground pepper and/or kosher salt for flavor. 
*Toss or roll into a flat disc and top with tomato sauce, olive oil, chopped meat, vegetables and/or grated cheeses to create a pizza (bake until cheese is melted).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What country did they live in? ==
The Akkadians lived on the Arabian Peninsula, a piece of land that sits between Europe, Africa, and Asia. Today, many countries share this land, including Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait.

The Akkadians lived on the Arabic peninsula then migrated north which created a big conflict with the Sumerian city-states. The Akkadians finally settled in Mesopotamia. Today this area is part of the Middle East.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
They built many types of buildings, including large temples and monuments. Their most famous buildings are called ziggurats, which are sort of like square pyramids. The first floor is the largest, and each floor up gets progressively smaller until you reach the top room. The Tower of Babylon is one famous example of this kind of building. The Akkadians buildings were made with handfuls of wet clay. The walls were poorly constructed. One way walls were made was to outline the shape of your house with lumps of clay and let it dry in the hot sun. A faster way was to use wood planks and put a layer of clay between each board. Their houses were shaped like domes, the whole dome was made out of clay.

== What did they eat? ==
Akkadians hunted fish, duck, and geese. They also ate dates, bread, onions, beans, cucumbers, garlic, and a few other fruits and vegetables. Then they would wash it down with beer or water. 

== What did their writing look like? ==

The language used a writing system called cuneiform. Wedge shaped symbols or strokes were carved or pressed into clay tablets with a reed stylus. This writing system was invented by the Sumerians around 3500 BC. Akkadians put their language into cuneiform and many early stories were found preserved in Akkadian text.  

== What did they believe? ==
The Akkadians adopted the Sumerian culture and its ideas. The Sumerians were polytheistic. The Sumerian's Gods An, En-lil, and En-ki lost supremacy to Astral Triad, which consisted of Sin (the moon), Ishtar (venus), and Shamash(the sun).

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
None recorded because this was an ancient civilization

== What is left of them today? ==
The Akkadians were Semitic people and their descendants survive today among the modern Arabs and Jews .

== When did their civilization exist? ==

The Akkadian civilization existed during the Mesopotamian times. About 6,000 years ago they lived with the Sumarians and Babylonians. The Babylonians, Sumerians, and the Akkadians all lived in peace with each other. They did not war with the other civilizations, they actually traded. They overran Sumer between 2400BC and 2100BC. Eventually they were conquered by the Babylonians. They still lived in Mesopotamia but eventually died out with the Sumarians.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= My Store =

You can set up many fundamental features in ''My Store''.

== '''My Super Store''' == 

This is the name of the website as presented to the public. The shopper's web browser window displays on the title bar.[[:Image:]]

== Store Owner == 

The name of the store owner. On the web page as the customer sees it this appears at xxx.

== Store Logo ==

This is the logo that appears in the top left hand corner of all pages and on the customer receipts.

== E-Mail Address == 

The main store's email address. On the web page as the customer sees it this appears at xxx.

== E-Mail From ==

When you send an email to your customers this is the email address they will see that it is from. This is also the return email address will be this.

== Country == 

This is the country in which the store is based. On the web page as the customer sees it this appears at xxx.

== Zone == 

This is the zone in which the store is located within that country. xxx.

== Expected Sort Order ==

CRE Loaded can sorts lists of products and other types of lists. You can choose whether they ascend (i.e. a, b, c, d or 1, 2, 3, 4) or descend (i.e. d, c, b, a or 4, 3, 2, 1) here.

Set this value to ''asc'' for an ascending order or ''desc'' for a descending order.

== Expected Sort Field == 

CRE Loaded will sort this field.

You have two choices: ''date_expected'' and ''products_name''.  They are self explanatory.

== Switch To Default Language Currency ==

If this is set to ... the default language currency is always used when a customer first arrives at your site.

== Send Extra Order Emails To ==

When your customer makes an order, this option will allow you to specify which emails extra orders should be sent to.

== Use Search-Engine Safe URLs (still in development)==

Sites such as Google dislike the long database derived URLs that CRE Loaded uses. This option will attempt to disguise the URLs, so Google and others are more likely to link to your pages. 

You should note that this feature is still in development. Do not use it unless you realise what you are doing.

== Display Cart After Adding Product ==

Customers will see their shopping cart straight away after adding to it. The advantage is that customers are encouraged to purchase goods straight away and are less likely to wander-off. The disadvantage is that they are less likely to add more products to the cart. You may want to test market this feature in order to decide whether you want it on or off.

== Allow Guest To Tell A Friend ==

Do you want to allow people who are not logged-in to tell a friend about one of your products? Absolutely yes!

Do you want to allow spam-bots which are not logged-in to send spam from your servers? Definitely not!

Be careful if you turn this option on. Seek help to keep it from being exploited.

== Default Search Operator ==

When searching the store customers will often type more than one word into the search box. You can make the default search operator '''and''' or '''or''' as follows:

 ''first search term'' '''and''' ''second search term''

or

 ''first search term'' '''or''' ''second search term''

For instance if a customer searches for ''baking tray'' and the default search operator is set to '''and''' then all products which contain ''baking'' '''and''' ''tray'' will be included in the search. Similarly if this value is set to '''or''' then all products which contain ''baking'' '''or''' which contain ''tray'' will be included in the results list.

== Store Address and Phone ==

Put your address and phone number here.

== Show Category Counts ==

The server will count recursively how many products are in each category. This is displayed xxx.

== Allow Category Descriptions ==

Turn this on to enable full text descriptions for categories.

== Enable Admin Dhtml menu ==

Turn this on to enable drop-down menus in the admin section. They look pretty cool - but be careful as they don't always work on everybody's set up - the side menus will disappear and you won't be able to change it back if there is a problem.

== Tax Decimal Places ==

This is the number of decimal places that are included in sales tax.

== Show Featured Products on Main Page ==

If you want Featured products to be shown on the main page switch this value on.

== Display Prices with Tax ==

You can either display the product with the price including tax, or the price excluding tax.

== Welcome Gift Voucher Amount ==

When customers register for your store you can give them a fixed gift voucher.

== Welcome Discount Coupon Code ==

Newly registered customers can be given a discount coupon here.

== Category/Products Display Order ==

This is the order in which category/ products should be displayed.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mm35173. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mm35173~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

== Electric Charge (Coulombs) ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;An electron has a charge of&lt;br&gt; '''-1.602&amp;times;10E-19''' C.}}

[[:w:Electric_charge|'''Electric charge''']] is a [[:w:physical property|physical property]] of [[:w:matter|matter]] that causes it to experience a [[:w:force|force]] when near other electrically charged matter. Electric Charge (symbol q) is measured in SI units called '''&quot;Coulombs&quot;''', which are abbreviated with the letter capital C. 

We know that q=n*e, where n = number of electrons and e= 1.6*10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence n=1/e coulombs. A Coulomb is the total charge of 6.24150962915265×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electrons, thus a single electron has a charge of −1.602 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt;.

It is important to understand that this concept of &quot;charge&quot; is associated with static electricity. Charge, as a concept, has a physical boundary that is related to counting a group of electrons. &quot;Flowing&quot; electricity is an [[:w:Electric_charge#Static_electricity_and_electric_current|'''entirely different situation''']]. &quot;Charge&quot; and electrons separate. Charge moves at the speed of light while electrons move at the speed of [[:w:Drift_velocity|'''1 meter/hour''']]. Thus in most circuit analysis, &quot;charge&quot; is an abstract concept unrelated to energy or an electron and more related to the flow of [[:w:Physical_information|'''information''']]. 

Electric charge is the subject of many fundamental laws, such as [[:w:Coulomb%27s_law|'''Coulomb's Law''']] and [[:w:Gauss%27s_law|'''Gauss' Law''']] (static electricity) but is not used much in circuit theory.

== Voltage (Volts) ==

'''Voltage''' is a measure of the work required to move a charge from one point to another in a electric field. Thus the unit &quot;volt&quot; is defined as a Joules (J) per Coulomb (C).

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{W}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

W represents work, q represents an amount of charge. Charge is a static electricity concept. The definition of a volt is shared between static and &quot;flowing&quot; electronics.

Voltage is sometimes called &quot;electric potential&quot;, because voltage represents the  a difference in Electro Motive Force (EMF) that can produce current in a circuit. More voltage means more potential for current. Voltage also can be called &quot;Electric Pressure&quot;, although this is far less common. 

Voltage is not measured in absolutes but in ''relative'' terms. The English language tradition obscures this. For example we say &quot;What is the distance to New York?&quot;  Clearly implied is the relative distance from where we are standing to New York. But if we say &quot;What is the voltage at ______?&quot; What is the starting point? 

Voltage is defined between two points. Voltage is relative to where 0 is defined. We say &quot;The voltage from point A to B is 5 volts.&quot; It is important to understand EMF and voltage are two different things. 

When the question is asked &quot;What is the voltage at ______?&quot;, look for the ground symbol on a circuit diagram. Measure voltage from ground to _____. If the question is asked &quot;What is the voltage from A to B?&quot; then put the red probe on A and the black probe on B (not ground). 

The absolute is referred to as &quot;EMF&quot; or Electro Motive Force. The difference between the two EMF's is a voltage.

== Current (Amperes)==

'''Current''' is a measurement of the flow of electricity. Current is measured in units called '''Amperes''' (or &quot;Amps&quot;). An ampere is &quot;charge volume velocity&quot; in the same way water current could be measured in &quot;cubic feet of water per second.&quot; But current is a [[:w:SI_base_unit|'''base SI unit''']], a fundamental dimension of reality like space, time and mass. A coulomb or charge is not. A coulomb is actually defined in terms of the ampere. &quot;Charge or Coulomb&quot; is a [[:w:SI_derived_units#Derived_units_with_special_names|'''derived SI Unit''']]. The coulomb is a fictitious entity left over from the [[:w:History_of_electromagnetic_theory#Late_18th_century|'''one fluid /two fluid''']] philosophies of the 18th century. 

This course is about flowing electrical energy that is found in all modern electronics. Charge volume velocity (defined by current) is a useful concept, but understand it has no basis in reality. Do not think of current as a bundle electrons carrying energy through a wire. [[Special_Relativity|Special relativity]] and [[Quantum_Mechanics|quantum mechanics]] concepts are necessary to understand how electrons move at [[:w:Drift_velocity|'''1 meter/hour''']] through copper, yet electromagnetic energy moves at near the speed of light.

{{SideBox|[[:w:Electric_charge#Properties|'''Charge''']] is similar to the [[:w:Rest_mass|'''rest mass''']] concept of relativity and generates the [[:w:Charge_(physics)|'''U(1) symmetry''']] of electromagnetism}}

Amperes are abbreviated with an &quot;A&quot; (upper-case A), and the variable most often associated with current is the letter &quot;i&quot; (lower-case I). In terms of coulombs, an ampere is:

:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{dq}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|For the rest of this book, the lower-case J (&amp;nbsp;j&amp;nbsp;) will be used to denote an imaginary number, and the lower-case I (&amp;nbsp;i&amp;nbsp;) will be used to denote current.}}

Because of the widespread use of complex numbers in Electrical Engineering, it is common for electrical engineering texts to use the letter &quot;j&quot; (lower-case J) as the imaginary number, instead of the &quot;i&quot; (lower-case I) commonly used in math texts. This wikibook will adopt the &quot;j&quot; as the imaginary number, to avoid confusion.

== Energy and Power ==

Electrical theory is about energy storage and the flow of energy in circuits. Energy is chopped up arbitrarily into something that doesn't exist but can be counted called a coulomb. Energy per coulomb is voltage. The velocity of a coulomb is current. Multiplied together, the units are energy velocity or power ... and the unreal &quot;coulomb&quot; disappears.

===Energy===
Energy is measured most commonly in Joules, which are abbreviated with a &quot;J&quot; (upper-case J). The variable most commonly used with energy is &quot;w&quot; (lower-case W). The energy symbol is w which stands for work.

From a thermodynamics point of view, all energy consumed by a circuit is work ... all the heat is turned into work. Practically speaking, this can not be true. If it were true, computers would never consume any energy and never heat up.

The reason that all the energy going into a circuit and leaving a circuit is considered &quot;work&quot; is because from a thermodynamic point of view, electrical energy is ideal. All of it can be used. Ideally all of it can be turned into work. Most introduction to thermodynamics courses assume that electrical energy is completely organized (and has entropy of 0).

===Power===
A corollary to the concept of energy being work, is that all the energy/power of a circuit (ideally) can be accounted for. The sum of all the power entering and leaving a circuit should add up to zero. No energy should be accumulated (theoretically). Of course capacitors will charge up and may hold onto their energy when the circuit is turned off. Inductors will create a magnetic field containing energy that will instantly disappear back into the source through the switch that turns the circuit off.

This course uses what is called the &quot;[[:w:Electric_power#Passive_sign_convention|passive]]&quot; sign convention for power. Energy put into a circuit by a power supply is negative, energy leaving a circuit is positive.

Power (the flow of energy) computations are an important part of this course. The symbol for power is w (for work)  and the units are Watts or W.</text>

== Boundary Conditions ==

The functions representing the solutions to the wave equation previously discussed,


i.e.    &lt;math&gt;y(x,t)= f(\xi)+g(\eta)\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\xi=ct-x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta=ct+x\,&lt;/math&gt; 


are dependent upon the boundary and initial conditions.  If it is assumed that the wave is propagating through a string, the initial conditions are related to the specific disturbance in the string at t=0.  These specific disturbances are determined by location and type of contact and can be anything from simple oscillations to violent impulses.  The effects of boundary conditions are less subtle.


The most simple boundary conditions are the Fixed Support and Free End.  In practice, the Free End boundary condition is rarely encountered since it is assumed there are no transverse forces holding the string (e.g. the string is simply floating).

=== For a Fixed Support:===

The overall displacement of the waves travelling in the string, at the support, must be zero.  Denoting x=0 at the support, This requires:


&lt;math&gt;y(0,t)= f(ct-0)+g(ct+0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, the total transverse displacement at x=0 is zero.

The sequence of wave reflection for incident, reflected and combined waves are illustrated below. Please note that the wave is traveling to the left (negative '''x''' direction) at the beginning. The reflected wave is ,of course, traveling to the right (positive '''x''' direction).

'''t=0'''
[[Image:Fixed_t0.gif]]

'''t=t1'''
[[Image:Fixed_t1.gif]]

'''t=t2'''
[[Image:Fixed_t2.gif]]

'''t=t3'''
[[Image:Fixed_t3.gif]]

=== For a Free Support:===

Unlike the Fixed Support boundary condition, the transverse displacement at the support does not need to be zero, but must require the sum of transverse forces to cancel.  If it is assumed that the angle of displacement is small, 

&lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)\approx\theta=\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and so,

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_{y} = T\sin(\theta)\approx T\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

But of course, the tension in the string, or T, will not be zero and this requires the slope at x=0 to be zero:

i.e. &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Again for free boundary, the sequence of wave reflection for incident, reflected and combined waves are illustrated below:

'''t=0'''
[[Image:Free_t0.gif]]

'''t=t1'''
[[Image:Free_t1.gif]]

'''t=t2'''
[[Image:Free_t2.gif]]

'''t=t3'''
[[Image:Free_t3.gif]]

=== Other Boundary Conditions:===

There are many other types of boundary conditions that do not fall into our simplified categories.  As one would expect though, it isn't difficult to relate the characteristics of numerous &quot;complex&quot; systems to the basic boundary conditions.  Typical or realistic boundary conditions include mass-loaded, resistance-loaded, damping-loaded, and impedance-loaded strings. For further information, see Kinsler, Fundamentals of Acoustics, pp 54-58.

Here is a website with nice movies of wave reflection at different BC's:

== Wave Properties ==

To begin with, a few definitions of useful variables will be discussed.  These include; the wave number, phase speed, and wavelength characteristics of wave travelling through a string.


The speed that a wave propagates through a string is given in terms of the phase speed, typically in m/s, given by: 


&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{T/\rho_{L}}\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the density per unit length of the string.


The wave number is used to reduce the transverse displacement equation to a simpler form and for simple harmonic motion, is multiplied by the lateral position.  It is given by:


&lt;math&gt;k=\left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega=2\pi f\,&lt;/math&gt;


Lastly, the wavelength is defined as: 

&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\left( \frac{2\pi}{k} \right)=\left( \frac{c}{f} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt; 

and is defined as the distance between two points, usually peaks, of a periodic waveform.  

These &quot;wave properties&quot; are of practical importance when calculating the solution of the wave equation for a number of different cases.  As will be seen later, the wave number is used extensively to describe wave phenomenon graphically and quantitatively.

== Forced Vibrations ==
1.forced vibrations of infinite string
suppose there is a string very long , at x=0 there is a force exerted on it.


F(t)=Fcos(wt)=Real{Fexp(jwt)}


use the boundary condition at x=0,

neglect the reflected wave


it is easy to get the wave form

where w is the angular velocity, k is the wave number.

according to the impedance definition

it represents the characteristic impedance of the string.
obviously, it is purely resistive, which is like the resistance in the mechanical system.


----
The dissipated power

Note: along the string, all the variables propagate at same speed.

== Boundary Conditions ==

The functions representing the solutions to the wave equation previously discussed,


i.e.    &lt;math&gt;y(x,t)= f(\xi)+g(\eta)\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\xi=ct-x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta=ct+x\,&lt;/math&gt; 


are dependent upon the boundary and initial conditions.  If it is assumed that the wave is propagating through a string, the initial conditions are related to the specific disturbance in the string at t=0.  These specific disturbances are determined by location and type of contact and can be anything from simple oscillations to violent impulses.  The effects of boundary conditions are less subtle.


The most simple boundary conditions are the Fixed Support and Free End.  In practice, the Free End boundary condition is rarely encountered since it is assumed there are no transverse forces holding the string (e.g. the string is simply floating).

 - For a Fixed Support:

The overall displacement of the waves travelling in the string, at the support, must be zero.  Denoting x=0 at the support, This requires:


&lt;math&gt;y(0,t)= f(ct-0)+g(ct+0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore, the total transverse displacement at x=0 is zero.

 - For a Free Support:

Unlike the Fixed Support boundary condition, the transverse displacement at the support does not need to be zero, but must require the sum of transverse forces to cancel.  If it is assumed that the angle of displacement is small, 

&lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)\approx\theta=\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and so,

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_{y} = T\sin(\theta)\approx T\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

But of course, the tension in the string, or T, will not be zero and this requires the slope at x=0 to be zero:

i.e. &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Vocabulary / ''Vocabolario'' ==
* [[wikt:en:ciao#Italian|ciao]] (informal), [[wikt:en:buon giorno#Italian|buon giorno]], [[wikt:en:salve#Italian|salve]] (formal) —  hello, good day
* [[wikt:en:come stai#Italian|come stai]] (tu)*? — how are you? (informal)
* [[wikt:en:come sta#Italian|come sta]] (Lei)*? — how are you? (formal)
* ti presento... — I introduce to you / This is... (e.g. ti presento Bianca - This is Bianca)
* sto bene — I'm fine
* grazie mille — many thanks
* e Lei? (''formal'')? (''informal'') — and you?
* [[wikt:en:arrivederci#Italian|arrivederla]] (formal), arrivederci, ci vediamo, ciao (informal) — goodbye, see you later

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;In Italian, you rarely express the subject pronoun unless you either want to stress the importance of the subject or you want to eliminate an ambiguity regarding the subject.

==Grammar / ''Grammatica''==
===Formal vs. Informal / ''Formale vs. informale'' ===
In Italian, there are two pronouns that mean ''you'' in the singular.  One is informal, to be used with a person with whom you are familiar, and the other is formal, which is to be used with a person of a status superior to yours or with a person you have just met.  The informal form is ''tu'' and the formal form is ''Lei'' (note that it is only capitalized here to distinguish between the word for 'she').  The plural of ''tu'' is 'voi', and the plural of ''Lei'' is ''Loro''.  Knowledge of the difference between these the formal and informal forms is important because they take different verb forms.  

In addition, especially in the south of Italy, you can also use the second person plural ('voi') when addressing an older person to whom you wish to show respect.

=====Exercise One / ''Esercizio uno''=====
# Signor Berti has just walked in.  He says ''buon giorno'' to you.  How do you ask him how he is?
# Your friend has gotten a new haircut.  When telling them how much you like it, will you use the tu form or the Lei form?
# It is your first day of school and your teacher asks how you are.  After responding, you wish to say 'and you?'.  Which pronoun do you use?

===Subject Pronouns and ''Essere'' / ''Pronomi personali soggetto e ''essere'' ===
Subject pronouns are used to show the subject of a sentence. In English subject pronouns are: I, you, he, she, it, we and they. Take a look at the following table which contains the corresponding pronouns in Italian.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Subject pronouns
|- 
| [[wikt:en:io#Italian|io]] || I 
|- 
| [[wikt:en:tu#Italian|tu]] || you 
|-
| [[wikt:en:lui#Italian|lui]]/[[wikt:en:lei#Italian|lei]] || he/she 
|-
| [[wikt:en:noi#Italian|noi]] || we 
|-
| [[wikt:en:voi#Italian|voi]] || you 
|-
| [[wikt:en:loro#Italian|loro]] || they 
|-
|}

Note that ''lei'' can mean either ''she'' or the formal, singular ''you'', which is used both for masculine and feminine subjects. In written Italian ''Lei'', written with a capital ''L'', is used to represent a formal ''you''.  Note also that, unlike in English, ''io'' used for the first person in singular is not capitalized. Subject pronouns (''io'', ''tu'' etc.) are not always used in Italian because, unlike English, the grammatical person is indicated by the declension. Thus, while in English we would say ''I sing'', in Italian we would normally use ''canto'' rather than ''io canto''.

''Essere'' (and also ''stare'') is an equivalent of the verb ''to be'' in English. It is very irregular; the conjugation for the present indicative tense follows:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Essere (to be)
|- 
| io sono {{Listen|filename=io sono.ogg|title=io sono.ogg|description=audio name|format=[[Ogg]]}} || I am
|- 
| tu sei {{Listen|filename=tu sei.ogg|title=tu sei.ogg|description=audio name|format=[[Ogg]]}}|| you are
|-
| egli/ella è {{Listen|filename=egli ella è.ogg|title=egli ella è.ogg|description=audio name|format=[[Ogg]]}}|| he/she is
|-
| noi siamo {{Listen|filename=noi siamo.ogg|title=noi siamo.ogg|description=audio name|format=[[Ogg]]}}|| we are
|-
| voi siete {{Listen|filename=voi siete.ogg|title=voi siete.ogg|description=audio name|format=[[Ogg]]}}|| you are
|-
| essi sono {{Listen|filename=essi sono.ogg|title=essi sono.ogg|description=audio name|format=[[Ogg]]}}|| they are
|-
|}

The pronouns ''Lei'' and ''Loro'' take the same verb form as ''egli/ella'' and ''essi''.

====Exercise Two / ''Esercizio due''====
# How do you say ''you are'' (informal singular)?
# ''Come stai tu?'' - Is the pronoun formal or informal in this question?
# When I say ''Lei è'', am I talking about you (my close friend) or my teacher?
# If you want to say ''Bob and I are'', which verb form do you use?
# Joan and Kim are good friends. Would they use ''tu'' or ''Lei'' when talking to each other?

This section focuses on blended learning in the classroom with the use of multimedia and internet resources. This includes the use of videos, virtual field trips, interactive websites, software packages, and broadcasting.

Blended learning often requires a reliance on technology use in the classroom.  Because there is often a lack of access to technology outside of school, blending learning for many students, must occur in the classroom.  The use of the internet for blending learning is wonderful.  However, if students do not have access outside of the school day, the blended learning must occur in the classroom.  The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) compiled information from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, October 2003.  The NCES put together the results in “Trends in the Well-Being of American Youth.&quot; These results provided the following information concerning computer usage; 62.6% of people ages 3-14 have home access, 72.2% of people ages 15-19 have home access, and 59.6% of people ages 20-24 have home access.  Because access in no age group is 100%, teachers can not reasonably expect students to access required work outside the class period without arrangements being made in advance for access.  Because of this possible lack of access for students it is very important to accomplish blended learning in the class period by using videos or DVD's, virtual field trips, interactive websites, and broadcasting.

==Video/DVD==
Blended learning can include technology as common place today as using a video/DVD clip, segment, or movie.  What is a video?  According to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (2002) the characteristics of video media are as follows
*Video is the medium that you…are most familiar with.
*Video can be distributed as “hard copy” on videocassette or DVD, digitized and delivered on the Web or CD, or distributed through specialized educational channels.
*Video is especially good at telling a story or showing things that require narrative structure or moving images.
*Video often has an emotional impact.  It’s great at “taking you there and making you care.”
*Today, VCRs (or DVD players) are widely accessible in classrooms and informal educational settings.

Most commonly, teachers think of buying videos to aid in enhancing the knowledge of the students for a particular topic.  What many do not consider is that videos can be created by presenters, administrators, teachers, or classes and can serve many other purposes.  

“Video can breathe meaning and life into nearly any lesson” (KQED 2005).  According to a site by KQED public broadcasting, videos:
*Provide a common experience for all students.
*Generate Interest and stimulate imagination.
*Offer a different perspective on or another approach to a topic.
*Connect students with faraway places.
*Demonstrate abstract ideas.
*Stimulate the development of critical thinking skills.
*Equalize educational opportunities.
*Enhance self-respect and break down social stereotypes.
*Promote critical viewing skills and media awareness.

Videos used in classroom settings, regardless who produced them, can be educational, promotional, training, event, and evaluative.

“Educational video is any video programming that contributes to the teaching/learning environment” (Lamb, Johnson 2002).  The videos that are used to contribute to the classroom environment can cover any subject matter ranging from science to religion to business.  These videos traditionally are the most common and they serve to introduce new topics or to reinforce previously learned topics.

Promotional videos are often used for companies trying to explain themselves or their products (Hotwire Media n.d.).  These types of videos are not limited to the corporate world; they can have classroom uses as well.  Teachers often are promoters of their product be it subject matter or classroom management.  Using a self made or purchased promotional video can help explain teachers, the classroom, and the subject matter to the consumers of the products.  Students.

Training videos are “Often targeted at a more specific audience than an educational film, and for use within a particular environment, video based training can add interest to any topic or process…” (Hotwire Media n.d.).  Again, this type of video may be used more often in the corporate world, but they also can serve a purpose in a classroom.  There are many processes that are taught and interest could be gained with a training video.  The process of check writing is complicated for some, see the process unfold in a video could increase the knowledge and interest of the process.  This would save instructional time and provide more time for the teacher to work one-on-one with students needing further instruction.  

Events videos allow for a …”permanent audio-visual record of the event… (and allows teachers to) present the event to those not in attendance, or be used as a basis for discussion and evaluation” (Hotwire Media n.d.).  Students giving presentations in class, or a guest speaker, would be examples of events in the classroom.  This type of video would be student or teacher created.  Absent students could view the events and not have lost any information from the day.

Evaluation videos and events videos can go hand in hand.  Once the event video has been made of the class presentations, students and the teacher can refer back to the event video to evaluate the presentations.  This can be a wonderful tool for teachers, allowing them to focus and really pay attention to the presenters, not grading the presentation as it goes.  It can also be a wonderful for students, allowing them to look back at the event video and evaluate their own presentations.

==Virtual Field Trips==
Blended learning &quot;Virtual Field Trips can be used in any number of ways to serve a variety of educational goals&quot; (Tramline 2003).  Fieldtrips have been a method of blending the learning and teaching methods of a class for a many years.  The reality of funding shortages force schools to remain on campus.  Using blended learning through the virtual fieldtrip is a wonderful opportunity.  The virtual fieldtrip experience is an excellent model of a teaching strategy that was not possible before the advent of computers in the (school) classroom (Beal &amp; Mason 1999).  Going on a field trip has usually meant taking students out of the school building for some purpose.  Today, due to budget restraints and other issues, it is becoming more and more difficult to take students out of the classroom to see things first hand.  Schools with computer and internet access have the opportunity to go on fieldtrips with out spending any additional money or ever leaving the school building.  “Virtual fieldtrips benefit students, families, schools, teachers, and communities” (Beal &amp; Mason 1999).  Virtual fieldtrips can take students to places they have personally visited, will be personally visiting. Once the virtual fieldtrip has been posted to the web, it is available to all people, any time, day or night (Tramline 2003).   Virtual fieldtrips of all kinds are available, post-fieldtrip activity, pre-fieldtrip activity, fieldtrips made by others (not the teacher), and fieldtrips created by the teacher (Beal &amp; Mason 1999).

The post-fieldtrip activity, as discussed by Beal and Mason (1999), blends student work, technologies, and locations involving student activities before, during, and after the fieldtrip.  Before leaving for the “in person” field trip, assign each student or group with a particular task or subject matter area.  Before and or during the trip, each person is responsible for gathering information of their assigned area.  While on the fieldtrip, they are to gather information as well as pictures.  Upon returning to the classroom, students are to compile their information and pictures into a presentation multimedia, which one depends on what is available to the students.  Once each student or group has created their portion of the fieldtrip, the parts should be combined so that all students can view the virtual field trip and gain the same information.  This field trip could then be used by other virtual visitors in the future if it is posted on the web.

Second is the fieldtrip category that addresses the blended learning virtual aspect (Beal &amp; Mason 1999).  With this pre-fieldtrip activity, the students go on a virtual fieldtrip created by someone else (partially the third category) before they leave their school building.  Seeing the sites prior to their own arrival will give students insight and knowledge that might be missed during their visit.  A pre-fieldtrip virtual fieldtrip can also give students a greater appreciation for what they will be seeing upon their arrival.  

The third blended learning virtual fieldtrip requires the students to never leave the building and to use the computer and internet.  The students &quot;go&quot; on the fieldtrip made by others and are able to gather information from places they can not visit in person as a class (Beal &amp; Mason 1999).  With the ability to go on a virtual fieldtrip, the places students can go are nearly endless.  There are free virtual fieldtrips that can take students to every continent on earth.  The locations range from a trip to a zoo, government agency, foreign museums, and national monuments and parks, just to name a few.  The preparation on the teachers part is much less cumbersome than the preparation necessary to take students out of the school building and often the students learn just as much if not more in the computer lab.

Fourth, is the virtual fieldtrip with the blended learning created by the classroom teacher (Beal &amp; Mason 1999).  Teachers often take advantage of opportunities in the summer to go to conferences or seminars where trips are included or just parts of their own vacations.  Teachers can put together the newly acquired information with pictures and create a virtual fieldtrip for their students for a much easier process and lesser cost than taking all the students out of the school building.

==Interactive Websites==
Blended learning oftentimes includes the use of interactive websites.  The use of interactive web sites requires computer and internet access in the school.  These sites provide another opportunity for teachers to use technology in their classroom, thus promoting blended learning. Interactive websites can be utilized within the class for those students who do not have internet access and can give other students the opportunity to expand knowledge if access is available privately. For these purposes, when we use the web, we are referring to the Internet.  According to Dictionary.com WordNet 2.0 fro Princeton University, interactive is defined as “capable of acting on or influencing each other” (20032).  When we put these two descriptions together we come to the conclusion that web/interactive is when people are capable of acting on or influencing the web.  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting Web/Interactive (2002) provides three characteristics of web/interactive media.
*They are not time-restricted and are not subject to a broadcast schedule.
*They are visual, textual, and interactive.
*They are nonlinear.

Blended learning web/interactive sites have elements within in them that allow people to act on or influence particular items on a particular page.  The different elements allow influencing in different ways.  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting Web/Interactive Media Elements (2002) addresses ten different web/interactive media elements.  These ten elements are 
*Animated Narratives-reveal information progressively or along a user-determined path.
*Audio and Video-voice and pictures (still or moving)
*Discussion Environments-being able to share submissions with the larger audience.
*Games-fun, and there may be a way to “win,” even though an educational agenda may be lurking within.
*Illustrated Essays-“standard” Web pages of HTML text and graphics, least expensive type of Web page to produce.
*Interactive Images-graphic features let users roll their cursor over or click on an image to provide greater text or graphic detail.
*Interactive Simulations-computer-assisted explorations allow users to simulate real-world situations.
*Interactive Timelines-present historical information in the context of other events of the period, organize events thematically, and allow users to read synopses and view images of people or artifacts.
*Polls and Provocations-engage users in a controversy, requiring them to consider both sides of arguments before registering their opinion.
*Resource Banks-annotated collections let users browse or search through carefully selected topical resources.

==Software Packages==

Blended learning with multimedia enhances both the teaching and learning processes.  Blended learning with multimedia can take the shape of software available at school.  Thousands of educational software packages exist on the market ranging from early reading and math skills to specific high school textbook supplements.  The following is a continually growing list and brief overview of various educational software packages available for general reference and use, as well as specifically for Elementary, Middle School, and High School age groups.


*[http://www.renlearn.com/am/default.htm Accelerated Math] is a self-paced math learning program that helps students practice and master math skills.  Teachers can tailor Accelerated Math to each student’s individual ability.  Accelerated Math automatically scores all assignments and tests and give both students and teacher immediate feedback.

*[http://www.calvertnet.k12.md.us/schools/bes/BESLibWeb/AR.htm Accelerated Reader Program] motivates students to read by tracking progress with book quizzes.  Students improve their reading skills as they progress throughout the Accelerated Reader book lists.  Teachers can utilize the book assessments and progress reporting generated by Accelerated Reader to track student progress and make book recommendations.

*[http://store.britannica.com/jump.jsp?itemID=665&amp;itemType=PRODUCT Encyclopedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite] provides research level knowledge source. New features include Daily Content which serves up fascinating historical snapshots for the knowledge junkie and Homework Helpdesk: powerful tools for students.

*[http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/default.mspx Microsoft Encarta] provides an encyclopedia, dictionary, atlas, and other educational reference materials.  Encarta tools for students bring the world into the classroom with engaging and reliable content. 

*[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857971033.aspx Microsoft PowerPoint] is used to create projects and presentations from elementary age levels through high school and beyond.  Students quickly learn the unique aspects of PowerPoint and enjoy learning technology while creating a presentation project.

==Broadcasting==

What is Broadcasting?  According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, the definition of broadcasting is to transmit or make public by means of radio or television; to make widely known; to scatter seed (Webster, 2005).  For purposes of Blended Learning, we will expand the definition to include web transmissions as well as radio and television transmissions.  Broadcasting as blended learning incorporates student run radio, television, and websites in an educational setting.

Student led broadcasts of school related information has become increasingly popular in many schools and districts.  Student broadcasts create a student-centered school environment among all students while fostering student leadership, developing technical skills, and building self-confidence and self-concept in participating students.  Student broadcasting productions is defined as a type of blended learning by actively engaging students in the broadcasting, scripting, production processes, and technical direction of the program.  Students from elementary grades through high school journalism classes utilize video, audio, and/or text and learn writing, editing, and publishing techniques through the production of online stories and links to student related interests.

How does broadcasting fit into blended learning?
In general...
*K-12 students learn through active participation in broadcasting production, scripting, performance, and technical directing.
*The general student body becomes engaged in student run activities.
*Classroom students take pride in their work highlighted on classroom websites.
Specifically...
*Media and Communications students learn practical applications of technical and communication skills through the active production of broadcasts.
*Journalism students learn to create, edit, and produce news stories.
*Video Production students learn the technical direction necessary behind the scenes in student broadcasts.

Examples of Student Broadcasting in the K-12 setting:

*Oak Park Elementary Student Council sponsors a student led closed circuit television broadcasting program called “Good Morning Oak Park”.  Oak Park fourth graders broadcast mini news, morning announcements, and lead the Pledge of Allegiance to the school every morning.  &quot;Good Morning Oak Park&quot; originated in the spring of 2003 on [http://www2.mde.k12.ms.us/ossd/OakPark/woak.html W.O.A.K.,] a school radio station.  W.O.A.K. quickly caught on in popularity and became a closed circuit television station during the fall of 2003. 

*Video Productions vocational students and Broadcast Journalism students of Hoover High School in North Canton, Ohio produce programs for both cable television and the school web site.  Television broadcasts are through the North Canton City Schools [http://www.northcanton.sparcc.org/~tv11/index.htm Channel 11,] an educational cable television station established for student use and production.  Students work collaboratively to produce both sites.  Journalism students create the feature stories and Video Production students run the technical aspects of the program.  

*Media and communications students from Carmel High School in Carmel, Indiana broadcast a student run radio station called [http://carmelhighschool.net/links/whje/index.php WHJE.]  WHJE began in 1963 with one to two hour broadcasts each day and is now broadcasting on the air and through the web twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  The station develops and fosters student growth through broadcasting experience, production managers, engineers, and technical support.  

*Carmel High School also creates a bi-weekly [http://www.hilite.org/ online newspaper] featuring student activities, school events, and announcements.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The use of classroom websites and Course Management Systems (CMS) aid in the process of creating a blended learning environment.  An article written by Klaus Schmidt, ''The Web-Enhanced Classroom'', discusses four components necessary for successfully enhancing a course via the internet.  The four components include: Administration, Assessment, Content and Community (Schmidt, 2002).  One way to implement these components into a web-enhanced course is to use a Course Management System (CMS).  A CMS allows for the administration of a web-enhanced course through the various tools included with the software.  For example, a teacher is able to distribute handouts, set assignment deadlines, collect assignments and give quizzes from one location.  This frees up time for the teacher, as stated by Schmidt, “A well-developed administrative component allows a teacher to spend more time interacting creatively with students and addressing higher level thinking skills rather than on mundane activities.”   Enhanced communication between the teacher and students is another administrative benefit gained from using a CMS.  A teacher is able to post announcements to the entire class or send an individual email.  Instant feedback on assignments can be sent and grades can be accessed by the student at any hour of the day.  In addition, grading policies and deadlines can be clearly communicated in a CMS. Communicating between teacher, student, and even parent, can also occur more frequently with the use of a CMS.  A teacher can distribute material to the class ahead of time; uing a CMS means that “assignments and lecture notes can be posted in advance, and students can have continual access to them” (Zirke, 2003).

Although a variety of CMS exist, this section focuses on three CMS examples (Moodle, WebCT, Blackboard).

 
==Free Websites for Teachers==
==Moodle==
According to the [http://moodle.org/ moodle Website], &quot;Moodle is a course management system (CMS) - a free, Open Source software package designed using sound pedagogical principles, to help educators create effective online learning communities&quot; (2005).

==WebCT==

==Blackboard==
Teacher Vivian Evans, gives a personal account of Blackboard, stating that &quot;Blackboard has got some good features...It supports synchronous chat and discussion threads in a way that is very clear.  Site administration is another strength.  You can control who has access to your site.  You can also look back at what happened previously by clicking on a past date to see what was discussed&quot; (Evans, 2005).

|previous=Types of Blended Learning/Course Management Systems
|next=Characteristics of Blended Learning}}

As indicated in Chapter 1, Blended learning combines technology with face to face instruction. Synchronous and asynchronous discussions are both types of internet communication that can be utilized in blended learning to fulfill the technology requirement. Both synchronous and asynchronous discussions utilize the internet to provide forums for use by the classroom teacher to either give instructions, facilitate office hours  or conversation among students that would normally take place in a classroom setting. Asynchronous and synchronous discussions can be teacher or student led and can be guided by a pre-set format or take place in a more open setting, just like a classroom discussion. Both synchronous and asynchronous discussions have advantages and disadvantages. Asynchronous discussions allow time for reflection by the learner. In addition the asynchronous format allows for the diversity of the learner. It provides some flexibility for the learner to respond at his individual 'peak time', when he/she is at his best. The asynchronous model also enables each learner time to adequately respond. There is no need to 'grab the mic.' Each student is provided the opportunity to reflect and post a reply as deemed appropriate. The opportunity for reflection before response and flexibility of communication can produce greater depth of learning than the synchronous environment alone.(Donaldson &amp; Conrad,2002)
Certain situations best lend themselves to synchronous communications.Such activities include group meetings or activities requiring group consensus or simultaneous response.  Synchronous discussions are especially useful for brainstorming or replicating the face to face situation. Synchronous discussions tend to be more successful when utilized by small groups.
While both synchronous and asynchronous discussions have advantages and disadvantages, their use together in a blended learning situation is critical to the development of the online learning community.The types of asynchronous and synchronous discussions evaluated in this section include the use of Yahoo Groups, TappedIn, Blogs, and Elluminate.
==Yahoo Groups==
The Yahoo website provides free access to [http://groups.yahoo.com/] Yahoo Groups. In Yahoo Groups, anyone can originate a group of friends, family or others with similar interests. In a blended learning situation, the teacher can create a group or assign groups within the class to utilize Yahoo as their 'meeting place'. Within the group, there are options for message posting, synchronous chats, links to other sites as well as a place to post photos, make a calendar and poll the group members. As a group, Yahoo provides great flexibility for sharing opinions and discussion both asynchronously and synchronously. 
The asynchronous format functions much like a message board with members of the group posting and responding to other posts. Messages are listed chronologically and easy to follow. Only members of the group are allowed to post and members are identified by their sign in name. The originator of the group becomes the moderator and as such can use different options to insure the continuity of messages and the appearance of the asynchronous site. Messages posted on the site can also be emailed to members of the group. 
The Yahoo site makes it easy to communicate with members of a specific group. It is basically like using email. You simply click on post and type your message. It appears on the message site for members of the group to see.The subject of the message appears at the top of the message in a larger font and different color. The sender's name and other information appears to the right of the message body. It is a very easy format to follow for asynchronous discussions.
The synchronous function of Yahoo Groups is found in the Chat section. It is similarly easy to access by clicking on Chat in the menu after signing in to your group. Once at the chat site, you can type your message into the dialogue box, hit send and it is immediately posted. Others can then respond to the dialogue. This format is a more expedient way to carry on a discussion although it can seem disjointed and does not always flow smoothly. One needs to establish a topic and some ground rules so everyone is not talking at once. It works very much like instant messaging except everyone is messaging simultaneously.There are a few options for the participants to choose if they are away from the computer.

==TappedIn==
[http://tappedin.org TappedIn] is a web-based learning environment created by [http://www.sri.com/ SRI International] to transform teacher professional development.  Tapped In enables teachers to implement effective, classroom centered learning activities through the use of online tools, resources, member colleagues, scheduled class events, and technical support.  Tapped In provides teachers with online learning strategies, collaborative member support, and online continued professional development courses.

Tapped In went online in 1997 and has continued to grow and expand it's teacher network.  Tapped In currently has ongoing funding from the [http://www.nsf.gov/ National Science Foundation] and from [http://www.sun.com/ Sun Microsystems.]  Tapped In is currently a free service to teacher members.

Teachers can use Tapped In to manage online courses, create teacher chat rooms, and conduct office hours.  Organizations registered with Tapped In receives a Tapped In virtual building with three floors.  The ground floor contains member logins, help desk, and public rooms.  The second floor contains group rooms deemed as public, moderated, or private.  The third floor is reserved for personal member offices.

Tapped In offers after school teacher collaboration sessions called the After School Online (ASO) in various subject matters.  A monthly schedule of ASO topics is contained on Tapped In's homepage and is emailed to every Tapped In member.  A sample of monthly activities and discussions can be viewed on this monthly [http://tappedin.org/tappedin/do/CalendarAction calendar.]

Tapped In can be used both synchronously and asynchronously.  Teachers can create and manage class groups with student accounts, set up course calendars, allow guest logons, send mailings, conduct online chats and private messaging, create discussion boards, and store files and URLs.  Courses can utilize synchronous chats through office hours and class chat sessions; and asynchronous discussions through message boards.  Tapped In automatically logs discussion transcripts and emails the transcript to group participants.  Students who are not present for a chat can later view the discussion text through Tapped In.

==Blogs==
Blog is a term coined for the combination of two words, web and log. As part of a blended learning project,it is an asynchronous form of online discussion. A blog is a publicly accessible website which contains a journal or diary of sorts. Anyone can initiate a blog either as a part of another website or personal web page or a blog can stand alone. The author of the blog can choose to write in this journal as she pleases with no filters or censorship. Blogs span a wide variety of topics. Some blogs are followed by a huge readership where others may suffice only for a family or small close knit group. According to Michael Berkman in his Blog Guide Book (Sept.2005)there are reportedly over 11 million blogs on the web. Blogs offer a forum for many people to state their opinions or comment on other's opinions. Blogs seem to offer a more fluid discussion than other group chats or asynchronous types of forums. Because blogs are in the public domain, a topic of intense interest or current event may be accessed continually with one or more threads flowing throughout the blog. This is different than an asynchronous discussion in which the reader is directed to comment on a specific topic or question. It is similar to a face to face discussion in the rapidity in which responses can appear and the opinionated nature of the comments and responses.
In a blended learning situation, blogs can be used as a discussion forum for students or as a reference source for parents. Blogs can also be used as a publishing site for student work, with appropriate security and permission issues addressed, of course. Teachers need to proceed with caution when using blogs as students may tend to read blogs as resource sites and not properly evaluate the information gained from the blog sites. Blogs could provide a great medium to enhance student writing through the use of technology. Elementary grade students are frequently encouraged to use journal writing as story starters so it would be a logical jump to move that journal writing to a blog site. Additionally blogs could be used toward improving literacy skills as students read and peer edit other student's blogs. The Daily Oral Language activity is another possible blog use. Blogs offer the most flexibility for use as an asynchronous forum. There are numerous free guides and sites to set up blogs.

==Eluminate==
Eluminate is a synchronous forum used for online discussions. It is widely used in both the academic arena as well as the corporate world. As a teaching tool, it provides an online source similar to a chat room for invited guests to meet and replicate a face to face classroom situation.At the Eluminate site, a moderator can conduct the discussions by stating a specific topic or listing it on the accompanying whiteboard. The moderator has several options to allow varying degrees of participation by the students. Eluminate provides moderators with the ability to use online quizzes and polls.  A whiteboard is also  available to repeat or illustrate with text or graphics. Whiteboard access for students is controlled by the moderator. In addition the moderator can present websites or related information on the whiteboard. The whiteboard can also serve to demonstrate power point presentations.         
Participants may discuss either by using a microphone for live voice or typing responses in the text box. Eluminate provides options for participants to raise their hand before speaking, to applaud and includes a system of tallies for polling. Although conversations seem to flow rapidly in the text box, there is often incontinuity as participants post comments frequently changing the subject. It can also be distracting as the text conversation continues while someone is talking. This actually seems to be somewhat rude.
One of the advantages of using Eluminate is the fact that it is extremely user friendly. It is relatively simple to acknowledge the invitation, access the site and join the discussion. Although a tutorial is available students can learn to navigate the site quite easily as a part of the first lesson. Sound quality is quite good and accessing the audio component is not difficult.
One of the disadvantages of the Eluminate program is the cost factor. The academic version of Eluminate ranges in price from $2400 for a one year three seat team edition to $7000. for a 10 seat team edition. This cost is no doubt prohibitive for some schools especially elementary districts. Currently Eluminate is used most often by higher education institutions. Although it has some valid use for elementary level districts, the cost is no doubt prohibitive.
As a teaching tool, Eluminate serves to replicate the face to face discussion one might have in a classroom. It lends itself most easily to the higher grade levels for a few reasons. Although Eluminate is easy to use, it requires higher level typing skills to keep up with the conversation. It is also necessary to access the talk button to use the audio portion of the forum and to adjust the volume of speaker and mic as necessary. This would be a difficult skill for an elementary aged student although I think it would be possible to involve junior high aged students. Eluminate could certainly be a resource for secondary schools and something students would enjoy using. Utilizing the synchronous discussion strictly for lecturing becomes stale. To fully realize the potential, the instructor should access the whiteboard either for illustrations or for a power point presentation. Eluminate offers many options for the instructor to integrate technology into the classroom in a meaningful way.

After using Tapped In, Blogs, and Elluminate I would have to say that Elluminate is by far the best product.  I love the aspect you can present PowerPoint’s, chat by typing, watch streaming videos and communicate to others in the class.  Before reading this article, I was wondering why Elluminate was not used more.  I did not realize the cost was so high!  I can’t help but wonder if the price came down if more people would use this product.  - Dale Donner</text>

By now you're probably familiar with the Bohr model of the atom, which was a great help in classifying the position of fundamental atomic specta lines.  However, Bohr lucked out in more ways than one.  The hydrogen atom turns out to be one of the few systems in Quantum Mechanics that we are able to solve almost precisely.  This has made it tremendously useful as a model for other Quantum Mechanical systems, and as a model for the behavior of atoms themselves.

=== Fundamentals ===

We can assume that the hydrogen atom is governed by the Coulomb potential, namely:

&lt;math&gt;
V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon _0} \frac{1}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

such that,
&lt;math&gt;
H\Psi = -\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\Psi}{dx^2} - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon _0} \frac{1}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, simply by inspection, we can see that the Hydrogen Atom is a spherical system.  Hence it makes more sense to deal with the Hydrogen atom in spherical coordinates.  One should remember at this point that, via [[w:Separation of variables|Separation of variables]], you can obtain the solution to the spherical Laplacian in three-dimensional space:

&lt;math&gt;
\nabla ^2f = {1 \over r^2} {\partial \over \partial r}
  \left( r^2 {\partial f \over \partial r} \right) 
+ {1 \over r^2 \sin \theta} {\partial \over \partial \theta}
  \left( \sin \theta {\partial f \over \partial \theta} \right) 
+ {1 \over r^2 \sin^2 \theta} {\partial^2 f \over \partial \phi^2}
&lt;/math&gt;


the solutions to this function when we use separation of variables inside a Hamiltonian gives us two different functions, the Radial Wave functions (not useful now, but good to know):

&lt;math&gt;
A \cdot J_l \left(Z_{nl}\frac{r}{a} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_l&lt;/math&gt; are the spherical [[w:Bessel functions|Bessel functions]] of type l, and &lt;math&gt;Z_{nl}&lt;/math&gt; are the zeroes of said Bessel functions.

The other component, the angular component are the [[w:Spherical harmonics|Spherical harmonics]] which are explored in detail on Wikipedia.

===Calculations===

Essentially, we're ahead of the game at this point.  We already know the answers.  The hydrogen wave function will have to involve the spherical solutions to the Laplacian and will be related to both the angular and radial components.  This is most fortunate; for us to attempt to solve the Laplacian while doing the hydrogen atom would be difficult.  However, we have some tasks left.  The situation must be normalized, and we must deal with the fact that our potential has a pesky r dependence.




=== Results ===

We end up with the results that you knew we were going to.  We can write down the hydrogen wave equation as:

&lt;math&gt;
\Psi _{nlm}(r, \phi, \theta) = R_{nl}(r)Y^l_m(\theta, \phi)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y^l_m(\theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are the spherical harmonics.</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Parameter Stack

A data structure common to many languages is the stack. A LIFO (last-in first-out) type of stack called the parameter stack (to distinguish it from the return stack) is frequently the implied source and destination for many of the data and arithmetic operations performed in FORTH.

Typical operations will find their input parameters on the stack, usually remove (pop) these inputs, and then place the new results back onto the stack (push).  

While FORTH has variables, arrays, strings, and other data structures, the use of the stack is combined with the philosophy of the language to achieve a variety of advantages.

* If a piece of code only uses the stack for its inputs, outputs, and intermediate values, it is inherently re-entrant in almost every case.
* If a piece of code maintains stack parity, that is, neither removes or abandons values on the stack between its beginning and end, then a call to it can be inserted anywhere in a body of code.
* The stack is like a switchyard that can get data to and from anywhere. Data can be switched between all parts of the system by reading it or writing it to the top element of the stack.
* Op codes do not need to use bits to specify register values, instead, two RISC machine style instructions are used in sequence, analagous to LOAD then ADD. These simpler instructions allow efficient implementation.

When you type a number, it goes on the stack. When you type several numbers, they all go on the stack, with the most-recent number on the top of the stack. For example, immediately after typing 7 22 -8 14 9 and hitting ENTER, the stack appears like this:

             cell #   contents
               0         9        (TOS) 
               1        14        (NOS) 
               2        -8 
               3        22
               4         7 

Many programmers document a word using a stack diagram, with two &quot;pictures&quot; of the stack (with the TOS furthest to the right), before and after the word executes.

SWAP ( ... a b -- ... b a )

DROP ( ... x y z -- ... x y )

DUP ( ... x y z -- ... x y z z )

ROT ( ... a b c d -- ... a c d b )

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Crystal Matrix. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Crystal Matrix~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

'''Social psychology''' is the scientific study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another. 

==Module 5: The Power of Positive Thinking==
===Locus of Control===
Locus of control is “the extent to which people perceive outcomes as internally controllable by their own efforts and actions or as externally controlled by chance or outside forces” (Myers, 56).  Some people “feel that what happens to them is governed by external forces of one kind or another, while others feel that what happens to them is governed largely by their own efforts and skills” (quoted by Hunt, 1993, p.334).  There are two types of locus’ of control, internal and external.  Internal is when one believes they control their own destiny, while external locus of control one believes some outside force determines their destiny.  

===Learned Helplessness Versus Self-Determination===
Individuals who feel that they are in control benefit greatly in life. “studies confirm that systems of governing or managing people that promote personal control will indeed promote health and happiness ( Deci &amp; Ryan, 1987).   Contrary, people who don’t feel they are in control, which are usually depressed, become quite unreceptive because they feel their work is useless.  This is usually refereed to as learned helplessness which is “the hopelessness and resignation learned when a human or animal perceives no control over repeated bad events” (Myers, 56).  
 
===Reflections on Self-Efficacy===
The Power of Positive Thinking

“If you think in positive terms you will get positive results” ( Myers, 53).  It does not occur just by self-persuasion, or by giving complements to individuals, rather it usually occurs after the achievement of success.  Thinking positively can help people achieve a plethora of things, so after realizing this, some situations can be avoided by positive thinking which will illuminate many problems.

The Dark Side of Self-Esteem

Personal problems such as depression and drug abuse is a result of low self-esteem.  Violence and degrading others usually occurs when an individual feels that their self-esteem is endangered.  After studying many bullies and gang leaders, who many people perceive as having low self-esteem, instead have rather high self-esteem.  There are many benefits to having a high self-esteem which is reflected in these individuals’ grades, appearance, and social status.  In contrast, individuals with low self-esteem live a more stressful life with stress, depression, ect.

==Module 8:Reason for Unreason==
===Our Preconceptions Control Our Interpretations===
Our preconception guides how our mind perceives and interprets information. People fail to realize how great the effect of preconception. Other studies support these ideas by showing students supporting evidence on their beliefs as well as disconfirming evidence that supported their point of view,but were critical of the disconfirming evidence.
Preconception can also be manipulated and in an experiment at the University of Oregon, students were asked to assess the facial expressions of a man. The students who judged his expressions as cruel were first told he was responsible for cruel acts performed at concentration camps of WWII. Others who assessed the man as warm and kind were previosly told he was an anti-nazi who saved numerous jewish lives. The experiment above strongly demonstrates that our preconceptions do control the way we view issues and people but beyond preconception is the ability to manipulate and consrue the way we see things.(Ross and Lepper).This seems to hold true in everyday life from assuming that someone is shy to wondering if someone feels the same way that you do. If you constue an idea and continue to perceive certain ideas then there will be little room for change or consideration.

===We Are More Swayed By Memorable Events Than By Facts===
Because people assume that something is commonplace simply because it is easily available in memory, people are often more compelled with powerful anecdote than statistics(Allison&amp;others,1992). This is known as the availability heuristic and is often why people overestimate the reality of situations. For example, the 9/11 attacks are often a visual and readily available in memory, many people thus believe they are more at risk for similar situations during commecial travel than they actually are.
Psychologist Daniel Kahneman supports this belief and conducts studies based on probability of an event based on the way our mind imagines and retrieves information. When we view an unlikely event the picture in our mind allows us to over estimate the likeliness that this would happen (kahneman).
[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/volvofal.html]

===We MisPerceive Correlation And Control===
Our search for order in random events influences our everyday thinking and can lead us down all sorts of wrong paths.
===Illusory Correlation===
When we expect to find a significant relationship we often associate random events. Experiments confirm that people often confirm their own beliefs by misperceiving random events(Crocker,1981). If we believe that there is a correlation between events or that a premonition relates to an event we tend to find ways they relate to later occurring events but neglect to realize all the episodes that occur and do not coincide. As the mind creates an illusion perception and correlation it also gives us the idea that chance events are subject to our influence also known as illusion of control. An experiment done by Ellen Langer in 1977 showed how illusion of control affected gamblers when people who picked their own lottery numbers demanded four times the value of their ticket simply because they chose their own numbers. Gamblers credit their wins to their skill and forsight(Gilovich&amp; Douglas,1986).
===Regression Toward The Average===
Illusion of Control contributes to another statistical phenomenon known as Regression toward the average.Tversky and Kahneman noted that students' exams scores fluctuate partly by chance and that tutors are not likely to be the cause of a students improvement but that students who score high will regress or fall back towards a more average score. Those who do poorly first time around will often seek tutoring but even without the help the student will typically improve showing that we tend to regress toward an average. As with test scores sports performances are proven to regress towards the average as well. After baseball players were measured on ability in areas such as batting average and earned run averages the outstanding performances of players often exaggerated their skills but are usually followed by a regression toward the mean (Galton).

===Our Beliefs Can Generate Their Own Confimation.===
A study conducted by Robert Rosenthal found that people sometimes live up to what is expected of them. When partipants knew they were expected to give high ratings on a picture they viewed, they did so more than others who were expected to see the photos as failures. This study demonstrated self-fulfilling prophecy.
Do teachers have the same expectation? Do teachers expectations affect student performance? Teachers do hold their standards higher for some students and think highly of those who do well(Jussin&amp;Others,1996). Certainly low expectation may not always discourage an average child but a teachers high expection of one child does not guarantee their success.An article posted in the New York Times demonstrated the self-fulfilling prophecy while gathering men and women between the ages of 48 and 62 and then divided them into groups.One group was assigned to complete a memory test against another group averaging 70 or older. The second group was to complete the same test but against a group averaging 20 years of age. The third group completed the test not aware of any competition. When the results were in the group competing against younger participants retrieved 14 words on the average the results remained the same for the group who had no competition. The group that tested against the &quot;older&quot; crowd retrieved the least amount of words on average. Perhaps, the mental perception of being included with an &quot;older&quot; group brought about an unconscious thought that advancing age automatically affects memory thus the stereotype may have reflected test results(Carey). Having these standards does seem to boost condfidence. Teachers who do see high potential in a student have been reported to look,smile,nod more often to those students as well as call on and allow more time for them to answer questions(Cooper,1983). 
On the flip side, a students expectation of an instructor can affect the way a student perceives the class. For example,a student who goes into class having heard positive feedback about the instructor was more likely to find the class more interesting than a student with lower expectation(Feldman&amp;Theiss,1982).

===Do we get what we expect from others===
Many times we view others then make our minds up about a person before we even get to know them.The fact that we make snap decisions or assumptions about people tells us something about ourselves. We make an assumption,and determine  what type of person they are.We have certain expectations of people and we believe they will live up to our expectation most of the time.The type of behavior that we want from a person can happen with the way we bait that persons response to our action. If a person is kind,friendly and well adjusted  that's what you will reflect to others. The expectation is that others will give you that in return because of the way you present yourself to them. Setting an expectation for success seems to motivate people to conform to this. An employee is more likely to accomplish more when an authority figure sets expectations high. Assuming that someone is rude may affect the way we approach them and in return may change the reaction of that person to support our anticipated internal thought.

===Conclusion===
We preceive things as true according to our own beliefs and we have the power to convince others to conform to the way we think. Whether these views are right or wrong our minds are capable of being judgemental.Despite the outcome of our judgement or decision its amazing the way our minds will come to this conclusion,which often results in false assumption and harsh judgement.Persuasion can even be as easy as referencing a simple image in our mind or listening to a news briefing.

== Module 10 - Clinical Intuition ==
'''ILLUSORY CORRELATIONS, p103-104'''

Often, we find ourselves anticipating outcomes by correlating two unique and unrelated events that just happen to coincide at the most opportune or inopportune time. To understand the Illusory Correlation phenomenon I started by looking within my own surroundings. One sunny morning last week as I struggled to clearly see the road in front of me, I realized that I hadn't washed my car in quite a while. Why not pull through an express wash and treat old reliable to a bath?, I said to myself. So, I did and back down the road I went. As fate would have it, by that afternoon a cold front moved in and brought with it a torrential downpour. So much for washing my car. Why does it always rain just after I wash my car anyway? My wife who delivers babies for a living dreads pulling call when the moon is in full phase, because she believes that most women tend to go into labor during this time. This in turn leads to long hours at the hospital followed by a weekend of total sleep deprivation. If I had some way to check how many times it actually rained after I washed my car the results would show that more times than not the day was rather nice.  And my wife she does work hard, but I can recall quite a few times when she didn't even get a phone call during a full moon phase. The husband and wife research team of Loren Chapman and Jean Chapman (1969, 1971) confirmed through experimintation that illusory correlation was an obstacle to the use of valid psychodiagnostic signs. Most of the research concerned with the illusory correlation is modeled after the seminal work of D. L. Hamilton and R. K. Gifford (1976) and concludes that observing in a unbias manner will bring more accurate judgments. Clinicians, because they are human can fall into a position in which they make judgements based on the frequency of the observed behaviors. The fact that some behaviors are similar does not make them the same. Misinterpreting these observations as being correlated can often lead to a misdiagnosis. 

=== Hindsight, p104-105 ===

As a kid, how many times did you get in trouble for doing something you probably shouldn't have only to hear your little brother or sister say &quot;I told you so&quot;?  And it was very painful when you realized they were right?  Hindsight, the I-should-have-known-all-along phenomenon is experienced in one form or another daily and much more than we realize. Goggin &amp; Range, 1985 examined hindsight from the perspective of a suicide victim's family, friends and acquaintances.  Typical responses from people viewed the suicide victim's family as somewhat responsible for the death. McIntosh and Kelly (1992) report there are more similarities than differences in the grief response among suicide, accident and natural death survivors. They did not find any guilt or social support differences, but they did find that suicide survivors differed from others in three ways. They blamed more people, felt stigmatized, and felt they could have done something to prevent the suicide. I have experienced the loss of a family friend by suicide.  I do recall the feeling of guilt, but only because there were no obvious signs or red flags to predict that such a drastic departure would occur. In regards to clinical judgements, hindsight leaves the clinician open to error.  The tendency to exaggerate a diagnosis usually leads to misinterpreting the true problem.

=== Self-Confirming Diagnosis, p105-107 ===

Looking for a lost set of keys or a matching pair of socks can turn into quite a frustrating endeavor.  In the clinical environment however, the clinician must not know what to expect of an individual if an honest judgment is to be made.  Presumptive questioning will lead the interviewer to the diagnosis he/she seeks not the diagnosis that will clarify a pattern of behavior.   Snyder and Swann (1978), conducted an experiment that proved that once a person received information and then is told it's invalid they still have problems clearing their mind to conduct an unbiased evaluation.  Thus, creating error in judgment and a misdiagnosis.  This reminds me of the conscientious attorney that declares in the courtroom that his client is guilty of all accusations.  The judge then turns to the jury and says &quot;disregard that last remark&quot;.  It's just about impossible.

=== Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction, p107-108 ===
Alot of cliicians and interviewers make the error of hindsight and self confirming diagnosis which leads them being more confident in their own predictions than in statistical prediction (such as using GPA of high school to predict how well the student will do in college). But using ones own predictions based off of intuition isnt nearly as accurate as statistical prediction.Most of the research favors statistical prediction over human intuition even thought neither one is completely reliable. After much research Paul Meehl (1986) writes how there is overwhelmingly more evidence toward statistical predictions as being more accurate than human intuition. &quot;When you are pushing 90 investigatioins, predicting everything from the outcome of football games to the diagnosis of liver disease and when you can hardly come up with a half dozen studies showing even a weak tendency in favor of the clinician, it is time to draw a practical conclusion.&quot;  Even in the face of all this research favoring statistical prediction, intuition is still used by experts to predict all kinds of things such as how well a high school student will do in college. Dawes (1976) tells us why statistics is more accurate by giving an example of interviewers relying on their intuitive ability rather than statistical information, which in this case is cumulative GPA of students interviewing for enrollment of college. &quot;Yet you and I, looking at a folder or interviewing someone for a half hour, are supposed to be able to form a better impression than one based on 3 1/2 years of cumulative evaluations of 20-40 differnt professors.&quot;

=== Implications, 108-109 ===
Clinicians make errors and have biases such as when thinking you see a connection between something you look for evidence to prove there is a connection. They also think their intuitive predictions are more accurate than they really are. Some ways to stay away from erroneous prediction is to realize that looking back can be tempting and may lead to overconfidence. Don't ask questions that may lead you to the answer you're looking for, and test your original thinking against different ideas. With all this bias and errors in research and diagnosis shows that Psychology has only extracted a drop of information from an ocean of knowledge. With this  knowledge missing some psychologist try to create theories to make up for Psychology's ignorance, which only increases our ignorance. Science is but one way of seeking truth and will always be connected with human intuition.

== Module 11 - Clinical Therapy:The Powers of Social Cognition ==
=== Social Cognition and Depression, p111-116 ===
When it comes to depression people don't realize the things people go through that make
them the way that they are. Doctors may find it hard to make a diagnosis because depression is so complex. In some cases depression may be hard to evaluate in some patients because it comes out of nowhere. Some patients may have no starting point, but there are ways to figure it out. 
The depressive explanatory style is one of those ways. (Peterson and Steen,2002:
Sweeney and others,1986) This style gives us a better understanding of how it works. 
People suffering from depression usually are the ones who look at the positive and negative aspects of things while non depressed people 
may only look at the positives. If something negative happens in a depressed persons life they may automatically take the blame for what 
has happened and a non depressed person may find other things to blame the failure on. Two questions are always on mind when it comes to depression: Does depressed moods cause negative thinking or does negative thinking cause depressed moods? Automatically you may assume that negative thinking causes a person to be depressed. That is true but it can actually be both. Our moods do help us decide the way that we think. If we are in a good mood we think positive thoughts and if we are in a bad mood we think negative thoughts. When we are in bad moods we may think of past events that were bad and at that time we just kind of brushed it off and now all of a sudden we are depressed about it. Also do not forget that negative thinking can cause depressed moods. Say you start a new job and the first person you meet seems sad and depressed and the next person you meet seems the same way, well when meeting the next person you may think negatively towards that person before you even meet them because of your past experience with the last two people. Given these two questions we have to ask ourselves how does depression revolve? How does it start? Where does it end? Does it end? Well the cycle of depression helps us  better understand the process. Our moods whether good or bad affect the way that we think and the way we act. To be in a bad mood we may remember a past event differently than if we were in a good mood. It also affects the way people view and act towards us. If we act sad and down a person may treat us differently than if we were happy.Below shows the cycle of depression and how it evolves.(Peter Lewinsohn)(1985)[http://www.alanpriest.f2s.com/images/Cycle_of_Depression.JPG] All of these factors lead doctors to evaluate all their patients differently. Looking more into the way that each individual thinks more than the way that they act. Also, how they view their life and the life of others around them. When evaluating these factors doctors are able to give their patients the proper diagnosis and treatment.

=== Social Cognition and Loneliness, p116-118 ===
Loneliness is something that most people feel atleast once in their life and most of the time it is unconscious.  There is a difference between felling lonely and actually being physically alone.  Most of the time loneliness is associated with depression but not always.  The correlation between the two is relatively high.  It is a negative correlation greater than .5 (Anderson et al. 1994: 549-557).
Loneliness is also a cycle like depression.  Since, people feel lonely they approach people shyly because the feeling of being lonely makes people feel that they are inadequate.  They also feel that it is their fault that they are lonely.  &quot;A correlation study designed to more accuratley represent the self-blame conceptualization revealed that both behavioral and characterological self-blame contribute uniquely to depression and loneliness&quot; (549).  Since, people behave and characterologically self-blame they then place themselves into a cycle of loneliness that is difficult to get out of. People's thoughts and beliefs control their actions which give them specific results that then contribute to their previous thoughts (Anderson et al.).

=== Social Cognition and Anxiety, p118-119 ===
Anxiety of certain situations occur for many different reasons.  Most of them stem from fear.  Fear of social evaluation, fear of self disclosure, and fear of having to evaluate others.  Shyness and anxiety were highly correlated with the correlation equaling .75 (Asendorpf 1987: 542-549). Shy people are more likely to be anxious than people who are not shy.

=== Social-Psychology Approaches to Treatment, p120-122 ===
Psychotherapists try change the way a patient thinks, their attitude, by first adjusting the
patient's action, their behavior. These methods take place within a supportive environment such as a support group or self-help group. Behavior therapists implement a technique in which an individual takes on new verbal or physical behaviors in front of a supportive audience, and in repetitive practice the individual can eventually be empowered to employ what they've learned into their everyday life. We are assumed to generate our own emotions according to rational-emotive therapy, and self-help groups use this to generate new behavior from participants. Experiments have been done that indicate human emotion can be affected by what a person may say about themselves (Mirels 1977:1132-1133). Positive emotions like self-worth, happiness, and togetherness can be maintained through a cycle of positive experiences. Conversely, negative emotions like sadness, anger, and frusteration can be maintained through a cycle of negative events. People can be broken from a negative cycle by reversing their environment, encouraging good behavior, and getting them to be cognitively positive. Negative emotions are not just a figment of one's imagination, they actually do unhealthily portray themselves in a given social situation. This
can be corrected with the observation and implementation of new behaviors in something like a support group, and the individual may then be able to respond more effectively in their everyday life. In behaving more positively the individual begins to retain a more positive image of themself. As a result they put themselves in better social situations and behave more positively in those situations. Explanatory style therapy implements a process in which a person changes their attributes which, in turn, changes their emotions. They learn how to define their actions and the outcomes of those actions which enables them to accurately evaluate a situation. Even if the outcome is negative, the fact that they know what they did wrong or what the external factors were lets them feel positive about a negative event. People with good social skills often can see themselves as socially awkward because their environment, or negative elements within that social situation. This type of person can be helped to reverse their their negative beliefs about themselves and that is the focus of explanatory style therapy. This therapy does not transform an individual into an omnipositive being that is appreciated by everyone in any given social situation. In addition their are positive and negative stages in every cycle. It is natural to react positively to positive events, and negatively to negative events. In this sense a negative self-perception is perfecly healthy and normal, as well as temporary.

==Module 13: Gender, Genes, and Culture==
===Gender Differences===

Are gender differences determined by natural selection or are they dictated through individual cultures? To answer this question we will need to examine the differences between how culture affects males and females.  Cultural influenced differences have been found to surface in childhood.  Boys have been found to seek a separation between themselves and their caregiver, whereas, girls tend to identify themselves through their social connections.  These gender differences appear to follow a person into adulthood.  For example, in group situations, men tend to focus on the task at hand whereas women focus more on personal relationships (Gabriel &amp; Gardner, 1999).  
There are also gender differences in expressing empathy or experiencing how someone else feels as if you are feeling it also.  Women tend to show more emotion, such as crying, than men when someone is distressed.  This difference in empathetic reactions may possibly be explained by a woman’s superior sensitivity to nonverbal cues, which allow women to easily decode emotional messages being displayed by individuals.

===Social Dominance===
According to John Williams and Deborah Best, men are more dominant driven, and aggressive (John Williams and Deborah Best, 1990 a.p.15).  
There is no evidence of societies where women are more dominant than men (Pratto, 1996).  
Gender differences are shrinking over time as women assume more managerial and leadership positions.

====Aggression====
Aggression is defined by psychologists as behavior that is meant to hurt others (Myers, 2004).  In surveys, men admit to having more aggression than women do.

====Sexuality====
When it comes to responses that are subjective and physiological, women and men are “more similar than different” (Griffitt, 1987).  Statistics show that 48% of men and 12% of women can imagine themselves being comfortable and enjoying casual sex with different partners.  How often do they think about sex? It is thought that 19% women and 54% men think about sex every day or several times a day (Laumann &amp; others, 1994).

===Evolution and Gender: Doing What Comes Naturally?===
====Gender and Mating Preferences====
There is a theory known by evolutionary psychologists that says that men are more aggressive and dominant than females because they produce many more times the number of sperm than woman do eggs. They use this to explain why men have the more aggressive and dominant behavioral patterns. Because men have more genetics to pass on, they seek to spread their genes and fertilize as many women as possible.  In contrast, woman are said to seek just one male who can help to support and take care of her and the child she will introduce into the world.  Evolution in turn is supposed to be the cause of the male’s behavior.  Physically dominant males are said to attract more woman, making it seem like they can better help support and care for them, forcing the other males to become more aggressive and dominant in order to spread their genes.  In accordance with what was said about woman wanting a man who can help support them, woman tend to seek the highest paid or most successful of men when searching for a partner. Woman will go to great lengths, even starvation, to get model like beauty which men seek.  In conjunction with this behavior, women tend to go after the more wealthy or dominant of men because they would be able to provide more for their offspring.

====Gender and Hormones====
Many people believe that sex hormones, mainly testosterone, are a key element in gender differences. Testosterone both influences masculine features and aggressiveness. Violent male criminals generally have much higher testosterone levels. It is also noted that most males seem to become much less aggressive as they grow older and testosterone levels drop.

===Reflections on Evolutionary Psychology===

There are two problems, hindsight bias and cultural socialization, that occur when researchers try to explain theories using evolutionary psychology.  Hindsight bias is an attempt to explain behavior by examining history and working backward to find an explanation for this behavior.  For example, if we were to say women are stronger and aggressive than in hindsight we can say that this is because women needed to be this way in order to protect their young (Myers, 2004).  On the other hand, cultural socialization tests “evolutionary predictions through the utilization of cross-cultural and animal behavior observations, as well as hormonal and genetic studies (Myers, 2004).  Evolutionary psychologists do agree however that evolution does play a role in explaining some of the things we have in common and the things that we differ in; however, they do not feel that evolution is solely responsible for predicting cultural variations in behavior through time (Myers, 2004).

===Culture and Gender===

Culture can be defined as the ideas, behaviors, attitudes and traditions that have been passed within a group through generations.  Within a culture there are certain behavioral expectations.  An example of one of these expectations would be gender roles in which there are certain behaviors that a culture expects females and males to conform to (Myers, 2004).

===Gender Roles Vary with Culture and Time===

	Gender roles have gone through dramatic times in the last part of the century.  For example, in 1938 only 1 out of 5 Americans agreed that a married woman could earn money in the industry and business fields.  However, in 1996 a remarkable 4 out of 5 Americans approved of women working in these fields proving that time has greatly influenced changes in American culture (Niemi &amp; others, 1989; NORC, 1996).  This type of attitude change has also been accompanied by behavioral shifts.  For instance, the proportion of 40 year old married women in America that are in the workplace has doubled since 1960 (Bureau of the Census, 1999).  It is evident that it is not just evolution and biology that change gender roles but that culture affects gender roles also (Myers, 2004).

===Conclusions: Biology and Culture===
Biology and culture both play a role in how are attitudes and behaviors are affected.  Genetics may predispose us to behave a certain way, but culture may accentuate these behaviors.  There is an interaction between biological and cultural influences in that the effects of biology are dependent on the environment (Myers, 2004).  For example, people (environment) tend to react differently to people with particular genetic traits (biology).  An example of this would be that there is a significant cultural norm that dictates that males should be taller than their female companions.  According to one particular study, only 1 in 720 couples were in violation of this cultural norm (Gillis &amp; Avis, 1980).  This interaction between biology and culture can be explained psychologically two different ways.  Through hindsight, we could say that social power over women is perpetuated when a man is taller than she.  On the other hand, using cultural socialization, we can explain that if partners preferred companions of equal height than taller men and shorter women would not have companions.  Therefore, the cultural norm for height among couples may result from biology and culture because it is evident that evolution has brought about taller men and culture has dictated the same for couples (Myers, 2004).

==Module 21: Power to the Person==
===Interacting Persons and Situations===
-Interaction occurs in three different ways:  First, any given social situation affects everybody differently.  Because we all see and think differently, we react to things based on how we perceive the situation.  Also, some people are more sensitive and corresponsive than others.  Second, interaction, whether between situations or persons, most often occurs because people choose, and are responsible, for the situations they are in.  For example, quiet people might choose to be in a quiet or nonsocial environment.  Another example would be when people choose the college they want to attend; conservatives would most likely not choose to attend a liberal college.  Third, more often than not, people create the situations they are in.  For example, if we perceive or expect someone to be unfriendly, the way we treat that person may cause that person to act unfriendly or distant.  Our social environment is what we make of it.

- Dispute between whether or not reacting or acting upon our environments does also come into play.  In one perspective, it is sensible to see ourselves as the product of our environment, and to see others as “free actors.”  In another perspective, it may be sensible to see the opposite; to see ourselves as the agents and others as the products.  For example, if we see others as being influenced by their environments, we would be more likely to understand them, rather than to just say they are lazy or corrupt.  In conclusion, we are both the products and the designers of our own environments and social worlds.

===Resisting Social Pressure===
====Reactance==== 
		The much supported theory of reactance states that “people do indeed act to protect their sense of freedom”, (Myers, 229).  Experiments also showed that people often do the opposite of what is expected of them in order to express their freedom.  Freedom is very important to all individuals, and they often rebel when they think it might be in jeopardy.  An example of this might be underage drinking, because surveys show that more people get drunk when they are under the legal drinking age than those over the drinking age(Engs &amp; Hanson, 1989).    Another example of individuals rebelling due to their sense of threat of their freedom is by the act of rape.  While committing rape a man or woman may feel their freedom is restricting by the rejection of the other partner.
====Asserting Uniqueness====
		“People feel uncomfortable when they appear too different from others….. they also feel uncomfortable when they appear like everyone else” (Myers, 230).  Individuals think of themselves highly when they appear unique, but not too different so they won’t appear as outcasts. The yearning for such uniqueness is evident in the selection in names of babies.   Children also present the desire for uniqueness in many ways. One example, which was reported by William McGuire and his colleagues at Yale University is that when students are asked to tell others  about themselves they often state something rather unique about themselves. 
	Also, individuals recognize their differences especially when it comes to the differences in gender (Cota &amp; Dion, 1986). For example, one sex is more likely to notice they are different when surrounded by the opposite sex.  This provides us with an understanding of how minorities become quite conscious of their differences and surroundings. 
	“When the people of two cultures are nearly identical, they still will notice their differences, however small” (Myers, 231).  Hostility usually occurs more when one party has a greater correspondence to the other.

===Minority Influence===
What is it that makes a minority persuasive?  In the book, there are three things that minorities achieve to gain the attention and respect of the majority.  We find that consistency of a minority that never falters in it's beliefs and stances on an issue is gradually accepted by the majority.  Self-confidence, which is a product of consistency, also establishes to the majority that the minority is assertive and empowered in their beliefs and claims.  And last, defections of the majority help to increase the popularity of the minority.  A product of the first two, defection from the majority can help to further a minorities cause.

===Is Leadership Minority Influence?===
-Some leaders surface based on their group and how they interact, others are formally agreed upon or elected.  Good leadership depends on the situation.  For example, the best person to lead the swim team may not be the best person to lead a debate team.  The most common types of leadership include task leadership and social leadership.  Task leadership includes setting standards, organizing, and goal achievement.  Task leaders most commonly have a dictative style-one that can work well if the leader is smart and adequate enough to give good instructions or guidelines.  Also, since the task leadership wants to achieve their goals, they would be good at keeping the group on track making sure things are getting done.  Experiments done on the subject show that a mixture of detailed and perhaps tough goals and intermittent advancement helps stimulate students’ achievement.  Social leadership includes being sympathetic and/or supportive, structuring teamwork, and intervening conflicts.  This is often a self-governing method.  Many researchers think this type of leadership is also good for self-confidence.  Also, when workers feel that they are in control over what they are doing, they are more likely to be motivated and therefore achieve more.

-Studies have shown that the best types of leaders include those who fall under both categories-task and social leadership.  They are concerned both with the progression of the work, and are also sympathetic and understanding to the needs and feelings of their workers.  Effective leaders also exude a self-confident charisma, and they are consistent with sticking to their goals. Charismatic leaders usually have a convincing vision or idea of what they desire, and are able to communicate these ideas clearly, showing hopefulness and confidence in their group to enthuse others to follow.

-Groups also influence their leaders.  Sometimes a leader who strays too much from their groups standards may be “thrown out.”  Smart leaders most often stick with the majority, and are careful as to what they say.  

Important concepts to remember:
*&quot;Reactance - A motive to protect or restore one’s sense of freedom.  Reactance arises when someone threatens our freedom of action.&quot;		
*&quot;Leadership- The process by which certain group members motivate and guide the group.&quot;

==Module 27: The Ups and Downs of Love==
===Passionate Love===
To better understand the principles of love, it must first be examined and measured.  Psychologist Robert Sternberg (1998) views love as a triangle, whose three sides consist of passion, intimacy, and commitment.  Love can be best described in reference to a relationship between two people.  Love is more evident in relationships that contain a mutual understanding, giving and receiving support, and enjoying the loved one’s company.  Passionate love is mostly expressed in a physical manner while maintaining an exclusive relationship.  Passionate love is also a love that is shared between two people who are intensely fascinated with their partners. Passionate love is an emotional love that is both exciting and intense.  Elaine Hatfield (1998) defined it as “a state of intense longing for union with another” (p.193).  Love assumes many variations.  Time and culture both have an affect on the love formed in a relationship.  Time can be consistent with the age of the individuals involved in the relationship, or it could even be the age difference between the partners.  Culture plays a strong role in love and relationships.  An individual’s ethnicity, background, religion, or even financial stability can affect the love in a relationship.  

===Companionate Love===
	Companionate love is best defined as a passionate love that has settled to a warm enduring love between the two partners in a relationship.  The companionate love shared between two partners consists of fewer ups and downs than what is found in passionate love.  It’s more stable and a deeper respect and affectionate attachment between partners is more evident.  Passionate love is a fire burning hot and rapidly.  Companionate love is the hot coals left over after the fire is gone.  Companionate love is often found in marriages.  In marriages, the passion has often left the relationship, but a deep affection and commitment for the other person still remains.  Companionate love is often a person relation shared amongst partners.  The longer the relationship lasts, the less of an emotional rollercoaster it will have.  

===Maintaining Close Relationships===
	One important factor of any close relationship is equity.  Being able to achieve equity is an important key in a relationship.  Elaine Hatfield, William Walster, and Ellen Berscheid  (1978) have proclaimed an equity principle of attraction:  What you and your partner get out of a relationship should be proportional to what you each put into it.  In other words, for a relationship to work, each partner must invest certain feeling and actions into their relationship.  Long-term equity is achieved by not focusing on “who owes who” in a relationship.  When one partner provides the other with their needs, a form of return in not expected.  Be able to look past and not feel that a debt is owed, is what allows the relationship to last.  One clue that an acquaintance is becoming a close friend is that the person shares when sharing is unexpected (Miller &amp; others, 1989).  Happily married people tend not to keep score of how much they are giving and getting (Buunk &amp; Van Yperen, 1991).

===Ending Relationships===
	Relationships normally end when the love that is shared between the partners is no longer significant.  Enduring relationships are rooted in enduring love and satisfaction, but also in inattention to possible alternative partners, fear of the termination cost, and a sense of moral obligation (Adams &amp; Jones, 1997).  
====Who Divorces?====
	Divorce rates are currently on the high and high nearly doubled since the middle of the century.  Divorce is ultimately the result of unhappiness in a relationship, a lost of love between partners, and the outcome of consistent conflict within a marriage.  Recent Risk of divorce also depends on who marries whom (Fergusson &amp; others, 1984; Myers, 2000a; Tzeng, 1992).  People usually stay married if they:
* married after age 20.
* both grew up in stable, two-parent homes.
* dated for a long while before marriage.
* are well and similarly educated.
* enjoy a stable income from a good job.
* live in a small town or on a farm.
* did not cohabit or become pregnant before marriage.
* are religiously committed.
* are of similar age, faith, and education.

These results can vary from marriage to marriage, but at least every divorce or loss of love in a relationship can be related back to one of these circumstances.  Obviously, without a way to attach or relate yourself to another person, a relationship or even a marriage will become increasingly difficult to maintain.

==Module 28: Causes of Conflict==

Conflict- a perceived incompatibility of actions or goals

===Social Dilemmas===
Many of the choices that we make in regards to our own self-interest can be collectively punishing.
====Prisoner’s Dilemma==== 
Two men are questioned by the District Attorney in regards to a crime they are guilty of committing but the DA only has enough evidence to convict them both of a lesser crime, so he splits them up and talks to them one at a time, giving them both three choices
•	Confess and if the other man doesn’t than you will be given immunity and he will have to serve your sentence along with his own
•	If both of you confess then you will each have to serve out five year sentences
•	If neither of the two men confess they will both be assigned very light punishment

This puts the two men in a predicament because they are left with the uncertainty that the other will try to get away scot-free.  Even though if neither of them confess they will both be sentenced to a far less harsh punishment, they are left to consider the risk that if they decide not to confess they could potentially be left to serve out both sentences alone.  So the majority of people would just choose to confess so that they don’t potentially have to deal with the others selfishness.  So just a simple thing like mistrust can make cooperation out of the question.

====The Tragedy of the Commons====
In most social dilemmas more than one party is responsible for contributing to the problem. 

EXAMPLE:
Between restockings, a cookie jar holds enough cookies (if conserved properly) for the children to eat three a day.  However cooperation and regulation of the out of cookies is very unlikely, instead, the children who are afraid of being exploited by each other just start shoveling cookies into their mouths and then the supply is exhausted immediately. A lack of trust in eachother and cooperation now leaves them without cookies until the next time the jar is filled, (Gifford &amp; Hine, 1997).  This is an example of a non-zero game, instances in which acting rationally still results in a negative outcome

===Resolving Social Dilemmas===
====Regulation====
if it becomes mandatory to follow guidelines which contribute to the overall good of the group it is more likely that the system will last
====Small is Beautiful====
If a group remains small then the members are more likely to feel an obligation to the group and they will most likely see their input or contribution as important.  If a group grows too large than many of the members might feel like their role is unimportant and will feel little ambition to remain active in the groups prosperity, (Kerr, 1989).
====Communication====
When a group communicates and expresses their concern or addresses a dilemma, the group members often act in the interest of everyone, this also adds pressure on the other members to contribute so they will not be singled out or possibly reprimanded.

====Changing the Payoffs====
If the reward for co-operation is more appealing than the reward for exploitation more people are likely to cooperate, for instance; car pool lanes on busy highways so that the number of cars contributing to the traffic and pollution problems is decreased.
====Appeals to Altruistic Norms====
If it is likely to benefit the common good, people might feel responsible to act in the interest of the group, (social responsibility norm) even if it could possibly put their own life in danger, or inconvenience them.

[[Image:060619 teched2006 019.jpg]]

The above image is a example of an altruistic view of our connection with the rest of the universe.

===Competition===
In an experiment to test the intensity of influence competition has on conflict, Muzifer Sherif (1966), used two groups of boys to test if limited resources shared between the two groups would lead to conflict.  Unaware of the other group, Sherif had the boys in each group work together to build their campsites and let them get aquatinted with one another.  After friendships had been formed he introduced the two groups to each other by putting one group on the baseball field at the same time the other group was supposed to use it.  This sudden fear of losing their resources to the other group led the boys to strengthen their camaraderie within their respective groups by mutual hostility towards the rival group, where even affiliation to the group meant immediate blacklisting.  

===Perceived Injustice===
When one feels as though their contribution to the group is worthy of a greater reward, they are either reminded of their inadequacies and become submissive to their superiors, use personal attacks or black-mail to get what they want, or actually revolt against their superiors and try to overthrow them, (Elaine Hatfield, William Walster, Ellen Pzersheid, 1978).  On the other hand, it is very unlikely that someone will bring attention to themselves if they feel they are receiving more for their contribution than necessary.  In these cases many will convince themselves that their work is worthy of extra benefits.  Also if one is made aware that their skills exceed their reward they are more likely to argue their worth, “The more competent and worthy people feel, (the more they value their inputs), the more they will feel under benefitted and thus eager to retaliate”(Ross &amp; others, 1971).

Example:
All things considered, who has a better life in this country--men or women?
             1972      1993
Men           29%       60% 
Women         35%       21%
Same          30%       15%
No Opinion     6%        5%
(Source: Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, 1997)

===Misperception===
[http://www.iwalt.com/static/images/blogpics/misperceptions.gif An example of variation in misperceptions according to News source]
Since conflict is the product of a perceived incompatibility, it is likely that by mis-perception of others actions, most conflicts are created.  This coincides with the concept of a self-serving bias, in that we often justify our own actions and take credit for our successes but justify our mistakes.  At the same time we tend to judge others’ actions or motives more harshly than our own, leading us to condemn others prematurely.  We can also attribute the fundamental attribution error to our mis-perceptions in the sense that we are more likely to be less considerate of others external circumstances that factor into their actions, and this gives us a one-dimensional perception of the other which can be very inaccurate.

===Mirror Image Perceptions===
[http://www.funnyhub.com/pictures/pages/mirror-image-perceptions.html An example of skewed mirror image perceptions]
It is common for two rival groups to hold each other responsible for same crimes and to consider themselves moral and virtuous for the same reasons, (Morton Deutsch, 1986).  This is often the case in wartime, we see people in only one of two categories; “for us or against us”.  In modern warfare it is seen as more diplomatic however for us to say that it is not the general public that we are at war with, but the evil regime that has contaminated it’s people that we are against.  This also gives us the appeal of a knight in shining armor, trying to save the “good people” from their “evil leaders”.  Our cause for intervening is now validated because it is then considered a service to the people.

== Module 30 - When Do People Help? ==
=== Why Do People Help? ===
Altruism is an unselfish act of genuine care toward another in a given situation in which no form of payment is expected. But what motivates helping? One theory, called Social-Exchange, entails a person evaluating a sort of relationship that binds the benefit and cost of helping the person before they act in the situation. Obviously, the helper desires to achieve optimal benefit at a low cost. If a person knows that the reason a person helped was because of this, then the &quot;helper&quot; does not deserve to be recognized for their &quot;good deed.&quot; Some people help to increase someone else's welfare and the only happiness gained is from the sense of knowing they genuinely helped someone. Often this type of person is characterized as someone who feels other's pain when they hurt, or feel someone else's joy when they are happy. Another agent that invokes helping are social norms, one of which being the reciprocity norm. As social norms idealize how we ought to be behave, this norm suggests how we act in service to someone else because they had previously done it for us. This norm is not likely to be altruistic since there is some motivation for the self present. Another norm that suggests how we ought to behave is the social-responsibility norm. This agent is different from the reciprocity norm in that we are aware of no trading services for one another. This norm best illustrates altruism because it prescribes us to be inspired to help someone in need and never ask for or expect anything in return. These theories can be brought up to the level of making sense in nature. A concern for other's well being essentially is a concern for their survival. It is interesting to think, in this sense, how a group that is more altrustic has a good likelihood of surviving.

=== When Do People Help? ===
Social psychologists have tried to explain bystander behavior in different ways. Through a series of experiments they arrived at remarkable results. Helping often is performed by people who want to feel better about themselves by relieving a sense of guilt they may have in order to have a more pure notion of themselves. Sometimes people who are just in a positive state of mind feel the genuine desire to help someone else in need. A highly specialized result gives the impression that people of a religious affiliation are often the ones giving service to others. The conditions under which help takes place range in subjective to objective conditions. Subjective conditions include recent observation of a good deed by someone else, not feeling rushed at that particular time, or that a person debating to help sees an element of similarity between them and the victim. Objective conditions include the severity of the victim's need, our environment or surroundings, and the absence of others around to help. 

=== Number of Bystanders ===
When we hear about a situation in which someone was in need but was not helped by a bystander we think that the bystander is a horrible person, and that surely, we would have done something because we are caring people. But is it possible that the bystander who did not help was a caring person? Not necessarily. Numerous experiments have been done that reveal, oddly enough, that the less people that are around as bystanders in a given situation where someone needs help, service is more likely to take place. In situations with multiple bystanders, one is less likely to notice the victim in need, their problem, and take action (Latane, Darley 1970:364-369). This lack of concern for a critical situation within a group of people is referred to as informational influence. One person sees no one else acting to help, and they themselves think everything must be alright, and do not help. On the other hand, if someone noticed someone in need and they saw someone rush over frantically to render service to them, then the sense of urgency for a critical situation would be higher. Either way, we always face the dilemma of deciding whether a situation warrants our attention. Sometimes we disregard ourselves and decide to help.  Other times we take no action in a situation we feel is unclear, and this is referred to as the bystander effect. But not understanding the magnitude of a critical situation is not always the reason for taking no action. In some events the situation is clear and we still do not act. We can see something happening to a person and not act because of our notice of others who are also watching. Our attention is drawn from the victim to the other bystanders and by seeing them just looking on, we fail to act as well. It is interesting to think the mere presence of other people affects our own personal emotion and mindset in an objective situation. In experiments where participants were placed in a situation where they had to decide whether or not to take action for themselves, focus groups with other people aware of the same circumstances failed to act more compared with focus groups in which people thought they were the only ones aware of the critical nature of the given situation (Latane, Darley 1968:217-221). The participants were asked whether the presence of others with the same awareness affected their decision regarding action, the common response was that it did not. In essence, a person does not always know why they do what they do, as affirmed by this experiment. The depth of some experiments causes some people to question the ethics of said experiments. But it is important to keep in mind that the overall goal of experiments is to protect those participating and enhance human well being in the process. People become informed as a result of such experiments, and those who witness change are more likely to implement it (Beaman, Barnes, Klentz, McQuirk 1978:407-410).

==Module 31: The Social Psychology of Sustainability==
===Enabling Sustainable Living===
====Increasing Efficiency and Productivity====
	To sustain a future for all human life, we must continue to push the boundaries of technology.  Automobiles have become more fuel efficient and produce much less pollution.  Documents are now stored, copied, delivered, and produced electronically.  Forget the copier machine, right click, copy, and then paste.  From home appliances, to light bulbs, highways, buildings, and medicine, technological advances are certainly paving the road into the future.  How knew the 21st century would be so far ahead of it time?

====Reducing Consumption====
	Another vital step in sustain future life is reducing consumption.  For humans to inhabit the earth for centuries to come, we must obtain the ability to both consume and pollute less.  Birth rates are continually dropping, due to the escalating numbers of educated and employed women in the world.  However, the world is still at its full capacity.  Many countries in the world have tried to reduce consumption, but many have simply given up or have not yet witnessed the constructive outcomes.  Ideas such as, rewarding those who recycle, carpool, use public transportation, and use environmental friendly equipment to power their homes would be a great place to start.  On the other hand, we must also penalize those who add to the over consumption of resources.  Fine, ticket, tax, or charge those who drive separately. Those who leave their light on in their homes 24 hours of the day, drive three-hundred miles for vacation in an S.U.V., and throw away every piece of trash instead of recycling.  Robert Frank (1999), an economist well-versed in social psychology, suggests how a socially responsible market economy might reward achievement while promoting more sustainable consumption.

===The Social Psychology of Materialism and Wealth===
====Increased Materialism====
	Increased materialism is most evident in the United States, as one poll clearly represents, Gallup Poll (1990), 1 in 2 women, 2 in 3 men, and 4 in 5 people earning more than $75,000 a year would like to be rich.  More and more individuals want to be wealthy during their life, rather than making an effort at living a meaningful life.  

====Wealth and Well-Being====
	Can you buy happiness with money?  Or maybe even your well-being?  Sadly, no, it can’t.  There is little, if any, correlation between wealth and well-being.  Studies have shown that regardless of how wealthy an individual is, his or her well-being is highly (almost indefinitely) not going to change.  In poor countries, where low income threatens basic needs, being relatively well-off does predict greater well-being (Argyle, 1999).  Once and individual becomes wealthy, there is an increase in happiness that will only last for short period of time till that individual is no longer happy.  Then, even more money and wealth are needed to be content with that individual’s well-being.  David Lykken (1999, p.17), “People who go to work in their overalls and on the bus are just as happy, on the average, as those in suits who drive to work in their own Mercedes.”  Even the super-rich –the Forbes 100 wealthiest Americans– report only slightly greater happiness than average (Diener, Horwitz, and Emmons, 1985).

====Why Materialism Fails to Satisfy====
	Materialism fails to satisfy the individual who strive to gain as much as they can in their life time.  Those who strive for power, money, and wealth live their lives at a much lower sense of well-being.  Those who strive to achieve person growth, wisdom, and knowledge live their lives with a much higher sense of well-being.  Being materialistic and obtaining a personal well-being from material objects will only results in a lower sense of well-being.  So many things that used to be luxuries have now become necessities, by which an individual will measure there well-being.  Eventually, everyone will have that luxury and the individual will feel they need yet another luxury that everyone else does not have, in order to promote their own well-being.  The cycle will continue and the materialistic individuals will constantly need more to obtain a higher sense of personal well-being.

===Towards Sustainability and Survival===
	To relieve our society of the materialistic nature in which it is engulfed, people must follow the steps of sustainability.  Implementing programs and laws that reduce consumption, continue to improve technology, focus on efficiency, realize that wealth and well-being share no correlation, and promote economical growth.  People must come together and concentrate their attention on the events which take place in the world instead of centering their focus on their selves.  Through the study of social psychology, the world can better itself by contributing to the sustainability and survival of the world.  The sooner people come to terms with materialism not leading to a better sense of well-being, the better of a place the world will become.

==Human Impact on the Environment==
Global warming, while a major concern for a variety of reasons, will also affect some components of the eco-system that one might normally consider. For instance, the projected temperatures and CO2 levels that will accompany global warming lead to the rapid and expansive growth of plants that are typically considered weeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher2008&quot;&gt;Christopher, Tom. 2008. “Can Weeds Help Solve the Climate Crisis?.” The New York Times, June 29 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/magazine/29weeds-t.html (Accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that some plants are &quot;weeds&quot; is actually a subjective understanding and illustrates social constructionism quite well; we construct the category of weeds to denote whichever plants we currently don't want to have in a specific location.  What's more, weed scientists are well aware of the fact that weeds co-evolve with human efforts to eradicate them, which has made many plant species commonly seen as weeds even hardier than they were before humans began trying to eradicate them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher2008&quot;/&gt;

Some might wonder why there is so little action being taken by the U.S., the world's leading polluter and contributor to global warming, despite the government being aware of its role in global warming.  There is some evidence to suggest that the reason is because of politics and greed. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher2006&quot;&gt;Fisher, Dana. 2006. Bringing the Material Back In: Understanding the U.S. Position on Climate Change. Sociological Forum, Vol. 21, No. 3. (2006), pp. 467-494.&lt;/ref&gt; Senators from states with large coal deposits are substantially more likely to oppose climate-friendly legislative proposals than are senators from other states.  As political campaigns in the U.S. are largely funded by donations, and many of those come from companies and employees of large companies, it is likely the case that the monetary benefits derived by the large companies extracting coal translate into political opposition to climate-friendly policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher2006&quot;/&gt;  In a sense, then, short-term monetary gain is preventing the U.S. from taking action on long-term climate degradation.

Another reason why people are unwilling to take action on climate change is because of human psychology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunstein2013&quot;&gt;Sunstein, Cass R. 2013. “People Don’t Fear Climate Change Enough.” BloombergView. Retrieved June 20, 2014 (http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-08-27/people-don-t-fear-climate-change-enough).&lt;/ref&gt;  People tend to prefer to focus on risks that have an identifiable perpetrator.  Since the responsibility for climate change is [[w:diffusion of responsibility|diffused]] throughout all of humanity, it is difficult to pick a single perpetrator.  Humans also tend to think about threats based on how immediate and salient they are; the consequences of climate change are neither immediate nor salient for most people.

==Environmental Impact on Humans==
Just as humans influence the environment, the environment influences human behavior.  For instance, instances of &quot;uncomfortable&quot; weather - i.e., very hot, humid, wet, or cold weather - changes who people call and how long they talk with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phithakkitnukoon2012&quot;&gt;Phithakkitnukoon, S., Leong, T. W., Smoreda, Z., &amp; Olivier, P. (2012). Weather Effects on Mobile Social Interactions: A Case Study of Mobile Phone Users in Lisbon, Portugal. PLoS ONE, 7(10), e45745. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0045745&lt;/ref&gt;  People are more likely to call and talk longer with close family and friends during instances of bad weather.

Robert Frank,{{ref|Frank1999}} an economist well-versed in social psychology, suggests how a socially responsible market economy might reward achievement while promoting more sustainable consumption.

Intriguingly, Americans favor conservation and reduced consumption, but many don't practice what they preach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leiserowitz&quot;&gt;Leiserowitz, A. (in press) “Climate change risk perceptions and behavior in the United States,” in S. Schneider, A. Rosencranz, and M. Mastrandrea, eds. Climate Change Science and Policy. Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 88% of Americans say it is important to recycle but only 51% often or always do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leiserowitz&quot;/&gt;  Changing attitudes about the environment is often easier than changing behaviors.

===The Social Psychology of Materialism and Wealth===
====Increased Materialism====
	Increased materialism is most evident in the United States, as one poll clearly represents, Gallup Poll,{{ref|Gallup1990}} 1 in 2 women, 2 in 3 men, and 4 in 5 people earning more than $75,000 a year would like to be rich.

Perry County is almost 70% black and is a poor county.  Thus, questions have been raised about whether the decision to store the coal ash in Perry County is illustrative of environmental racism.  The claims of environmental racism are contrasted with the economic benefits to the county and people in the county that will result from the decision to store the polluting coal ash in the county.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before giving details of language specification, let us take a moment to point out several aspects of the flavour of FORTH so they can be kept in mind during the subsequent pages.

* Many requirements of traditional programming environments are actually unnecessary and based on historical baggage. 

* Careful specification of system elements causes them to become much smaller in code size. This process feeds on itself.

* One pass compilation and a style that discourages references to things that haven't yet been defined provides subtle pressure that eliminates enormous numbers of programming bugs based on Russell's paradox type code (circular definitions).

* Factoring is encouraged because the overhead to define and call a subroutine is reduced to a minimum. This encourages definition of a subroutine for each sequence of operations that is used in multiple places. This shrinks the size of the code and encourages good coding practice of implementing each algorithmic component in one centralized and maintainable subroutine.

* Structured programming conditionals in best mathematical computer science style are used. Programmers are led to follow the mathematical requirement of having only one entry point and only one exit point for code snippets.

* The programmer should be able to make the code read as they want it to look like, eliminating a level of confusion due to required language syntax. It should be possible to have the meaning of code stand out from skimming it.

* The &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; issue lurking in computer languages is made explicit and democratized. You, not the language designer, get to create a dictionary and name the words in it. It is your dictionary. If you want to share vocabularies with other people, well then you all have to agree what to name the word for a particular function. If you don't like the name given, you can define a new word with the name you like that points to the original definition.

* If there is a capacity already built into the software somewhere, it should always be available to be called by the programmer. This is unlike most other systems, where you can see many applications already contain code for doing a programming task you may wish to use, but this code and its constituents are not callable or available to you if you sit down to write a program.

* Demystification of the concept of &quot;the compiler&quot;. The compiler and its required functionality become a few words in the dictionary whose behavior can be mastered by intermediate students. They can be used, extended and modified.

* By specifying the language rules by which you and the computer communicate as simple and consistent with an articulatable philosophy behind them instead of a blizzard of special characters and complicated precedence rules both communicants benefit. The person feels they are working in harmony with a few KB of understandable compiler code instead of fighting megabytes of coded exceptions and special cases. The compiler writer has a well defined set of rules that can be exactly and correctly implemented. Moments of ambiguity between compiler bugs and language manual vagueness are to be minimized.

== Option D.1 Origin of Life on Earth ==

'''D.1.1 Outline the conditions of the pre-biotic Earth, including high temperature, lightning, UV light penetration and a reducing atmosphere.'''

*In the pre-biotic Earth (the solar system originated around 4.57 billion years ago) there was little to no oxygen in the atmosphere (any oxygen was absorbed by rocks), so there was no oxygen to steal the energy. 
The energy for forming the molecules was provided by lightning, volcanic activity, meteorite bombardment, high temperatures due to greenhouse gasses and UV radiation.
*At first, the Earth was cold and later melted from heat produced by compaction, radioactive decay and the impact of meteorites. The molten material sorted into layers of varying density with the least dense material solidified into a thin crust. The present continents are attached to plates of crust that float on the mantle. The first seas formed from rain that began when Earth had cooled enough for water in the atmosphere to condense. 
*The prebiotic era dates from 4.4 billion years ago. The earliest life known is dated to 3.8 billion years ago.

'''D.1.2 Outline the experiments of Miller and Urey into the origin of organic compounds.'''

* They simulated conditions on the early Earth by constructing an apparatus that contained a warmed flask of water simulating the primeval sea and an atmosphere of water, hydrogen gas, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (methane), and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (ammonia).
*Sparks were discharged in the synthetic atmosphere to mimic lightning. A water was boiled while a condenser cooled the atmosphere, raining water and any dissolved compounds back to the miniature sea. The simulated environment produced many types of amino acids and other organic molecules leading them to conclude the prebiotic synthesis of organic molecules was possible.
*However, the question of the concentration of methane and other chemicals is in doubt so the applicability of the results is uncertain.

'''D.1.3 Discuss the hypothesis that the first catalysts responsible for polymerization reactions were clay minerals and RNA.'''

* Polymers are chains of similar building blocks or monomers, synthesized by condensation reactions (H and OH are removed from polymers and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 is produced). Early polymerization reactions must have occurred without the help of enzymes. 

Clay increases the rate of polymerization in these ways:
*Monomers bind to charged sites between close clay layers, concentrating amino acids and other monomers
*Metal ions at binding sites in clay catalyze dehydration reactions
*The clays provide more stable conditions for the formation of molecules. 

Functions of RNA in polymerization:
*There is a type of RNA called a ribozyme that can catalyze its own replication. This may be very crucial to the origin of RNA and DNA and therefore for the beginning of life.

'''D.1.4 Discuss the possible role of RNA as the first molecule capable of replicating.'''

* Protobionts, or aggregates of abiotically produced molecules, accumulate organic materials like polypeptides from the environment. However, they probably do not possess a mechanism for replicating their particular characteristics so life cannot start. However, an information storage mechanism like RNA would allow them to pass on their characteristics. RNA probably preceded DNA, as DNA is too complex of a molecule to have formed in early protobionts. Short strands of RNA, perhaps most importantly the RNA called ribozymes, could have copied themselves and could have catalysed other reactions. They could then align nucleotides according to a certain pattern when bound to clay. Thus RNA could be replicated and passed on. This is supported by the fact that RNA plays an important role in genetic control in cell life today.

'''D.1.5 Discuss a possible origin of membranes and prokaryotic cells.'''

* Living cells may have been preceded by protobionts, aggregates (groups) of abiotically produced molecules. To form life they need to compartmentalise themselves from the surrounding water.
*Some protobionts in the presence of  lipids form a molecular bilayer (liposome) around the protobiont droplet when shaken. This resembles the lipid bilayer of modern cells. The liposomes can break, reform and merge with others and mix their contents. Within these droplets reactions could be catalysed and RNA could replicate itself.
*The most successful liposomes at surviving would pass on their characteristics and develop into early prokaryotes.

'''D.1.6 Discuss the endosymbiotic theory for the origin of eukaryotes.'''

* Eukaryotic cells were probably symbiotic groupings of prokaryotic cells with smaller species living within larger prokaryotes. The endosymbiotic theory focuses on the origins of chloroplasts and mitochondria.
*The ancestors of these organisms (photosynthetic prokaryotes like algae or respiring bacteria) originally entered the host cell as undigested prey or internal parasites. Normally the invaders would be digested but in this case they were not.
*The host cell would allow them to live and exploit these orginisms provide food and energy. Those which absorbed prokaryotes which became chloroplast and mitochdria formed plants, those without the chloroplasts became animal cells.
*The evidence that supports this theory is:
** Mitochondria and chloroplasts have bacteria-like RNA and ribosomes (70S as opposed to 80S in eukaryote cytoplasms) that enable them to make their own proteins and divide independently of the host cell.
** Mitochondria and chloroplasts both have double membranes, the inner one probably that of the original cell, and the outer that which was created when the cell was absorbed.
**Thylakoids resemble structures found in blue-green bacteria.
**Chloroplasts and mitochondria have naked DNA like prokaryotes.
**Chlorophyll a is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
**Christae in mitochondria resemble mesosomes in bacteria.

== Option D.2 Origin of Species ==

'''D.2.1 Outline Lamarck's theory of evolution by the inheritance of acquired characteristics.'''

* Lamarcks theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics states that the modifications an organism acquired during its lifetime could be passed along to its offspring. The common idea is that if a giraffe stretches up to reach high leaves, it can pass a long neck onto its offspring.

'''D.2.2 Discuss the mechanism of, and lack of evidence for, the inheritance of acquired characteristics.'''

* There is no evidence that acquired characteristics can be inherited. Characteristics that can be passed on are in your genes. If you are not born with genes programming for certain characteristics, you cannot pass down characteristics acquired during your lifetime as these characteristics do not reach sex cells. Example: if you cut off the tails of mice, their offspring will still have tails.

'''D.2.3 Explain the Darwin-Wallace theory of evolution by natural selection.'''

*Populations tend to produce more offspring than an environment can support but populations tend to remain constant
*There is a struggle for survival among organisms in a species with varied characteristics
*Those individuals which are best adapted to their environments are most likely to survive
*Only these pass on their positive characteristics in the form of genes to their offspring who also survive

*While on his Beagle voyages, Darwin became intrigued with the different types of finches found in the Galapagos. All the species of birds were very similar, just like a species on the mainland of South America but between the islands they differed in size and beak shape. Darwin found that the birds fed on different types of food. Their beaks were adapted to eat different types of leaves, worms and seeds and other types of diets. Darwin explained all his observations and thoughts about the origin of species by the concept of &quot;natural selection&quot;. This theory states that great diversity in a species ensures that some members of a population will be more suited to their environment than others. These individuals will be more likely to live long enough to reproduce and pass on their well-suited genes. Therefore, because those that are best suited (the food on an island) are the ones who have the most children, a population will, over time, adapt itself to its environment. The change in the frequency of characteristics (genes) in a population with a common gene pool is evolution.

'''D.2.4 Discuss other theories for the origin of species including special creation and panspermia.'''

* Panspermia is the theory which suggests that life arose elsewhere in the universe and travelled to Earth through space in comets or meteors. Special creation states that a creator(s) formed life directly.

'''D.2.5 Discuss the evidence for all these theories and the applicability of the scientific method for further investigation.'''

*Panspermia - Organic compounds and amino acids have been recovered from modern meteorites. This theory is not incompatible with evolution, which would have occurred once life reached Earth. The theory could be tested in the future by looking for life similar to our own beyond Earth but space travel is not yet sufficiently developed.

*Special Creation - most of the evidence for this theory is found in religious faith. There is no real scientific evidence for this theory other than a lack of evidence for alternate theories. The theory cannot be falsified (contradicted) by observations, unlike evolution and panspermia. However, some believe that more and more evidence is being found that points towards creation by a divine being.

*The Lamarckian theory also lacks any evidence in its favour.

*Evolution fits with commonly held facts and is supported with sufficient amounts of evidence discussed in D.3.  It operates based on well understood processes and laws of nature that have not been contradicted by any current observations, and thus is the preferred theory.

== Option D.3 Evidence for Evolution ==

'''D.3.1 Describe the evidence for evolution as shown by the geographical distribution of living organisms, including the distribution of placental, marsupial and monotreme animals.'''

*The two northern continents are only separated by a small sea, the Bering Straight which has been crossable at times in the past. They have very similar mammal life. The three southern continents have been far more isolated from one another and show far greater variety of mammal life.
*Looking at the way in which continents have drifted over time and examining the fossils in them we can map out the development of different sorts of mammals. Monotremes and marsupials developed in Gondwanaland 165mya before the three southern continents were separated. Placental mammals (developed life young) developed later 135mya and replaced almost all of the monotremes (egg laying mammals) and marsupials (undeveloped young born into pouches) in the other continents.
* Australia was separated from the other continents so animals there could no longer mate with animals from other continents and Australian animals could not travel elsewhere. This is why marsupials and monotremes are now found only on Australia. Monotremes and marsupials have evolved to fit the niches within the Australian environment and there are no placental mammals. This is simply because of geography not because Australia is unfit for placental mammals. These observations and other similar examples are expected under the theory of evolution.

'''D.3.2 Outline how remains of past living organisms have been preserved.'''

*Study of past evolution - phylogeny
*Sand eroded from the land is first carried by rivers, seas, swamps where the particles settle to the bottom. These deposits pile up and compress the older sediments into rock. Dead organisms are swept into seas and swamps then settle to the bottom with the sediments. When the sediments turn to rock under pressure the hard parts of the animal may remain as fossils. Minerals also leach into the soft parts of the organism, leaving a petrified cast of its shape within the rock.
*Fossils can also be stored in:
**Resins, which become amber
**Frozen in ice or snow
**In acid peat in which they cannot decay

'''D.3.3 Outline the method for dating rocks and fossils using radioisotopes, with reference to 14C and 40K.'''

* Fossils contain isotopes of elements that accumulated in the living organisms. If the isotopes are unstable, they will lose protons and break down over time. Since each radioactive isotope has a fixed half-life it can be used to date fossils based on the relative concentrations of the reactant and product of the decay. Half life is the amount of time it takes for half of a sample of a certain substance to break down. Carbon-14 has a half life of 5000 years so useful or dating fossils less than 100,000 years old. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billions years so useful for long-term dating. Error of less than 10%.

'''D.3.4 Define half-life.'''

* Half-life - The number of years it takes for 50% of a sample to decay.

'''D.3.5 Deduce the approximate age of materials based on a simple decay curve for a radioisotope.'''

* Look on the graph at how many times the concentration of the original isotope has halved then multiply that by the half-life.

'''D.3.6 Outline the palaeontogical evidence for evolution using one example.'''

*The existence of the many fossils similar but different to current species is expected under evolution.
*The Acanthostega fossil shows an amphibian from 365mya which has eight fingers and seven toes so is different from current organisms. It has four legs and a backbone like mammals, reptiles and amphibians but also a fish like tail and gills. It lived in water. It is a ‘missing link’ fossil demonstrating an intermediate point in evolution between current amphibians and fish.
* In the horse, the number of toes they have has been reduced from four to one. A succession of fossils from the horse ancestor with four toes to a modern horse with one toe shows a trend towards reduced number of toes. 
*A clear progression of species is visible in the fossil record over time, from bacteria, to simple water based organisms, to amphibians, to insects, to reptiles and finally to mammals.

'''D.3.7 Explain the biochemical evidence provided by the universality of DNA and protein structures for the common ancestry of living organisms.'''
* All living organisms have DNA, use the same 20 amino acids and use left, not right handed amino acids. This suggests that all life forms had a common ancestor which did the same.
*To determine further relationships between organisms, comparing DNA and protein structure can be helpful. DNA Match two single stranded DNA from different species and see how tightly the DNA from one species can bind to DNA from another species. The tighter the bond the greater the similarity and the more closely related the species.
*Most fundamental enzymes present in most living creatures have a similar amino acid structure.

'''D.3.8 Explain how variations in specific molecules can indicate phylogeny.'''
* Proteins are genetically determined. Thus a close match in the amino acid sequence of two proteins from different species indicates that the genes in those proteins evolved from a common gene present in a shared ancestor.

'''D.3.9 Discuss how biochemical variations can be used as an evolutionary clock.'''
*Mutations are random changes in gene structure but they occur at a roughly predictable rate. In general the more differences between the amino acid sequence of a common protein, the further in the past two species had a common ancestor. For example, the haemoglobin of gorillas only differs by one amino acid from human haemoglobin whereas elephant haemoglobin differs from human haemoglobin by 26 amino acids. Therefore elephants separated as a species from a common ancestor with humans longer ago then did gorillas. Information like this can help to group organisms in trees of descent and suggest how long ago they had a common gene pool.
* First, check a specific protein and know that mutations occur at a certain rate. Count how many mutations there are in that specific protein and then calculate how many years the organism has evolved. For example, if there are 10 mutations and mutations occur every 5,000 years in this protein - 10 times 5,000 = 50,000 years.

'''D.3.10 Explain the evidence for evolution provided by homologous anatomical structures, including vertebrate embryos and the pentadactyl limb.'''

* Evolutionary transitions leave signs in fossil records in terms of descent with modifications.
*Homologous anatomical structure is a test for common ancestry. Descent with modification is evident in anatomical similarities between species grouped in the same taxonomical category. For example, the forelimbs of mammals have been modified to fit their function. However similarities in these structures demonstrate that they all originate from a common ancestor.
*A pentadactyl limb describes the same skeletal elements that make up the forelimbs of humans, cats, whales, bats and all other mammals. They have evolved for different functions but the relationships between the bones in the limb are all remarkably similar.
*Even distantly related organisms go through similar stages in their embryonic development. Many of them cannot be told apart in the embryonic stage despite looking entirely different as adults. All vertebrate embryos go through a stage in which they have gill pouches on the sides of their throats. This is all easily explained by evolution.

'''D.3.11 Outline two modern examples of observed evolution. One example must be the changes to the size and shape of the beaks of Galapagos finches.'''

*In 1981 the finch Geospiza fortis had a short, wide beak and had a diet of mostly large, hard seeds. In 1982-3 there was an el Niño event which brought much rain and meant that the vegetation changed and over the next 5 years there were far more soft small fruits. The population boomed because of the rains and increase in food then dropped back when the rains stopped. By 1987 they had longer, narrower beaks than they had before because those beaks helped the birds to survive the population cutback after the rains.
*In industrial areas of Europe in 1960 more ladybugs showed the black melanic colour allele. The black absorbs more light, and so the black ones have an advantage staying warm when sunlight levels are low. After 1960 as smog levels decreased the proportion of black ladybugs decreased proportionally and both smog and black butterflies reached constant low levels from 1980. Instead they were replaced with a red colour which warned off predators and was more effective at improving survival.

== Option D.4 Human Evolution ==

'''D.4.1 State the full classification of human beings from kingdom to sub-species.'''

* Kingdom - Animalia

* Phylum - Chordata

* Class - Mammalia

* Order - Primata

* Family - Hominidae

* Genus - Homo

* Species - Homo sapiens

* subspecies - H. s. sapiens

'''D.4.2 Describe the major physical features, such as the adaptations for tree life, that define humans as primates.'''

* Shoulder joints that allow movement in 3 dimension
*Dexterous hands with opposable thumb and long fingers
*Sensitive fingers with nails
*Eyes closer together in front of the face for enhanced depth perception, excellent eye-hand coordination
*Shoulder joints and skull modified for upright posture
*Parental care with usually single births and long nurturing of offspring.

'''D.4.3 Discuss the anatomical and biochemical evidence which suggests that humans are a bipedal and neotenous species of African ape that spread to colonize new areas.'''

* Humans, like apes, care for their young for a long time. Offspring also have delayed puberty.
*Humans show more physical similarities with young apes than mature ones, so we may be neotenous – have evolved to retain juvenile ape characteristics.
* Humans and apes have dexterous hands and similar hips and muscles.
*98% of human and chimpanzee DNA is exactly the same.
*Fossils have been found of intermediate species in the evolution of humans from apes.

'''D.4.4 Outline the trends illustrated by the fossils of Australopithecus including A. afarensis, A. africanus and A. robustis and Homo including H. habilis, H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens.'''

A. afarensis: 3 - 3.9 million years – ape-like face

A. africanus: 2.3 - 3 million years – flatter face, larger molars for plant based diet


A. robustus: 1.4 - 2.2 million years – very large molars, bones and skull

H. habilis: 1.6 - 2.4 million years – smaller teeth and jaw for meatier diet, first with tools, size like humans

H. erectus: .4 - 1.8 million years – more complex tools so meat significant part of diet and changed teeth.

H. neanderthensis .5 million years – larger brains and bones, larger teeth and jaw, shorter limbs for the cold

H. sapiens: .1 million years – large brain, flat face, reduced teeth, reduced robustness, chin

*Enlargement of brain and taller and more erect structure.
*The spike connection to the skull becomes more central to balance centre of gravity.
*Pelvis changes to support organs in walking.
*Pelvis shorter and broader to attach walking muscles.
*Legs become stronger and longer while arms become shorter and weaker.
*Knee can now be fully straightened.
*Foot forms more of a platform and rigid shape without opposable toe.

'''D.4.5 Discuss the possible ecology of these species and the ecological changes that may have prompted their origin.'''

* The climate of Africa became drier with thin woodland instead of forests. The depletion of forests encouraged a ground-adapted species that could move on land for long distances and who could carry scattered food. Thus, the adaptation of a bipedal human.
*Later Africa became much cooler and there was mostly savanna. This may have prompted the evolution of the Homo genus which used tools and group work to hunt large animals for food.

'''D.4.6 Discuss the incompleteness of the fossil record and the resulting uncertainties with respect to human evolution.'''

* The fossil record of human ancestry is incomplete and thus we cannot certainly determine when certain species originated and became extinct.
* early fossil record is fragmented and scarce because: they were not buried, many killed by predators so bones were spread and few died in location where they would be preserved
* as there are ‘missing links’ it can not be ensured that the hypothesised evolution of hominids is accurate

'''D.4.7 Discuss the origin and consequences of bipedalism and increase in brain size.'''

* Bipedalism - had to adapt to living on the ground and be able to look for food over longer distances. 
*Allowed carrying of food and water and looking over brush.
*The increase in brain size allowed the production of tools. This allowed us to hunt larger animals for meat, changing the diet and the teeth structure towards smaller molars.
*Language becomes possible.
*We learned to limit the environment's influence (e.g. clothing, fire and housing).
*This comes at the cost of a longer development period and greater energy use by the brain.

'''D.4.8 Outline the difference between genetic and cultural evolution.'''

* Cultural evolution are changes in the behaviour of a species, for example, what tools they use, as where they live, the things they eat etc.
*Genetic evolution is changes in the genetic makeup of a species.
*Cultural evolution has spanned millions of years in three major stages: the nomadic (hunting), agricultural (settled), and industrial ages. However, we have not changed biologically in any significant way. We are probably not any more intelligent than the cave men. Our increased ability is due to the past experience we draw on.

'''D.4.9 Discuss the relative importance of genetic and cultural evolution in the evolution of humans.'''

*Evolution of the brain allowed cultural evolution to take off. Since then cultural evolution has been able to change humans far more quickly than genetic evolution has.  Human behaviour and life has changed greatly without much genetic evolution at all. We are now able to change our environment instead of changing to suit our environment.  However, recent reseach (Voight and Kudaravalli, et al., 2006) indicates humans are in fact evolving under selective environmental pressures based on genetic analysis.

== Option D.5 Neo-Darwinism ==
'''D.5.1 State that mutations are changes to genes or chromosomes due to chance, but with predictable frequencies.'''

* Mutations are changes to genes or chromosomes due to chance, but with predictable frequencies.

'''D.5.2 Outline phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic fibrosis as examples of gene mutation, and Klinefelter's syndrome as an example of chromosome mutation.'''

* PKU is caused by a gene mutation that ruins the protein that breaks down the amino acid phenylalanine. It is caused by many possible recessive alleles all at very low frequencies. This causes toxic levels of this amino acid in the blood, which causes mental retardation and death.
*Most instances of cystic fibrosis are caused by a specific mutation on a recessive allele. The mutation changes and amino acid and ruins the body’s protein that moves chloride ions in epithelial cells. A lot of thick mucus builds up inside airways, which leads to infection. Untreated, most children will die by age 5.
*Klinefelter's syndrome results from an extra X chromosome due to trisomy (non-disjunction). Thus a person has an XXY pattern of sex chromosomes. Such a person has male sex organs but low testosterone, reduced male characteristic and abnormally small testes. Not significant in evolution as all are sterile. 

'''D.5.3 Explain that variation in a population results from the recombination of alleles during meiosis and fertilisation.'''

* Meiosis includes independent assortment of different alleles and also crossing over. These two processes make the total possible gene combinations from an individual very large and produce considerable variation in sexual reproduction by mixing up genes in new combinations.
*In fertilisation the genes of two members of a species are mixed, increasing variation further.

'''D.5.4 State that adaptations (or micro-evolutionary steps) may occur as the result of an allele frequency increasing in a population over a period of time.'''

'''D.5.5 Describe how the evolution of one species into another species involves the accumulation of many advantageous alleles in the gene pool of a population over a period of time.'''
*Evolution involves the change in heritable traits of a population over successive generations, as determined by shifts in allele frequencies of genes
*Over time this results in speciation

'''D.5.6 State that a species is a potentially interbreeding population having a common gene pool.'''

* A species is a potentially interbreeding population having a common gene pool. 
* A gene pool is all the genes in an interbreeding population.

'''D.5.7 Discuss the definition of the term species.'''

*Most species are identified by their physical characteristics alone, but sometimes these are not sufficient.
* Accurately, a species is a groups of organism that are potentially interbreeding and produce fertile offspring. They have a common gene pool and are reproductively isolated from other such groups.
*This definition is somewhat ambiguous, but the main defining factor is the ability to produce fertile offspring. This is why donkeys and horses are different species. They produce mules when they breed, but because their chromosomes don't match completely, mules are infertile.
**However, some species that are clearly different can interbreed and produce hybrids, like some ducks and plants.
**Species which reproduce asexually cannot be classified in this way.
**Fossils cannot be classified this way as we do not know how they bred.
**Some species are almost identical physically but cannot interbreed like the Pipistrelle bat in Britain.
**Ring species like the herring gulls and lesser black backed gulls around the Arctic circle are able to interbreed with the population adjacent to them, but not with those further around the circle.

'''D.5.8 Discuss the process of speciation in terms of migration, geographical or ecological isolation and adaptation, leading to reproductive or genetic isolation of gene pools.'''

* As organisms become separated geographically and cannot breed (their gene pools do not mix) these organisms become different enough to be unable to breed. Such organisms have become different species.
* Differences between two populations that have been geographically or ecologically isolated are caused by natural selection. Such speciation usually occurs because of genetic variation. They have different habitats to evolve to, so they evolve differently, and eventually become so different that they cannot breed. Then, even if they are not geographically isolated, they are reproductively or genetically isolated. 

'''D.5.9 Discuss ideas on the pace of evolution including gradualism and punctuated equilibrium.'''

*Gradualism suggests that evolutionary change occurs at a constant slow rate.
*Punctuated equilibrium implies long periods with no change and short periods with rapid evolution.
*The latter is gaining popularity as being more important than once thought. Volcanic eruptions and meteor impacts and climate changes speed up evolution at certain times as they create rapid changes in the environment which require rapid adaptation to survive. Only certain species will survive and evolve. For example, when the Dinosaurs died, there was a sudden punctuation in the evolutionary path of all other organisms because they were now able to adapt to fill newly available niches.

== Option D.6 The Hardy-Weinberg Principle ==
Only Higher Level

'''D.6.1 Describe an adaptation in terms of the change in frequency of a gene's alleles.'''

* If an allele increases the chances of survival and reproduction of individuals that possess it, the frequency of the allele in the gene pool will tend to increase.
*If a moth inherits an allele of a gene that would make it bright pink in a dark brown environment - it would stand out in its environment and be eaten. This would cause the bright pink allele to decline in frequency. 

'''D.6.2 Explain how the Hardy-Weinberg equation (p squared + 2pq +q squared = 1) is derived.'''

* In a population where two alleles occur, p represents the frequency of the dominant allele and q the frequency of the recessive allele. Thus the combined frequency of the alleles must account for 100% of the genes for that particular locus in the population.
      p + q = 1

*When gametes combine their alleles to form zygotes, the probability of AA (A being the dominant allele) is p squared. The probability of aa is q squared. There are two ways in which an Aa genotype can arise, depending on which parent contributes the dominant allele. Thus, the frequency of heterozygous individuals is 2pq. The frequency of genotypes must add to 1. Thus,
      p² + 2pq + q² = 1
      AA +  Aa + aA + aa = 1

'''D.6.3 Calculate allele, genotype and phenotype frequencies for two alleles of a gene, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation.'''

* If a population is known to be following the Hardy-Weinberg Principle, the Hardy-Weinberg can be used to calculate unknown frequencies. An example of this is a gene in which two alleles controls the ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). The ability to taste PTC is due to the dominant allele (T) and non-tasting is due to the recessive allele (t).

      1600 people were tested in a survey. 461 were non-tasters - a frequency of 0.288.
      Their genotype was homozygous recessive (tt).
      If q = frequency of t allele, q squared = .288 so q = .537
      If p = frequency of T allele, p = (1 - q) = .463
      The frequency of homozygous dominants (TT) and heterozygotes (Tt) can be calculated.
      p squared = frequency of homozygous dominants
      p squared = (.463)(.463) = .214
      2pq = frequency of heterozygotes
      2pq = 2 (.463)(.537) = .497 

'''D.6.4 State that the Hardy-Weinberg principle can also be used to calculate allele, genotype and phenotype frequencies for genes with two alleles.'''

* The Hardy-Weinberg principle can also be used to calculate allele, genotype and phenotype frequencies for genes with two alleles. 

'''D.6.5 State the Hardy-Weinberg principle and the conditions under which it applies.'''

* If there are two alleles of a gene in a population, there are three possible genotypes - homozygous for each of the two alleles and heterozygous. The frequency of the two alleles in the population is usually represented by the letters p and q. The total frequency of the alleles in the population is 1.0, so
      p + q = 1
If there is random mating in a population, the chance of inheriting two copies of the first of the two alleles is (p)(p). The chance of inheriting two copies of the second of the two alleles is (q)(q). The expected frequency of the heterozygous genotype is 2pq. The sum of
      p² + 2pq + q² = 1 

* If gene frequencies change, then evolution occurs

'''D.6.6 Describe one example of transient polymorphism and sickle cell anemia as an example of balanced polymorphism.'''

* Polymorphism is when two or more forms of a phenotype are represented in high enough frequencies to be readily noticeable.
* A balanced polymorphism is a polymorphism in which the frequencies of the characteristics remain fairly constant over time. For example, the recessive allele for sickle cell anemia is very damaging when it is present in the homozygous recessive form because the person only has sickle shaped red blood cells. However, in the heterozygous form, it protects the person from malaria. That is why it continues to exist instead of being bred out. In populations exposed to malaria it will increase in the population until the homozygous recessive form becomes too common. Then it will remain at a balanced frequency.
*A transient polymorphism is one that is changing in frequency over time. For example, if a population with a high incidence of the sickle cell anemia gene moves to a location where malaria is no longer present the gene will begin to disappear because the selective pressure in its favour has disappeared but the pressure against it (the homozygous form) continues. Over time its frequency will fall.

:No problem, it's not an urgent task. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 11:49, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
----
I don't think you have to insert such note in your images. Look f.e. at [[:Image:Ginger-smoothbody.png]]. There is &quot;File history&quot; section and everyone can see, who's the author, so you don't need to write it. If you want to add some information about yourself, write it on your user page.

The second thing: CC-BY-SA is a good licence, but unfortunately, it's incompatibile with GFDL. The best soution is either dual-licensing ({{tl|GFDL}} + {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}}) or using {{tl|cc-by-2.5}}. You can also use {{tl|PD-self}}, but I understand that not everyone is keen to release his work to public domain ;-)

If you want to be able to change description of all of your images at once, you can make a template like {{tl|Darkonc/ImageCopyright}} and insert license and you notes there. But, as I said before, I don't think you need it --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 20:35, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Lat4.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Lat4.jpg]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator.

== All your uploaded images were deleted ==

All the images you uploaded without license information in 2005 were deleted. You and the other authors of [[Diagnostic Radiology]] were given amply opportunity to either provide license information or find alternative images. The redlinks in [[Diagnostic Radiology]] were left behind as placeholders so you know what images are missing and where they go. Hopefully you'll be able to use that information to find alternatives.

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Chrismo. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Chrismo~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This template serves as a page-header template for the [[Circuit Theory]] book. This template should appear at the top of every page in that book. It automatically includes the host page in [[:Category:Circuit Theory]]. This template changes shape for the [[Circuit Theory/All Chapters|Print Version]] of the circuit theory book. In the print version, the template appears only as two horizontal lines. Also, through some CSS, this template forces a page break before itself, so that each page starts on a fresh printed page.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Before we begin==
{{TOC right}}
We quickly review the set-theoretic concept of Cartesian product here. This definition might be slightly more generalized than what you're used to.

==Cartesian Product==
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; be an indexed set, and let &lt;math&gt;X_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; be a set for each &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;b&gt;Cartesian product&lt;/b&gt; of each &lt;math&gt;X_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\prod_{\lambda \in \Lambda}X_\lambda = \{x:\Lambda\rightarrow\bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} X_{\lambda} | x(\lambda) \in X_\lambda\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

==Example==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_\lambda = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\prod_{\lambda \in \Lambda} X_\lambda = \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N} = \{x: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \mid x(n) \in \mathbb{R}\, \forall\, n \in \mathbb{N}\} = \{(x_1, x_2, \ldots) \mid x_n \in \mathbb{R}\, \forall\, n \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

==Product Topology==
Using the Cartesian product, we can now define products of topological spaces.

===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;X_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The &lt;b&gt;product topology&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{\lambda \in \Lambda} X_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the topology with base elements of the form &lt;math&gt;\prod_{\lambda \in \Lambda} U_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_\lambda = X_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for all but a finite number of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;U_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is open.

==Examples==
* Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_\lambda = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual topology. Then the basic open sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;  have the form &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \times (c,d)&lt;/math&gt;:
[[Image:Opensetusual.jpg]]

* Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_\lambda = R_l&lt;/math&gt; (The Sorgenfrey topology). Then the basic open sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; are of the form &lt;math&gt;[a,b)\times [a,b)&lt;/math&gt;:

==Okra &amp; Mysterious Ingredient==
Not sure what you mean 'claiming to be a gumbo sans okra'? Most gumbos don't have okra but some do.  My vote, and most from Lousiana would say gumbo is more soup than stew. For what its worth. How do you get that entry attribution after your comment? Is it automatic? (user [[User:Tchoup|Tchoup]], unsigned)

I'll have to ask a co-worker from there. Currently, the recipe suggests a mysterious ingredient that I believe has been banned by the FDA as a poison. (cancer or kidney problems if I remember right) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:48, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

You sign comments with 4 tilde ('~') characters in a row. On a qwerty keyboard, look to the left of the exclamation point. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:48, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

I am from Lousiana. Filé, made from Sassafras root is your mysterious ingredient. The research is debatable, cancer inlarge doses in rats. In any case, the base of gumbo is the trinity and a roux (dark or light/oil or butter). Okra, or any other ingredient is just a style of gumbo. Seafood, okra, etc. File, as well, and it is only added to one's bowl. Never to the gumbo. I made the original entry for this gumbo. Pretty exciting. I no longer feel I can change it though. Who am I to make changes to something like a recipe.[[User:Tchoup|Tchoup]] 11:06, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

: As far as I can remember, I've never heard of a gumbo without okra, because okra is gumbo.  That's where the name comes from, that's how you know it's a gumbo.  Course, being Canadian, my views of food are bias towards how I've been taught foods are supposed to be and I've never been served a gumbo by an actual cajun.  Gumbos I've seen boarder between the definitions of soup and stew that I know, stews being the thicker, simpler, slow cooked, less spiced and more ingredient-flavour based meals and soups being lighter, spiced and a side dish.  The gumbo I've had was not so think but not really spiced and didn't really take any definate, &quot;oh, that's X,&quot; kind of feel to it.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 04:40, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

: Originally, the name did come from it being a soup of gumbo (okra), but it obviously has taken on another meaning. Agree about file only being added to the bowl -- it's just wrong to add it to the entire soup! File is also only used in gumbo without okra (i.e. chicken and andouille); okra itself is the thickener in gumbo. [[User:Alainna|Alainna]] 05:21, 26 November 2006 (UTC) 

Should I create a different page for seafood gumbo and gumbo z'herbes? [[User:Alainna|Alainna]] 05:21, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

Filé powder is made from sassafrass ''leaves'', not the roots. The leaves do not contain significant amounts of the carcinogenic [[w:en:safrole|safrole]]. And as a long-time neighbor of Louisiana who has eaten many gallons of gumbo, I can say that okra is not a necessary or even preferred ingredient. -- [[User:66.25.244.7|66.25.244.7]] 07:36, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

== List of Ingredients ==
Am amused to see that a recipe for gumbo that duly mentions okra in the intro and has plenty discussions re here on the talk page '''does not have okra listed in the ingredients''' for the recipe! [[User:OoEtMePasty|OoEtMePasty]] ([[User talk:OoEtMePasty|talk]]) 15:16, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
:Same for chicken stock, which the recipe first stipulates, never to mention it again.  I'm sorry, this recipe sucks, please fix ASAP! [[User:Maikel|Maikel]] ([[User talk:Maikel|talk]]) 00:37, 29 April 2008 (UTC)

==Rant==
I've moved this unwikified edit here from the &quot;Notes&quot; segment of the article:&lt;br&gt;
''Experiment with onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, black pepper, white pepper, bay leaves, even cumin.  Gumbo is NEVER about recipes.  Look in your fridge, there is something thats will go bad in the next couple of days.  Throw it in the gumbo, trust me.  You will never learn to make &quot;for real&quot; gumbo from a recipe.  Experiment!.  Its like our music, improvisation is the ideal, not some perfect recipe.  Sometimes, when you are young, your gumbo won't always be awesome, but when you get to be 30 or 40, you will be able to create a bitchin' gumbo anywhere in the world from available ingredients.  Please, experiment.  Down here, we argue all the time about what a proper gumbo is.  Put in some potatoes or tomatoes or carrots (To represent the Irish and Spanish!).  Potatoes in particular will soak up the flavor of the gumbo.  By the way, the cooking time of the gumbo listed above as one hour is ridiculous.  Gumbo should cook for at least 3 to 4 hours.  TRUST ME!''

===Resistors===

Mechanical engineers seem to model everything with a spring. Electrical engineers compare everything to a '''Resistor'''. Resistors are circuit elements that resist the flow of current. When this is done a voltage appears across the resistor's two wires.

A pure [[:w:Resistor|resistor]] turns electrical energy into heat. Devices similar to resistors turn this energy into light, motion, heat, and other forms of energy. 

[[Image:Resistor.png|center]]

Current in the drawing above is shown entering the + side of the resistor. Resistors don't care which leg is connected to positive or negative. The + means where the positive or red probe of the volt meter is to be placed in order to get a positive reading. This is called the &quot;[[:w:Electric_current#Conventions|positive charge]]&quot; flow sign convention. Some circuit theory classes (often within a physics oriented curriculum) are taught with an &quot;electron flow&quot; sign convention.

In this case, current entering the + side of the resistor means that the resistor is removing energy from the circuit. This is good. The goal of most circuits is to send energy out into the world in the form of motion, light, sound, etc.

===Resistance===

'''[[:Wikipedia:Electrical resistance|Resistance]]''' is measured in terms of units called &quot;Ohms&quot; (volts per ampere), which is commonly abbreviated with the Greek letter &amp;Omega; (&quot;Omega&quot;). Ohms are also used to measure the quantities of ''impedance'' and ''reactance'', as described in a later chapter. The variable most commonly used to represent resistance is &quot;r&quot; or &quot;R&quot;.

Resistance is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;r = {\rho L \over A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;rho; is the resistivity of the material, L is the length of the resistor, and A is the cross-sectional area of the resistor.

===Conductance===

'''Conductance''' is the inverse of resistance. Conductance has units of &quot;Siemens&quot; (S), sometimes referred to as mhos (ohms backwards, abbreviated as an upside-down &amp;Omega;). The associated variable is &quot;G&quot;:

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{1}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Before calculators and computers, conductance helped [[:w:Smith chart|reduce]] the number of hand calculations that had to be done. Now conductance and it's related concepts of [[:wikipedia:Admittance|admittance]] and susceptance can be skipped with matlab, octave, wolfram alpha and other computing tools. Learning one or more these computing tools is now absolutely necessary in order to get through this text.

===Resistor terminal relation===
[[Image:Ohmslawvoltagesource.png|right|framed|A simple circuit diagram relating current, voltage, and resistance]]

The drawing on the right is of a battery and a resistor. Current is leaving the + terminal of the battery. This means this battery is turning chemical potential energy into electromagnetic potential energy and dumping this energy into the circuit. The flow of this energy or power is negative. 

Current is entering the positive side of the resistor even though a + has not been put on the resistor. This means electromagnetic potential energy is being converted into heat, motion, light, or sound depending upon the nature of the resistor. Power flowing out of the circuit is given a positive sign.

The relationship of the voltage across the resistor V, the current through the resistor I and the value of the resistor R is related by [[:wikiversity:Ohm%27s_law|ohm's law]]:

{{eqn|Resistor Terminal Relation}}
:&lt;math&gt;V=R*I&lt;/math&gt;


A resistor, capacitor and inductor all have only two wires attached to them. Sometimes it is hard to tell them apart. In the real world, all three have a bit of resistance, capacitance and inductance in them. In this unknown context, they are called two terminal devices. In more complicated devices, the wires are grouped into [[:wikipedia:Two-port_network|ports]]. A two terminal device that expresses Ohm's law when current and voltage are applied to it, is called a resistor.

===Resistor Safety===
Resistors come in all forms. Most have a maximum power rating in watts. If you put too much through them, they can melt, catch fire, etc.
Resistance is an electrical passive element which oppose the flow of electricity.

===Example===
Suppose the voltage across a resistor's two terminals is 10 volts and the measured current through it is 2 amps. What is the resistance? 

If &lt;math&gt; v=iR &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; R = v/i = 10V/2A = 5 ohms&lt;/math&gt;</text>

Simultaneous action is designated by replacing the &quot;〜ます&quot; ending of the polite present positive tense of the first verb with &quot;〜ながら&quot;. The tense is then determined by the latter verb. Both actions should be performed by the same person.

Those more comfortable thinking in terms of the dictionary form can see this as adding &quot;〜ながら&quot; to the stem of vowel-stem verbs, or the い-row of consonant-stem verbs (e.g. 飲む -&gt; 飲みながら example below).
The irregular verbs are also put in the い-row making them identical to the consontant-stem verbs.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;sentece start&gt; || &lt;vowel-stem verb stem&gt; || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | ながら &lt;second verb&gt;
|-
| &lt;consonant-stem verb stem in い-row&gt;

The tense of the sentence is given with the second verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Suitability for those new-to-Radians==

This page in its current form is unsuitable for anyone new to radians.  It does not explain why we would want to use radians (admittedly a difficult sell at this stage, with no calculus).  Also I have never seen the crazy &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\theta^c&lt;/math&gt; notation. [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 21:04, 27 October 2010 (UTC)

== Picture is wrong==
It is obvious that the picture of an angle of 1 radian doesn't really show a 1 radian angle.[[User:130.89.219.179|130.89.219.179]] 15:46, 5 October 2005 (UTC)


==Keeping the Units Right==
I changed the formulas for converting, because I didn't understand them. Let's look at an example:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta=60^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Now converting, using the original formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta^\circ \frac {\pi}{180}=(60^\circ)^\circ \frac {\pi}{180} = (\frac {\pi}{30})^{\circ\circ}&lt;/math&gt;

Let's try it another way:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha =\theta^\circ = 60^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Converting:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta^\circ \frac {\pi}{180}=60^\circ \frac {\pi}{180} = (\frac {\pi}{30})^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

The answer is in degrees!?

Now suppose the answer should be the number of radians. What is the meaning of the degree symbol in the formula?

[[User:130.89.219.179|130.89.219.179]] 16:25, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

When you changed 60 degrees to radians, your formula was wrong.
The part:

Theta*pi/180

is wrong. It is supposed to be 

Theta*pi/180°, so that the degree symbol is eliminated.

Correcting your equation, 

Theta*pi/180°=60° *pi/180°=pi/30

== Centesimal system ==

The principal unit in system is grade and is denoted by (g).One right angle is divided in 100 equal parts,called grades,and each grade is subdivided into 100 minutes,and each minutes,and each minutes into 100  seconds.


IN MATHEMATICAL FORM :
ONE RIGHT ANGLE = 100grade
        1 grade = 100' 
        1'      = 100&quot;.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Benjamin Gatti. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Benjamin Gatti~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

==Cortical face processing==

==Subcortical face processing==
Recent functional imaging, electrophysiological and neuropsychological studies on adults have provided evidence for a fast, low-spatial-frequency (LSF), subcortical face-detection pathway that might also modulate the responses of certain cortical areas to faces and other social stimuli. This route involves the superior colliculus, the pulvinar and the amygdala.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How to Pass a Course}}

Taking notes is an extremely important aspect of studying that is often neglected, despite the fact that it can make the difference between a moderate grade and an excellent one. Taking notes can involve more cognitive or &quot;thought work&quot; than the common alternative of merely highlighting important terms or phrases in a text, but it also produces better learning. Its benefits happen by focusing attention on the material in two ways: initially at the time of reading it, and later at the time of reviewing the notes.

== Why Take Notes? ==
Takings notes provides a person with a way to review material learned. Reviewing and reading notes allows a person a chance to know what is on an exam, test, or pop quiz. One of the more important reasons to take notes, is to create a placemark. This placemark allows the note taker to know when the lecturer stopped giving a lecture for the day.

'''For example:''' ''Did the teacher stop midway between Chapter 10.. or are we on Chapter 11 now?''

In this make-believe situation:
You ''review the notes'' and notice how the ending material of the notes are similar to the material seen before the ending part of Chapter 10. Therefore, you figure the teacher did not lecture on Chapter 11 yet... or else you dazed out really bad the last half of class.

Knowing this gives you a chance to read ahead or study certain materials, and place emphasis on studying a particular section of notes and book reading.

Notes are also a way of reviewing what you have learned in the lecture. During the lecture, a teacher may put emphasis on a particular term or word. These particular terms or words may be found on an oncoming test or quiz. Studying materials on notes gives a person a chance to know what the teacher expects you to know, now that the teacher has presented you with that material.

If the material is on the notes, the teacher expects you to know the material is on the notes. 
: Therefore, there is a good chance the material will be on a test.

== The Voice Recorder ==
Besides the obvious paper and pencil, many technological additions of the past decades allow for someone to take notes with deadly accuracy.

* Digital Voice Recorder
* OR Analog Voice Recorder (recorders that use casette tapes)

These additions save effort (and reduce writers' cramp) at the time of listening to a lecture, but they also have two kinds of limitations. One kind is practical--getting good quality sound (see below for more discussion of this challenge).

Another kind of limitation is the time needed, sooner or later, to listen to recorded notes. Since speech proceeds at a relatively fixed rate, it is hard to do &quot;speed listening&quot; equivalent to &quot;speed reading&quot; of notes that are written. This fact of life puts a premium on abbreviating voice recordings of notes--though it should also be noted that the physical work of writing puts a premium on abbreviating written as well. Since taking notes is work either by writing or by recording, the best advice is to use whichever medium feels most comfortable.

=== Buying a Voice Recorder ===
The voice recorder is essential to any student who wants to take accurate notes. More importantly is a voice recorder with the ability to upload voice files to a computer console. Often when looking into buying a voice recorder, the choice can be complicated and indefinite. Fore, one must buy and try before deciding on one to buy. However, due to the technical limitations provided by manufacturers and stores, reviews and other word of mouth advice seems to be the supplies provided in obtaining a decent voice recorder.

'''Many things should be considered when buying a voice recorder.'''

* How long does the voice recorder record?
: * Can it record for two hours or more?
:: Some classes last two hours and thirty minutes (2:30 hours)
:: A recorder that can record for this long is essential.

* Can the batteries be replaced or do the batteries need to be recharged?
: * What type of batteris does the recorder take?
:: Many devices &quot;eat up&quot; battery electrolytes (power) quickly.
:: Getting a recorder with easy to replace batteries found in common stores is suitable for replenishing the supply of power.

* Can the recordings be saved to a computer?
:: Being able to put files on a computer allows for a person to sort lectures according to dates.

=== Using the Voice Recorder ===
Getting a voice recorder saves a person a lot of time taking notes. If a teacher is mostly lecture, as in, the teacher rarely writes on the chalkboard/whiteboard, then it would be best to get a voice recorder to save your hand from developing arthritis.

==== Positioning inside a Class Room ====
The typical area of a placement is one of the greatest factors to consider when using a voice recorder.
Observation is the key to finding a good place to set the recorder.

If you notice that a teacher does not past a certain line of boundary, say past his or her desk, then you could possibly put the recorder on his or her desk. (ask if you may first)

However, if the teacher walks around the room this creates problems. If a teacher walks past the desk, and his or her back is facing towards the desk, then the teacher's voice will not reach the voice recorder as effective--and the voice may not be recorded at all.

Often placing the recorder one's own desk is suitable if better positioning cannot be found elsewhere.

However, to have a recorder sitting on a desk while jotting down notes can cause interference when voice and other sounds are being recorded. Often the writings and scribbles cause a sound of scratching on the paper which will be picked up on the recorder. At other times, the sound of flipping a page on a binder--to go to the next clean sheet for writing notes--will be picked up on the recorder. Another thing to consider is the sound of the arm moving against a desk, while the hand goes downwards on a sheet of paper, as notes are being written. Often the rubbing sound of an arm against a desk and the hand against the paper will be recorded.

''The remedies recommended for these problems are as follows:''

* Use an inkpen. 
: Inkpens glide on paper. Also, pencil writings tend to fade with time. 
: Pencil is often a bad writing utensil for notes. This is why I suggest an erasable pen.

* Wear long sleeves
: Human skin is like leather at times. Clothing will create less friction on the desk.

* Use an ID card under your hand.
: This is an art technique I learned long ago. It allows the hand to be placed on the ID, as the ID easily slides on paper. Sometimes it works; sometimes it does not.

* Listen carefully to the person giving a lecture.
: I've found that professors at times go off at a tangent. The best thing to do is notice when there is a break in his or her logic being conversated, and quickly flip the page. It is at times best to bring the notebook off the desk, away from the recorder, and then flip the page to reduce recorded noise.

==== Uploading the Files ====
I personally like to upload all files to a computer. 
With one or more file belong to a particular date, say Feb-26-07, I put those files in a computer folder labeled: Feb-26-07
From there, I make a backup copy of the files inside the folders and put them on a CD.

* CD-Drives are more common to find around schools than DVD-Drives. Therefore, a CD is more suitable than a DVD storage medium.

Also, I create a backup of that CD.
* Take the files inside the CD and put those onto a storage medium: considerably another CD.
* After burning a CD, make a backup on a DVD (if possible -- if not, then a CD) and then store that disc somewhere safe. I like to put things in my top dresser drawer. Always make backups of a lecture, this is very important. Backups are gravely important!
* Another thing to consider is if you use a program to listen to the audio files. If you use a program to listen to the audio files, it would be best to find the setup program of that recorder. Take the setup program and put the program on the CD that you will carry around with you. Also, put a copy of the audio listening setup program on the backup to always have the setup program on hand.
* Sometimes the setup programs can be found on the installation CD that comes with a voice recorder.
: Other times, a person could call Technical Help to help them find the program from the Internet and download it.

Never take the original with you!
Always take the Backup.

Take the backup with you around the campus and listen to the audio files at a campus computer when you want to study/review.

==== Uploading with an Analog Recorder ====
This is a guide if someone wishes to create a backup. Otherwise, a person could simply find a safe place to store his or her cassette tape and access when he or she wishes to listen to it.

Make a backup of the cassette tape recording.

Typically one uses the Line Out feature of a recorder and plugs a wire into the Line Out hole.

The wire then extends to the Line In hole of another device (computers, boombox, etc.) and then inserts that part of the wire into the Line In.

(Recorder) Line Out &lt;----&gt; Line In (Boombox)

Typically one pushes play on the analog voice recorder and pushes record on the boombox.
Label the cassette tape with the date of the recording and set that somewhere safe.

You don't technically need to make a backup, however, I always like the idea of making backups.

I could be wrong, if I am, please someone correct this entry.

==== Getting the teacher to repeat something ====

Often times a person in the classroom will cough harshly. Coughs are typically very loud and will block out any voice coming into the recorder. Many times, other students could not hear what the teacher said during the time someone in the class coughed. In consideration, what a person should do is ask the teacher to repeat what he or she said. Do not fear asking the teacher the question, &quot;Could you please repeat that?&quot; because many other students may not have heard the teacher over the other student's sneeze, cough, or disruptive movements.

==== Hybrid Voice Recorder and Note Taking ====

=====With the Chalkboard=====
A method that is very well used when taking notes and using a voice recorder can help a person backtrack and review notes. Often times a teacher will give lectures and write on the board rarely. When a teacher writes on the board, it is best to look at the voice recorder and take note of how much time has expired and write the current recording time on the note page.

For example:

Let's say the teacher has been talking about studies in psychology without writing anything on the board for a while. 

Finally, the teacher writes something on the board. 

* ''Phallic Stage and male idea of swords''

The recorder has been on for about one hour and thirty minutes. The recorder displays (1:30:15) with :15 being 15 seconds.

* Write the time displayed on the notepage. '''(1:30:15)'''
* Then, copy the material on the chalkboard onto the notepage.

=====Without the Chalkboard=====
Sometimes the teacher doesn't even use the chalkboard. However insane that may be, some may not. 
In that situation, a voice recorder would be highly regarded as necessary.

As the teacher talks, you need to find placemarks that help you backtrack to certain parts of the lecture.

For instance, the teacher breaks the class lecture into three parts: 
* Intro to baskets
* how to choose weaving material 
* weaving the basket

Subparts are included, however, he or she does not describe them to you.
Thus, as the lecture goes on, you'll need to find a way to backtrack to certain material that he or she has spoken about.

If you don't want to listen to the whole recording again, it would be wise write that time down. That way, you can backtrack and review that material.

''Let's say the teacher talks about Native American weaving techniques.''
You know this part is going to be on the test.

You look at the voice recorder displaying (1:45:19)

You jot down on your notebook 

* (1:45:19) Native American Techniques.

===Problems with recording Lectures===
There are many disadvantages to using a recorder.  When recording a lecture, one must re-listen to the entire lecture.  This means using another 2 and 1/2 hours.  However, you could use a tape recorder if you intend to re-use a small clip in you're private study.

== Taking notes while reading the text book ==
Taking notes while reading your text can be the most critical part of passing a class.  In most classes the majority of information learned is taken from the text book, thus it is critical you retain as much of the information as possible.  The mechanics of taking notes while reading a text book can be broken down further into various techniques.

=== Type or write? ===
Typing your notes or writing your notes is a matter of personal preference.  If you can type faster than you write, you might prefer typing over writing.  Also typing your notes makes sure that they are legible.  However if you do plan to type your notes make sure that you have your book, monitor, and keyboard in a comfortable position to avoid neck or back cramps while note taking.  Writing out your notes has the advantage of allowing free-form drawing.  Something that is possible when typing, but can be cumbersome.

=== The Bookmark Technique ===
Often words/terms in bold--or words/terms that are important--are read. The best thing a person can do is take a sheet of writing paper and fold it up until it forms a makeshift bookmark. Then, when coming across terms, write the word found in bold on the bookmark writing line with the page number. Sometimes putting down names read and the page number the information about the person is on--does well.

This way, a person can track what page he or she is on. Also, it provides a way for someone to glance quickly at the bookmark and try to remember what the term means. If he or she does not remember what the word/term means, he or she can simply turn back to the page and regrasp the material.

The best part of this technique is that you can fold the bookmark up and put it in your pocket while going from place to place. All someone has to do is take the bookmark out of his or her pocket, look at it, and think hard about the terms and words on the bookmark. This is a great way to quickly review.

=== Copying the text verbatim ===
Copying text from the text book verbatim is the least perferred method of taking notes, but it can be somewhat helpful if it is the only option avaliable.

=== Copying definitions verbatim ===

When reading a Math or Science text, copying definitions verbatim is appropriate, and required.  Science and Math are build upon precise definitions, so modifying in any way will distort key concepts.  The definitions are so important that copying them to flash cards for memorization is encouraged if time permits.

=== Paraphrasing concepts and paragraphs ===
Paraphrasing concepts is the ideal way to take notes.  It will force you to actually think about what you read.  For Math and Science texts, extract '''ALL''' definitions and relevant theorems from paragraphs, and organize them into lists and sublists.  This will make sure you know they exist.  When reading all other texts, try to summarize '''ALL''' concepts.  Summarizing paragraphs will help too, but isn't as effective because the author of the text has already done some of the organization for you.  You may think that summarizing all concepts is a bit extreme, but often in a class you don't know what will be on the test and what won't, so if you want a high grade, this is the only way to be sure.

==== What if I don't understand something in the text? ====
The following is just a partial list of what you can do in this situation.

# Ask your instructor for clarification.  You can call or email your instructor before the next time class meets, or just wait until class.  This is usually a very good option if you only have a small number of questions.  Unfortunatly instructors tend to be very busy and are difficult to get in touch with.
# Ask a friend or class mate.  This is a good option only if your friend knows the material better than you do.  If not then you will have a situation of the blind leading the blind.
# Get another text book from the library that covers the same subject.  This is an excellent option because text book explanations are usually well thought out,  and there are often many text books in the library on the same subject, which all describe the same concepts, but from different points of view, and in different wording.

=== Asking yourself, and answering questions ===
This is an '''EXTREMELY''' good technique.  Once you read a section of text, ask your self as many  questions as time allows about what you have read.  Try to answer them based on the content of the book.  It is good to do this as you go along, because it will make sure that your truly understood read before you go on to the next section.  This technique is essential if you are reading from texts that don't have a lot of questions in them, or have questions that don't have answers in the back.

== Taking notes during lecture ==
Shorthand can be helpful.  Following along in the derivation of a solution to a math problem is a very good way to stay focused.

== Laplace Transform ==
The '''Laplace Transform''' is a powerful tool that is very useful in Electrical Engineering. The transform allows equations in the &quot;time domain&quot; to be transformed into an equivalent equation in the '''Complex S Domain'''. The laplace transform is an integral transform, although the reader does not need to have a knowledge of integral calculus because all results will be provided. This page will discuss the Laplace transform as being simply a tool for solving and manipulating ordinary differential equations.

Laplace transformations of circuit elements are similar to phasor representations, but they are not the same. Laplace transformations are more general than phasors, and can be easier to use in some instances. Also, do not confuse the term &quot;Complex S Domain&quot; with the complex power  ideas that we have been talking about earlier. Complex power uses the variable &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}&lt;/math&gt;, while the Laplace transform uses the variable s. The Laplace variable s has nothing to do with power.

The transform is named after the mathematician '''Pierre Simon Laplace''' (1749-1827). The transform itself did not become popular until Oliver Heaviside, a famous electrical engineer, began using a variation of it to solve electrical circuits.

== Laplace Domain ==

The '''Laplace domain''', or the &quot;Complex s Domain&quot; is the domain into which the Laplace transform transforms a time-domain equation. s is a complex variable, composed of real and imaginary parts:

:&lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + j\omega&lt;/math&gt;

The Laplace domain graphs the real part (&amp;sigma;) as the horizontal axis, and the imaginary part (&amp;omega;) as the vertical axis. The real and imaginary parts of s can be considered as independent quantities.

The similarity of this notation with the notation used in Fourier transform theory is no coincidence; for &lt;math&gt;\sigma=0&lt;/math&gt;, the Laplace transform is the same as the Fourier transform if the signal is causal.

== The Transform ==

The mathematical definition of the Laplace transform is as follows:

{{eqn|The Laplace Transform}}

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) 
  = \mathcal{L} \left\{f(t)\right\}
  = \int_{0^-}^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;The letter '''s''' has no special significance, and is used with the Laplace Transform as a matter of common convention.}}

The transform, by virtue of the definite integral, removes all t from the resulting equation, leaving instead the new variable s, a complex number that is normally written as &lt;math&gt;s=\sigma+j\omega&lt;/math&gt;. In essence, this transform takes the function f(t), and &quot;transforms it&quot; into a function in terms of s, F(s). As a general rule the transform of a function f(t) is written as F(s). Time-domain functions are written in lower-case, and the resultant s-domain functions are written in upper-case.

{{SideBox|There is a table of Laplace Transform pairs in&lt;br&gt;'''[[Circuit Theory/Transform Tables|the Appendix]]'''}}

we will use the following notation to show the transform of a function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) \Leftrightarrow F(s)&lt;/math&gt;

We use this notation, because we can convert F(s) back into f(t) using the '''inverse Laplace transform'''.

== The Inverse Transform ==

The '''inverse laplace transform''' converts a function in the complex S-domain to its counterpart in the time-domain.  Its mathematical definition is as follows:

{{eqn|Inverse Laplace Transform}}
:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{F(s)\right\}
  = {1 \over {2\pi}}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} e^{ft} F(s)\,ds = f(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a real constant such that all of the poles &lt;math&gt;s_1,s_2,...,s_n&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt; fall in the region &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}\{s_i\} &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that all of the poles of &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt; are to the left of the vertical line intersecting the real axis at &lt;math&gt;s=c&lt;/math&gt;.

The inverse transform is more difficult mathematically than the transform itself is. However, luckily for us, extensive tables of laplace transforms and their inverses have been computed, and are available for easy browsing.

== Transform Properties ==

{{SideBox|There is a table of Laplace Transform properties in&lt;br&gt;'''[[Circuit Theory/Transform Tables|The Appendix]]'''}}

The most important property of the Laplace Transform (for now) is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left\{ f'(t) \right\} = sF(s) - f(0)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, we can express higher-order derivatives in a similar manner:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left\{f''(t)\right\} = s^2F(s) - s f(0) - f'(0) &lt;/math&gt;

Or for an arbitrary derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left\{f^{(n)}(t)\right\} = s^nF(s) - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s^{(n-1-i)} f^{(i)}(0) &lt;/math&gt;

where the notation &lt;math&gt; f^{(n)}(t) &lt;/math&gt; means the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative of the function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; f^{(0)}(t) &lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt; f(t) &lt;/math&gt;.

In plain English, the laplace transform converts differentiation into polynomials. The only important thing to remember is that we must add in the initial conditions of the time domain function, but for most circuits, the initial condition is 0, leaving us with nothing to add.

For integrals, we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left\{ \int_0^t f(t)\, dt \right\} = {1 \over s}F(s)&lt;/math&gt;

== Initial Value Theorem ==

The '''Initial Value Theorem''' of the laplace transform states as follows:

{{eqn|Initial Value Theorem}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(0) \Leftrightarrow \lim_{s \to \infty} sF(s)&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful for finding the initial conditions of a function  needed when we perform the transform of a differentiation operation (see above).

== Final Value Theorem ==

Similar to the Initial Value Theorem, the '''Final Value Theorem''' states that we can find the value of a function f, as t approaches infinity, in the laplace domain, as such:

{{eqn|Final Value Theorem}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t) \Leftrightarrow \lim_{s \to 0} sF(s)&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful for finding the steady state response of a circuit.  The final value theorem may only be applied to stable systems.

== Transfer Function ==

If we have a circuit with impulse-response h(t) in the time domain, with input x(t) and output y(t), we can find the '''Transfer Function''' of the circuit, in the laplace domain, by transforming all three elements:

[[Image:LTI.png|center|500px]]

In this situation, H(s) is known as the &quot;Transfer Function&quot; of the circuit. It can be defined as both the transform of the impulse response, or the ratio of the circuit output to its input in the Laplace domain: 

{{eqn|Transfer Function}}
:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \mathcal{L} \left\{h(t) \right\} = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Transfer functions are powerful tools for analyzing circuits. If we know the transfer function of a circuit, we have all the information we need to understand the circuit, and we have it in a form that is easy to work with. When we have obtained the transfer function, we can say that the circuit has been &quot;solved&quot; completely.

== Convolution Theorem ==

Earlier it was mentioned that we could compute the output of a system from the input and the impulse response by using the convolution operation. As a reminder, given the following system:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:System Block.svg|400px|center]]
|
*''x(t)'' = '''system input'''
*''h(t)'' = '''impulse response'''
*''y(t)'' = ''' system output'''
|}

We can calculate the output using the convolution operation, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = x(t) * h(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where the asterisk denotes convolution, not multiplication. However, in the S domain, this operation becomes much easier, because of a property of the laplace transform:

{{eqn|Convolution Theorem}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \left\{ a(t) * b(t) \right\} = A(s)B(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Where the asterisk operator denotes the convolution operation. This leads us to an English statement of the convolution theorem:

{{TextBox|Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the S domain, and convolution in the S domain becomes multiplication in the time domain.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture 6 Slide 22 (Page 6 in the PDF document) http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/ee2_signals/Lecture%206%20-%20Laplace%20Transform.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Now, if we have a system in the Laplace S domain:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Laplace Block.svg]]
| 
*''X(s)'' = '''Input'''
*''H(s)'' = '''Transfer Function'''
*''Y(s)'' = '''Output'''
|}

We can compute the output Y(s) from the input X(s) and the Transfer Function H(s):

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = X(s)H(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that this property is very similar to phasors, where the output can be determined by multiplying the input by the network function. The network function and the transfer function then, are very similar quantities.

== Resistors ==

The laplace transform can be used independently on different circuit elements, and then the circuit can be solved entirely in the S Domain (Which is much easier). Let's take a look at some of the circuit elements:

Resistors are time and frequency invariant. Therefore, the transform of a resistor is the same as the resistance of the resistor:

{{eqn|Transform of Resistors}}
:&lt;math&gt;R(s) = r&lt;/math&gt;

Compare this result to the phasor impedance value for a resistance r:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_r = r \angle 0&lt;/math&gt;

You can see very quickly that resistance values are very similar between phasors and laplace transforms.

== Ohm's Law ==

If we transform Ohm's law, we get the following equation:

{{eqn|Transform of Ohm's Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;V(s) = I(s)R&lt;/math&gt;

Now, following ohms law, the resistance of the circuit element is a ratio of the voltage to the current. So, we will solve for the quantity &lt;math&gt;\frac{V(s)}{I(s)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the result will be the resistance of our circuit element:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V(s)}{I(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

This ratio, the input/output ratio of our resistor is an important quantity, and we will find this quantity for all of our circuit elements. We can say that the transform of a resistor with resistance r is given by:

{{eqn|Tranform of Resistor}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{\text{resistor}\} = R = r&lt;/math&gt;

== Capacitors ==

Let us look at the relationship between voltage, current, and capacitance, in the time domain:

:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = C\frac{dv(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for voltage, we get the following integral:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^{\infty} i(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

Then, transforming this equation into the laplace domain, we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt;V(s) = \frac{1}{C} \frac{1}{s} I(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Again, if we solve for the ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{V(s)}{I(s)}&lt;/math&gt;, we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V(s)}{I(s)} = \frac{1}{sC}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the transform for a capacitor with capacitance C is given by:

{{eqn|Transform of Capacitor}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{\mbox{capacitor}\} = \frac{1}{sC}&lt;/math&gt;

== Inductors ==

Let us look at our equation for inductance:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = L \frac{di(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

putting this into the laplace domain, we get the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;V(s) = sLI(s)&lt;/math&gt;

And solving for our ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{V(s)}{I(s)}&lt;/math&gt;, we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V(s)}{I(s)} = sL&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the transform of an inductor with inductance L is given by:

{{eqn|Transform of Inductor}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{\text{inductor}\} = sL&lt;/math&gt;

== Impedance ==

Since all the load elements can be combined into a single format dependent on s, we call the effect of all load elements '''impedance''', the same as we call it in phasor representation. We denote impedance values with a capital Z (but not a phasor &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;).


==Determining electric current in circuits==
[[File:Electric circuit RCL.jpg|thumbnail|RCL circuit with zero capacitance and zero initial current.]]

In the network shown, determine the character of the currents &lt;math&gt;I_1(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; assuming that each current is zero when the switch is closed. 

===Solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Hewie|first=Mohamed F.|title=Laplace Transforms|year=2013|publisher=Shaymaa Publishing|location=USA|isbn=1484136349|pages=217-220|url=http://www.amazon.com/Laplace-Transforms-Mohamed-F-El-Hewie/dp/1484136349/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366249920&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=eL-hEWIE+Laplace+transform}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

====Current flow at a joint in circuit====

Since the algebraic sum of the currents at any junction is zero, then

&lt;math&gt; I_1(t)-I_2(t)-I_3(t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.........(182)

====Voltage balance on a circuit====
Applying the voltage law to the circuit on the left we get

&lt;math&gt; I_1(t)R_1 + L_2 \frac{dI_2(t)}{dt}\ =E(t) &lt;/math&gt;.........             (182-1)

Applying again the voltage law to the outside circuit, given that E is constant, we get

&lt;math&gt; I_1(t)R_1+I_3(t)R_3 + L_3 \frac{dI_3(t)}{dt}\ =E(t) &lt;/math&gt;.........            (182-2)	

====Laplace Transforms of current and voltage equations====

Transforming (182), (182-1) and (182-2), we get

&lt;math&gt; i_1(s)-i_2(s)-i_3(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.........(182-3)

&lt;math&gt; i_1(s)R_1 +sL_2i_2(s)=\frac{E}{s}\ &lt;/math&gt;.........         	 	(182-4)	

&lt;math&gt; i_1(s)R_1 +( R_3 + sL_3 ) i_3(s)= \frac{E}{s}\ &lt;/math&gt;	        .........    	 	(182-5)	

=====Review on implementing Laplace Transformation=====
The three Laplace transformed equations (182-3), (182-4), and (182-5) show the [http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Mathematics-Personal-Study-Notes/dp/1461084423/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366661958&amp;sr=8-1 benefits of integral transformation in converting differential equations] into linear algebraic equations that could be solved for the dependent variables (the three currents in this case), then inverse transformed to yield the required solution. 

* In equation (182-3), we utilized the ''sum property'' of Laplace transforms.
* In equation (182-4), we utilized the transform of ''differential derivative'' as follows. 

&lt;math&gt; si_2(s)-I_2(0)= \mathcal{L}\left\lbrace\frac {dI_2}{dt}\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;.........(182-4.1)
	
Since, substituted by the given initial condition: &lt;math&gt; I_2(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; 

* In equation (182-5), we also utilized the transform of differential derivative 

&lt;math&gt; si_3(s)-I_3(0)= \mathcal{L}\left\lbrace\frac {dI_3}{dt}\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;.........(182-5.2)	

Again, we substituted by the given initial condition: &lt;math&gt; I_3(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; 

The fact that the applied voltage was a step function, implied the use of Laplace transform of a step function, as follows:

&lt;math&gt; \frac {E}{s}= \mathcal{L}\left\lbrace E \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;.........(182-5.3)

====Solution linear simultaneous equations====

The three linear simultaneous equations (182-3), (182-4), and (182-5) have the three unknown &lt;math&gt;i_1(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_2(s)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i_3(s)&lt;/math&gt; and can be solved by Cramer’s rule of matrices among other simple methods of elimination, as follows.

  	
&lt;math&gt; i_1(s) = \frac{ \begin{vmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
\frac{E}{s}\  &amp; sL_2 &amp; 0 \\
\frac{E}{s}\ &amp; 0 &amp;R_3 + sL_3 \\
\end{vmatrix}}{ \Delta}= \frac{E}{s}\frac{R_3+s(L_2+L_3)}{\Delta}
&lt;/math&gt;  .........    (182-6)

Where, the determinant ∆ for the matrix is determined as follows
 
&lt;math&gt; \Delta = \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
R_1  &amp; sL_2 &amp; 0 \\
R_1 &amp; 0 &amp;R_3 + sL_3 \\
\end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
R_1  &amp; sL_2+R_1 &amp; R_1 \\
R_1 &amp; R_1 &amp; R_1+R_3 + sL_3 \\
\end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
	 

&lt;math&gt; \Delta = s^2L_2L_3+s(R_1L_2+R_3L_2 +R_1R_3)+R_1R_3&lt;/math&gt;......... 	(182-6.1)

Since we are interested in the factors of Δ, we consider the equation Δ =0. Since all coefficients of this equation are positive, hence it cannot have any positive roots. Its discriminant is

&lt;math&gt;(R_1L_2+R_3L_2 +R_1R_3)^2-4L_2L_3R_1R_3&lt;/math&gt; ........ (182-6.1.1)


which can be written

:&lt;math&gt;R^2_1L^2_2+2R_1L_2(R_3L_2+R_1L_3)+(R_3L_2-R_1L_3)^2&lt;/math&gt;........ (182-6.1.2)



which is positive. Hence the equation Δ = 0 has two negative distinct roots &lt;math&gt;-\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, say. 

Therefore,
 
&lt;math&gt;\Delta = L_2L_3(s+\alpha_1)(s+\alpha_2)&lt;/math&gt; .........	(182-6.2)



Where,&lt;math&gt;-\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of the quadratic equation (182-6.1) as follows



&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1=\frac{1}{2}\left\lbrace\frac{R_1L_2+R_3L_2+R_1R_3}{L_2L_3}+\sqrt {\left(\frac{R_1L_2+R_3L_2+R_1R_3}{L_2L_3}\right)^2-4\frac{R_1R_3}{L_2L_3}}\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt; .........	(182-6.2.1) 



&lt;math&gt;\alpha_2=\frac{1}{2}\left\lbrace\frac{R_1L_2+R_3L_2+R_1R_3}{L_2L_3}-\sqrt {\left(\frac{R_1L_2+R_3L_2+R_1R_3}{L_2L_3}\right)^2-4\frac{R_1R_3}{L_2L_3}}\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt; .........	(182-6.2.2)



Therefore, equations (182-6) and (186-6.2) give

&lt;math&gt;i_1(s)=\frac{E}{s}.\frac{R_3+s(L_2+L_3)}{L_2L_3(s+\alpha_1)(s+\alpha_2)} &lt;/math&gt; 	

&lt;math&gt;i_1(s)=\frac{A_0}{s}+\frac{A_1}{s+\alpha_1}+\frac{A_1}{s+\alpha_2} &lt;/math&gt; 	 .........(182-7)

The constants &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt; are obtained in terms of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_3&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; and are given as:



&lt;math&gt;A_0=-\frac{ER_3}{L_2L_3\alpha_1\alpha_2}&lt;/math&gt; .........(182-7.1)



&lt;math&gt;A_1=E\frac{R_3\alpha_2-\alpha_1\alpha_2(L_2+L_3)}{L_2L_3\alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)}&lt;/math&gt;.........(182-7.2)



&lt;math&gt;A_2=E\frac{\alpha_2(L_2+L_3)-R_3}{L_2L_3\alpha_2(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)}&lt;/math&gt;.........(182-7.3)

====Inverse Laplace Transforms of current equations====

The inverse Laplace transform of (182-7) is therefore,
	 
&lt;math&gt;I_1(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\lbrace\frac{A_0}{s}+\frac{A_1}{s+\alpha_1}+\frac{A_1}{s+\alpha_2}\right\rbrace  
=A_0+A_1e^{-\alpha_1t}+A_2e^{-\alpha_2t}
&lt;/math&gt;.........(182-8) 	

The remaining variables &lt;math&gt;I_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding voltages are determined by equations (182), (182-1) and (182-2)


=====Analysis of circuit dynamics=====
The electric current &lt;math&gt;I_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; in equation (182-8) shows a time-independent component &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; and two decay terms, which reach asymptotic values as t reaches ∞. In other words, the currents in the three circuits lack sinusoidal osculation, mainly because: (1) the applied voltage is constant and (2) the circuit does not have capacitance components. 

'''Notes:'''
This example could be is modified in various ways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Hewie|first=Mohamed F.|title=Laplace Transforms|year=2013|publisher=Shaymaa Publishing|location=USA|isbn=1484136349|pages=190–220|url=http://www.amazon.com/Laplace-Transforms-Mohamed-F-El-Hewie/dp/1484136349/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366249920&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=eL-hEWIE+Laplace+transform}}&lt;/ref&gt; to involve voltage impulse, sinusoidal voltage source, capacitance,and various boundary and initial conditions of charges and currents.

==Generalization of the method==

In the above example, the following modifications can be made:

(1) The applied voltage in the Krichhoff's equation can take many forms such as 

* :&lt;math&gt;E(t)=E_o\delta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

* :&lt;math&gt;E(t)=E_o\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

* :&lt;math&gt;E(t)=E_of(t)&lt;/math&gt;

(2) Capacitance add the integral term of current over the duration as

* : &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{C}\int_0^t I(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Fourier.jpg|right|framed|[[Wikipedia:Joseph Fourier|Joseph Fourier]], after whom the Fourier Transform is named, was a famous mathematician who worked for Napoleon.]]

This course started with phasors. We learned how to transform forcing sinusodial functions such as voltage supplies into phasors. To handle more complex forcing functions we switched to complex frequencies. This enabled us to handle forcing functions of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{st}\cos(\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
where s is:
:&lt;math&gt;s=\sigma + j\omega&lt;/math&gt;
And the convolution integral can do anything.

Along the way &quot;s&quot; began to transform the calculus operators back into algebra. Within the complex domain, &quot;s&quot; could be re-attached to the inductors and capacitors rather than forcing functions. The transfer function helped us use &quot;s&quot; to capture circuit physical characteristics. 

This is all good for designing a circuit to operate at a single frequency &amp;omega;. But what about circuits that operate at a variety of frequencies? A RC car may operate at 27mhz, but when a control is pressed, the frequency might increase or decrease. Or the amplitude may increase or decrease. Or the phase may shift. All of these things happen in a cell phone call or wifi/blue tooth/xbee/AM/FM/over the air tv, etc. 

How does a single circuit respond to these changes?

==Fourier analysis==
Fourier analysis says we don't have to answer all the above questions. Just one question has to be answered/designed to. Since any function can be turned into a series of sinusiodals added together, then sweeping the circuit through a variety of \omega's can predict it's response to any particular combination of them. 

So to start this we get rid of the exponential term and go back to phasors. 

Set &amp;sigma; to 0:
:&lt;math&gt;s = j\omega&lt;/math&gt;

The variable &amp;omega; is known as the &quot;radial frequency&quot; or just frequency. With this we can design circuits for cell phones that all share the air, for set-top cable TV boxes that pack multiple channels into one black cable. Every vocal or pixel change during transmission or reception can be designed for within this framework. All that is required is to sweep through all the frequencies that a sinusoidal voltage or current source can produce. 

Analysis stays in the frequency domain. Because everything repeats over and over again in time, there is no point in going back to the time from a design point of view.

== Radial Frequency ==

In the Fourier transform, the value &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''Radial Frequency''', and has units of radians/second (rad/s). People might be more familiar with the variable f, which is called the &quot;Frequency&quot;, and is measured in units called Hertz (Hz). The conversion is done as such:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;
For instance, if a given AC source has a frequency of 60Hz, the resultant radial frequency is:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi(60) = 120\pi&lt;/math&gt;

== Fourier Domain ==
The Fourier domain then is broken up into two distinct parts: the '''magnitude graph''', and the '''phase graph'''. The magnitude graph has j&amp;omega; as the horizontal axis, and the magnitude of the transform as the vertical axis. Remember, we can compute the magnitude of a complex value C as:

:&lt;math&gt;C = A + jB&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|C| = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The Phase graph has j&amp;omega; as the horizontal axis, and the phase value of the transform as the vertical axis. Remember, we can compute the phase of a complex value as such:

:&lt;math&gt;C = A + jB&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\angle C = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The phase and magnitude values of the Fourier transform can be considered independent values, although some abstract relationships do apply. Every fourier transform must include a phase value and a magnitude value, or it cannot be uniquely transformed back into the time domain.

The combination of graphs of the magnitude and phase responses of a circuit, along with some special types of formatting and interpretation are called [[Circuit Theory/Bode Plots|Bode Plots]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Very generally speaking, Canada's court system is a four-level hierarchy as shown below from highest to lowest in terms of legal authority. Each court is bound by the rulings of the courts above them; however, they are not bound by their own past rulings or the rulings of other courts at the same level in the hierarchy.


==Supreme Court of Canada==
Although created by an Act of Canada's Parliament in 1875, its decisions could be reviewed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council until 1949 when the Supreme Court of Canada truly became the final and highest court in the country. The court currently consists of nine justices, which include the Chief Justice of Canada, and its duties include hearing appeals of decisions from the appellate courts (to be discussed next) and, on occasion, delivering references (i.e. the court's opinion) on constitutional questions raised by government. By tradition, three of the nine justices are appointed from Quebec. This has come about because of two reasons, the Court will sometimes have cases heard by three of the nine justices and Quebec uses the civil code rather than common law, which requires the Court to have justices versed in the civil code.

==Appellate Courts of the Provinces and Territories==
These courts of appeal (as listed below by province and territory in alphabetical order) exist at the provincial and territorial levels. Their function is to review decisions rendered by the superior-level courts and to do references (i.e. deliver a judicial opinion) when requested by a provincial or territorial government. These appellate courts do not normally conduct trials and hear witnesses.

These courts are Canada's equivalent of the Court of Appeal in England and the various United States Courts of Appeals. Each of the above-listed appellate courts is the highest court from its respective province or territory. A province's chief justice (i.e. highest ranking judge) sits in the appellate court of that province.

==Superior-level Courts of the Provinces and Territories==

These courts (as listed below by province and territory in alphabetical order) exist at the provincial and territorial levels. The superior courts are the courts of first instance for divorce petitions, civil lawsuits involving claims greater than small claims, and criminal prosecutions for &quot;indictable offences&quot; (i.e. &quot;felonies&quot; in American legal terminology). They also perform a reviewing function for judgments from the local &quot;inferior&quot; courts and administrative decisions by provincial or territorial government entities such as labour boards, human rights tribunals and licensing authorities.

Furthermore, some of these superior courts (like the one in Ontario) have specialized branches that deal only with certain matters such as family law or small claims. To complicate things further, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has a branch called the Divisional Court that hears only appeals and judicial reviews of administrative tribunals and whose decisions have greater binding authority than those from the &quot;regular&quot; branch of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Although a court, like the Supreme Court of British Columbia, may have the word &quot;supreme&quot; in its name, it is not necessarily the highest court from its respective province or territory.

==Provincial and Territorial (&quot;inferior-level&quot;) Courts==
These courts operate locally and exist only at the provincial and territorial levels. They do trials, often concerning &quot;summary conviction offences&quot; (i.e. &quot;misdemeanors&quot; in U.S. legal vocabulary), but their judgments must be appealed to the &quot;superior&quot; courts instead of directly to the higher appellate courts. These &quot;inferior&quot; courts do not have &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot; (to be explained later) and are descended from the old localized courts presided over by lay magistrates and Justices of the Peace who did not necessarily have formal legal training. Many of such &quot;inferior&quot; courts have specialized functions, such as hearing only criminal law matters, juvenile delinquency matters, family law matters, small claims matters, or &quot;quasi-criminal&quot; offences such as not paying fines or not complying with building safety standards.
It is improper to call these courts &quot;inferior&quot; and this derogatory term is used here only to help readers understand and remember these courts' subordinate relationship to the &quot;superior&quot; courts. Instead, the phrase &quot;provincial court&quot; or &quot;territorial court&quot; is often used to mean a low level court whose decisions can be reviewed by a &quot;superior&quot; court. Decades ago they were commonly referred to as &quot;district courts&quot; and &quot;county courts&quot;.

==Federal Courts==
The Federal Court and the more specialized Tax Court of Canada exists primarily to review administrative decisions by federal government bodies such as the immigration board and hear lawsuits under the federal government's jurisdiction such as intellectual property and maritime law.

The Federal Court of Appeal hears appeals from decisions rendered by the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada and a certain group of federal administrative tribunals like the National Energy Board and the federal labour board. The chief justice of the Federal Court sits in the Federal Court of Appeal.

Before 2003, the Federal Court was known as the Federal Court of Canada - Trial Division while the Federal Court of Appeal was known as the Federal Court of Canada - Appeal Division. In turn, the Federal Court of Canada is descended from the old Exchequer Court of Canada created back in 1875.

Although the federal type courts can be said to have the same prestige as the superior courts from the provinces and territories, the federal ones lack the &quot;inherent jurisidiction&quot; (to be explained later) possessed by superior courts such as the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

==Administrative Tribunals==
Known in Canada as simply &quot;tribunals&quot;, these are non-judicial adjudicative bodies, which means that they adjudicate (hear evidence and render decisions) like the courts do BUT are not presided over by judges. Instead, the adjudicators are experts of the very specific legal field handled by the tribunal (e.g. labour law, human rights law, immigration law, enegry law, liquor licensing law, etc.) who hear arguments and evidence provided by lawyers before making a written decision on record. Its decisions can be reviewed by a court through an appeal or a process called &quot;judicial review&quot;. The reviewing court may be required to show some deference to the tribunal if the tribunal possesses some highly specialized legal knowledge that the court does not have.

Appearing before an administrative tribunal may feel like appearing in a court, but the appearing lawyer will appreciate the fact that the tribunal's procedure is relatively less formal than that of the court, and more importantly, the rules of evidence are not as strictly observed. In other words, evidence that would be inadmissible in a court hearing would be allowed in a tribunal hearing. The presiding adjudicator is normally called &quot;Mister/Madam Chair&quot;, and lawyers routinely appear in tribunals advocating a matter for their clients.

What tribunals all have in common is that they are created by statute, their adjudictors are appointed by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g. immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g. liquor licensing) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. Yet, there are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.

Most importantly, from the lawyer's perspective, is the fact that the principle of stare decisis does not apply to tribunals. In other words, a tribunal adjudicative could legally make a decision that differs from a past decision, on the same subject and issues, delivered by the highest court in the land. Because a tribunal is not bound by legal precedent, established by itself or by a reviewing court, A TRIBUNAL IS NOT A COURT even though it performs an important adjudicative function and contribute to the development of law like a court would do. Although stare decisis does not apply to tribunals, their adjudicators will nonetheless find a prior court decision on a similar subject to be highly persuasive and will likely follow the courts in order to ensure consistency in the law and to prevent the embarrassment of having their decisions overturned by the courts.

Among the federal tribunals, there is a small group of tribunals whose decisions must be appealed directly to the Federal Court of Appeal rather than to the Federal Court. These so-called &quot;super tribunals&quot; are listed in Subsection 28(1) of the Federal Courts Act (R.S.C. 1985, Chapter F-7) and some examples include the National Energy Board, Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the Competition Tribunal, the Canada Industrial Relations Board (e.g. federal labour board), the Copyright Board, and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (&quot;CRTC&quot;).

==Courts of Inherent Jurisdiction==

These are the superior courts from the provinces and territories as discussed above. The words &quot;inherent juridiction&quot; refers to the idea that the decision-making power of Canada's superior courts is inherited from England's superior courts rather than granted by Canada's federal parliament or provincial legislatures. Because the superior courts possess &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot;, they can hear cases concerning any area of law except those which are specifically reserved by legislation for the lower &quot;provincial&quot; courts. The doctrine of &quot;inherent jurisdiction&quot; gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts (to be explained next) to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.

==Statutory Courts==
These courts include the Supreme Court of Canada, the different types of federal courts, the various appellate courts from the provinces and territories, and the numerous low level &quot;provincial&quot; courts. Their decision-making power is granted by either the federal parliament or a provincial legislature.

The word &quot;statutory&quot; refers to the fact that these courts' powers are derived from a type of legislation called a statute and is defined and limited by a statute. A statutory court cannot try cases in areas of law that are not mentioned or suggested in the statute. In this sense, statutory courts are similar to non-judicial adjudicative bodies such as administrative tribunals, boards, commissions, etc. which are created and given limited power by legislation. The practical implication of this is that a statutory court cannot provide a type of legal remedy or relief that is not expressly or implicitly referred to in its enabling or empowering statute.

==Appointment and Regulation of Judges==

Judges in Canada are appointed and not elected. Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, the appellate courts and the &quot;superior&quot; courts are appointed by the federal government. Thus, judges of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice are chosen not by Ontario's provincial government but by the same level of government that appoints judges to the federal courts. Meanwhile, judicial appointments to judicial posts in the so-called &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;provincial&quot; courts are made by the local provincial government.
There are Canadians who would like to see their judges be elected as is the case for some American judges, but as of 2005 there is no indication that the longstanding British tradition of appointing judges will be altered in Canada anytime soon. Those who favour the appointment method point out that the election approach could possibly threaten the judiciary's ability to be independent in its decision-making.
Because judicial independence is seen by Canadian law to be essential to a functioning democracy, the regulating of Canadian judges requires the involvement of the judges themselves. The Canadian Judicial Council, made up of the chief justices of the various courts, receives complaints from the public concerning questionable behaviour from members of the bench.

The '''Holy Trinity''' of both [[Cookbook:Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] and [[Cookbook:Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] cuisine is made up of green peppers, onions, and celery in no specified amount or ratio. The trinity is typically sauteed in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] as the base of a recipe. 

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]], the trinity ('''[[Cookbook:Mirepoix|mirepoix]]''') is made up of onions, celery, and carrots in a ratio of 2:1:1 (onions:celery:carrots).

=== Pith and Substance ===

===Purpose and Effect===

===Double Aspect===
The doctrine of Double Aspect says that a law may possess more than one &quot;matter&quot; that may be enumerated in both section 91 and 92. The doctrine originates from the Privy Council decision of ''Hodge v. The Queen'' (1883) where the court stated that &quot;subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within s.92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within s.91&quot;. In applying the doctrine, it should be in situations where the importance of one matter should not be significantly larger than the other. In effect, the doctrine removes the need for courts to split hairs to determine which head of power should be assigned a particular law.   

=== Colourability ===

===Concurrent jurisdiction===

===Ancilliary effects===

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Side dishes | Side dishes]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada | Canadian Cuisine]]

The origins of '''Potato Salad''' can be traced to Germany before the turn of the 17th century, where it first became popular to use vinegar and spices on potatoes as a side dish.  The salad has a bite to it and is served warm as often as not.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound | pounds]] (~1kg) of [[Cookbook:Potato | potatoes]] 
* 6 slices of [[Cookbook:Bacon | bacon]]
* 1/2 cup (120g) finely chopped yellow onion
* 2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Sugar | sugar]]
* 1/2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Celery| celery seed]]
* 2 hard boiled [[Cookbook:Egg | eggs]]
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60g) [[Cookbook:Flour | flour]]
* 1/2 cup (120ml) of [[Cookbook:Vinegar | vinegar]]
* 1 cup (240ml) of [[Cookbook:Water | water]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley | parsley]]
* 1 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt | salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper | pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Paprika | paprika]]

== Procedure ==
# Cook bacon strips, cut into small pieces and set aside for later.
# Boil potatoes for 5-10 minutes or until softened; cut into small chunks or thick slices.
# Place potatoes in a large bowl and let them come to room temperature.
# In a bowl combine flour, celery seed, parsley, chopped onion, salt and pepper.
# Pour the water and vinegar into a pot, stir in sugar and bring to a boil. Add the dry mixture and stir until thickened.
# In the original bowl place potatoes and bacon, pour on thickened mixture.
# Break apart eggs and stir lightly into the bowl to combine. 
# Place in large serving bowl and sprinkle with paprika. 
# Serve

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Potatoes may be boiled whole in skins, cooled, and carefully peeled to leave the thin, yellow protein layer intact for improved nutritional value and flavour.  Slice at room temperature or chilled.
* Chopping the potatoes into small pieces allow more surface to be coated and improves the flavour.
* Omit salt and use a chicken-flavoured bouillon cube instead.  Add chopped onion to bouillon and simmer for a few minutes to blend flavours.
* Salad can be served chilled or warm to preference.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calculus/Top Nav|Area|Volume of solids of revolution}}

When we think about volume from an intuitive point of view, we typically think of it as the amount of &quot;space&quot; an item occupies. Unfortunately assigning a number that measures this amount of space can prove difficult for all but the simplest geometric shapes.  Calculus provides a new tool that can greatly extend our ability to calculate volume. In order to understand the ideas involved it helps to think about the volume of a cylinder.  The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula &lt;math&gt;V=\pi r^2 h&lt;/math&gt;.  The base of the cylinder is a circle whose area is given by &lt;math&gt;A=\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the volume of a cylinder is derived by taking the area of its base and multiplying by the height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. For more complicated shapes, we could think of approximating the volume by taking the area of some cross section at some height &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and multiplying by some small change in height &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; then adding up the heights of all of these approximations from the bottom to the top of the object. This would appear to be a Riemann sum. Keeping this in mind, we can develop a more general formula for the volume of solids in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; (3 dimensional space). 

==Formal Definition==
Formally the ideas above suggest that we can calculate the volume of a solid by calculating the integral of the cross-sectional area along
some dimension. In the above example of a cylinder, the every cross section was given by the same circle, so the cross-sectional area is therefore a constant function, and the dimension of integration was vertical (although it could have been any one we desired). Generally, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a solid that lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;
between &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=b&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; denote the area of a cross section taken in the plane perpendicular to the ''x'' direction, and passing through the point ''x''.
If the function &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is  continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, then the volume &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; of the solid &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;V_S = \int_a^b A(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
===Example 1: A right cylinder===
[[File:Cylinder with cross section at height x.svg|200px|thumb|right|Figure 1]]
Now we will calculate the volume of a right cylinder using our new ideas about how to calculate volume.  Since we already know the formula for the volume of a cylinder this will give us a &quot;sanity check&quot; that our formulas make sense.  First, we choose a dimension along which to integrate. In this case, it will greatly simplify the calculations to integrate along the height of the cylinder, so this is the direction we will choose. Thus we will call the vertical direction &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (see [[:File:Cylinder with cross section at height x.svg|Figure 1]]). Now we find the function, &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which will describe the cross-sectional area of our cylinder at a height of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The cross-sectional area of a cylinder is simply a circle. Now simply recall that the area of a circle is &lt;math&gt;\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;A(x)=\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;. Before performing the computation, we must choose our bounds of integration. In this case, we simply define &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; to be the base of the cylinder, and so we will integrate from &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the cylinder. Finally, we integrate:
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{cylinder}}&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_a^b A(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^h \pi r^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi r^2\int_0^h\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\left.\pi r^2x\right|_{x=0}^h&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi r^2(h-0)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi r^2h.&lt;/math&gt;
|}
This is exactly the familiar formula for the volume of a cylinder.

===Example 2: A right circular cone===
[[File:Plane intersecting cone 2.png|200px|thumb|right|Figure 2:  The cross-section of a right circular cone by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone is a circle.]]

For our next example we will look at an example where the cross sectional area is not constant.  Consider a right circular cone.  Once again the cross sections are simply circles.  But now the radius varies from the base of the cone to the tip.  Once again we choose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the vertical direction, with the base at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and the tip at &lt;math&gt;x=h&lt;/math&gt;, and we will let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the radius of the base.  While we know the cross sections are just circles we cannot calculate the area of the cross sections unless we find some way to determine the radius of the circle at height &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  

[[File:Similar triangles for cone.svg|200px|thumb|left|Figure 3:  Cross-section of the right circular cone by a plane perpendicular to the base and passing through the tip.]]

Luckily in this case it is possible to use some of what we know from geometry.  We can imagine cutting the cone perpendicular to the base through some diameter of the circle all the way to the tip of the cone.  If we then look at the flat side we just created, we will see simply a triangle, whose geometry we understand well.  The right triangle from the tip to the base at height &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is similar to the right triangle from the tip to the base at height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.  This tells us that &lt;math&gt;\frac{r}{h-x}=\frac{R}{h}&lt;/math&gt;.  So that we see that the radius of the circle at height &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;r(x)=\frac{R}{h}(h-x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Now using the familiar formula for the area of a circle we see that &lt;math&gt;A(x)=\pi\frac{R^2}{h^2}(h-x)^2&lt;/math&gt;.
  
Now we are ready to integrate.

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{cone}}&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_a^b A(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^h \pi \frac{R^2}{h^2}(h-x)^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi \frac{R^2}{h^2}\int_0^h(h-x)^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|By u-substitution we may let &lt;math&gt;u=h-x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;du=-dx&lt;/math&gt; and our integral becomes
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi \frac{R^2}{h^2}\left(-\int_h^0 u^2\,du\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi \frac{R^2}{h^2}\left(\left.-\frac{u^3}{3}\right|_h^0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi \frac{R^2}{h^2}(-0+\frac{h^3}{3})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{3}\pi R^2h.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Example 3: A sphere===
[[File:Sphere with cross section.svg|200px|thumb|right|Figure 4:  Determining the radius of the cross-section of the sphere at a distance &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; from the sphere's center.]]
In a similar fashion, we can use our definition to prove the well known formula for the volume of a sphere. First, we must find our cross-sectional area function, &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which is centered at the origin in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.  If we again integrate vertically then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will vary from &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.  In order to find the area of a particular cross section it helps to draw a right triangle whose points lie at the center of the sphere, the center of the circular cross section, and at a point along the circumference of the cross section.  As shown in the diagram the side lengths of this triangle will be &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  Where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circular cross section.  Then by the Pythagorean theorem &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{R^2-|x|^2}&lt;/math&gt; and find that &lt;math&gt;A(x)=\pi(R^2-|x|^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is slightly helpful to notice that &lt;math&gt;|x|^2=x^2&lt;/math&gt; so we do not need to keep the absolute value.

So we have that
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{sphere}}&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_a^b A(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_{-R}^R \pi (R^2-x^2)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi \int_{-R}^R R^2\,dx-\pi\int_{-R}^R x^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\left.\pi R^2x\right|_{-R}^R-\left.\pi \frac{x^3}{3}\right|_{-R}^R&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\pi R^2(R-(-R))-\pi\left(\frac{R^3}{3}-\frac{(-R)^3}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=2\pi R^3-\frac{2}{3}\pi R^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Extension to Non-trivial Solids==
Now that we have shown our definition agrees with our prior knowledge, we will see how it can help us extend our horizons to solids whose volumes are not possible to calculate using elementary geometry.

Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication Methods

	In blended learning, instructors use facets of self-paced instruction and live, collaborative learning to moderate the offline setting.  This is also respectively known as asynchronous and synchronous learning.  These methods of teaching and learning are essential in encouraging active participation in the blended learning environment.  (Im and Lee, 2003)  

Online discussions have the potential to enhance students’ learning and may lead to cognitive development.  (Fassinger, 1995)  In addition, preconceived notions of race, gender, educational abilities or social status of the students is virtually erased.  (Im and Lee, 2003)  This can be extremely beneficial with the number of social cliques in both junior high and high school.  The key to the learning process includes interactions among the students themselves, the interactions between instructor and students, and the collaborations in learning that result from these interactions.  (Jin, 2005)

A live, collaborative learning environment depends on dynamic communication between learners that fosters knowledge sharing. (Singh, 2001) Synchronous discussions are extremely beneficial for students who might not otherwise participate collaboratively within the traditional classroom.  Furthermore, they allow for fast and efficient exchanges of ideas.  (Bremer, 1998)  In a traditional classroom setting, participation of all students is often difficult due to time constraints or simple shyness.  In live, collaborative learning atmospheres the communication process between learners is just as meaningful and vital as an educational end product. Collaborative learning emphasizes the following factors:
*active participation and interaction among learners
*knowledge viewed as a social construct
*environments that facilitate peer interaction, evaluation, and cooperation
*learners who benefit from self explanation when more experienced or knowledgeable learners contribute
*learners who benefit from internalization by verbalizing in a conversation (Hiltz, 1999)
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others.  It allows students the ability to work at their own pace and control the pace of instructional information.  In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours.  (Bremer, 1998)  The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times. Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of day and expect reasonably quick responses, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting. 
Self-paced instruction will often come in a variety of asynchronous formats including but not limited to:
*Documents &amp; Web Pages
*Web/Computer Based Training Modules
*Assessments
*Surveys
*Simulations
*Recorded lectures, discussions, or live events
*Online Learning Communities and Discussion Forums (Singh, 2001)
According to Hew and Cheung there are 5 phases in the active construction of knowledge that exist (2003) and are traversed through asynchronous communication.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+
|-
| '''Phases''' || '''Real World Examples''' || '''K-12 Examples'''
|-
| '''Phase 1:''' Sharing and comparing of information.
| Statements of agreement or corroborating examples from one or more other participant. || Students can discuss an assignment with each other for clarification or share data to be analyzed as a group. 
|-
| '''Phase 2:'''  Discovery and exploration of dissonance or inconsistency among the ideas, or statements advanced by different participants.	
| Identifying and stating areas of disagreement or asking and answering questions to clarify the source and extent of the disagreements.	 || Multiple student participation ensures feedback with possible differing opinions.  Differences can be examined and analyzed while using the Internet for further clarification. 
|-
| '''Phase 3:'''  Negotiation of meaning.
| Negotiation of the meaning of terms or identification of areas of agreement or overlap among conflicting concepts.	 || Heterogeneous grouping would allow many students to share their “meaning” and define if for others.  Concepts can be explained at many different levels. 
|-
| '''Phase 4:'''  Testing and modification of proposed synthesis or co-construction.
| Testing the proposed synthesis against formal data collected or against contradictory information from the literature. || Students can peer edit each others work with no face-to-face threat, and may be more honest.  Students can collaborate on written assignments. 
|-
| '''Phase 5:''' Statement or application of newly constructed knowledge.	
| Summarising (sic) of agreements or students' self reflective statements that illustrate their knowledge or ways of thinking have changed as a result of the online interaction. || Students can analyze their group work/opinions/knowledge base and use this information to improve their own work. 
|}

	

These phases integrate with student goals in a traditional classroom and further extend student learning with the asynchronous component. Asynchronous discussions actively involve students and therefore improve communication between and amongst students and instructors.  Inherent complications would include lack of access to technology and lack of motivation by the students.</text>

===Designing a Lesson===

The keystone standards of blended learning are akin to other forms of learning. Identifying the objective, establishing the timescale, and recognizing different learning styles are basic principles found in any successful lesson plan. Streamlining the lesson plan comes with experience, as does determining appropriate applications of the lesson and its evaluation.

An online environment can foster close relationships between student and teacher and between student and other students. When students interact online, opportunities arise for the sharing of personal information and personal responses. Therefore, students must first understand that their classmates are to be treated with respect. Instructors should make clear what information might be confidential and what can be shared. In addition, students should understand that they are to use language appropriate to an academic forum and free of slang or jargon (the latter can be especially difficult when working in education academia). Students should also know how to invite, accept, and offer feedback in ways that promote learning.

With the preceding principles established, the focus turns to the design of the lesson itself. A sample outline follows. Only the main topics are mentioned here. Like a jazz score, this outline is a framework, not a crystallized prescription.  Practitioners are advised to start here and then improvise as their experience and proficiency develop.

I. Purpose Statement (the overall intent of the lesson plainly stated)

II. Duration

III. Prerequisites (if any)

IV. Learning Objectives

V. Content/Learning Activities (For each item of content to be addressed, show how it would be communicated to the students and the estimated time needed. This is by far the longest section of the design document.)

VI. Application of Learning Strategy

VII. Evaluation Strategy

The Purpose Statement gives an overall description of the lesson to be presented. It may include the concept to be taught and the means by which it may be delivered. Perhaps this statement will state how much of this lesson is to be performed online and how much is to be completed during a classroom session. The statement is usually concise, but divulges an overview of the entire lesson.

When making decisions about the design of a blended learning lesson plan, there will always be a need for determining an appropriate timetable. The lesson plan should be designed to include a balance of online and offline activities, but those activities must remain within reasonable time limits. Far too many teachers have made the mistake of heaping an excessive amount of online work on their students. Teachers are then accused of believing that theirs is the only class in which their students are currently enrolled. Balance is key. Too much of either component will cause the lesson or activity to either grow dull or become overly burdensome, thereby diminishing the learning aspect. At the same time, the lesson must include enough challenges to promote and instill the concepts being taught by the lesson. The balance is delicate, but the very nature of the flexibility of blended learning helps to maintain that balance. The duration portion of the lesson becomes streamlined after its first delivery. Ample time must be allowed to complete activities, but overplanning seems to be the wiser choice. Students and teachers alike find it awkward to have time remaining at the end of a lesson with no other learning planned. It is best to have too many activities planned for a session than to not have enough. You can always reduce the work load or save it for another time.

Prerequisite skills must be addressed by students and teacher. Offering a traditional lesson to those without previous skills to complete the new lesson leads to frustration for everyone concerned. Opportunities to learn using technology without previously learned technological skills will cause like frustration. Technical skills learned along with the academic concepts makes for a very efficient lesson, provided the academic goals and objectives are met. Technological skills are important, but should not distract from the academic portion of the lesson, but rather enhance it.

The learning objective is the meat of a lesson plan. It is the compass that guides the teacher throughout the lesson. When expressed to the students, it points the learner into the right direction as well. In a blended learning class, if the learning objective is rooted in a math concept, it is crucial that the teacher remain focused on that concept - not the technological means by which it may be taught. If a technical skill is being presented, that objective must be made clear in the lesson plan.

Content and Learning Activities must be introduced into the lesson plan and provided for ample practice if the student is to grasp the intent of the lesson. Looking back at the learning objectives and the &quot;Content/Learning Activities Outline&quot; can help answer evaluation questions. &quot;Is my test content-valid, based upon the methods of lesson presentation?&quot; &quot;Should my test include a short review time via a traditional classroom setting, or would an online review better prepare my students for evaluation?&quot; &quot;Should the test be performed online or in the presence of the teacher?&quot; Online tests make for easy and quick grading by the teacher. Security of the test, however, might be diminished depending on the software used by the teacher. Tests taken exclusively in the classroom setting, however, negate the natural lessons of technology. Teachers who evaluate their students' performances by using a mixture of tests - some online, some offline - have experienced more fruitful outcomes. Supplying examples to read as text online or offline proves to be helpful. Presenting video explanations or examples online, where students can view a snippet of the lesson repeatedly gives enough exposure to solidify an idea or concept. Any tool that can be afforded the student should be considered to improve retention.

The most crucial step needed in each lesson plan is the preparation of transfer of learning strategy. If learning is not transferred from the place of learning to practical application, there can be no positive return on investment of the time needed to create, implement, and evaluate the lesson plan. Students are smarter than we might think. If the lesson doesn't apply to something tangible or if it can't be used in real life, you can expect them to ask, &quot;When are we ever going to use this stuff?&quot; Make sure that your objectives are made clear to the students. The learning standards must be addressed, yes, but also find a real life application to better your students' understanding of the materials covered. If this is not done, much of your time, and your students' time, has been greatly wasted. A second look to ensure that students have indeed learned the objectives might trigger revisions, allowing for more (or better) class activities and teacher feedback. This should be done before any evaluation strategy. Technology is useful in simplifying this task of transferring the learning strategy. Many times a lesson taught with the use of online instruction or with technology as its main tool provides a built-in application. Students see more clearly how the concepts are used in real life situations, and because the lesson was applied practically, the student retains the information and skills much longer.

A blended learning class is like any other - when lessons are presented, it is imperative that assessment is given to check the depth of learning. Caution must be practiced when using online assessment. If this method was never practiced during the teaching of the lesson, the student finds himself at a bit of a disadvantage when being tested. Instead of devoting proper time to the non-technical concepts taught, the student might be fighting his way through the technical tool he must use to perform the task at hand. For example, students that have graduated from high school may need to take an assessment test at a nearby community college in order to be placed properly into a Math or English class. If the college issues an online test and the student has no past experience with such a method of testing, the scores can be expected to be lower, causing the student to be placed in an inappropriate level class. If online testing is to be used, pretests are advised to familiarize the students with the technical part of the test-taking task. Not doing so would seemingly violate the equity issue.

Identifying opportunities of learning in blended learning is the same as identifying any learning opportunity. The focus should remain, however. The K12 teacher must recognize the need to provide the right methods of teaching for his students. The overall intent of the lesson should also address the result of the lesson. Teachers may ask themselves, &quot;What exactly do I want my students to know as a result of this lesson?&quot; Be sure you understand the objectives of the lesson - many times they provide the basis for subsequent lessons. Outline the topics and subtopics that must be addressed by the lesson.

Blended learning is advantageous to the learner. Research has shown the limitations of applying a generalized style of teaching, rather than modifying lesson plans to fit the needs of the student. &quot;Increasingly, organizations are recognizing the importance of tailoring learning to the individual rather than applying a 'one-size-fits-all' approach.&quot; (Thorne, 2003) Of course, common needs exist, but blended learning allows the teacher to look for creative ways and use a variety of media to address the specific needs of his students.

When a teacher designs his lesson plan, it is important to note the type of learning activity (e.g. lecture, case study, role play, simulation, game, etc.) that best conveys the objectives of the lesson. There are two reasons for listing traditional teaching methods only at this point, instead of both classroom and online activities: 

#We as teachers usually establish on paper the &quot;ideal&quot; learning experience when you work under a more familiar, traditional style of teaching. It is live, face-to-face, instructor-facilitated and student-collaborative. 
#Once you have established the lesson plan for the &quot;ideal&quot; learning experience, you can systematically analyze the elements that can be delivered online without compromising learning effectiveness. You will discover here what might be best left in a classroom setting.

Blended learning is not simply adding an online component to a lesson plan. Technology in a lesson plan should be used wisely - to enhance the lesson. Technology should not be used just to show off technology. Excellent opportunities exist for teachers to make learning interactive, dynamic, and fun when used properly. The technology aspect of a lesson should be like a good baseball umpire - it (like the umpire) is good if it (he) goes unnoticed.

&quot;Since the intent of blended learning is to enhance learning by combining the best of both worlds...elements of the outline that appear to lend themselves to self-study online should be highlighted. Such elements tend to include easy-to-interpret, straightforward information that is relatively easy for the (student) to accurately grasp on his/her own.&quot; (Troha, 2003) Students should be able to perform required tasks online with little or no prompting by the instructor. Of course, teachers should guide their students along, but when a student can accomplish a task online with limited assistance, that student encounters a learning experience that is deeper and more rewarding.

Blended learning courses are dynamic by their very nature. Revisions will need to be made to adapt to the learning needs of its students. Knowing what works and what does not comes with experience. The best resource for K-12 teachers to create and implement a blended learning course is another teacher or a network of teachers who have had experience with launching such courses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once considered a thing for loners and desperate people, online dating is fast becoming just as widespread and socially acceptable as going to a nightclub. 



== Pros ==

* Saves money and time.
* For women: Male users tend to be in the majority on online dating sites
* If your tastes are very specific, you'll spend more time interacting with your target peers. There is no need to go to endless cocktail parties where nobody is interesting.
* Gives you a chance to practice courtship skills in a non-intimidating environment, without the danger of suffering public embarrassment

== Cons ==

* Communicating over instant messaging or email can be more time-consuming and tedious than talking to someone face to face.
* For men: Female users tend to be in the minority on online dating sites
* Online dating sites tend to attract a disproportionate number of single parents.
* Online dating sites tend to attract a disproportionate number of users from certain subcultures.
* It is hard to verify whether users are being insencere, however such users are a minority.


== The one-paragraph ad ==
In the context of discrete personal ads, such as [[w:craigslist|craigslist]] ([http://www.craigslist.org www.craigslist.org]) and the [[w:newspaper|newspaper]] classifieds it is modelled after, the format limits the amount of information you can share.  It's often customary to chat online using [[w:email|email]] or [[w:instant messaging|instant messaging]] to make up for this, without having to invest the effort of becoming dressed and going out to meet someone. The goal in writing an ad may be to present a topic that you're enthusiastic about in a way that's both interesting and accessible, or to describe some activity that a person might find appealing.  It's important that something stand out and catch the attention of a person, but feel free to try different &quot;hooks&quot; in several consecutive weeks if the first ad doesn't bring the kind of response you would want.

When you finally do make contact with a person, and it seems that there's mutual interest, try as much as possible to balance the conversation between talking about you, talking about the other person, and small talk about movies, sports, politics, or whatever your social group talks about most.

The goal is not to be an interrogator, but to discover a rough sense of the identity and appearance of the person. Suppose that you arrive at a bar or pub to find a person who is entirely unattractive, and whose career aspirations entirely counter your ideals. You might be able to have an interesting conversation and successful date, but only in the sense that you learn about what is important to you. One author of this book experienced such a scenario, and made a list of what was important: a good education, critical thinking skills, a humane way of thinking about strangers, and a single chin. Your own list may vary.

== Dating and networking sites ==
At social websites like [[w:Friendster|Friendster]] ([http://www.friendster.com www.friendster.com], [[w:Orkut|Orkut]] [http://www.orkut.com www.orkut.com], [[w:Myspace|Myspace]] ([http://www.myspace.com www.myspace.com]), and [[w:tribe.net|tribe.net]] ([http://tribe.net tribe.net]), there is room to present a lot of information, including who you know and the finer details of your interests. A profile on such a site is generally the same as one on a dating site like [[w:OkCupid|OkCupid]] ([http://www.okcupid.com www.okcupid.com]) or the many pay-for-communication dating sites; most of the same rules apply, except that some effort should be put into giving complete and honest answers to any &quot;match test&quot; or &quot;compatability questionaire&quot;. Persons are more likely to be interested if the computer says that you match them. There is also the chance that whoever wrote the personality test knew how to make such a test.

=== What is the difference between Free and Paying? ===

In general, paying sites advertise, and free sites don't. In fact, advertising is normally the main expenditure of paying sites; in effect you are paying them to advertise your profile to the largest possible audience on the web. Free sites rely on original web page designs, niche markets, and network effects to succeed.

Paying sites tend to have a bigger database of users. Free sites have fewer users signed up, but tend to be more casual, with many users joining for other reasons than dating, such as networking, fun, and taking tests. 

Before you decide to pay for dating online, do make sure that the database of your service of choice is large, otherwise you're wasting your money. An easy way to check is to verify traffic ranking of the dating site on alexa.com

=== Dos and Don'ts===

* Perhaps the most important thing is to post a good photo of yourself. If you know a good photographer, who really enjoys their work, you should consider asking them to take a picture of you the next time it's convenient. It really is an art form, and if you go to someone who knows what they are doing, the result will look more like you, and more datable as well.  Often, student photographers need models of &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; people for classes, so you can usually find someone who will work [[wikt:pro bono|pro bono]] even if they know you not personally. But, if the students that have projects due soon often accept anyone who will sit in front of a camera. Also make sure to include a portrait shot that shows your face clearly, as well as a full body shot. 

* Don't post pictures showing you amongst large groups of people. Remember that the user doesn't know you yet, so they'll have trouble to pick out which of the people is you.

* Also include some photos that reflect your personality. One author of this book posted a photo of a tiny paper crane perched on a coin, along with a note that the paper was smaller than a fingernail. Persons that like your photos will tend to like you.

* Go not into too much depth in listing your favorite bands or books. Fifteen or twenty examples is plenty; if they have that kind of attention span for your interests, it's best to talk with them face-to-face. Pare it down to the best in every general category, so that you can present the most important parts of each facet of your personality.

* Make sure your spelling, grammar, and punctuation is correct. At the very least run a spell checker through your profile. Do not write in txt spk, and do not use overuse &quot;lol&quot; and exclamation marks!!!!!!! You might think that spelling isn't that important, but remember that your picture and those few paragraphs of text are ''all'' the other user sees of you, so it's important to make the most of this small window. Bad English will give many users a bad first impression of you. Some users might not be fussy, but good English will certainly not put anyone off, so it doesn't hurt to use it.

* As in the rest of life, authenticity is important.  Let your quirks show.  There's such a (potentially) wide audience out there. Even if you think your traits are not popular, there is going to be that one person out there who is attracted to exactly those traits, and the more honest you are the more likely you are to find them. If all you say is that you're friendly and outgoing and that your interests include reading, pubs, clubs and movies, not only will your profile look like a million others, you aren't actually revealing much about yourself.

* Be yourself. Rather than lie about your flaws, show that you're a strong person by stating them openly, along with your strengths. Or simply leave them out if they're not that important. Trying to be &quot;a better version of you&quot; might attract more messages, but you'll just be wasting both parties' time once it comes to meeting the person.

* Do try to contact more than one person you may be interested in at a time. A given post may have been there for weeks or more. It may not be active anymore, she could be currently involved with someone she just met, and no longer responding to replies, or she may not be interested in you, etc. If you ask one woman out, then wait for several days for a reply, you may well have wasted/missed an opportunity to meet another woman. Alternatively, you may converse online with one and find out after a few cybermeetings that you two aren't hitting it off. You are not truly dating them until you are in person anyway, and success rates for meeting people online tend to be lower than in person- it is quite possible that it gets called off after a first real date or two. It is better to anticipate that this may occur and have another potential date in the wings than to have to start over again from scratch wooing another woman for several weeks before you finally meet. Worst case scenario, both of them do like you enough to have a long-term relationship, you would have to choose the one you liked more, and call it off with the other. This is not exactly a horrific position for you to be in. You don't have to tell her that she was second choice, and if you're doing your job right, she won't know.

* Don't use online dating as your sole channel of courtship. It should be a supplement to traditional ways of socialising, not a replacement.

== Meeting ==
Meeting someone for the first time can be a little uncomfortable, especially if neither person is really sure about interest. It is best to choose a place where a date can end suddenly without anyone losing face, such as a coffee shop or bar.

If you find that you are not interested in the person, do not arrange for future contact, or claim that you contact the person later, by telephone, email, or otherwise. Instead, finish your beverage, state that the meeting was nice, and wish a good day to the person.

=== Edit Image in External Program ===
This runs in linux (probably any unix), and launches The Gimp. It could probably be modified to launch Photoshop in windows.
&lt;br&gt;
In Gnome, KDE and Mac OS X, you can use a command to open documents using the default or a specified application.
* KDE: kfmclient openURL &lt;URL, relative or absolute path&gt;
* Gnome: gnome-open &lt;any URL or path Gnome understands&gt;
* Mac OS X: open [-a &lt;application name&gt;] &lt;path&gt;
Win32 has some open command too, maybe somebody could add this in.

=== Find Images ===
This script recursively searches for images that have broken files references.
&lt;br&gt;
It works by giving the user a root path, then finds and re-links all images within that path.
&lt;br&gt;
Its very useful when migrating projects to different computers.

=== Remove Double Images ===
This script finds images that are referenced more than once, and looks through all meshes texface's, and assigns only one of the images.
&lt;br&gt;
If a face has no users the image is removed.
&lt;br&gt;
This is useful because when an image is loaded more than once, it's also loaded into system memory and graphics card memory more than once, wasting resources.
&lt;br&gt;
Support for image type textures still needs doing.

=== Toon Material Batch Conversion Script  ===
this script changes *all* materials in your
currently open blend file to toon materials.
after executing, check the blender console
for script output.

as this script alters *all* of your material
settings in your currently opened blend file,
you should *not* run it on a project that has
not been saved yet!  changes made to materials
while using this script cannot be undone!

note: changes are not permanently committed
to your blend file unless you choose to save
your file after executing this script.

= Curve Functions =
=== Length of a curve===
This function gets the combined length of all edges. Most useful to get the length of a curve.
Be careful, because it will get the length of every curve in a curve object!

Note that this function doesn't take the object's transformation into account when getting the length.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import Mesh, Object
def curve_length(ob): # Can realy be any object
    me= Mesh.New()
    me.getFromObject(cu_ob.name)

    for ed in me.edges:
        # Blender 2.42 can simply do
        # totlength+= ed.length
        totlength+= (ed.v1.co-ed.v2.co).length

=== Desaturate Meshes VertCol ===
Uses the new Mesh module. In Blender 2.4 only. Desaturates using the same weighting as Photoshop uses.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import Mesh, Object
for ob in Object.GetSelected():
        if ob.getType() == 'Mesh':
                me = ob.getData(mesh=1)
                if me.faceUV:
                        for f in me.faces:
                                for c in f.col:
                                        # Weighted colour conversion, as used by photoshop.
                                        c.r = c.g = c.b = int(((c.r*30) + (c.g*59) + (c.b*11)) / 100.0)
&lt;/source&gt;


===Point inside a Mesh===
This function returns 1/0 depending on whether the provided point is inside a mesh. It relies on the mesh having a continuous skin, no holes in it. (Otherwise the problem doesn't make sense.)

It uses the method of seeing how many face intersections there are along a line segment between that point, and a point somewhere outside the meshs bounds.

An even number of intersections means it's outside, an odd for inside. Hence we '''return len(intersections) % 2''' where '''intersections''' generates a list of intersections.

This function uses a Z direction vector so we can save some CPU cycles by first doing an X/Y bounds test to see if the points could intersect, before doing a full ray intersection. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import *

def pointInsideMesh(ob, pt):
	Intersect = Mathutils.Intersect # 2 less dict lookups.
	Vector = Mathutils.Vector
	
	def ptInFaceXYBounds(f, pt):
			
		co= f.v[0].co
		xmax= xmin= co.x
		ymax= ymin= co.y
		
		co= f.v[1].co

=== Scanfill for importers ===
This function takes a mesh and a list of vert indicies representing an ngon.
It returns a list of tri indicies that make up the scanfilled face. This is much more useful for importers.

it also handles cases where scanfill does not work by returning a triangle fan.

It may be faster then using the mesh.fill() function on your original mesh because cycling editmode can be slow on a lot of data.
Another advantage with this function over simply using fill() is you can be sure the faces will be flipped the right way, according to the order of the indicies.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import *
def ngon(from_mesh, indicies):
	if len(indicies) &lt; 4:
		return [indicies]
	is_editmode= Window.EditMode()

	temp_mesh = Mesh.New()
	temp_mesh.verts.extend( [from_mesh.verts[i].co for i in indicies] )
	temp_mesh.edges.extend( [(temp_mesh.verts[i], temp_mesh.verts[i-1]) for i in xrange(len(temp_mesh.verts))] )
	
	oldmode = Mesh.Mode()
	Mesh.Mode(Mesh.SelectModes['VERTEX'])
	for v in temp_mesh.verts:
		v.sel= 1
	
	# Must link to scene
	scn= Scene.GetCurrent()
	temp_ob= Object.New('Mesh')
	temp_ob.link(temp_mesh)
	scn.link(temp_ob)
	temp_mesh.fill()
	scn.unlink(temp_ob)
	Mesh.Mode(oldmode)
	
	new_indicies= [ [v.index for v in f.v]  for f in temp_mesh.faces ]
	
	if not new_indicies: # JUST DO A FAN, Cant Scanfill
		print 'Warning Cannot scanfill!- Fallback on a triangle fan.'
		new_indicies = [ [indicies[0], indicies[i-1], indicies[i]] for i in xrange(2, len(indicies)) ]
	else:
		# Use real scanfill.
		# See if its flipped the wrong way.
		flip= None
		for fi in new_indicies:
			if flip != None:
				break
			
			for i, vi in enumerate(fi):
				if vi==0 and fi[i-1]==1:
					flip= 0
					break
				elif vi==1 and fi[i-1]==0:
					flip= 1
					break
		if flip:
			for fi in new_indicies:
				fi.reverse()
	
	if is_editmode:
		Window.EditMode(1)
	return new_indicies


# === ===== EG
scn= Scene.GetCurrent()
me = scn.getActiveObject().getData(mesh=1)
ind= [v.index for v in me.verts if v.sel] # Get indicies

indicies = ngon(me, ind) # fill the ngon.

# Extand the faces to show what the scanfill looked like.
print len(indicies)
me.faces.extend([[me.verts[ii] for ii in i] for i in indicies])
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Triangulate NMesh ===
This is a function to be used by other scripts, its useful if you want to make your life simpler by only dealing with triangles.
&lt;br&gt;
The shortest edge method is used for dividing the quad into 2 tri's.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def triangulateNMesh(nm):
	'''
	Converts the meshes faces to tris, modifies the mesh in place.
	'''
	
	#============================================================================#
	# Returns a new face that has the same properties as the origional face      #
	# but with no verts                                                          #
	#============================================================================#
	def copyFace(face):
		newFace = NMesh.Face()
		# Copy some generic properties
		newFace.mode = face.mode
		if face.image != None:
			newFace.image = face.image
		newFace.flag = face.flag
		newFace.mat = face.mat
		newFace.smooth = face.smooth
		return newFace
	
	# 2 List comprehensions are a lot faster then 1 for loop.
	tris = [f for f in nm.faces if len(f) == 3]
	quads = [f for f in nm.faces if len(f) == 4]
	
	
	if quads: # Mesh may have no quads.
		has_uv = quads[0].uv 
		has_vcol = quads[0].col
		for quadFace in quads:
			
			# Triangulate along the shortest edge
			if (quadFace.v[0].co - quadFace.v[2].co).length &lt; (quadFace.v[1].co - quadFace.v[3].co).length:
				# Method 1
				triA = 0,1,2
				triB = 0,2,3
			else:
				# Method 2
				triA = 0,1,3
				triB = 1,2,3
				
			for tri1, tri2, tri3 in (triA, triB):
				newFace = copyFace(quadFace)
				newFace.v = [quadFace.v[tri1], quadFace.v[tri2], quadFace.v[tri3]]
				if has_uv: newFace.uv = [quadFace.uv[tri1], quadFace.uv[tri2], quadFace.uv[tri3]]
				if has_vcol: newFace.col = [quadFace.col[tri1], quadFace.col[tri2], quadFace.col[tri3]]
				
				nm.addEdge(quadFace.v[tri1], quadFace.v[tri3]) # Add an edge where the 2 tris are devided.
				tris.append(newFace)
		
		nm.faces = tris
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Fix vertex winding in &quot;bowtie&quot; quads ===
Sometimes you may encounter quad faces which, although correctly coplanar, aren't quite &quot;full&quot;. This comes from the vertices being in the wrong order, and causes the face to overlap itself, often leaving undesired holes and black areas where the normals point the wrong way. To see what this all means, just make a plane and switch places for the vertices at any edge. The connecting edges will then cross. Since the normals of the face don't make sense in this situation, the script can't guarantee that the normal points outwards after finishing.

from Blender.Object import GetSelected
for obj in GetSelected():

      sortface(face)
    mesh.update()
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Remove Verts Without removing entire faces ===
Script that uses the mesh template above. removes verts but surrounding quads will be converted to tri's.&lt;br&gt;
''Note'' This only works with NMesh.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        #================#
        # EDIT MESH HERE #
        #================#
        for f in me.faces:
            face_verts = f.v[:] # make a copy of the list.
            for v in face_verts:
                if v.sel:
                    f.v.remove(v)
        
        # Remove all with less then 3 verts,
        # When removing objects from a list its best to loop backwards
        fIdx = len(me.faces)
        while fIdx:
            fIdx -=1
            f = me.faces[fIdx]
            if len(f.v) &lt; 3:
                del me.faces[fIdx]
        
        # Remove all selected verts
        # Loop backwards.
        vIdx = len(me.verts)
        while vIdx:
            vIdx -=1
            v = me.verts[vIdx]
            if v.sel:
                del me.verts[vIdx]
        #================#
        # FINISH EDITING #
        #================#
&lt;/source&gt;

=== GMesh AutoSmooth Mesh ===
This function uses GMesh to autosmooth manifold meshes, it requires the GMesh module.

Be careful because it will smooth your mesh in place, so make a copy of your original object if you don't want it modified.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import *
import GMesh

smooth = Draw.PupIntInput('smooth:', 20,1,89)

for ob in Object.GetSelected():
        mesh = ob.getData()
        gmesh = GMesh.NMesh2GMesh(mesh)

        try:
                gmesh.autoSmooth(smooth)
        except:
                print 'Error non manifold mesh'
                continue # go onto the next item

        mesh = GMesh.GMesh2NMesh(gmesh)

        # Make the faces smooth
        for f in mesh.faces:
                f.smooth = 1

        ob.link(mesh) # Link the new mesh with the original object
&lt;/source&gt;


=== ScanFill ===
To simulate typing &quot;Shift F&quot; in blender to create scanfill selected edge loop (edit mode only)

This will only work if the 3D view is open.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Blender

winid = Blender.Window.GetScreenInfo(Blender.Window.Types.VIEW3D)[0]['id']
Blender.Window.SetKeyQualifiers(Blender.Window.Qual.SHIFT)
Blender.Window.QAdd(winid, Blender.Draw.FKEY,1)
Blender.Window.QHandle(winid)
Blender.Window.SetKeyQualifiers(0)
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Expanded Scanfill function ===
Self contained scanfill function, based on the code above.
''Note, this function needs a 3D view to be available''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Blender

# Take a list of points and return a scanfilled NMesh
def scanFillPoints(pointList):
        Blender.Window.EditMode(0)

        nme = Blender.NMesh.New()
        # 2.37 compatability, not needed in 2.4
        if not nme.edges:
                nme.addEdgesData() 

        for p in pointList:
                v = Blender.NMesh.Vert( p[0], p[1], p[2] )
                nme.verts.append(v)
                v.sel = 1

                if len(nme.verts) &gt;= 2:
                        nme.addEdge(nme.verts[-2], nme.verts[-1])

        nme.addEdge(nme.verts[0], nme.verts[-1])


        scn = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()

        actOb = scn.getActiveObject()
        if actOb:
                actSel = actOb.sel
        else:
                actSel = 0


        ob = Blender.Object.New('Mesh')
        ob.link(nme)
        scn.link(ob)
        scn.layers = range(1,20)
        ob.sel = 1
        Blender.Window.EditMode(1)

        winid = Blender.Window.GetScreenInfo(Blender.Window.Types.VIEW3D)[0]['id']
        Blender.Window.SetKeyQualifiers(Blender.Window.Qual.SHIFT)
        Blender.Window.QAdd(winid, Blender.Draw.FKEY,1)
        Blender.Window.QHandle(winid)
        Blender.Window.SetKeyQualifiers(0)

        Blender.Window.EditMode(0)
        # scn.unlink(ob)

        # Select the old active object.
        if actOb:
                actOb.sel = actSel

        # Reture the scanfilled faces.
        return ob.getData()
&lt;/source&gt;
Example function usage.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
scanFillPoints([[-1,-1,0], [1,-1,1], [1,1,0], [0,0,0.2], [0,1,-.1], [0.1,1,-0.3] ])
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Copy NMesh Face ===
Returns a new face that has the same properties as the original face but with no verts
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def faceCopy(face):
  newFace = NMesh.Face()
  # Copy some generic properties
  newFace.mode = face.mode
  if face.image != None:
    newFace.image = face.image
  newFace.flag = face.flag
  newFace.mat = face.mat
  newFace.smooth = face.smooth
  return newFace
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Returns the Faces centre as a Vector ===
'''Note, Blenders Mesh API now has face.cent access'''

Take 1 NMFace and return a vector as its centre, will use an existing vector object &quot;cent&quot; if provided.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;				
def faceCent(f, cent=None):
	x = y = z = 0
	for v in f.v:
		x+=v.co[0]
		y+=v.co[1]
		z+=v.co[2]
	if not cent:
		return Mathutils.Vector([x/len(f.v), y/len(f.v), z/len(f.v)])
	
	# Modify the provided vec
	cent.x = x/len(f.v)
	cent.y = y/len(f.v)
	cent.z = z/len(f.v)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Flip Faces Up===
I used this script to flip all faces in many terrain meshes to point up.
It uses Mesh as opposed to NMesh.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Scale UVs===
Scales all uv coords for selected mesh objects.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import *
def main():
        # Scale the UV down.
        # This examples scales down by 1 pixel on a 512x512 image.
        shrink = 1-(1/512.0)

=== Find a material in all Meshes in all Scenes ===
Sometimes You have a lot of mesh object and materials you don't want any of them to use.
This script can help you find those objects.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!BPY

&lt;/source&gt;


=== Faces share an edge ===
The the 2 faces share an edge, its best to make sure your not comparing the same faces, and remove the first 'if'.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Do the 2 faces share an edge?
# return true or false.
def faceShareEdge(face1, face2):
	# Are we using the same verts. could be more comprehensive, since vert order may differ but still be the same.

	for v1 in face1:
		if v1 in face2:
			if firstMatch is None:
				firstMatch = True
			else:
				return True
	return False
&lt;/source&gt;

===Get Edge Angles===
Returns a list of angles, the combine angle difference of all faces that use the edges.
the angles returned are in sync with mesh.edges.
Edges with 0 or 1 faces will have Zero angle.

This function uses Blender.Mesh not Blender.NMesh mesh data.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def getEdgeAngles(me):

		for key in f.edge_keys:
			edges[key][1].append(f.no)
	
	edgeAngles=[0.0] * len(me.edges)
	for eIdx, angles in edges.itervalues():
		angles_len= len(angles)
		
		if angles_len &lt; 2:

= Math Functions =
Here is the place to add math examples, they can be blender specific or generic python math functions.

===Changing Rotation Axis Order===
If you ever have trouble converting between different rotation systems its possible that the order of rotations is the problem.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Blender
RotationMatrix= Blender.Mathutils.RotationMatrix

MATRIX_IDENTITY_3x3 = Blender.Mathutils.Matrix([1.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,1.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,1.0])
def eulerRotateOrder(x,y,z): 
	x,y,z = x%360,y%360,z%360 # Clamp all values between 0 and 360, values outside this raise an error.
	xmat = RotationMatrix(x,3,'x')
	ymat = RotationMatrix(y,3,'y')
	zmat = RotationMatrix(z,3,'z')
	# Standard BVH multiplication order, apply the rotation in the order Z,X,Y
	# Change the order here
	return (ymat*(xmat * (zmat * MATRIX_IDENTITY_3x3))).toEuler()
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Get Angle between 3 points ===
Get the angle between line AB and BC
where b is the elbow.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Blender
AngleBetweenVecs = Blender.Mathutils.AngleBetweenVecs

def getAng3pt3d(avec, bvec, cvec):
	try:
		ang = AngleBetweenVecs(avec - bvec,  cvec - bvec)
		if ang != ang:
			raise  &quot;ERROR angle between Vecs&quot;
		else:
			return ang
	except:
		print '\tAngleBetweenVecs failed, zero length?'
		return 0
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Point inside a tri (2D) ===
Returns True if pt is inside the triangle.
&lt;br&gt;
only gives a correct answer when pt lies on the triangles plane.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import Mathutils
SMALL_NUM = 0.000001
def pointInTri2D(pt, tri1, tri2, tri3):
	a = Mathutils.TriangleArea(tri1, tri2, tri3)

	if othera &gt; a: return False
	othera += Mathutils.TriangleArea(pt, tri2, tri3)
	if othera &gt; a: return False
	othera += Mathutils.TriangleArea(pt, tri3, tri1)
	if othera &gt; a: return False
	return True
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Apply Matrix ===
Applys a 4x4 transformation as returned by object.getMatrix(), to a vector (3d point in space)

This is useful for finding out the position of a vertex in worldspace.

Blender 2.43 supports this simply by doing &quot;newvwec = vec*matrix&quot; but its good to know how to do it manually
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

			x*matrix[0][1] + y*matrix[1][1] + z*matrix[2][1] + yloc,\
			x*matrix[0][2] + y*matrix[1][2] + z*matrix[2][2] + zloc

&lt;/source&gt;

=== 2D Line Intersection ===
Intersect 2 lines, if so where.

If there is no intersection the retured X value will be None and the y will be an error code.

The first line is ''(x1,y1, x2,y2),'' the second ''(_x1,_y1, _x2,_y2)''

=== Round to power of 2 ===
This function takes any number and rounds it to the nearest power of 2 value (2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048, 4096...)
This is useful for rounding textures to sized that load into graphics card memory.

It returns 3 values. rounded down, round closest, rounded up.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def roundPow2(roundVal):
	base2val = 1
	while roundVal &gt;= base2val:
		base2val*=2
	
	# dont round up if there the same, just give the same vars
	if roundVal == base2val/2:
		return base2val/2, base2val/2, base2val/2 # Round down and round up.
	
	
	smallRound = base2val/2
	largeRound = base2val
	
	# closest to the base 2 value
	diffLower = abs(roundVal - smallRound)
	diffHigher = abs(roundVal - largeRound)
	if diffLower &lt; diffHigher:
		mediumRound = smallRound
	else:
		mediumRound = largeRound
	
	smallRound = base2val/2
	largeRound = base2val
	
	return smallRound, mediumRound, largeRound # round down, round mid and round up.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Closest Point (snapping)===
Returns the vector that is closest to point. Good for snapping.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def getSnapVec(point, snap_points):
	'''
	Returns the closest vec to snap_points
	'''
	close_dist= 1&lt;&lt;30

=== Auto Buttons ===
Auto Buttons is a really easy way to add a stack of buttons into any script.
&lt;br&gt;
Add the AutoButtons text to the bottom of any script and any function ending with '''_bgui''' will have a button that calls it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# All functions to be displayed as buttons must use this suffix
GUI_SUFFIX= '_bgui'
BUTTON_LIST = [] # A list if dicts
EVENT = 1000
EVENTNUM = 1000

for func in dir():
	if func.endswith(GUI_SUFFIX):
		newButton = {}
		newButton['name'] = func[:-5].replace('_', ' ')[2:]
		newButton['func'] = func + '()'
		newButton['event'] = EVENT
		BUTTON_LIST.append( newButton )
		EVENT+=1
		
def draw_gui():
	# find the width of the widest button
	button_height = 16; button_width = 100; ROW = 0
	for button in BUTTON_LIST:
		Draw.PushButton(button['name'], button['event'], 0, button_height*ROW, button_width, button_height, ''); ROW+=1
def handle_event(evt, val):
	if evt in (Draw.ESCKEY, Draw.QKEY) and not val:
		Draw.Exit()
def handle_button_event(evt):
	if evt &gt;= EVENTNUM and evt &lt; EVENTNUM + len(BUTTON_LIST):
		exec(BUTTON_LIST[evt - EVENTNUM]['func'])
	else:
		print 'invalid', evt
Draw.Register(draw_gui, handle_event, handle_button_event)
&lt;/source&gt;


An example of a function that could use this
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def Print_Object_Selection_bgui():
	Blender.Draw.PupMenu('|'.join(ob.name for ob in Blender.Object.GetSelected()))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Popup Menu Wrapper ===
This script takes a string that you would normally give to '''Draw.PupMenu()''' splitting up the menus by the groupsize.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def PupMenuLess(menu, groupSize=30):
	'''
	Works like Draw.PupMenu but will add a more/less buttons if the number of
	items is greater then the groupSize.
	'''
	more = ['   more...']
	less = ['   less...']
	
	menuList= menu.split('|')
	
	# No Less Needed, just call.
	if len(menuList) &lt; groupSize:
		return Draw.PupMenu(menu)
	
	title = menuList[0].split('%t')[0]
	
	# Split the list into groups
	menuGroups = [[]]
	for li in menuList[1:]:
		if len(menuGroups[-1]) &lt; groupSize:
			menuGroups[-1].append(li)
		else:
			menuGroups.append([li])
	
	# Stores the current menu group we are looking at
	groupIdx = 0
	while True:
		# Give us a title with the menu number
		numTitle = [ ' '.join([title, str(groupIdx + 1), 'of', str(len(menuGroups)), '%t'])]
		if groupIdx == 0:
			menuString = '|'.join(numTitle + menuGroups[groupIdx] + more)
		elif groupIdx == len(menuGroups)-1:
			menuString = '|'.join(numTitle + less + menuGroups[groupIdx])
		else: # In the middle somewhere so Show a more and less
			menuString = '|'.join(numTitle + less + menuGroups[groupIdx] + more)
		result = Draw.PupMenu(menuString)
		# User Exit
		if result == -1:
			return -1
		
		if groupIdx == 0: # First menu
			if result-1 &lt; groupSize:
				return result
			else: # must be more
				groupIdx +=1
		elif groupIdx == len(menuGroups): # Last Menu
			if result == 1: # Must be less
				groupIdx -= 1
			else: # Must be a choice
				return result + (groupIdx*groupSize)
			
		else:	
			if result == 1: # Must be less
				groupIdx -= 1
			elif result-2 == groupSize:
				groupIdx +=1
			else:
				return result - 1 + (groupIdx*groupSize)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Iterate Multiple Lists ===
Sometimes you want to loop over more than 1 list at once. if the lists your dealing with are large then creating a new list for the purpose can be slow and use too much memory.
This class takes multiple lists and treats them like 1 big list. without having to make a new list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
type_list= type([])
type_tuple= type(())
class listIter:

			raise StopIteration
		idx=self.idx
		lidx=self.lidx
		self.idx+=1
		if self.idx==len(self.lists[self.lidx]):

&lt;/source&gt;

Some examples
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in listIter( (range(10), range(22), range(5)) ):
	print i
&lt;/source&gt;
Another example that takes verts from 3 meshes and adds them to 1 mesh using this iterator and list comprehension.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Blender import Mesh
newme= Mesh.New()

# Using the iterator
newme.verts.extend( [v.co for v in listIter((me1.verts, me2.verts, me3.verts))] )

# Without the iterator
newme.verts.extend( [v.co for v in me1.verts ] )
newme.verts.extend( [v.co for v in me2.verts ] )
newme.verts.extend( [v.co for v in me3.verts ] )
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Binary Conversion (Without Struct) ===
Thanks to  SJH 07/29/2004 20:26:03
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
nybblechr_to_01_dqs={'-':'-','0':'0000', '1':'0001', '2':'0010', '3':'0011',
                             '4':'0100', '5':'0101', '6':'0110', '7':'0111',
                             '8':'1000', '9':'1001', 'A':'1010', 'B':'1011',
                             'C':'1100', 'D':'1101', 'E':'1110', 'F':'1111'}

# Binary to char
def b2c(b):
	chr(int(b,2))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Randomize List ===
Returns a randomized list.
'''Note''' if you can import random, use random.shuffle(ls) instead.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def randList(ls):
	lsCopy = ls[:]
	randList = []
	lenList = len(lsCopy)
	while lenList != len(randList):
		randIndex = int( Noise.random() * len(lsCopy)  )
		randList.append( lsCopy.pop( randIndex ) )
	return randList
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Remove Doubles in List ===
Removes doubles in a list, modifying the original list. (will use an objects cmp() function)
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def RemDoubles(List):
	lIdx = 0
	while lIdx &lt; len(List):
		if List.count(List[lIdx]) &gt; 1:
			List.pop(lIdx)
			continue
		lIdx+=1
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Remove Doubles in List (Hash) ===
Return a new list with no doubles.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def RemDoublesHash(myList):
	return list(set(myList))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Get flag properties of a sum ===
A lot of properties in Blender are flags and stored in a sum of exponentials of 2. To find out that a specific flag is set and it is included in the sum try this function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def powList(self, x):
	tmpx = x
	exp = 0
	expList = []
	while tmpx != 0:	
		tmp = 2**exp
		if tmp &gt; tmpx:
			elem = 2**(exp-1)
			expList.append(elem)
			tmpx -= elem	
			exp = 0
		else:
			exp += 1; 
	return expList
&lt;/source&gt;

Call the function in that way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
lmp = Lamp.Get(thisObj.data.getName())
lmpMode = lmp.getMode()
lmpFlags = self.powList(lmpMode)
if 16 in lmpFlags:
	...
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Fraction Data Type ===
Allows creation of fraction data and all operations on them within the real number system.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class fraction:
	# Types without importing type - Does not retuire a python install.
	type_float = type(0.1)
	type_int = type(1)
	
	def __init__(self, num, den=1):
		if den == 0:
			raise ValueError, 'Division by zero'
		g = self.gcd(num, den)
		self.num = num / g
		self.den = den / g

	def __str__(self):
		return &quot;%d/%d&quot; % (self.num, self.den)

		if type(other) is fraction.type_int:
			other = fraction(other)
		elif type(other) is fraction.type_float:
			return self.eval() * other
		if not isinstance(other, fraction):
			raise ValueError, 'Unsupported operand type for multiply operation ' + str(type(other))
		return fraction(self.num * other.num, self.den * other.den)

	__rmul__ = __mul__

	def __add__(self, other):
		if type(other) is fraction.type_int:
			other = fraction(other)
		elif type(other) is fraction.type_float:
			return self.eval() + other
		if not isinstance(other, fraction):
			raise ValueError, 'Unsupported operand type for addition operation ' + str(type(other))
		num = self.num * other.den + self.den * other.num
		den = self.den * other.den
		return fraction(num, den)

	def __cmp__(self, other):
		if type(other) is fraction.type_int or type(other) is fraction.type_float:
			return self.eval() - other
		if not isinstance(other, fraction):
			raise ValueError, 'Comparative operation no supported for operand ' * type(other)
		return (self.num * other.den - other.num * self.den)

	def __neg__(self):	
		return fraction(self.num * -1, self.den)

	def __invert__(self):
		return fraction(self.den, self.num)

	def __sub__(self, other):
		return self + -other

	def __rsub__(self, other):
		return other + -self

	def __div__(self, other):
		return fraction(self.num, self.den) * fraction(other.den, other.num)
	
	def __rdiv__(self, other):
		return fraction(self.den, self.num) * fraction(other.num, other.den)
	
	def __pow__(self, other):
		if type(other) is fraction.type_int:
			return fraction(self.num ** other, self.den ** other)
		elif type(other) is fraction.type_float:
			a = self.eval()
			if a &gt; 0:
				return a ** other
			else:
				raise ValueError, 'Negative number raised to fractional power'
		if not isinstance(other, fraction):
			raise ValueError, 'Unsupported operand type for exponential operation ' + str(type(other))
		return self.eval() ** other.eval()

	def gcd(self, m, n):
		if m % n:
			return self.gcd(n, m % n)
		return n
		
	
	def eval(self):
		return float(self.num) / self.den

##### Usage: #####

a = fraction(3, 4)
b = fraction(5, 6)
print a * b
print a - 3
print a ** b

#invalid - raising a negative number to a fractional power
print (-a)**b
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Get a name with sane chars===
This function can be used when you are making a filename from an object/mesh/scene... name.
Blender supports many characters in a name that a filesystem may not.

saneFilechars replaces these characters with &quot;_&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def saneFilechars(name):
	for ch in ' /\\~!@#$%^&amp;*()+=[];\':&quot;,./&lt;&gt;?\t\r\n':
		name = name.replace(ch, '_')
	return name
&lt;/source&gt;

= Colour Scripts =
A place for scripts that deal with colours.

=== RGB to HSV ===
Convert Red/Green/Blue to Hue/Saturation/Value

r,g,b values are from 0.0 to 1.0

h = [0,360], s = [0,1], v = [0,1]

if s == 0, then h = -1 (undefined)

''The Hue/Saturation/Value model was created by A. R. Smith in 1978. It is based on such intuitive color characteristics as tint, shade and tone (or family, purety and intensity). The coordinate system is cylindrical, and the colors are defined inside a hexcone. The hue value H runs from 0 to 360º. The saturation S is the degree of strength or purity and is from 0 to 1. Purity is how much white is added to the color, so S=1 makes the purest color (no white). Brightness V also ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is the black.''

===Compress All Blend files (Unix Only)===
Sine blender 2.41, support for GZip compression has been integrated into blender.
So you can gzip all blend files and they will still open as expected.

This utility searches your hard-disk for blend files and gzips them if they are not already compressed.

Note: python3 required.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;math&gt; v^2 \equiv \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} = v_0^2 (2  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}}  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} - \hat{\mathbf{a}}) + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) + 2 \| \mathbf{v} \| \| \mathbf{v_0} \| (\hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \hat{\mathbf{a}} - \hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}} \hat{\mathbf{v_0}}).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} = v_0^2 (2  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}}  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} - \hat{\mathbf{a}}) + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;
Because (at least from what i think is going on) &lt;math&gt; (\hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \hat{\mathbf{a}} - \hat{\mathbf{v}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{a}} \hat{\mathbf{v_0}}) &lt;/math&gt; is 0, because of the commutativity of the dot product.

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} = v_0^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} (2  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \cdot  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} - 1) + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;
By the distributive property of the dot product.

But &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} \cdot  \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} &lt;/math&gt; is 1, since &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{v_0}} &lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector.

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} = v_0^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} (2 - 1) + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}} = v_0^2 \hat{\mathbf{a}}  + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;


By definition,
&lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{a}} = \frac{\mathbf{a}}{\| \mathbf{a} \|} &lt;/math&gt;

so

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \frac{\mathbf{a}}{\| \mathbf{a} \|} = v_0^2 \frac{\mathbf{a}}{\| \mathbf{a} \|}  + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;


Multiplying through by &lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{a}\|&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \mathbf{a} = v_0^2 \mathbf{a}  + 2 \| \mathbf{a} \| \| \mathbf{a} \| (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;


Assuming we have defined &lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{x} \| &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}} &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; v^2 \mathbf{a} = v_0^2 \mathbf{a}  + 2  \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ) &lt;/math&gt;

which is:

&lt;math&gt;   \mathbf{a} \cdot (v^2  - v_0^2 - 2  \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ))  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Since the stuff in the parens is a scalar, either the acceleration is 0 or the stuff in the parens is. Assuming a nonzero acceleration:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \neq \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

than

&lt;math&gt; (v^2  - v_0^2 - 2  \mathbf{a}  \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} ))  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

which implies:

&lt;math&gt; v^2  = v_0^2 + 2  \mathbf{a} \cdot  (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r_0} )) &lt;/math&gt;

Which is _not_ useless, since this equation is not dependant on time.

&quot;&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = v_{xf}\Delta t + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} (v_{xf}-v_{xi}) \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;

This simplifies to:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = (v_{xi} + \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} v_{xf} - \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} v_{xi})\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;&quot; 

Is this right? Does &lt;math&gt;v_{xf}&lt;/math&gt; simplify to &lt;math&gt;v_{xi}&lt;/math&gt;? 

I changed it to &lt;math&gt;v_{xi}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

There is a serious error in example 2.
: I am not sure exactly what you mean by this:  the example is itself illustrating that there is a possible error.  I think what is written is OK [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 04:20, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

== Example 2 ==

I agree about Example 2. It is an improper integral but to me it is incorrect to say it diverges. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus answer is correct in this case (which is ln(1)-ln(3) = -ln(3) btw, not ln(5/3)). Perhaps a different example to avoid going into why it converges in this case.</text>

'''Lynn's Veggie Salad''' is a light vegetable salad with a dash of spice to it.

== Ingredients ==

* 1/2 cup (120g) of diced [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1/2 cup (120g) of chopped [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1 cup (240g) of shredded [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
* 1/2 (120g) cup of cubed [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
* 4-6 chopped [[Cookbook:Green Beans|green beans]]
* 4-6 chopped yellow beans
* 1 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green pepper]]
* 3 chopped [[Cookbook:Walnuts|walnuts]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* 1/2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Chives|chives]]
* 1/2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==

# Cut the green pepper into long thin strips.
# Toss vegetables together in a large bowl.
# Using a mortar grind the spices together, sprinkle over salad.
# Sprinkle walnut chunks over salad.
# Serve.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* One can easily substitute the cubes of tomato for cherry tomatoes or plum tomatoes, however, these both have seeds in them and the bitterness is often undesirable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Coordinate systems =
There are several ways of assigning coordinates to a system. Which one you choose depends on what is happening within the system.

== Fixed Rectangular coordinates ==

In this coordinate system, vectors are expressed as an addition of vectors in the x, and y, direction from a non-rotating origin. Usually &lt;math&gt;\vec i \, \!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] in the x direction, and &lt;math&gt;\vec j \, \!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the y direction.

The position vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec s \, \!&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\vec r \, \!&lt;/math&gt;), the velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec v \, \!&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[acceleration]] vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec a \, \!&lt;/math&gt; are expressed using rectangular coordinates in the following way:

&lt;math&gt;\vec s = x \vec i + y \vec j&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec v = \dot {s} = \dot {x} \vec {i} + \dot {y} \vec {j}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \vec a = \ddot {s} = \ddot {x} \vec {i} + \ddot {y} \vec {j}&lt;/math&gt;

Note: 
&lt;math&gt; \dot {x} = \frac{dx}{dt} &lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt; \ddot {x} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Rotating coordinates ==
Unlike rectangular coordinates which are measured relative to an origin that is fixed and non rotating, the origin of these coordinates can rotate and translate - often following a particle on a body that is being studied.

This system of coordinates is based on three [[orthogonal]] unit vectors: the vector &lt;math&gt; \vec i&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector &lt;math&gt; \vec j &lt;/math&gt; which form a [[basis]] for the plane in which the objects we are considering reside, and &lt;math&gt;\vec k&lt;/math&gt; about which rotation occurs.

===Derivatives of Unit Vectors===
The position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of a given point can be expressed using these coordinate systems, but we have to be a bit more careful than we do with fixed frames of reference. Since the frame of reference is rotating, we must take the derivatives of the unit vectors into account when taking the derivative of any of these vectors. If the coordinate frame is rotating at a rate of &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega \, \!&lt;/math&gt; in the counterclockwise direction (that's &lt;math&gt; \omega \vec k&lt;/math&gt; using the [[right hand rule]]) then the derivatives of the unit vectors are as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\dot \vec i = \omega \vec k \times \vec i = \omega \vec j &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot \vec j = \omega \vec k \times \vec j = - \omega \vec i &lt;/math&gt;

===Position, Velocity, and Acceleration===
Given these identities, we can now figure out how to represent the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of a particle using this coordinate system.

====Position====
Position is straightforward:

&lt;math&gt;\vec s =  x \vec i + y \vec j&lt;/math&gt;

It's just the distance from the origin in the direction of each of the unit vectors.

====Velocity====
Velocity is the time derivative of position:

&lt;math&gt;\vec v = \frac{d\vec s}{dt} = \frac{d (x \vec i)}{dt} + \frac{d (y \vec j)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[chain rule]], this is:

&lt;math&gt;\vec v = \dot x \vec i + x \dot \vec i + \dot y \vec j + y \dot \vec j&lt;/math&gt;

Which from the identities above we know to be:

&lt;math&gt;\vec v = \dot x \vec i + x \omega \vec j + \dot y \vec j - y \omega \vec i = (\dot x - y \omega) \vec i + (\dot y + x \omega) \vec j&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

&lt;math&gt;\vec v = (\dot x \vec i + \dot y \vec j) + (y \dot \vec j + x \dot \vec i) = \vec v_{rel} + \vec \omega \times \vec r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec v_{rel}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle relative to the coordinate system.

====Acceleration====
Acceleration is the time derivative of velocity.

We know that:

&lt;math&gt;\vec a = \frac{d \vec v}{dt} 
= \frac{d \vec v_{rel}}{dt} + \frac{d (\vec \omega \times \vec r)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \vec v_{rel}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; part. &lt;math&gt;\vec v_{rel}&lt;/math&gt; has two parts we want to find the derivative of: the relative change in velocity (&lt;math&gt;\vec a_{rel}&lt;/math&gt;), and the change in the coordinate frame (&lt;math&gt;\omega \times \vec v_{rel}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \vec v_{rel}}{dt} = \vec a_{rel} + \omega \times \vec v_{rel}&lt;/math&gt;

Next, consider &lt;math&gt;\frac{d (\vec \omega \times \vec r)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. Using the chain rule:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d (\vec \omega \times \vec r)}{dt} = \dot \vec \omega \times \vec r + \vec \omega \times \dot \vec r &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot \vec r&lt;/math&gt; we know from above:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d (\vec \omega \times \vec r)}{dt} = 
\dot \vec \omega \times \vec r + 
\vec \omega \times (\vec \omega \times \vec r) +
\vec \omega \times \vec v_{rel} &lt;/math&gt;

So all together:

&lt;math&gt;\vec a =  \vec a_{rel} + \omega \times \vec v_{rel} + 
\dot \vec \omega \times \vec r + 
\vec \omega \times (\vec \omega \times \vec r) +
\vec \omega \times \vec v_{rel} &lt;/math&gt;

And collecting terms:

&lt;math&gt;\vec a =  \vec a_{rel} + 2(\omega \times \vec v_{rel}) + 
\dot \vec \omega \times \vec r + 
\vec \omega \times (\vec \omega \times \vec r)&lt;/math&gt;

In this coordinate system, vectors are expressed as an addition of vectors in the x, y, and z direction from a non-rotating origin. Usually &lt;math&gt;\vec i \, \!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] in the x direction, &lt;math&gt;\vec j \, \!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the y direction, and &lt;math&gt;\vec k \, \!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the z direction.

The position vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec s \, \!&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\vec r \, \!&lt;/math&gt;), the velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec v \, \!&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[acceleration]] vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec a \, \!&lt;/math&gt; are expressed using rectangular coordinates in the following way:

&lt;math&gt;\vec s = x \vec i + y \vec j + z \vec k \, \!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec v = \dot {s} = \dot {x} \vec {i} + \dot {y} \vec {j} + \dot {z} \vec {k} \, \! &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \vec a = \ddot {s} = \ddot {x} \vec {i} + \ddot {y} \vec {j} + \ddot {z} \vec {k} \, \! &lt;/math&gt;

Note: 
&lt;math&gt; \dot {x} = \frac{dx}{dt} &lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt; \ddot {x} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Chapter 4'''
==verses 1-6==
1 Now &lt;s&gt;as soon as&lt;/s&gt; the &lt;s&gt;Lord&lt;/s&gt; &lt;span
style='font-size:8.0pt'&gt;&lt;B&gt;LORD&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was aware that the Pharisees had heard &lt;s&gt;it said&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;the report&lt;/B&gt;, &quot;Jesus is gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,&quot;

2 &lt;s&gt;though&lt;/s&gt; (&lt;B&gt;and yet&lt;/B&gt; Jesus Himself did not baptize &lt;s&gt;them&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;the people&lt;/B&gt;, but His disciples did.)

3 &lt;B&gt;So&lt;/B&gt;, He left Jud&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt;ea and returned to Galilee.

4 His &lt;s&gt;road lay&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;route went&lt;/B&gt; through Samaria,

5 and &lt;s&gt;so&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;on the way&lt;/B&gt;, He came to Sychar, a town in Samaria near the &lt;s&gt;piece&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;parcel&lt;/B&gt; of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6 &lt;s&gt;Jacob's Well&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;The spring bearing Jacob’s name&lt;/B&gt; was there: and accordingly, Jesus, tired out &lt;s&gt;with&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;from&lt;/B&gt; His journey, sat down by the well to rest. It was about &lt;B&gt;the&lt;/B&gt; noon &lt;B&gt;hour&lt;/B&gt;.

==verses 7-12==
7 Presently, &lt;s&gt;there came&lt;/s&gt; a woman of Samaria &lt;B&gt;came&lt;/B&gt; to draw water &lt;B&gt;and&lt;/B&gt; Jesus asked her to give Him some water &lt;B&gt;to drink&lt;/B&gt;; 

8 for His disciples were &lt;B&gt;away, having&lt;/B&gt; gone &lt;B&gt;in&lt;/B&gt;to the town to buy provisions. 

9 &quot;How is it,&quot; replied the woman, &quot;that a &lt;s&gt;Jew&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Judean&lt;/B&gt; like you asks me, &lt;s&gt;who am&lt;/s&gt; a Samaritan woman, for water?&quot; (For &lt;s&gt;Jews&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Judeans&lt;/B&gt; have no dealings with Samaritans.) 

10 &lt;B&gt;Jesus answered by saying,&lt;/B&gt; &quot;If you had known God's free gift&lt;s&gt;,&quot; replied Jesus, &quot;&lt;/s&gt; and who it is that said &lt;s&gt;to you&lt;/s&gt;, `Give me some water,' you would have asked Him, and He, &lt;B&gt;in turn&lt;/B&gt;, would have given you living water.&quot; 

11 &quot;Sir,&quot; she said, &quot;you have no &lt;s&gt;thing&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;vessel&lt;/B&gt; to draw with, and the well is deep; so &lt;s&gt;where can&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;where do&lt;/B&gt; you get &lt;s&gt;the&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;this&lt;/B&gt; living water &lt;s&gt;from&lt;/s&gt;? 

12 Are you greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well, and &lt;B&gt;who&lt;/B&gt; himself drank from it, as did &lt;s&gt;also&lt;/s&gt; his sons and his &lt;s&gt;cattle&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;livestock&lt;/B&gt;?&quot;

==verses 13-18==
13 &lt;s&gt;&quot;Every one,&quot; replied&lt;/s&gt; Jesus answered her saying, &quot;All who drink this water will thirst again; 

14 but those who drink the water that I give them will never, ever thirst; for what I give a person will become a fountain within of water welling up to eternal Life.&quot; 

15 &quot;Sir,&quot; said the woman, &quot;give me that water, that I may never be thirsty, nor &lt;s&gt;continually&lt;/s&gt; be coming &lt;s&gt;all the way&lt;/s&gt; here &lt;B&gt;continually&lt;/B&gt; to draw from the well.&quot; 

16 &quot;Go &lt;s&gt;and&lt;/s&gt; call your husband,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;and &lt;B&gt;then&lt;/B&gt; come back.&quot; 

17 &quot;I have no husband,&quot; she replied. &quot;You &lt;s&gt;rightly say that you have no husband&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;spoke well&lt;/B&gt;,&quot; said Jesus; 

18 &quot;for you have had five husbands, and the man you &lt;s&gt;have&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;are with&lt;/B&gt; at present is not your husband. &lt;s&gt;You have spoken the&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;There is&lt;/B&gt; truth in &lt;B&gt;what you say.&quot;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;saying that.&quot;&lt;/s&gt;

==verses 19-24==
19 &quot;Sir,&quot; replied the woman, &quot;I see that you are a prophet. 

20 Our forefathers worshipped &lt;s&gt;on&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;in&lt;/B&gt; this mountain, but you &lt;s&gt;Jews&lt;/s&gt; say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.&quot; 

21  &quot;&lt;u&gt;Believe&lt;/u&gt; me,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 

22 You worship that of which you know nothing. We worship that which we know; for salvation comes from the &lt;s&gt;Jews&lt;/s&gt; Judeans. 

23 But a time is coming--indeed, has already come--when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for indeed the Father desires such worshippers. 

24 God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&quot;

==verses 25-30==
25 &quot;I know,&quot; replied the woman, &quot;that Messiah is coming--`the Christ,' as He is called. When He has come, He will tell us everything.&quot; 

26 &quot;I am He,&quot; said Jesus--&quot;I who am now talking to you.&quot; 

27 Just then His disciples came, and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. Yet not one of them asked Him, &quot;What are you seeking?&quot; or &quot;Why are you talking with her?&quot; 

28 So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went away to the town, and called the people. 

29 &quot;Come,&quot; she said, &quot;and see a man who has told me everything I have ever done. Can this be the Christ, do you think?&quot; 

30 They left the town and made their way to see Him.
 
==verses 31-36==
31 Meanwhile the disciples were urging Jesus. &quot;Rabbi,&quot; they said, &quot;eat something.&quot; 

32 &quot;I have food to eat,&quot; He replied, &quot;of which you do not know.&quot; 

33 So the disciples began questioning one another. &quot;Can it be,&quot; they said, &quot;that some one has brought Him something to eat?&quot; 

34 &quot;My food,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;is to be obedient to Him who sent me, and to accomplish His work. 

35 Are you not saying, `It wants four months yet to the harvest?’ But look round, I tell you, and observe these plains—how they are ripe for the harvest. 

36 Already the reaper is getting pay and gathering in a crop in preparation for eternal Life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.
 
==verses 37-42==
37 in this you see the real meaning of the saying, `One sows, but another reaps.' 

38 I have sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your own labours. Others have laboured, and you are getting the benefit from their labour.&quot; 

39 Of the Samaritan population of that town a good many &lt;u&gt;believed&lt;/u&gt; in Him because of the woman's statement when she declared, &quot;He told me all that I have ever done.&quot; 

40 When the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. 

41 Then a far larger number of people &lt;u&gt;believed&lt;/u&gt; because of His own words, 

42 and they said to the woman, &quot;We no longer &lt;u&gt;believe&lt;/u&gt; in Him simply because of your statement; we have now heard for ourselves, and we know that this really is the Saviour of the world.&quot;
 
==verses 43-48==
43 After the two days He departed, and went into Galilee; 

44 though Jesus Himself declared that a prophet has no honour in his own country. 

45 So when He reached Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed Him eagerly, having been eye-witnesses of all that He had done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for they also had been to the Festival. 

46 So He came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. Now there was a certain official of the King's court whose son was ill at Capernaum. 

47 Having heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he came to Him and begged Him to go down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death. 

48 &quot;Unless you and others see signs and marvels,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;nothing will induce you to &lt;u&gt;believe&lt;/u&gt;.&quot;
 
==verses 49-54==
49 &quot;Sir,&quot; pleaded the official, &quot;come down before my child dies.&quot; 

50 &quot;You may return home,&quot; replied Jesus; &quot;your son is alive.&quot; He &lt;u&gt;believed&lt;/u&gt; the words of Jesus, and started back home; 

51 and he was already on his way down when his servants met him and told him that his son was alive. 

52 So he inquired of them at what hour he had shown improvement. &quot;Yesterday, about one o'clock,&quot; they replied, &quot;the fever left him.&quot; 

53 Then the father recollected that that was the time at which Jesus had said to him, &quot;Your son is alive,&quot; and he and his whole household became &lt;u&gt;believers&lt;/u&gt;. 

54 This is the second miracle that Jesus performed, after coming from Judaea into Galilee.

|4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If you knew the &lt;i&gt;gift of God&lt;/i&gt;, and who it is that says to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.

|4:18 For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your &lt;i&gt;husband&lt;/i&gt;: in that said you truly.

|4:21 Jesus says unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when all of you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

|4:22 All of you worship all of you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
|&amp;nbsp;
|22 You worship that of which you know nothing. We worship that which we know; for salvation comes from the Judeans.

|-
|4:23 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit (o. pneuma) and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.

|23 But a time is coming--indeed, now is&amp;mdash;when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for  the Father desires such worshippers.

|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:27 And &lt;i&gt;upon this&lt;/i&gt; came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you? or, Why talk you with her?
|Upon &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;this juncture&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;epsilon;&amp;pi;&amp;iota;&lt;/b&gt; (1909) &lt;b&gt;&amp;tau;&amp;omicron;&amp;upsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;omega;&lt;/b&gt;
|27 Just then His disciples returned, and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. Yet none of them asked, &quot;What do you need from her?&quot; or &quot;Why speak with her?&quot;

|4:28 The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and says to the men,

|28 So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and called the people.

|30 They left the town and went out to see Him.

|-
|4:31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.

|31 Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, &quot;Rabbi,&quot; they said, &quot;eat something.&quot;

|-
|4:32 But he said unto them, I have food to eat that all of you know not of.

|32 &quot;I have food to eat,&quot; He replied, &quot;of which you have no knowledge.&quot;

|-
|4:33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him ought to eat?
|&amp;nbsp;
|33 So the disciples questioned one another. &quot;Can it be,&quot; they said, &quot;that someone has given Him something to eat?&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:34 Jesus says unto them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

|34 &quot;My food,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;is to be obedient to HIM who sent me, and to accomplish HIS work.

|4:35 Say not all of you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

|35 Would you not say, `It wants four months yet to the harvest?’ But look around, I tell you, and observe these plains&amp;mdash;how they are ripe for the harvest.

|4:36 And he that reaps receives ''wages'', and gathers fruit unto life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.
|Reward&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;mu;&amp;iota;&amp;sigma;&amp;theta;&amp;omicron;&amp;nu;&lt;/b&gt; (3408)
|36 Already the reaper is receiving recompense and gathering in a crop to prepare for eternal Life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.
|&lt;small&gt;Jesus: the Sower&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|4:37 And herein is that saying (o. logos) true, One sows, and another reaps.

|37 Here you have the real meaning of the saying, `One sows, but another reaps.'

|-
|4:38 I sent you to reap that whereon all of you bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and all of you are entered into their labours.
|&amp;nbsp;
|38 I have sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your own labors. Others have labored, and you benefit from their labor.&quot;

|-
|4:39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying (o. logos) of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
|&amp;nbsp;
|39 A good many of the Samaritan population of that town &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/font&gt; in Him because of the woman's testimony when she declared, &quot;He told me all that I have ever done.&quot;

|-
|4:40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.

|40 When the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them; and He stayed two days.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:41 And many more believed because of his own word; (o. logos)

|41 Then a considerable number of the people &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/font&gt; because of His own words,

|-
|4:42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the &lt;i&gt;Saviour&lt;/i&gt; of the world.
|Savior&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;Sigma;&amp;omega;&amp;tau;&amp;eta;&amp;rho;&lt;/b&gt; (4990)
|42 And they said to the woman, &quot;We no longer &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; in Him just because of your testimony; we have now heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world, the Christ.&quot;

|4:43 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
|&amp;nbsp;
|43 He departed after two days there, and went into Galilee;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.
|&amp;nbsp;
|44 Though Jesus Himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
|&amp;nbsp;
|45 When He reached Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all that He had done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for many of them had been there also.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
|&amp;nbsp;
|46 So Jesus came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. Now there was a certain royal official whose son was ill at Capernaum.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
|&amp;nbsp;
|47 Having heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he came and begged Him to go and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except all of you see signs and wonders, all of you will not believe.
|&amp;nbsp;
|48 Jesus said, &quot;Unless you and others see signs and marvels, nothing will convince you to &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt;.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:49 The nobleman says unto him, Sir, come down before my child die[s].
|&amp;nbsp;
|49 &quot;Sir,&quot; pleaded the official, &quot;come, before my child dies.&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;KJV &quot;ere my child die.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|4:50 Jesus says unto him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word (o. logos) that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
|&amp;nbsp;
|50 &quot;You may return home,&quot; replied Jesus; &quot;your son is alive.&quot; The man &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/font&gt; the words of Jesus, and went back home; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives.
|&amp;nbsp;
|51 And he was well on his way down to Capernaum when his servants met him and told him that his son was alive.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|52 So he inquired of them at what time the son had recovered. &quot;Yesterday, about one o'clock,&quot; they replied, &quot;the fever left him.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|4:53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his &lt;i&gt;whole house&lt;/i&gt;.
|Family [household]&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;omicron;&amp;iota;&amp;kappa;&amp;iota;&amp;alpha;&lt;/b&gt; (3614)
|53 Then the father knew that was the time when Jesus said, &quot;Your son lives,&quot; and he and his whole family became &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believers&lt;/font&gt;.
|&amp;nbsp;

|4:54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.

In English, we sometimes say things like:
Q1. &quot;Whose pen is that?&quot;
Q2. &quot;Whose mother picks up the kids?&quot;
Q3. &quot;Whose father died?&quot;
Q4. &quot;Whose friend is in trouble&quot;

And the answers go something like this:
A1.&quot;That's my pen.&quot;
A2. &quot;Fred's mother picks up the kids.&quot;
A3. &quot;My best friend's father died.&quot;
A4. &quot;His best friend is in trouble.&quot;

But sometime people can't give different types of answers:
X1. &quot;I don't know.&quot;
X2. &quot;What?! Someone picks up the kids from school?! I thought they walked home.&quot;
X3. &quot;I think John's father died.&quot; (the speaker is not certain)
X4. &quot;No one is in trouble.&quot;


So how do we say &quot;Whose&quot; like it was in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. Well, instead of saying whose in Arabic we say&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لـمن &lt;/font&gt;(li-man). Recall that&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لِـ &lt;/font&gt;(li) is a preposition meaning &quot;for&quot;, as in &quot;He spoke for John.&quot; And recall that&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; من &lt;/font&gt;(man) means &quot;who&quot; but only in a question so it kind of means &quot;who?&quot;. So instead of saying &quot;Whose&quot;, we say something that literally translates to &quot;for-who&quot;.

So let's try to translate Q1.
&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;لـمن &lt;/font&gt;will start the sentence instead of &quot;whose&quot;.

(Joel had put &quot;bone thingy&quot; in the '''tools''' section)
:do you mean a bone folder? Also, a paperknife can serve as a bone folder, and is an important book making tool by itself. A paper knife is any unserrated knife, an old fashioned butterknife will work, but is usually a little smaller, while metal spatulas are often too large and a little too flexible.

(and from the '''types of binding''' section)
- also stiff leaf is a simple binding, this is the binding of old, old photo albums, it's &quot;leafs&quot; have a little measurable width to them, and the binding only involves the leafs, several cuts of book cloth and PVA. Here's a picture:http://itsnt166.iowa.uiowa.edu/YAH-DP/01112005.html

It seems like I may have to make pictures or illustrations of this one myself. Or one of you could do it. 
In doing other simple Japanese stitch styles we could move more into the proper kinds of thread and paper neccessary for accurate recreations of early Japanese books. Also, perhaps there should be something in &quot;perfect binding&quot; on restoring your own paperback books, but should I assume access to a guillotine?
:I've been in touch with a binding press maker who has a nice page up on bookbinding techniques, focusing on the fan gluing.  Hopefully he will decide to release his work: he has quite a few good photos on [http://www.temperproductions.com/how_to.htm his site].

:You probably shouldn't assume access to a guillotine, but there's [http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/book/trim.html a nice alternative] on Douglas Jones's website.  His current license is quite relaxed already, so perhaps we should ask him about licensing it to the GFDL.

== Bradel binding ==

The Wikipedia article [[Wikipedia: Bradel binding]] claims that &quot;Wikibooks has more on the topic of: Bradel binding&quot;.
Alas, when I click on that link, I get a page that says &quot;Bradel binding ... No results found at Wikibooks.&quot;
Is there information about what Wikipedia calls Bradel binding anywhere in Wikibooks -- perhaps under some other name?

Patients are typically managed with bile duct stent placement to resolve/prevent malignant obstruction and jaundice. Role of radiotherapy is palliative, and involves both EBRT as well as brachytherapy. There are no prospective randomized studies to show benefit, but a number of single institution retrospective studies suggest palliative advantage. Similarly, the role of combined modality therapy is still under investigation. Photodynamic therapy appears to offer survival advantage over supportive care. Some long-term survival (20% at 4-years) with chemoradiotherapy (intraarterial 5-FU).


==External Beam RT==
The role of external beam RT in this setting is not clear. There are no randomized studies; most reports are single institution retrospective analyses. Some studies show some benefit (symptom relief and survival), while other do not. Some studies also show benefit for higher dose (&gt;45 Gy).


For EBRT literature review, please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bile_duct/Unresectable_Disease/EBRT|Unresectable Disease/EBRT]] page.

==3D-CRT / IMRT==
*'''U Chicago''' PMID 15145161 -- ''Intensity-modulated radiotherapy in treatment of pancreatic and bile duct malignancies: toxicity and clinical outcome.'' ('''2004 Milano''' MT, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jun 1;59(2):445-53.)
**25 patients (21 pancreas, 3 bile duct, 1 pancreatic neuroectodermal); median follow-up 10.2 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In this hypothesis-generating analysis, the acute and chronic toxicity profile with IMRT in the treatment of pancreatic and bile duct cancer was encouraging. Local control was not compromised, despite efforts to increase conformality and avoid doses to normal structures. Distant failure remains a major obstacle in pancreatic cancer.&quot;

*'''Sikoku Japan''' PMID 15553012 -- ''Impact of pretreatment cholinesterase level on survival of inoperable intrahepatic or hepatic-hilar carcinomas treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy'' ('''2004 Hamamoto''' Y, Radiat Med. 2004 Sep-Oct;22(5):316-23.)
**Retrospective. 35 patients with HCC, intrahepatic cholangio and hilar cholangio treated with 3D-CRT (mean 51.5 Gy); mean follow-up 11 months
**2-year OS: HCC 19% vs. intrahepatic 26% vs. hilar 39%
**Pre-treatment cholinesterase value only multivariate prognostic variable (p&lt;0.01)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Pre-3DCRT cholinesterase value was a significant independent prognostic indicator for survival. Benefit of dose escalation above 60 Gy could not be demonstrated.&quot;

*'''MD Anderson 2000-03''' PMID 15234062 -- ''Daily ultrasound-based image-guided targeting for radiotherapy of upper abdominal malignancies.'' ('''2004 Fuss''' M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jul 15;59(4):1245-56.)
**Retrospective. 62 patients with upper abdominal CA treated with IMRT (10 cholangio/GB)
**Daily BAT U/S measurements in 1337 patient setups, mean setup time 4.6 min
**Mean shift from skin mark position: 4.9, 6.0, and 6.0 mm (x, y, z)
**Proportion alignments corrected by &gt;10, &gt;15, &gt;20 mm: 49%, 25%, 13%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Daily US-guided BAT targeting for patients with upper abdominal tumors was feasible in the vast majority of attempted setups. This method of US-based image-guided tumor targeting has been successfully implemented in clinical routine. The observed improved daily repositioning accuracy might allow for individualized reduction of safety margins and optional dose escalation. Compared with the established application of the BAT device for prostate radiotherapy, in which the target can be directly visualized, the TV in the present study was predominantly positioned relative to guidance vascular structures in close anatomic relation. We perceived an enormous potential in improved and individualized patient positioning for fractionated radiotherapy and also for stereotactic extracranial radiotherapy and radiosurgery, especially for tumors of the liver and pancreas.&quot;

*'''Erlangen Germany''' PMID 15592694 -- ''Chemoradiation May Prolong Survival of Patients with Non-Bulky Unresectable Extrahepatic Biliary CarcinomaA Retrospective Analysis.'' ('''2004 Brunner''' TB, Strahlenther Onkol. 2004 Dec;180(12):751-757.)
**Retrospective. 98 pts treated with stenting alone or chemoradiation (3D-CRT 50.8 Gy + 5-FU/Gemcitabine)
**Median survival: overall 11.8 months, stenting alone 9.3 months, chemoradiation 16.5 months (p=NS)
**Chemoradiation median survival: &lt;40mm tumor 21.4 months vs. &gt;40mm tumor 8.7 months (p=0.01). Toxicity reasonable.
**Conclusion: &quot;Inclusion criteria for future CRT trials should be based on tumor size at diagnosis: patients otherwise eligible for CRT should only be included with an inoperable tumor &lt;/= 40 mm, while patients with larger tumors may only benefit from palliation by stenting.&quot;

*'''Guangzhou China''' PMID 14625193 -- ''[Therapeutic effect of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy on hilar cholangiocarcinoma] - [Article in Chinese]'' ('''2003 Wu''' DH, Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2003 Nov;23(11):1217-8.)
**Retrospective. 21 patients treated with 3D-CRT
**52% achieved CR or PR, 3-year OS: 14%
**Complications: 8 (38%) duodenal ulcer, 4 (19%) died of GI bleeding
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;3D-CRT can be considered as a valuable palliative approach for unresectabe hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and effective management of the late complications of radiotherapy play a key role in increasing survival rates of the patients.&quot;

*'''Bordeaux France''' PMID 11899677 -- ''[Conformal therapy of locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma of the main bile ducts] - [Article in French]'' ('''2002 Bouras''' N, Cancer Radiother. 2002 Feb;6(1):22-9.)
**Retrospective. 23 patients, 8 after radical resection (R0 but LN+), 7 after microscopic margins (R1), 7 not resected. Dose 45-50 Gy, followed by boost up to 60 Gy; concomittant chemo in 15 cases
**Late toxicity: stenosis of duodenum, stenosis of biliary anastamosis, 2 cholangitis deaths
**Median survival (5-year OS): 16.5 months (7%); similar among subgroups
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Conformal radiochemotherapy delivering 60 Gy represents a valuable palliative approach in locally advanced biliary carcinoma.&quot;

*'''Hokkaido Japan''' PMID 10974464 -- ''High-speed magnetic resonance imaging for four-dimensional treatment planning of conformal radiotherapy of moving body tumors.'' ('''2000 Shimizu''' S, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Sep 1;48(2):471-4.)
**High speed MRI to look at movement of implanted fiduciary markers during normal breathing
**Movement: average 10.6mm CC, 5.2 mm lateral, 4.6 mm AP
**If PTV determined during exhalation +10mm margin, CTV not covered in 19% of images
**If PTV determined during inhalation +10mm margin, CTV not covered in 36% of images
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Four-dimensional treatment planning using high speed MRI, and integrating time and spatial information, has the potential to determine the planning target volume of moving body tumors more precisely than does conventional CT planning.&quot;

*'''Review''' PMID 10436827 -- ''Conformal irradiation for hepatobiliary malignancies.'' ('''1999 Gunderson''' LL, Ann Oncol. 1999;10 Suppl 4:221-5.)
**Data presented from U Michigan. Conformal high dose EBRT (48-72.6 Gy) for (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) to potentially increase local control and survival, over what would be expected with lower dose EBRT.

*'''U Michigan''' PMID 9392548 -- ''A phase I trial of hepatic arterial bromodeoxyuridine and conformal radiation therapy for patients with primary hepatobiliary cancers or colorectal liver metastases.'' ('''1997 Robertson''' JM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Dec 1;39(5):1087-92.)
**Phase I conformal EBRT with dose escalation of BrDU. Unresectable primary hepatobiliary CA or liver mets. RT dose (24, 48, 66) determined by fractionated volume of liver irradiated. 41 patients (18 CRC liver mets, 16 cholangiocarcinoma and 7 hepatoma)
**Response rates were not improved compared to our previous experience.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The appropriate dose of HA BrdU for Phase II evaluation is 25 mg/kg/day. Neither the hepatic parenchyma nor the gastrointestinal mucosa appeared to be sensitized by this method of BrdU administration. It is anticipated that these, or still newer methods of therapy, can improve treatment results in the near future.&quot;

*'''U Michigan''' PMID 8742902 -- ''3-D conformal radiation therapy in upper gastrointestinal cancer. The University of Michigan experience.'' ('''1996 Lawrence''' TS, Front Radiat Ther Oncol. 1996;29:221-8.)
**No Abstract

*'''U Michigan''' PMID 8391066 -- ''Treatment of primary hepatobiliary cancers with conformal radiation therapy and regional chemotherapy.'' ('''1993 Robertson''' JM, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jul;11(7):1286-93.)
**Retrospective. 26 patients treated with concurrent intraarterial FdUrd and conformal RT (1.5-1.65 Gy/fx bid, dose 48-72.6 Gy), 6 diffuse HCC, 11 localized HCC, 9 cholangiocarcinoma
**Median survival for localized disease: 19 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These findings suggest that three-dimensional planned focal liver radiation and IAH FdUrd can produce a high, durable response rate and an encouraging median survival duration in patients with nondiffuse, unresectable primary hepatobiliary cancer.&quot;

==Stereotactic radiosurgery==
*'''Stanford''' [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2089.pdf ASTRO Abstract] ''Phase I Dose Escalation Study of CyberKnife Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Liver Malignancies'' ('''2005 Lieskovsky''' YC, ASTRO 2005 #2089)
**Phase I. 6 patients/7 tumors (1 IH-CCA, 7 mets). Tumors &lt;5cm. Treatment delivered with motion tracking of implanted fiducials
**Dose escalation: 3 tumors with 18 Gy, 4 tumors with 22 Gy. MTD not reached. Toxicity: 1 GI Grade 1
**Response: 4 PR
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Results thus far indicate that single fractions of 18 and 22 Gy are safe to administer to liver tumors with the CyberKnife. We have not yet reached the MTD at 22 Gy. We plan to dose-escalate to 30 Gy.&quot;

*'''Freiburg Germany''' PMID 16097074 -- ''Klatskin tumor treated by inter-disciplinary therapies including stereotactic radiotherapy: a case report.'' ('''2005 Becker''' G, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 Aug 21;11(31):4923-6.)
**Case report. 1 patient with Stage III unresectable Klatskin tumor
**Total dose 48 Gy (3X4 Gy/wk), therapy was well tolerated. 
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In the context of inter-disciplinary treatment concepts, this radiotherapy technique is a promising choice of treatment for patients with hilar CCC.&quot;

==Brachytherapy==
Literature review is available at the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bile_duct/Unresectable_Disease/Brachytherapy|Unresectable Disease/Brachytherapy]] page. There are several dozen retrospective single-institution studies. Overall, the trend is toward BT having some benefit in terms of obstruction, and even survival. Howerver, randomized trials are lacking.

==Intraoperative RT==
*'''Mayo''' PMID 1341262 -- ''Intraoperative radiotherapy for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma--the Mayo Clinic experience.'' ('''1992 Monson''' JR, Surg Oncol. 1992 Aug;1(4):283-90.)
**Retrospective. 13 patients treated with EBRT + IORT + stenting
**Local failure in 50%; morbidity related to biliary sepsis and GI complications
**Median survival: 16.5 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Although the median survival of 16.5 months seemed to be an improvement over our previous results for ERT alone or ERT with 5-fluorouracil, the survival data are still discouraging.&quot;

*'''Tsukuba Japan''' PMID 2830731 -- The role of intraoperative radiation therapy in the treatment of bile duct cancer. (1988 Iwasaki, World J Surg. 1988 Feb;12(1):91-8.)
**81 patients. 50 resected (33 surgery, 14 +IORT, 3 +PORT). 31 not resected (6 +IORT, 4 +EBRT)
**IORT (20 Gy) not used in curative resection (1 pt), only with incomplete resection (13 pts) or PTCD (6 pts)
**2-year OS: Non-curative resection + IORT 17.1% vs. resection alone 9.0%


*'''Tsukuba Japan''' PMID 7427860 -- ''Intraoperative radiotherapy for advanced carcinoma of the biliary system.'' ('''1980 Todoroki''' T, Cancer. 1980 Nov 15;46(10):2179-84.)
**Case report 5 pts. IORT (25-30 Gy) for unresectable patients
**Mean survival: 10.9 months (2 patients living 16+ and 18+ months)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Intraoperative radiotherapy increased the effectiveness and length of palliation for the unresectable lesion.&quot;


==Proton therapy==
*'''PSI; 2000''' PMID 10924999 -- &quot;The role of proton therapy in the treatment of large irradiation volumes: a comparative planning study of pancreatic and biliary tumors.&quot; (Zurlo A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Aug 1;48(1):277-88.)
**Treatment planning. 4 patients (2 pancreatic, 2 biliary). IMRT vs PT vs IMPT. RT 50 Gy + 20 Gy boost
**Outcome: Protons better dose conformality to PTV and better dose homogeneity, except in post-op case
**Conclusion: Proton therapy superior dose distribution compared to IMRT

==Combined Modality==
*'''Italy 1991-97''' 
**PMID 16242254 -- ''Chemoradiation and brachytherapy in biliary tract carcinoma: long-term results.'' ('''2005 Deodato''' F, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Oct 18; [Epub ahead of print])
***22 patients (17 unresectable, 5 residual; 13 perihilar, 8 distal, 1 GB) treated with EBRT (39.6-50.4 Gy) + 5-FU; 12 also BT (30-50 Gy @ 1cm)
***45% Grade I/II GI toxicity; 2 with EBRT + BT developed duodenal ulceration
***Median survival: unresectable tumors 13.0 months (EBRT+BT) or 22.0 (EBRT alone), p=NS
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This study confirmed the role of concurrent chemoradiation in advanced biliary carcinoma; the role of intraluminal brachytherapy boost remains to be further analyzed in larger clinical trials.&quot;
**PMID 10705013 -- ''Combined modality treatment in unresectable extrahepatic biliary carcinoma.'' ('''2000 Morganti''' AG, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2000; 46:913-9.)
***20 patients with noncurative, nonmetastatic disease treated with EBRT (39.6-50.4 Gy), 19 also received 5-FU. 12 (60%) received ILRT (30-50 Gy) boost
***Median survival: 21.2 months; distant mets in 50% of patients
***2 patients with EBRT + ILRT developed late duodenal ulceration
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our data suggest that chemoradiation plus intraluminal brachytherapy was relatively well-tolerated, and resulted in reasonable local control and median survival.&quot;

*'''Feldkirch Austria''' PMID 16101189 -- ''Radiotherapy and razoxane in advanced bile duct carcinomas.'' ('''2005 Rhomberg''' W, Anticancer Res. 2005 Sep-Oct;25(5):3613-8.
**Prospective. 23 patients EBRT (median 48 Gy) + radiosensitization with razoxane
**Overall response rate 64%, local control 75%. 
**Side effects: N/V Grade I/II in 61%, leukopenia Grade III/IV 9%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Combined radiotherapy and razoxane led to local response rates which are superior to data from the literature when radiotherapy alone is used. Obstacles to the treatment were complications of the disease and frequent metastasis.&quot;

*'''Washington University 1999-2002''' PMID 15923794 -- ''A phase II study of alternating cycles of split course radiation therapy and gemcitabine chemotherapy for inoperable pancreatic or biliary tract carcinoma.'' ('''2005 Lin''' LL, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun;28(3):234-41.)
**Phase II. 42 patients (40 pancreas, 1 GB, 1 CCA) treated with 3 6-wk courses: (gemcitabine x 2 weeks, 1 week break, RT 50.4 Gy x2 weeks, 1 week break) x 3 courses; followed by resection if response
**Toxicity: 4 patients Grade 3/4 toxicity
**10 PRs, 6 underwent resection; Median survival: 9.5 months (2-32.5)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Alternating cycles of split-course radiotherapy and gemcitabine chemotherapy permits the delivery of full doses of both modalities with acceptable tolerance.&quot;

*'''Tokyo Japan''' PMID 16015690 -- ''Thermo-chemo-radiotherapy for advanced bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''2005 Kamisawa''' T, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 Jul 21;11(27):4206-9.)
**Retrospective. 8 patients advanced disease and obstructive jaundice, treated with RT + RF heating to 42C + 5-FU+Cisplatin/MTX
**Mean survival: 13.2 months, 4 patients &gt;20 months. 3CR / 2PR / 3 no change
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Although the number of cases is rather small, TCRT in the treatment of locally advanced bile duct carcinoma is promising in raising local control and thus, long-term survival.&quot;

*'''Erlangen Germany''' PMID 15592694 -- ''Chemoradiation May Prolong Survival of Patients with Non-Bulky Unresectable Extrahepatic Biliary CarcinomaA Retrospective Analysis.'' ('''2004 Brunner''' TB, Strahlenther Onkol. 2004 Dec;180(12):751-757.)
**Retrospective. 98 pts treated with stenting alone or chemoradiation (3D-CRT 50.8 Gy + 5-FU/Gemcitabine)
**Median survival: overall 11.8 months, stenting alone 9.3 months, chemoradiation 16.5 months (p=NS)
**Chemoradiation median survival: &lt;40mm tumor 21.4 months vs. &gt;40mm tumor 8.7 months (p=0.01). Toxicity reasonable.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Inclusion criteria for future CRT trials should be based on tumor size at diagnosis: patients otherwise eligible for CRT should only be included with an inoperable tumor &lt;/= 40 mm, while patients with larger tumors may only benefit from palliation by stenting.&quot;

*'''Oita Japan 1993-2002''' PMID 15160347 -- ''Radiotherapy combined with transarterial infusion chemotherapy and concurrent infusion of a vasoconstrictor agent for nonresectable advanced hepatic hilar duct carcinoma.'' ('''2004 Matsumoto''' S, Cancer. 2004 Jun 1;100(11):2422-9.)
**Retrospective. 23 patients treated with EBRT (mean 41.4 Gy) + transarterial infusion of epirubicin/mitomycin C/5-FU
**Response rate 41%. OS 1 year (59%), 2 years (36%), and 3 years (18%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The combination of radiotherapy, transarterial infusion chemotherapy, and concurrent infusion of a vasoconstrictor can be delivered safely with good efficacy for patients with advanced hilar duct carcinoma.&quot;

*'''Italy''' PMID 12972696 -- ''Concomitant gemcitabine (Gemzar) and extended nodes irradiation in the treatment of pancreatic and biliary carcinoma: a phase I study.'' ('''2003 Morganti''' AG, Onkologie. 2003 Aug;26(4):325-9.)
**Phase I dose escalation. 15 patients (5 after radical resection). EBRT using 3F technique + gemcitabine short infusion once/week
**No dose-limiting toxicity at gemcitabine 100-250mg/m2. 3 DLTs at 300 mg/m2
**6 patients stable disease, 4 patients progressive disease
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Based on this study, the recommended dose for weekly short infusional gemcitabine combined with radiation therapy to the tumor and lymph nodes is 250 mg/m(2). This value is suggestive of a correlation between acute toxicity and inclusion of lymph nodes in the irradiated volume.&quot;

**Retrospective. 52 patients treated with RT +/- chemo. Pts grouped by dose: 30 Gy (52%) vs. 36-50.4 Gy (27%) vs. 54-85 Gy (21%). Additionally, 73% received protracted venous 5-FU infusion
**Median time to radiographic progression: 9 months vs. 11 months vs. 15 months (p=NS)
**Median survival: 10 months
**No variables (RT dose, chemo, grade, size) had influence on progression or OS
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The primary limitation of definitive chemoradiation was local progression. Although the small patient numbers limited the statistical power of this study, a suggestion of improved local control was found with the use of higher RT doses.&quot;

*'''Mie Japan''' PMID 11788896 -- ''Clinical efficacy of brachytherapy combined with external-beam radiotherapy and repeated arterial infusion chemotherapy in patients with unresectable extrahepatic bile duct cancer.'' ('''2002 Nomura''' M, Int J Oncol. 2002 Feb;20(2):325-31.)
**Retrospective. 17 patients treated with BT alone (5), BT+EBRT (12), HA infusion (1), or HA infusion+BT+EBRT (6)
**Mean survival: BT alone 4.6 months vs. HA infusion+BT 16.2 months (p&lt;0.01)
**RT &gt;50 Gy resulted in radiation gastritis
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Brachytherapy combined with external-beam radiotherapy and repeated hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy increases survival compared with brachytherapy alone in patients with unresectable bile duct cancer.&quot;

**Retrospective. 22 patients (11 HCC and 11 cholangio) with unresectable tumors, treated with concurrent HA FdUrd + conformal EBRT (48-66 Gy)
**Median survival (4-year OS): 16 months (20%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Combined conformal RT and HA FdUrd can produce long-term freedom from hepatic progression and survival in patients with unresectable, nondiffuse primary hepatobiliary malignancies. There were no long-term liver complications observed.&quot;

**Phase I. 27 patients (pancreas 19, BD 7, GB 1). EBRT split course 40 Gy (20 Gy in 10 fxs, 2 weeks, 20 Gy in 10 fxs) + 5-FU (300-375) + folinic acid. 
**Toxicity: 8 patients Grade 3/4, 4 did not complete treatment, 2 treatment deaths to septic neutropenia
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This protocol is poorly tolerated by elderly patients or those with poor performance status, and 350 mg/m2/day is our recommended dose for 5FU as given in this protocol.&quot;

**Retrospective. 48 patients treated, 24 received RT (EBRT mean 46Gy + ILRT 192Ir mean 25 Gy) + CT (5FU +/- Adriamycin/Mitomycin)
**Mean survival (2-year OS): no RT 5.5 mo (17%) vs. CMT 12 mo (30%) p=0.01
**Mean survival (2-year OS): RT &lt;55 Gy 6 mo (0%) vs. RT &gt;55 Gy 24 mo (48%) p=0.003. Dose response suggested
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;A dose response is shown with more than double the 2-year and median survival for doses &gt; 55 Gy. A brachytherapy dose of 25 Gy, plus 44-46 Gy external beam is well tolerated. High dose combined brachytherapy and external beam radiation (60-75 Gy) appears to be the most effective modality for extrahepatic bile duct cancer.&quot;

**Phase I. 19 patients. Gemcitabine 100mg/m2 24 hour infusion on day 1, 8, 15 q28 days until progression
**Response: 6% PR, 61% SD. Median OS 7.5 months
**Toxicity: moderate myelosuppression
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Weekly 24-hour gemcitabine at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is well tolerated. There was a relatively high rate of disease control for a median duration of 5.3 months (range 2.8-18.8 months). However, the objective response rate of this regimen in gallbladder and biliary tract carcinomas was limited.&quot;

==Photodynamic Therapy==
*'''CHUV Switzerland''' PMID 14598251 -- ''Successful photodynamic therapy for nonresectable cholangiocarcinoma: a randomized prospective study.'' ('''2003 Ortner''' ME, Gastroenterology. 2003 Nov;125(5):1355-63.)
**Prospective randomized open-label. 39 patients with unresectable CCA, 20 to stenting + PDT vs. 19 to stenting alone
**Median survival: stent + PDT 16.4 months vs. stent alone 3.3 months (p&lt;0.001); Also improvement in biliary drainage and quality of life
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;PDT, given in addition to best supportive care, improves survival in patients with NCC. The study was terminated prematurely because PDT proved to be so superior to simple stenting treatment that further randomization was deemed unethical.&quot;</text>

==Ecology of Species==
'''Ecology is the scientific study of the interrelations between the living organisms and their environment including both the abiotic and biotic factors with emphasis on the interspecific and intraspecific relations between them.'''

'''Outline the factors that affect the distribution of plant species including temperature, water, light, soil pH, salinity, and mineral nutrients.'''
:*High temperature denatures enzymes and retards growth of plants; the rate of transpiration (loss of :water) is also increased. Low temperatures decrease enzyme activity and freezing temperatures inactivate enzymes. Most plants live in moderate temperature zones.
:*Water is needed for enzyme activity, transport, photosynthesis, support, and many other things. There is a low diversity of plants in deserts and polar regions.
:*Light is important for photosynthesis and flowering. Dark areas have small numbers of plants.
:*Soil pH is important for absorption of nutrients. If soil is acidic, desertification can occur; the use of limestone can neutralise the soil.
:*Salinity has an affect on the absorption through osmosis. High salinity causes plants to lose water through osmosis. Halophytes live in high salinity.
:*Mineral nutrients are needed for many vital functions. Nitrogen is needed to manufacture proteins, enzymes, nucleotides, vitamins, and other compounds. Phosphorous is used in the formation of phospholipid and other structures.

'''Explain the factors that affect the distribution of animal species including temperature, water, breeding sites, food supply and territory.'''
:*Temperatures affect the concentration of animals. Only especially adapted organisms can live in extreme temperatures.
:*Water is needed for vital functions, so only animals that can conserve water are found in deserts.
:*Breeding sites are needed for growth and protection of young. Some need specific areas to breed. High animal diversity is found in areas with varied topographical nature.
:*Food supply is important for survival since animals are heterotrophs. High animal diversity is once again found in the rain forest.
:*Some animals are territorial and need large areas for feeding, mating, and protecting their young. Some are territorial during breeding season and occupy areas to prevents others from approaching them. There is high animal distribution where there is room to occupy territory and defend against other members of the species. 

'''Deduce the significance of the difference between two sets of data using calculated values for t and the appropriate tables.'''
:* The t-test can be used to measure whether there is a significant difference between the means of two populations. For example if you measure the weight of rabbits on two islands the t-test formula will work out whether there is a significant difference based on the difference between the means and the degree of variation among them. A table of critical t values is used to determine the probability that the difference is simply random chance.

'''Explain what is meant by the niche concept, including an organism's spatial habitat, its feeding activities and its interactions with other organisms.'''
:* A niche is all the characteristics, biotic and abiotic, specific to a species. It includes the habitat, nutrition, and relationships. For example, the place that the species sleeps, lives, breeds, its food source and relationship with other species.

'''Explain the principle of competitive exclusion.'''
:*First proposed by Lokta and Volterra, competitive exclusion takes place when two species need the same resources, and will therefore compete until one species is removed. In any situation where two species are very similar and are vying for the same food source or breeding ground, one would be somewhat more capable of controlling the resources or reproducing rapidly. The other is run out of existence. Experiments with bacteria populations in the lab of Russian ecologist G.F. Gause demonstrated that this concept was accurate in practice. This principle was termed competitive exclusion.
*No two species can live in the same niche, because there is competition for the resources of the land and only one species will survive.

==Ecology of Communities==
'''Explain the following interactions between species, giving two examples of each: competition, herbivory, predation, parasitism, and mutualism.'''
:*Competition is when two species need the same resource such as a breeding site or food. Usually one of the species will out-compete the other. The Douglas Fir and Western Hemlock are trees that compete in the USA.
:*Herbivory is the relation between an animal and a plant. Different animals feed on different plants. Deer feed on tree leaves, rabbit feed on grass, giraffes on trees.
:*Predation is the relation between the predator, which is usually bigger, and the prey, which is usually smaller. An example would be a fox and a rabbit, or bonitos on anchovies.
:*Parasitism is the relation between the host and the parasite. The parasite causes harm to the host to get food and other resources. Examples of parasites are the malaria protist and tapeworm in humans.
:*Mutualism is where two members of different species benefit and neither suffers. Examples include rumen bacteria/protazoa that digest cellulose in the digestive systems of cows, providing the cow with an energy source and the bacteria with a stable habitat. Lichens and Chlorella/Chlorohydra, an algae, also exhibit such a relation. The lichen provide an means of attaching to the surface, and the algae photosynthesize to produce a source of sugars and nutrients.

'''Define gross production, net production, and biomass.'''
:*Gross production is the total amount of organic matter produced per unit area per unit time by a trophic level in an ecosystem.
:*Net production of an ecosystem is gross production less the material expended by the plants in respiration.
:*Both of these are measured in kJ per squared meter per year.
:*Biomass is the dry mass of organic matter in organisms of an ecosystem. 

'''Calculate values for gross production and biomass from given data.'''
:* Gross Production - Respiration = Net Production

'''Discuss the difficulties of classifying organisms into trophic levels.'''
:*It is difficult due to the fact that some organisms can be secondary, tertiary, and may be quaternary consumers at the same time, such as humans. It is difficult to place them on a certain level of the food pyramid.
:*For this reason, an alternate method of classification - the food web - has been developed. The food web displays relationships not as a simple hierarchy but rather a complex network, with the various feeding relationships between species existing as connections and the animals themselves existing as the hubs. 

'''Explain the small biomass and low numbers of organisms in higher trophic levels.'''
:* There is a decreasing biomass of organisms in the higher trophic levels because energy is lost between levels in the form of heat (respiration), waste, and dead material. Around 10-20% of the energy proceeds on to the next trophic level.

'''Construct a pyramid of energy given appropriate information.'''
:* The lowest bar of the pyramid of energy represents gross primary productivity, the next bar is the energy ingested as food by primary consumers, and so on. The arrows demonstrate the direction of energy flow. The units are energy per unit area per unit time.

'''Describe ecological succession using one example'''
:*Ecological succession is the gradual change in the composition of a community with time in an ecosystem. If succession occurs in a lifeless area it is primary succession. It can start after things such as volcanoes, fire or flood.
:*The process is usually goes: lichen, moss, ferns, flowerings plants, conifers.
:* For example on the Volcan Osorno in south Chile after ash covers the ground: mosses spread over the ash. Small herbs and ferns arrive and through the activity of their roots, soil formation starts to occur. Shrubs and bushes grow and replace these. Then flowering trees grow, then conifers, and other larger trees producing a forest. 

'''Explain the effects of living organisms on the abiotic environment with reference to the changes occurring during ecological succession to climax communities'''
:*Living organisms can help with soil development, as a plant grows, their roots grow deeper down and break rock into small particles, helping soil formation. Plants enrich the soil with minerals as they die and decompose. The plant roots hold the soil particles together, preventing soil erosion and retain nutrients. The water that evaporates from many plant leaves condenses and comes down in the form of rain. The presence of organic materials in the soil and the presence of roots and root hair help in the retention of water and slows down drainage.

==Biodiversity and Conservation==
'''Discuss reasons for the conservation of biodiversity using rainforests as an example. Reasons should include ethical, ecological, economic, and aesthetic arguments.'''
:*Biodiversity is highest in the tropical rainforests.
:*Ethical reasons for conserving biodiversity are that all species have a right to live on this planet. Many People have a cultural connection to the biological world. Future humans have a right to enjoy a healthy planet as we do today.
:*Ecological reasons are that species live with great interaction and dependence on each other. If one species dies out, a food chain is disrupted, therefore disrupting all of the other species as well. Species are adapted to particular conditions while other species may take a long time to adapt themselves. They help to dramatically reduce carbon dioxide levels.
:*Aesthetic reasons are that the tropical rain forest is one of the most beautiful attractions on this planet. There is variety everywhere in the rainforest. Many artists have been inspired by the diversity of life around them.
:*Economic reasons include that the rainforest is a source of materials important to human life. They regulate the weather and recycle nutrients and detoxify water. Medicinal substances can be taken from a variety of plants in the rain forest, new crop plants may be uncovered and ecotourism offers a new source of funds for the many impoverished nations these forests exist in. 

'''Outline the factors that caused the extinction of one named animal and one named plant species.'''
:* The Arizona Jaguar became extinct due to an increased demand for its fur. As the human population increased in the areas inhabited by the jaguar, the hunting and shooting increased and the last of this rare animal was shot in 1905 in New Mexico.
:* The Fluffy groundsel is a kind of herbal plant with clusters of yellow flowers. It became extinct because of farming, building, road construction and other sorts of human impact in the American South West. 

'''Outline the use of the Simpson diversity index.'''
:*The Simpson diversity index is a measure of species diversity
:*D = (N(N-1))/(summation of n(n-1)). D is the diversity index, N is the total number of organisms of all species found, n is the number of individuals of a particular species.
:*A high value of D suggests a stable and ancient ecosystem and a low D value could suggest pollution, recent succession or agricultural management.
:*The index is determined by counting organisms on randomly chosen parts of an area. Monitoring over time shows changes in an ecosystem.

'''Explain the use of biotic indices and indicator species in monitoring environmental change.'''
:*Indicator species are highly sensitive to environmental changes and their populations increase or decrease significantly depending on changes in the environment. They are good indicators of change. Frog populations are very vulnerable to pollution and other forms of change, while sludge worms are good indicators of low oxygen concentration in waterways.
:*Biotic indices are calculated via the number of tolerant and intolerant species at a time. The numbers of these organisms in the indicator species populations can be monitored over time directly so they are easy to keep track of. 

'''Outline the damage caused to marine ecosystems by the over-exploitation of fish.'''
:*If the population of fish is fished excessively and the number of adult fish fall below a critical level, spawning fails which can lead to fish population crashes and destroy the fishing industry. 
:*This occurred in Peru to anchoveta fishers in 1973 when the haul plummeted to nothing.

'''Discuss the international measures that would promote the conservation of fish.'''
:*International measures are necessary because many fish move through the oceans of multiple countries. Fish stocks in the ocean have fallen very significantly over the last 50 years due to excessive fishing. Enforcement is very difficult for any rules.
:*International measures that could be taken are monitoring of stocks and of reproduction rates, quotas for catches of species with low stocks, moratoria on catching endangered species, minimum net sizes, so that immature fish are not caught, and banning of drift nets, which catch many different species of fish indiscriminately. 
:*The ICES is a name example of an international agency that advises limits on catching fish.

'''Discuss the advantages of in situ conservation of endangered species (terrestrial and aquatic nature reserves).'''
:*These are places where the animal is found in its own natural habitat and is not allowed to be disturbed by humans and their activities.
:*This keeps the animals out of danger zones and allows them to live and reproduce naturally in its own environment. Most animals typically survive at a much greater rate using in situ conservation, and preserving their habitat allows other species to live there also, thus preserving other animals and biodiversity.  Greater genetic variety is also ensured.
:*However, sometimes numbers reach such low levels that the animals cannot be left unprotected in the wild or a habitat is being destroyed and this will not be stopped.

'''Outline the management of nature reserves.'''
:*A nature reserve is maintained by controlling alien species. Those that are not originally supposed to be in the area are removed.
:*They restore degraded areas where human impact has destroyed the ecosystem by methods such as reforestation and species reintroduction.
:*They promote the recovery of threatened species through feeding, for example.
:*They also control the exploitation by humans. Logging is controlled along with land clearing. If trees are cut down, more are planted. 

'''Outline the use of ex situ conservation measures including captive breeding of animals, botanic gardens, and seed banks.'''
:*For captive breeding, animals kept in zoos or parks are allowed to reproduce in order to give them a chance to increase in number, with the possibility of eventually reintroducing some of the offspring into the wild. Unfortunately many do not reproduce. Elephants are an example.
:*Botanic gardens are sites where many plant species are planted in controlled environments to maintain their species. The Botanic Gardens of Kew has a massive collection of 50,000 species.
:*Seed banks are where seeds are kept in cold and dry storage, since they stay in good condition for hundred of years. 

'''Discuss the role of international agencies and conservation measures including CITES and WWF.'''
:* CITES is an agreement that aims to control and regulate cross-border trade in endangered wildlife and wildlife products and so reduce poaching. Elephant poaching for example has been reduced through its listing on the agreement.
:*WWF is an independent organisation that attempts to save biodiversity and wildlife through political lobbying and monitoring projects. They try to keep areas from being cut down by buying areas of land and establishing them as nature reserves.

==AHL The Nitrogen Cycle==
'''State that all chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles and that these cycles involve water, land and the atmosphere.'''

'''Explain that all biogeochemical cycles summarize the movement of elements through the biological components of ecosystems (food chains) to form complex organic molecules, and subsequently simpler inorganic forms which can be used again.'''
:* All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles and these cycles involve water, land and the atmosphere.
:*The simple inorganic forms are absorbed and converted into complex organic forms but then broken down again into simple forms and released into the environment for reabsorption.

'''Explain that chemoautotrophs can oxidise inorganic substances as a direct energy source to synthesize ATP.'''

'''State that chemoautotrophy is found only among bacteria.'''
:*Only bacteria can make their food through chemoautotrophy. They perform reactions using inorganic substances such as nitrates, ammonia and sulphur. The oxidisation of these substances results in energy. The energy is then used to fix carbon dioxide into glucose as in the Calvin cycle.

'''Draw a diagram of a nitrogen cycle.'''
See [[w:Nitrogen cycle|Nitrogen cycle]]
:*Gaseous nitrogen is converted into biomass nitrate for plants and bacteria through the process of nitrogen fixation. Other bacteria also release nitrogen back into the air. When plants and animals die, proteins are broken down - deamination occurs, ammonia is formed, oxidation occurs producing nitrite, more oxidation occurs producing nitrate, then it can follow this path through another plant again or continue through bacteria in the soil. Ammonia is also formed by nitrogen gas through lighting and the Haber process (produces fertilizer).
:*This nitrogen cycle is not the only one present in an ecosystem that returns complex molecules to simple and simple to complex over and over again. The vast majority of other organic substances, such as potassium are also recycled in this manner, thus allowing ecosystems to survive without a constant influx of new organisms or nutrients.

'''Outline the roles of Rhizobium, Azobacter, Nitrosomonous, Nitrobacter and Pseudomonas dentrificans in the nitrogen cycle.'''
:*Rhizobium Azobacter are nitrogen fixing bacteria that can create nitrate from nitrogen gas. Nitosomonous oxidises ammonia to form nitrite. Nitrobacter oxidizes nitrite to form nitrate. Pseudomonas is a dentrifying bacteria that creates free nitrogen in the air from nitrate. The first four of these take inorganic nitrogen compounds found in the soil and transform them into a substance that can be used by plants and the last returns them to the atmosphere, away from plants.

'''Describe the conditions that favour dentrification and nitrification.'''
:*A harmful type of bacteria are denitrifying bacteria. They converts nitrate into free nitrogen gas. This decreases soil fertility and plant growth. These kind of bacteria are usually only found in water-logged soils. Water logging results in poor aeration and deficiency of oxygen in the soil.
*Nitrification occurs in ploughed soil because then the oxygen gets into the soil and makes it unfavourable for dentrifying bacteria. 
    
'''Discuss the action taken by farmers/gardeners to increase the nitrogen fertility of the soil including fertilizers, ploughing /digging and crop rotation (use of legumes).'''
:*Farmers plough the soil to make air space between the soil particles. The oxygen makes it an unfavourable condition for dentrifying bacteria and encourage the growth of nitrogen fixing bacteria.
:*Fertilizers are another option used to ensure proper nitrogen levels in the soil: processed from inorganic nitrogen, they provide a guaranteed heavy source of nitrogen compounds to plants. However, they have a tendency to leach out of the soil rapidly, and can often harm to the surrounding environment.
:*The final method, crop rotation, involves rotating crop planting between the crop the farmer wishes to grow and some kind of legume crop. Legumes form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, allowing these bacteria to produce their own source of nitrates from inorganic or atmospheric nitrogen. Under favourable conditions, these plants can produce enough excess nitrogen that it renews the soil's store of nitrates capable of being used by plants next year. The following year, non-legume crops are planted on the field the legumes previously grown on.

==AHL Impacts of Humans on Ecosystems==
'''Describe the role of atmospheric ozone in absorbing ultra violet (UV) radiation.'''
:*Ozone exists in the upper atmosphere and is formed from oxygen. It absorbs UV light from the sun, breaking down and converting the UV energy into heat. This results in the conversion of UV light energy into heat energy. The ozone layer is continually formed and destroyed and protects the Earth from most dangerous UV radiation.

'''Outline the effects of UV radiation on living tissues and biological productivity.'''
:*UV radiation can kill phytoplankton, the sea-going organisms that account for a significant portion of net photosynthesis that occurs in the biosphere. This affects the whole oceanic food web.
:*The radiation retards the growth of terrestrial plants by slowing their rate of photosynthesis, usually a result of radiative damage and subsequent mutations in plant leaves. High levels of UV light can also kill symbiotic bacteria that fixes nitrogen in the root nodules of legumes.
:*Increases in UV exposure will increase rates of skin cancer, sunburn and eye cataracts in animals

'''Outline the chemical effect of chlorine on the ozone layer.'''
:* Chlorine (broken away from CFC molecules by UV light) reacts with ozone and breaks down into oxygen. One chlorine can break down thousands of ozone molecules. This leads to depletion of the ozone layer and the passage of UV light through the ozone hole. 

'''Discuss methods of reducing the manufacture and release of ozone depleting substances including recycling refrigerants, reducing production of gas-blown plastics and using CFC-free propellants.'''
:*In 1987, after research had shown that CFCs were depleting the ozone layer, the Montreal protocol was created which set deadlines for the replacement of CFCs with non-ozone depleting substances.
:*Two of the largest sources of ozone-depleting substances come from the production of recycling refrigerants, gas blown plastics and the use of (CFCs) for propellants in spray cans, hairspray, etc. These chemicals have largely been removed and most corporations now recycle the refrigerants used rather than produce entirely new ones.
:*Nitrogen oxides also deplete the ozone layer and can be reduced through reduced use of fossil fuels, less polluting combustion engines and cleaner plane engines.
:*Ozone levels should start returning to normal around 2010 and be normal again by 2050 due to these measures.

'''Outline the consequences of releasing raw sewage and nitrate fertiliser into rivers.'''
:*Water polluted nitrate fertilisers will become rich in nutrients. The algae absorb large amounts of nitrates and this results in quick growth and reproduction of these algae and so the ecosystem becomes overpopulated with algae (algal blooms). This blocks the sun from reaching the photosynthetic plants at deeper levels and blocks the entry of carbon dioxide and oxygen from the atmosphere. The algae exceed their carrying capacity, the nutrients run out and they start to die quickly, encouraging the growth of the bacteria which digest them and increase the biochemical oxygen demand. They consume a large amount of oxygen and this results in deoxygenation of the water and aerobic organisms die. Finally, anaerobic bacteria develop producing poisonous hydrogenous compounds like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. By now most aquatic life has died.
:*When raw sewage is released bacteria grow first, deoxygenate the water and release the phosphates and nitrates used by algae. These grow and reoxygenate the water, after which they are eaten. At this time aquatic life may recover.
:*Raw sewage can also release pathogens into the bathing and drinking water supplies, causing the risk of human and animal infection when this water is used.

'''Outline the origin, formation and biological consequences of acid precipitation on plants and animals.'''
:*Acid precipitation occurs primarily because of the presence in the atmosphere of sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides that react with water in the air to form acids like sulphuric acid and nitric acid. Sulphur and nitrogen oxides come from the combustion of fossil fuels and industries.
:*The acidic rain helps release aluminium ions from soil into waterways. Aluminium is acidic too and toxic to fish. Both lower the pH of lakes and contaminate freshwater habitats. It affects fish, amphibians and aquatic invertebrates the most, due to the destruction of their freshwater lake and river environment.
:*Calcium, magnesium and potassium ions are leached out of the soil, reducing fertility and plant growth.

'''State that biomass can be used as a source of fuels such as methane and ethanol.'''
:* Biomass, like wood, is already burnt for fuel. Biomass can also be used as a source of fuels such as methane and ethanol.

'''Explain the principles involved in the generation of methane from biomass, including the conditions needed, organisms involved and the basic chemical reactions that occur.'''
:* Any organic rubbish, such as remains of food, are placed in a sealed container. Methanogenic bacteria such as methanobacillus and methanococcus are added. The container must be sealed to ensure anaerobic conditions. Bacteria decompose organic material in the rubbish to organic acids and alcohol. Bacteria use these as a source of hydrogen. The hydrogen is used to reduce carbon dioxide into methane. The methane is then burnt as a source of energy. The digested material is rich in nutrients and used as fertiliser.

[[Image:Cottage Cheese.jpg|right|thumb|A tub of commercial cottage cheese]]

'''Cottage cheese''' is a [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] [[Cookbook:Curd|curd]] product with a mild flavor. It is drained, but not pressed so some [[Cookbook:Whey|whey]] remains. The curd is usually washed to remove acidity giving ''sweet curd'' cheese. It is not aged or colored. Different styles of cottage cheese are made from milks with different fat levels and in small curd or large curd preparations. Cottage cheese which is pressed becomes [[Cookbook:Hoop Cheese|hoop cheese]], [[Cookbook:Farmer's Cheese|farmer's cheese]], [[Cookbook:Pot Cheese|pot cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Queso Blanco|queso blanco]].

Cottage cheese is eaten straight where it is like the curds of the nursery rhyme food &quot;curds and whey&quot;. It is also eaten in [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]]s, with fruit or as an ingredient in recipes like [[Cookbook:Jello Salad|jello salad]], [[Cookbook:Lasagne|lasagne]] and various [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]]s. It is popular among dieters and some health food devotees.

For a recipe using a somewhat similar (but pressed) type of cheese called paneer used in Indian cooking, see [[Cookbook: Matar Paneer|mattar paneer]].

== Introduction ==

{{Electric Circuits}}

This book will serve as an introduction to Digital Circuits. This book will rely heavily on the concepts of Discrete Math, but will not require any previous knowledge of the subject because all necessary math concepts will be developed in the text. This book will, however, assume a knowledge of basic electrical principles such as current, voltage, and resistance, so the reader may want to brush up on their [[Circuit Theory]].

A mechanical engineer learns to think of everything as a spring. An electrical engineer starts off with building blocks of resistors (circuit theory) and NAND gates. From NAND gates, every part of a [http://nand2tetris.org/ computer can be built]. Most electronics purchased today contain a huge variety of special purpose chips including a CPU. Mass produced commercial circuits are cheaper to build this way. But digital design is typically implemented today in a chip that can be potentially turned into anything. Most digital courses today plunge straight into programming a [[:wikipedia:FPGA|FPGA]]. In any case &quot;design&quot; is important. This course focuses on the design and leaves the FPGA programming for [[VHDL_for_FPGA_Design|another course]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">I set up a basic outline that I think is pretty good, although we can probably add some things and delete some other things. I think we can move some more advanced topics into a different wikibook on &quot;Digital Signal Processing&quot;, or something similar. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 18:28, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

&lt;del&gt;I had several text books that I was going to use to verify alot of my information before i wrote it down, but i left those books at home (i am away at school), and can't get to them for a little while. I would rather write nothing then write something that is factually incorrect or incomplete. Other people may feel free to write about these topics, but i wont add anything for a little while. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 14:19, 7 October 2005 (UTC)&lt;/del&gt;

Changed a little of the outline to reflect more like a text book, so that a reader can go though the book in a sequential direction --[[User: Asm2750|Asm2750]] 23:05, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

:I made more changes still. See my note below. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:23, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

Glad to be on board, I'll try to flesh out many of the headings and provide the extra sections nessecary to bring this book into a more developed state. --[[User:HL-SDK|HL-SDK]] ([[User talk:HL-SDK|talk]]) 22:51, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

== Combinational vs. sequential Circuits ==

According to wikipedia, and what I understood before, Combinational circuits have outputs that depend only on inputs, and not past states.  Therefore, latches, flip fops and registers would be sequential logic, not combinational.  I think combinational circuits would be decoders, multiplexers, and arithmetic circuits.[[User:Hithisishal|Hithisishal]] ([[User talk:Hithisishal|talk]]) 01:59, 18 October 2008 (UTC)

== Karnaugh Maps ==

I think that Karnaugh Maps should probably go under the section with optimizations. Maybe shannon's expansion should also. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 22:51, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

I decided to put back the Karnaugh Map in the logic area, due to the fact that it is pretty much the first thing you learn after boolean algebra, and is one of the foundations of digital logic. --[[User:Asm2750|Asm2750]] 23:05, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

:Kept the Karnaugh map page where it was essentially, as per your decision, but i made it a top-level page. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== What this book is not ==

i've done this on a few of the other books, but i feel that it is important to lay down precisely what the scope of a new wikibook is, so that it doesnt grow out of control, and suffer from &quot;feature creep.&quot; Here is what i think this book should be, although these guidelines are certainly not set in stone:

#This is not a Computer Science book. We are not here to teach programming, although i dont think it would be out of the question to include some examples using an HDL such as Verilog or VHDL. However, if we do include programming examples, we should definately not teach ''how to program'' because that is a topic best left reserved to the fine people on the CS bookshelf.
#This is not a physics book. We are not talking about the physical concepts concerning transistors. In fact, i dont think we should talk about transistors much at all, except in a macroscopic sense.
#This book has a limited scope, and a target audience. This book is designed to talk about what a logic gate is, and how they are used in the design of more complicated circuits. An engineer can walk down to a local electronics store and purchase a set of logic gate ICs. There is no sense reinventing the wheel. There has been an amazing amount of information written on the properties of silicon, or on the construction of a transistor, and there is no need to reproduce that here. 

This is my 2 cents, and i would like to hear some input because this wikibook is still in the very early stages of development, and can easily be redirected if necessary. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 22:04, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

: Many textbooks have been dedicated to digital circuits.
: Other textbooks (such as our own [[Electronics]] Wikibook) include &quot;digital circuits&quot; as one chapter of a larger work.

: If I suddenly remember some crucial fact about digital circuits that new learners simply must learn, do I put it in the [[Digital Circuits]] Wikibook, or into the &quot;Digital Circuits&quot; section of the [[Electronics]] Wikibook? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 12:59, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

== Big Changes ==

As of April 28th, I made a few big changes to the aesthetics of this book:
#I flattened out the naming scheme. No more &quot;Digital Circuits/Chapter/Page&quot; notation.
#I put 4 headings per page, at least. This way there is an automatic TOC on each page, and each page looks like it has substantial information
#Changed the page naming scheme for all pages from &quot;Digital Circuits:Page&quot; to &quot;Digital Circuits/Page&quot;. This is a better convention for all pages.
#I combined material from subpages into the main pages, so that all pages have a good amount of information on them.
#I changed some of the &quot;section&quot; headings on the Table of Contents
If anybody has any questions about these changes, or thinks that they should be reverted or whatever, leave me a message and let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:26, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Another Restructure ==

I've been busy with college and work for the last few months so I havent had any time to work on this book. But I'm thinking of moving some subjects around again. I'll take a look at this again in a week or two. -- asm2750 17:50, 8 December 2006

== merge ==

I suggest merging the [[Digital Electronics]] Wikibook into the [[Digital Circuits]] wikibook.
A box of &quot;digital circuits&quot; is practically synonymous with a box of &quot;digital electronics&quot;, right?

Some of the current contents of the [[Digital Electronics]] Wikibook look like they would be better suited for a &quot;Computer Architecture&quot; book -- is [[Microprocessor Design/Computer Architecture]] and [[Computer Systems Engineering]] the closest we have right now?
--[[Special:Contributions/68.0.124.33|68.0.124.33]] ([[User talk:68.0.124.33|talk]]) 22:17, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

I teach digital electronics using givone &quot;digital principles and design&quot; and would like to move to a wikibook. We offer both an engineering and technology digital course. The labs may overlap, but the text can not. There has to be a clear boundary. The text books are going to differentiate the courses more than the labs. This text aligns more with the engineering course. I want to expand it. The digital math is missing X0R and lots of examples right now .. sample homework problems that push design rather than troubleshooting. I agree the design has to lead to FPGA programming. I don't think technologists are going to be troubleshooting this code.

One edit[https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_Circuits/Multipliers&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=2551312] of the [[Digital Circuits/Multipliers]] page

I suspect Geoff Knagge wrote the original and someone copied it to Wikipedia rather than vice versa, since his version is the only one with the &quot;figure 2&quot; referred to in the text.

What should we do about it?

== Overview ==

'''''The Cruciatus Curse''''' causes extreme amounts of pain on the victim.  Along with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]], the Cruciatus Curse is considered to be one of the most terrible curses in the magical world, called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]; the use of any of the three on another human being is punishable by a life sentence in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] and three other of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters#Death_Eaters|Death Eaters]] used this curse on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]]'s parents, torturing them into a state of irreversible madness. Since that time, they have resided in a special ward at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]].

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] attempts this curse on Bellatrix Lestrange after she kills Harry Potter's godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]].  However, when Harry casts this curse it does not have the same effect as Lestrange's or other Dark Wizards'.  As Lestrange explains to Harry, the caster must really intend harm on the victim for the curse to have its desired effect.  In Harry's case, he is consumed with a righteous anger rather than a malicious intent.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] attempts to use this curse on Harry at one point, but is forestalled by Harry's use of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]].

Harry uses this curse again on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]], who has just spat at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. The curse is much more effective this time, as Harry feels hatred towards Carrow.

It hardly needs to be mentioned that this is one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] favorite spells. Voldemort uses this spell on his own followers numerous times as punishment, and twice uses it on Harry. The second time, it is ineffective, because the wand he is using has chosen Harry as its master.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Why was Voldemort's Cruciatus Curse ineffective against Harry in the Forbidden Forest after Harry's &quot;near-death&quot; experience?
#Does the wand in any way define the power of the Cruciatus curse?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] attempts to use the Cruciatus Curse against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], in self-defense, but fails. Bellatrix taunts him for this failure, saying he has to &quot;really mean it&quot;, that he has to really hate someone for that curse to be effective. Just as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] charm depends upon having a mind filled with happy thoughts, so must the Unforgivable Curses depend on having the mind filled with hate or anger. Harry truly realizes this when he casts the Cruciatus Curse on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] after Carrow spits in the face of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] in the Ravenclaw dormitory, stating his understanding of the anger one must feel to make such a curse be effective.

== Overview ==
''&quot;This ancient and mysterious charm conjures a magical guardian, a projection of all your most positive feelings. The Patronus Charm is difficult, and many witches and wizards are unable to produce a full, corporeal Patronus, a guardian which generally takes the shape of the animal with whom they share the deepest affinity. You may suspect, but you will never truly know what form your Patronus will take until you succeed in conjuring it.&quot;''— Miranda Goshawk (author of the ''Standard Book of Spells'') 

'''''Expecto Patronum''''', or the Patronus Charm, will cast a Patronus, which can appear as simply white vapour, or in more advanced casters, as a silvery-white animal shape. If it takes the shape of an animal, it is called a corporeal Patronus.  This spell is used to ward off the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], which are the guardians of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

''&quot;That's very, very advanced magic ...&quot;'' — Hermione Granger on the difficulty and complexity of the charm

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] learns this spell from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]. Harry's ability to cast a corporeal Patronus in his third year of magical studies shows his ability as a wizard, as it is a very advanced spell which is thought to be too difficult for underage wizards, in fact many witches and wizards are unable to produce any form of Patronus. In his fifth year, when Harry takes his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWLs]], his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] examiner offers him an extra point if he can produce a corporeal Patronus. A point, or a letter grade, would be worth about 15% of his total marks, so achieving this one charm is seen as quite valuable.

The primary purpose of the Patronus, as mentioned, is as defence against Dementors. Professor Lupin describes it thus: &quot;... a kind of anti-Dementor – a guardian which acts as a shield between you and the Dementor.&quot; And: &quot;The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon – hope, happiness, the desire to survive – but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so Dementors can't hurt it.&quot; Presumably, the Dementor, finding that the being confronting it does not suffer as a human would, retreats in confusion. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] we see Harry's Patronus charge at the Dementors; though the Patronus may have no physical body, the Dementor, being sightless, cannot see that, all it can sense is this emotional blast furnace, which is charging at it, and it will retreat to save itself.

We also see the Patronus used as a signaling spell when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] sends for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], and also when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] sends up a Patronus to summon someone from within the school to open the gates in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 8|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=99 According to the author], use of the Patronus as a communications device was pioneered by Dumbledore and is used exclusively by members of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]].

The Patronus is used extensively in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], both as a communications device, as the Order of the Phoenix is now an outlaw organization, and also as defence against the Dementors who are wandering the English countryside. In particular, we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] using it to warn Harry, on his birthday, of his imminent arrival with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|the Minister for Magic]]. The following day, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] sends his Patronus to warn the members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding party that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] had fallen; Arthur sends a Patronus later that night to tell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and Harry that the Weasley family is all right. We also see Patronuses used as defence against Dementors by Harry, Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]. We see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth Dumbledore]]'s Patronus, a goat, when the Trio return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.]] Finally, we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s Patronus on two occasions.

The shape of a corporeal Patronus is significantly influenced by the personality of the caster. Harry's is a stag; Dumbledore's is a phoenix; Tonks' Patronus, as seen in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', is &quot;something large and hairy&quot;, and has apparently changed recently. Members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] are also, some of them, able to conjure Patronuses by their last lesson: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]]'s is a swan, for instance, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s is an otter. Life events can change the shape of a Patronus as well; as mentioned, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] mentions that Tonks' Patronus had changed. This change apparently happened at the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and Harry initially thinks that Tonks' new Patronus has taken on Sirius' dog shape.

It is because of this connection between the caster's personality and the shape of the Patronus that it can also be used, to a certain extent, as identification of the wizard. Harry is identified, for instance, by his Patronus in Hogsmeade; the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] guarding against his return to Hogsmeade decide that Harry has arrived by the shape of the Patronus he uses to defend himself from the Dementors they send after him. This is only a weak identification, as it is possible for multiple wizards to have the same Patronus animal, and because not all wizards can successfully cast this spell; but it is unlikely that a wizard in disguise would have the same Patronus as the wizard he is trying to impersonate.

Literal Latin translation: I desire my patron.

== Analysis ==

It should be noted that a sufficiently advanced wizard or witch can apparently cast multiple simultaneous Patronuses. We see that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] casts three Patronuses at once, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 30|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], when she needs to contact the three other Heads of House.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Harry's Patronus is a Stag. His father's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] form is also a stag. We know from the description of the Animagus that the form the wizard takes when transformed is related to his personality. Are Patronuses and Animagus Forms related? Does this pass from father to son, and if someone's Patronus' form changed, would their Animagus form also change?
#Clearly, the form a wizard's Patronus takes is related to his personality or events in his life. If you had a Patronus, what shape would it take?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

There are two spells that relate a wizard or witch to an animal shape: the Patronus charm, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] transformation. In the course of the books, we see only one witch who is both Animagus and casts a visible Patronus, that being [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. The fact that her Animagus form is the same as her Patronus, a tabby cat, would indicate that whatever influences the shape of the one would also influence the shape of the other. It is perhaps a reasonable assumption that the shape resulting from either of these spells is related to the current mental state of the caster; but the Animagus transform, being a one-time enabling of the ability to transform, likely does not allow for change in the animal one changes to, rather enabling the transform according to the state of the caster at the time the transform was enabled, while the Patronus charm, being invoked afresh each time, reflects the caster's current state. There is more discussion of this at the entry for the Animagus transform.

While it is noted in the Extended Description that we see Professor Snape's Patronus on two occasions, we deliberately elide the shape of that Patronus as it constitutes a relatively large spoiler. Snape's Patronus takes the shape of a doe, and is seen first in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 19|the Forest of Dean]], and later in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|Snape's memories]] of a conversation with Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore recognizes it as being related to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans, as she then was]], and Snape's unrequited love for her. We note that in three instances, Harry, Snape, and Tonks, the Patronus has taken a shape related to a major object of affection: Harry's is related to his father, Tonks' is related to Lupin, and Snape's to Lily. Clearly there is some indication that the Patronus form is influenced by love, requited, unrequited, or lost. Related to this we note that Hermione's Patronus is an otter, and if its form was related to love objects, we would expect it to be a weasel; Hermione, however, likely is aware that weasels and otters belong to the same family, Mustelidae.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Any tutorial would be better than no tutorial.  Even if there aren't the best capabilities, in the current tutorial, you could add in the newer capabilities on the end, or as a new tutorial so that people could get an idea as to the results from different methods of doing things ((FAR better learning experience in that case)).

The idea (in my mind) is to learn the techniques first, then perfect later.
: The rule is - if you don't know what to do, do something useful. Any content is better than nothing, polishing will come later.


There are a bunch of tutorials here that do not teach so much as they walk you through a bunch of steps without explaining what you're doing or why.  This is one of those.  =/  Specifically, I understand what's being done, but I'm not all that clear on what the individual options do or why they are being set to whatever values.... again, a problem in many of these tutorials.  This makes experimenting on my own harder.  Solution, walk the user through setting each value to multiple settings, and pointing out and explaining the differences (which are not always obvious).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calculus/Top Nav|Volume|Arc length}}

In this section we cover '''solids of revolution''' and how to calculate their volume.  A solid of revolution is a solid formed by revolving a 2-dimensional region around an axis.  For example, revolving the semi-circular region bounded by the curve {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and the line {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} around the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis produces a sphere.  There are two main methods of calculating the volume of a solid of revolution using calculus:  the disk method and the shell method.

==Disk Method==
[[Image:Generating fx disk method.svg|thumb|397px|right|Figure 1:  A solid of revolution is generated by revolving this region around the x-axis.]]
[[Image:Approx generating fx disk method.svg|thumb|397px|right|Figure 2:  Approximation to the generating region in Figure 1.]]
Consider the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the curve {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, which is continuous on {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, and the lines {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=b&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} around the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis.  We could imagine approximating the volume by approximating &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with the stepwise function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; shown in [[:File:Approx generating fx disk method.svg|{{nowrap begin}}figure 2{{nowrap end}}]], which uses a right-handed approximation to the function.  Now when the region is revolved, the region under each step sweeps out a cylinder, whose volume we know how to calculate, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{cylinder}=\pi r^2 h&lt;/math&gt;
, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the cylinder and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the cylinder's height.  This process is reminiscent of the Riemann process we used to calculate areas earlier.  Let's try to write the volume as a Riemann sum and from that equate the volume to an integral by taking the limit as the subdivisions get infinitely small.

Consider the volume of one of the cylinders in the approximation, say the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th one from the left.  The cylinder's radius is the height of the step function, and the thickness is the length of the subdivision.  With &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subdivisions and a length of &lt;math&gt;b-a&lt;/math&gt; for the total length of the region, each subdivision has width
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
Since we are using a right-handed approximation, the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th sample point will be
:&lt;math&gt;x_k=k\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
So the volume of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th cylinder is
:&lt;math&gt;V_k=\pi f(x_k)^2\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
Summing all of the cylinders in the region from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;V_{approx}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\pi f(x_k)^2\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity gives us the the exact volume
:&lt;math&gt;V=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\pi f(x_k)^2\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
, which is equivalent to the integral
:&lt;math&gt;V=\int_a^b \pi f(x)^2 dx&lt;/math&gt;

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example:  Volume of a Sphere}}
Let's calculate the volume of a sphere using the disk method.  Our generating region will be the region bounded by the curve {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{r^2-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and the line {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  Our limits of integration will be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-values where the curve intersects the line {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, namely, {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=\pm r&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  We have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V_{sphere}&amp;=\int_{-r}^r \pi(r^2-x^2)dx\\
&amp;=\pi(\int_{-r}^r r^2 dx-\int_{-r}^r x^2 dx)\\
&amp;=\pi(r^2 x\bigr|_{-r}^r - \frac{x^3}{3}\biggr|_{-r}^r)\\
&amp;=\pi(r^2 (r-(-r)) - (\frac{r^3}{3}-\frac{(-r)^3}{3})\\
&amp;=\pi(2r^3-\frac{2r^3}{3})\\
&amp;=\pi\frac{6r^3-2r^3}{3}\\
&amp;=\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Washer Method==
[[Image:Generating fxs washer method.svg|thumb|401px|right|Figure 3:  A solid of revolution containing an irregularly shaped hole through its center is generated by revolving this region around the x-axis.]]
[[Image:Approx generating fxs washer method.svg|thumb|401px|right|Figure 4:  Approximation to the generating region in Figure 3.]]

The washer method is an extension of the disk method to solids of revolution formed by revolving an area bounded between two curves around the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis.  Consider the solid of revolution formed by revolving the region in [[:File:Generating fxs washer method.svg|figure 3]] around the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis.  The curve &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that in [[:File:Generating fx disk method.svg|figure 1]], but now our solid has an irregularly shaped hole through its center whose volume is that of the solid formed by revolving the curve &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; around the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis.  Our approximating region has the same upper boundary, &lt;math&gt;f_{step}(x)&lt;/math&gt; as in [[:File:Approx generating fx disk method.svg|figure 2]], but now we extend only down to &lt;math&gt;g_{step}(x)&lt;/math&gt; rather than all the way down to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis.  Revolving each block around the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis forms a washer-shaped solid with outer radius &lt;math&gt;f_{step}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and inner radius &lt;math&gt;g_{step}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The volume of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th hollow cylinder is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V_k&amp;=\pi f(x_k)^2\Delta x-\pi g(x_k)^2\Delta x\\
&amp;=\pi(f(x_k)^2-g(x_k)^2)\Delta x\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x_k=k\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  The volume of the entire approximating solid is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{approx}=\sum_{k=1}^n \pi(f(x_k)^2-g(x_k)^2)\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity gives the volume
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V&amp;=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n \pi(f(x_k)^2-g(x_k)^2)\Delta x\\
&amp;=\int_a^b \pi(f(x)^2-g(x)^2)dx\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Shell Method==
[[Image:Generating fx shell method.svg|thumb|401px|right|Figure 5:  A solid of revolution is generated by revolving this region around the y-axis.]]
[[Image:Approx generating fx shell method.svg|thumb|401px|right|Figure 6:  Approximation to the generating region in Figure 5.]]
The shell method is another technique for finding the volume of a solid of revolution.  Using this method sometimes makes it easier to set up and evaluate the integral.  Consider the solid of revolution formed by revolving the region in [[:File:Generating fx shell method.svg|figure 5]] around the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis.  While the generating region is the same as in [[:File:Generating fx disk method.svg|figure 1]], the axis of revolution has changed, making the disk method impractical for this problem.  However, dividing the region up as we did previously suggests a similar method of finding the volume, only this time instead of adding up the volume of many approximating disks, we will add up the volume of many cylindrical shells.  Consider the solid formed by revolving the region in [[:File:Approx generating fx shell method.svg|figure 6]] around the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis.  The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th rectangle sweeps out a hollow cylinder with height &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x_k)\right|&lt;/math&gt; and with inner radius &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; and outer radius &lt;math&gt;x_k+\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, where {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;\Delta x=\frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x_k=k\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, the volume of which is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V_k&amp;=\pi((x_k+\Delta x)^2-x_k^2)|f(x_k)|\\
&amp;=\pi((x_k^2+2x_k\Delta x+\Delta x^2)-x_k^2)|f(x_k)|\\
&amp;=\pi(2x_k\Delta x+\Delta x^2)|f(x_k)|\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The volume of the entire approximating solid is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{approx}=\sum_{k=1}^n \pi(2x_k\Delta x+\Delta x^2)|f(x_k)|&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity gives us the exact volume
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V&amp;=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n \pi(2x_k\Delta x+\Delta x^2)|f(x_k)|\\
&amp;=\pi\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\sum_{k=1}^n 2x_k\Delta x|f(x_k)|+\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta x^2|f(x_k)|\right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} is continuous on {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, the [[Calculus/Some_Important_Theorems#Extreme_Value_Theorem|Extreme Value Theorem]] implies that {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} has some maximum, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, on {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  Using this and the fact that {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;\Delta x^2|f(x_k)|&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n 2x_k\Delta x|f(x_k)| \leq \sum_{k=1}^n 2x_k\Delta x|f(x_k)|+\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta x^2|f(x_k)| \leq \sum_{k=1}^n 2x_k\Delta x|f(x_k)|+\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta x^2 M&lt;/math&gt;
But
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta x^2 M &amp;= \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n \left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)^2 M\\
&amp;=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{(b-a)^2}{n} M\\
&amp;=0\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
So by the [[Calculus/Limits/An_Introduction_to_Limits#The_Squeeze_Theorem|Squeeze Theorem]]
:&lt;math&gt;\pi\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\sum_{k=1}^n 2x_k\Delta x|f(x_k)|+\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta x^2|f(x_k)|\right) = \pi\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n 2x_k\Delta x|f(x_k)|&lt;/math&gt;
, which is just the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b 2\pi x|f(x)|dx&lt;/math&gt;

Successful writers understand that revising is an integral part of the writing process. It is important for authors to spend the majority of their time revising their texts. Revising and editing are two separate processes that are often used interchangeably by novice writers. Revising requires a significant alteration in a piece of writing, such as enriching the content, or giving the piece clarity; editing, however, is not as involved and would include fixing typos and grammatical errors. Although editing can be a part of this process, revising generally involves changes that concern bigger issues, such as content and organization. While revising, a writer might notice that one idea needs to be developed more thoroughly, and another idea omitted. The writer might decide that rearranging paragraphs will provide clarity and support for their argument, strengthening the paper as a whole. Writers should also change grammar and punctuation while revising, but if that is all they are doing then they are simply editing.

This chapter is meant to provide sound advice about the revising process.

==Differences Between Revising, Editing, and Proofreading==

It is important to note that revising, editing, and proofreading are very different processes.  Despite the differences, however, they often overlap.  They are being separated here for ease of explanation.

''Revising''
*Revising is done throughout the writing process, with special emphasis on the first few drafts.
*Focus = big issues
**Audience
**Organization
**Content
**Evidence
**Conclusion

''Editing''
*Editing is done throughout the writing process, with special emphasis on the middle and final drafts.
*Focus = technical issues
**Usage
**Word choice
**Transitions
**Mechanics
''Proofreading''
*Proofreading is reserved for the final draft.
*Focus = mechanics and presentation
**Spelling
**Punctuation
**Format
**Typographical errors
**Textual inconsistencies

==A Change for the Better==

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;I write one page of masterpiece to ninety-one pages of sh*t. I try to put the sh*t in the wastebasket.&quot;|caption=--Ernest Hemingway}}

Writing is an intellectually challenging, and draining, activity -- writing well, that is. Putting ideas on paper is a good start, but revising those ideas so that they are persuasive, cogent, and form a solid argument is the real work of writing. As you review what you have written, you will undoubtedly see holes in your logic, sentences that confuse rather than clarify, and sentences and paragraphs out of place. Below are some helpful hints to consider as you analyze and transform your paper.
* Take a break. Looking at your paper later will help you see it from the point of view of the audience.  A good rule of thumb is to wait at least a day before revising. Often, writers look at their prose a day later and recognize significant flaws they would not have noticed had they written their paper in one night.
* Be your own critic. You are obviously your own best critic. When writing, most people do not (and should not) turn in their first drafts. So take advantage of your first, second, and third drafts to write your opinions in the margins. Highlight the things you really like, and circle the things you would like to change. 
*Read and re-read your paper. In the first read-through consider the clarity of both the [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/few/680 focus] and the purpose of the paper. Does every supporting statement agree with the thesis? In the second read-through analyze organization, logical development, and correctness. Often, reading your text aloud reveals awkward phrasing, missing information, weak points, and illogical reasoning.
* Put yourself in the shoes of your reader. Look at your work through their eyes. Keep in mind that, while you may know something about a topic and write about it with supported research, your audience may be new to the topic. Being specific in your writing helps clarify your message to audiences. Do not assume that your audience already knows what you know.
* Cut unnecessary words. Inexperienced writers should be able to cut 20 percent (or more) of their prose. Look hard at each word, each phrase, and each sentence. Does each and every one help you achieve your purpose? Does each sentence in a paragraph relate to the main idea? If you are like most people, you will find unnecessary repetition rampant in your writing. Pruning the verbiage will result in leaner, tighter, and more forceful writing. Remember E.B. White's mantra: &quot;Omit needless words. Omit needless words. Omit needless words.&quot; 
* Understand that revising your paper should not be the last thing you do -- revision should be ongoing throughout the creation of a document. 

After doing all this by yourself, seek help from others. First, find an individual who knows about the assignment, your intended audience, and the purpose of the essay. Then, share it with someone who fits the description of the audience for whom the document is intended. Ask your readers if everything is clear and easily understood, if phrases are worded correctly, if the document is logically sound, etc. If you have other specific concerns -- Is the second example effective? Does my conclusion resolve the paper nicely? -- ask your readers to direct their attention to those issues.  

After your have written your paper, return to the beginning to see how the end relates to the beginning. Have you maintained the same tone and main idea throughout? Does the ending reiterate your main idea without just summarizing what you've already said? Pay to attention to your word usage; try to leave little room for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Language_interpretation&amp;redirect=no misinterpretation] when the audience reads your piece.

It is also oftentimes helpful to have someone read your paper aloud to you.  This will force you to go over the material more slowly and allow you another chance to absorb the content of the paper.  When you read your own paper aloud you are more apt to read the paper as you intended it to be read, as opposed to reading what is actually on the page.

After going through the steps above and making changes as necessary, you should feel your paper is nearly complete. The content should be in place, and your text should make your case clearly and forcefully. If you feel this is the case, you are ready to closely edit and proofread your text.

==Analyze Each Part of Your Paper==
===Introductions===
When you look over the draft of your paper, the first thing you should focus on is your introduction [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction|introduction]]. Whether it is one paragraph or an entire chapter, the purpose of the introduction is to grab your readers' attention while simultaneously giving a preview of the information that will be included in the following paragraphs. Make sure you draw your readers in from the beginning and follow with interesting and supportive information. If readers are not intrigued from the very beginning of the piece, they will quickly become distracted avoid reading any further. 

What is the difference between a good and a bad introduction? A bad introduction is misleading, rambling, incoherent, boring, or so hopelessly vague that you know less about the topic than you did before you read it. On the other hand, a good introduction gets to the point, gives the reader a reason to keep on reading, and sets the stage for a really exciting performance.  An introduction is like a first impression; it is crucial to your image and, once presented, you never get a second opportunity. Your essay's introduction is your reader's first impression of your ability as a writer. Even if you are brilliant and have great ideas, a muddy or boring introduction will turn away many of your readers. 

Make sure that you don't beat around the bush in your intro. If you have tedious openers such as &quot;in today's society&quot; or openers that merely relay what the assignment is, change it so that it instead states your argument up front and presents a clear thesis right away, then subtly describe your paper's overall structure. Try summarizing every paragraph into one sentence each, then put them all together to see if your introduction covers each point. Your introduction should state the issue at hand, establish your position regarding it, describe your paper's organization, and identify the scope of your coverage. However, be careful not to write a wordy or overly dense [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_(writing) introduction]; your introduction should merely frame the rest of the paper.

===[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis_statement Thesis Statements]===
A thesis is not only an idea, but it is also a theory that provides direction and guidance on what one is talking about. It is a theory because it is an abstract type of generalized thinking that binds the whole piece of writing together and also provides a goal and a standard for the paper. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory theory] Next, make sure you have a '''clear thesis'''. Simply put, a thesis is your main point, the line of argument that you are pursuing in your essay. It should answer two simple questions: What issue are you writing about, and what is your position on it? A thesis statement is a single sentence (or sometimes two, which are combined using a semicolon or comma and conjunction) that provides the answers to these questions clearly and concisely. Ask yourself, &quot;What is my paper about, exactly?&quot; to help you develop a precise and directed thesis, not only for your reader, but for you as well.

How can you be sure that your thesis is clear? Will your reader be able to identify it and see that the rest of your paper is supporting your argument? One sign of a weak [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis_statement thesis] would be that the statement does not make a concise claim, or the claim it does make is already proven true from its factual contents. 

Most American readers expect to see the point of your argument (the thesis statement) within the first few paragraphs. This does not mean that you have to place it there every time. Some writers place it at the very end, slowly building up to it throughout their work, to explain a point after the fact. Others don't bother with one at all, but feel that their thesis is &quot;implied&quot; anyway. 

Avoid the &quot;implied thesis&quot; unless you are certain of your audience. Almost every professor will expect to see a clearly discernible thesis sentence in the intro. Remember: The harder it is for you to write your thesis statement, the more likely it is that your entire essay is incoherent and unfocused. If you are having real problems crafting a good thesis statement, you may need to start over, narrow your topic, or dig even more deeply into what you are trying to say and write.

A good basic structure for a thesis statement is &quot;they say, I say.&quot; What is the prevailing view, and how does your position differ from it? However, avoid limiting the scope of your writing with an either/or thesis under the assumption that your view must be strictly contrary to their view.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do;jsessionid=664CE6E971C19646ABF500EEC6B18443?N=14%204294922390&amp;Ntk=P_EPI&amp;Ntt=182068546421014838399085744741621134048&amp;Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are some typical thesis statements:
* Although many readers believe ''Romeo and Juliet'' to be a tale about the ill fate of two star-crossed lovers, it can also be read as an allegory concerning a playwright and his audience.
* The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; has not only failed to reduce the frequency of drug-related crimes in America, but actually enhanced the popular image of dope peddlers by romanticizing them as desperate rebels fighting for a cause.
* The bulk of modern copyright law was conceived in the age of commercial printing, long before the internet made it so easy for the public to compose and distribute its own texts. Therefore, these laws should be reviewed and revised to better accommodate modern readers and writers. 
* The usual moral justification for capital punishment is that it deters crime by frightening would-be criminals. However, the statistics tell a different story.
* If students really want to improve their writing, they must read often, practice writing, and receive quality feedback from their peers.
* Plato's dialectical method has much to offer those of us engaged in online writing, which is far more conversational in nature than print.

You will know your thesis statement is finished when it contains the basic information for your argument without any major in-depth descriptions.

===Position===
Make sure that your reader knows ''your'' position on the issue. This should be properly expressed in  your thesis, but check your entire introduction for &quot;wishy washy&quot; sentences. Unless you're only writing a summary, your introduction should make it clear how you feel about the issue at stake.

Avoid sentences or &quot;thesis statements&quot; such as the following:
* Abortion is a very controversial issue in America.
* Capital punishment is both good and bad.
* This paper will present the pros and cons of modern copyright law.
Are these examples stating an issue and taking a position, or merely stating what everyone knows already? Again, your reader should already know that the issue you're writing about is controversial, otherwise there would be little reason to write about it. Unless you've been instructed to merely write a report or summary of an issue, assume that your professor wants you to take a position and defend it with the best evidence you can muster. However, you should not forget to fairly [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis analyze] all positions and debate opposing viewpoints. Even if you only cater to other opinions in order to disprove them, you will have strengthened your argument as a result.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do;jsessionid=E9081C98071BCB814BE7322EF2AE6557?N=14%204294922390&amp;Ntk=P_EPI&amp;Ntt=182068546421014838399085744741621134048&amp;Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===
Besides explaining what your paper is about and your argument, an introduction may also state what you will and won't cover. For instance, let's say your paper is about an issue affecting mothers infected with HIV. Your introduction should reflect this focus, rather than present your paper as a general overview of HIV. If your scope isn't clear, then readers will constantly wonder when you'll address the larger topic--or even assume you simply forgot to do it.

Let's say you wanted to write a paper that argued that Ford makes better cars than Chevrolet. However, your introduction didn't mention Chevrolet at all, but instead had the line: &quot;Ford makes better cars than any other car manufacturer.&quot; Your reader would quickly begin to wonder why you're not talking about Toyota or Nissan! Try to anticipate what your reader will expect to see covered, and, if necessary, state it explicitly:
* Although my topic is capital punishment, I will focus on one aspect of that larger issue: the execution of convicts who are mentally ill.
* Although we interviewed over two hundred doctors in our study, we will discuss only three of them in detail here.
* In the following essay, I will be discussing only the first edition of ''Leaves of Grass,'' and my claims may or may not apply to Whitman's later editions.

===Body Paragraphs===
As you build support for your thesis in the &quot;body&quot; paragraphs, always ask yourself if you are spending your readers' time wisely. Are you writing unnecessarily complex and confusing sentences, or using 50 words when 5 would do? If a sentence is already plain and direct, there's no need to fluff it up. Flowery words and phrases obscure your ideas: when writing, being ''concise'' is key. For example, why write, &quot;Cats have a tendency toward sleeping most of the day&quot; when you could simply write, &quot;Cats usually sleep most of the day&quot;? How about changing &quot;The 12th day of the month of April&quot; to &quot;April 12th?&quot; Try to pick out such sentences and substitute simpler ones. 

But wait--don't you need to inflate your text so you can meet the minimum word count? Wouldn't it be better to use &quot;due to the fact that&quot; for &quot;because&quot; and &quot;in addition to&quot; for &quot;and,&quot; since these phrases use far more words? Answer: NO. Any experienced reader will instantly see through such a pitiful scheme and will likely become irritated by the resulting &quot;flabby&quot; prose. If you are having trouble meeting the minimum word count, a far better solution is to add more examples, details, quotations, or perspectives. Go back to the planning and drafting stage and really ask yourself if you've written everything useful about a topic.

Other students worry that their sentences don't sound smart enough. Compare these two sentences:
* Do not ask what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.
* Do not submit a query concerning what assets and benefits your country can bestow upon you and yours, but rather inquire as to what tasks or activities you yourself can perform and carry out that will be useful for the citizens of your own country.
Although the second sentence is longer and harder to grasp, that doesn't make it more intelligent. In fact, it's far more impressive to write a complex thought in simple prose than vice versa. Beware, however, that you do not lose meaning when you make a sentence simpler; cut out only the most unnecessary “fluffy” adjectives, but don’t sacrifice being [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/descriptive descriptive].

 
How about your organization? From sentence-to-sentence, paragraph-to-paragraph, the ideas should flow into each other smoothly and without interruptions or delays. If someone tells you that your paper sounds &quot;choppy&quot; or &quot;jumps around,&quot; you probably have a problem with organization and transitions.  The addition of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation quotations] from a text that relates to your topic can be an excellent way to refocus your writing and avoid unrelated ideas.

Keep in mind that very few writers can write a well-organized paper in one draft. Instead, their first drafts are disorganized and even chaotic. It takes patience to sort through this mess, consolidating related ideas into coherent paragraphs and helping the reader to follow their train of thought without derailing. Compare:
* Proofreading is an important step in the writing process. Read your paper aloud to catch errors. Use spell check on your computer.
* Proofreading is an important step in the writing process. One technique is to read your paper aloud, which will help you catch errors you might overlook when reading silently. Another strategy is to use spell check on your computer.
The second example has better transitions between ideas and is easier to read. Note that the example with better transitions is also longer. Good transitions can improve your style and help you reach the minimum word count!

===Conclusions===
After all the work you have exerted on your paper, you want to end with a '''good conclusion'''. The conclusion and the introduction may be similar but may take several forms. Conclusions may be a simple restatement of your thesis to reestablish what the entire paper is about. They may also sum up your main points, reflect on the information presented, ask a thought-provoking question, or present a &quot;call to action,&quot; telling your readers what you want them to do with the information you have presented. Often, this choice will be determined by the genre, audience, or purpose of your paper. Nevertheless, your conclusion should accurately reflect the paper's subject and provide the reader with closure. 

Be sure not to end a paper with new ideas or a thesis you have not already supported or explained in the paper. Remember, a conclusion is meant to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_(rhetorical_device) reiterate] the paper’s main argument and then return the thesis to the larger issue the paper is addressing and should not present any new arguments or topics in the process.

==Before and After Revision Examples==

===Example Before Revision===
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&lt;center&gt;'''Household Chore Divisions When We Get Married'''&lt;/center&gt;

My mom does almost everything at our house.  She cooks, cleans, 
does laundry, vacuums, and when my sisters and I were younger, she 
did most of the child care – not fair!  My father, on the other hand, 
clips the hedges, waters the lawn, and snow-blows the driveway.  He 
makes more money than my mom.  My sisters and I take care of mowing 
the lawn, washing dishes, cleaning the bathrooms, and scrubbing the 
floors.  I was interested to know how Pete and I will split chores 
once we are married because there (ideally) will not be as large of an 
earning gap between the two of us as there is between my parents.

Pete and I discussed and debated a lot as we went through 
the “list of chores”.  I tried to stand my ground on percentages of 
time that I should do a chore unless Pete was able to give me a 
reasonable explanation of why I should do a greater percentage of 
something than he does; he did the same, and so this assignment was 
a great communication tool and gave us the opportunity to confer on 
possible problems which may occur somewhere down the road.

My boyfriend Pete and I talk a lot about getting married.  We 
are now college seniors, so it just seems like the next step in the 
progression of our relationship.  We figure, however, that we will 
wait until I am done with law school and he has his PhD before we do 
it.  Although that brings us to at least 6 years from now we agree 
that it will be better if we are financially stable before getting 
married.

Pete and I have decided to split chores almost evenly.  I will 
be doing 44.43% of the total things that will need to get done.  He 
will be doing 43.24% of them.  We decided that our son, who will be 
named Christian, was old enough to help with some of the chores.  
Some of the other things, we decided, would be worth paying an 
outside source to do.  Income tax returns, for example, we concluded 
could be better and more efficiently taken care of by a CPA.  We 
found that I will be doing 50.25% of the housework, while Pete will 
be doing 43.17%.  We also found that I will be doing 10% of the 
occasional work while Pete will be doing 63.33%.  I will do 60% of 
the child care, and Pete will do 40%.  I seem to be doing more daily 
tasks, and Pete seems to be doing more occasional tasks. 

I think that this assignment was a good starting point for a 
discussion between Pete and myself.  I am going to be a lawyer and he 
is going to be a chemist.  Both of our schedules will be tight, and 
we will have to find a better compromise in real life then we did in 
our imaginary one.  If we do not, neither one of us will be truly 
satisfied.

From the results of this assignment, I will be doing more of the 
traditionally “female work”, and Pete will be doing more “male 
work”.  I think that our assigned careers play a part in this but not 
as much as I would like.  I think that although we have broken many 
of the stereotypes that control my parents, we are still following 
some of them.  When I look over the results it seems odd that Pete 
will be doing more of the ironing than I, but he taught me to iron 
and his job calls for more ironed clothes than mine.  We also figured 
that he will have a little more leeway on time as a manager than I 
will as a lawyer.  Thus, he will be getting the kids ready for 
school.  We broke a couple of stereotypes, but we still have a ways to go before reaching equality.

=== Notes ===

With only a few changes made, notice how much nicer the Example After Revision reads than the Example Before Revision.
# The order of a few paragraphs was re-arranged. Notice how the focus changes perspective from the past to the present. It immediately centers and controls what the author wants the reader to &quot;see&quot; and sets the tone for the rest of the essay.  Also, notice the way the author repeats the words &quot;Pete and I&quot; to keep the reader on track.  Notice that the paragraph that was moved to the beginning provides a more solid introduction.  It immediately tells the reader why the rest of the essay is relevant.  The writer is considering getting married so it is a good time to talk about household chores.  This puts the rest of the essay into context and helps orient the reader to what will be coming and why the author wrote the essay.  The concluding paragraph was also rearranged and now offers a more accurate summary of the essay as a whole.  The example before the revision had a concluding paragraph that veered off topic to deal with the idea of gender roles, which, although mentioned, is not the main idea.  
# Punctuation was included '''inside''' of quotation marks rather than '''outside''' quotation marks. This makes for easier reading and tells your reader/professor that you are conscious of the proper technique when quoting, and keeps the clarity of the speaker consistent.
# &quot;6&quot; was changed to &quot;six.&quot;  Be aware of numbers in your writing.  Generally, the rule is to spell out numbers one through nine and use numerals for numbers 10 or higher.  
# Some material was added to the Example After Revision for clarity. When you believe something can be added or taken away to provide your reader with a better idea of your meaning or thought process, do so.  Clarity is extremely important when writing a paper. If your reader becomes confused, this will damage the paper's effectiveness.  Do your best to guide your reader, so there will be little to no ''re-reading'' and a grade to reflect this.

= Derivations = 

== Derivations ==

At [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Validity|Validity]], we introduced the notion of ''validity'' for formulae and for arguments.  In sentential logic, a valid formula is a tautology.

Up to now, we could show a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to be valid (a tautology) in the following ways.

* Do a truth table for &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* Obtain &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as a substitution instance of a formula already known to be valid.

* Obtain &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; by applying interchange of equivalents to a formula already know to be valid.

Truth tables become unavailable in predicate logic.  Without an alternate method, there will be no way of getting the second two methods started since they need already known validities to work.  Derivations provide such an alternate method for showing a formula valid, a method that continues to work even after truth tables become unavailable.  This page, together with the several following it, introduce this technique.  Note, the claim that a derivation shows an argument valid assumes a sound derivation system, see ''soundness'' below.

A derivation is a series of numbered lines, each line consisting of a formula with an annotation.  The annotations provide the justification for adding the line to the derivation.  A derivation is a highly formalized analogue to&amp;mdash;or perhaps a model of&amp;mdash;a mathematical proof.

A typical derivation system will allow some of the following types of lines:

* A line may be an axiom.  The derivation system may specify a set of formula as axioms.  These are accepted as true for any derivation.  For sentential logic the set of axioms is a fixed subset of tautologies.

* A line may be an assumption.  A derivation may have several types of assumptions.  The following cover the standard cases.

:* A premise.  When attempting to show the validity of an argument, a premise of that argument may be assumed.

:* A temporary assumption for use in a subderivation.  Such assumptions are intended to be active for only part of a derivation and must be discharged (made inactive) before the derivation is considered complete.  Subderivations will be introduced on a later page.

* A line may result from applying an inference rule to previous lines.  An ''inference'' is a syntactic transformation of previous lines to generate a new line.  Inferences are required to follow one of a fixed set of patterns defined by the derivation system.  These patterns are the system's ''inference rules''.  The idea is that any inference fitting an inference rule should be a valid argument.

== Soundness and validity ==

We noted at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Semantics | Formal Semantics]] that a formal language such as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted via several alternative and even competing semantic rule-sets.  Multiple derivation systems can be also defined for a given syntax-semantics pair.  A triple consisting of a formal syntax, a formal semantics, and a derivation system is a ''logical system''.

A derivation is intended to show an argument to be valid.  A derivation of a zero-premise argument is intended to show its conclusion to be a valid formula&amp;mdash;in sentential logic this means showing it to be a tautology.  These are the intentions.  Given a logical system, the derivation system is ''sound'' if and only if it achieves this goal.  That is, a derivation system is ''sound'' (has the property of ''soundness'') if and only if every formula (and argument) derivable in its derivation system is valid (given a syntax and a semantics).

Another desirable quality of a derivation system is completeness.  Given a logical system, its derivation system is ''complete'' if and only if every valid formula is derivable.  However, there are some logics for which no derivation system is or can be complete.

Soundness and completeness are metalogic substantial results.  Their proofs will not be given here, but are available in many standard metalogic text books.

== Turnstiles ==

The &lt;math&gt;\vDash\,\!&lt;/math&gt; symbol is sometimes called a ''turnstile'', in particular a ''semantic turnstile''.  We previously introduced the following three uses of this symbol.

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | (1)
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v} \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;40px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| (2)
| &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is valid.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| (3)
| &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; implies (has as a logical consequence) &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
|}


Derivations have a counterpart to the semantic turnstile, namely the ''syntactic turnstile''.  (1) above has no syntactic counterpart.  However, (2) and (3) above have the following counterparts.

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | (4)
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\vdash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;40px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is provable.
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| (5)
| &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; proves (has as a derivational consequence) &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
|}


(4) is the case if and only if there is a correct derivation of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; from no premises. Similarly, (5) is the case if and only if there is a correct derivation of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which takes the members of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as premises. 

The negations of (4) and (5) above are

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | (6)
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\not\vdash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;
| (7)
| &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \not\vdash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}


We can now define soundness and completeness as follows:

* Given a logical system, its derivation system is ''sound'' if and only if:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }\Gamma \vdash \varphi,\mbox{ then }\Gamma \vDash \varphi.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* Given a logical system, its derivation system is ''complete'' if and only if:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }\Gamma \vDash \varphi,\mbox{ then }\Gamma \vdash \varphi.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Circuit Theory/Page}}

== Steady State ==
&quot;Steady State&quot; means that we are not dealing with turning on or turning off circuits in this section. We are assuming that the circuit was turned on a very long time ago and it is behaving in a pattern. We are computing what the pattern will look like. The &quot;complex frequency&quot; section models turning on and off a circuit with an exponential.

== Sinusoidal Forcing Functions ==

Let us consider a general AC forcing function:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = M\sin(\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, the term M is called the &quot;Magnitude&quot;, and it acts like a scaling factor that allows the peaks of the sinusoid to be higher or lower than +/- 1. The term &amp;omega; is what is known as the &quot;Radial Frequency&quot;. The term &amp;phi; is an offset parameter known as the &quot;Phase&quot;.

Sinusoidal sources can be current sources, but most often they are voltage sources.

== Other Terms ==

There are a few other terms that are going to be used in many of the following sections, so we will introduce them here:

;Period : The period of a sinusoidal function is the amount of time, in seconds, that the sinusoid takes to make a complete wave. The period of a sinusoid is always denoted with a capital T. This is not to be confused with a lower-case t, which is used as the independent variable for time.

;Frequency : Frequency is the reciprocal of the period, and is the number of times, per second, that the sinusoid completes an entire cycle. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). The relationship between frequency and the Period is as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:Where f is the variable most commonly used to express the frequency.

;Radian Frequency : Radian frequency is the value of the frequency expressed in terms of Radians Per Second, instead of Hertz. Radian Frequency is denoted with the variable &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. The relationship between the Frequency, and the Radian Frequency is as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;

;Phase : The phase is a quantity, expressed in radians, of the time shift of a sinusoid. A sinusoid phase-shifted &lt;math&gt;\phi = +2 \pi&lt;/math&gt; is moved forward by 1 whole period, and looks exactly the same. An important fact to remember is this:

::&lt;math&gt;\sin (\frac{\pi}{2}-t) = \cos (t)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sin (t) = \cos (t - \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Phase is often expressed with many different variables, including &lt;math&gt;\phi, \psi, \theta, \gamma&lt;/math&gt; etc... This wikibook will try to stick with the symbol &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, to prevent confusion.

== Lead and Lag ==

A circuit element may have both a voltage across its terminals and a current flowing through it. If one of the two (current or voltage) is a sinusoid, then the other must also be a sinusoid (remember, voltage is the derivative of the current, and the derivative of a sinusoid is always a sinusoid). However, the sinusoids of the voltage and the current may differ by quantities of magnitude and phase.

If the current has a lower phase angle than the voltage the current is said to '''lag''' the voltage. If the current has a higher phase angle then the voltage, it is said to '''lead''' the voltage. Many circuits can be classified and examined using lag and lead ideas.

== Sinusoidal Response ==

Reactive components (capacitors and inductors) are going to take energy out of a circuit like a resistor and then pump some of it back into the circuit like a source. The result is initially a mess. But after a while (5 time constants), the circuit starts behaving in a pattern. The capacitors and inductors get in a rhythm that reflects the driving sources. If the source is sinusoidal, the currents and voltages will be sinusoidal. This is called the &quot;particular&quot; or &quot;steady state&quot; response. In general:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{in} \cos(\omega_{in} t + \phi_{in}) \to A_{out} \cos(\omega_{out} t + \phi_{out})&lt;/math&gt;

What happens initially, what happens if the capacitor is initially charged, what happens if sources are switched in and out of a circuit is that there is an energy imbalance. A voltage or current source might be charged by the initial energy in a capacitor. The derivative of the voltage across an Inductor might instantaneously switch polarity. Lots of things are happening. We are going to save this for later. Here we deal with the steady state or &quot;particular&quot; response first.

== Sinusoidal Conventions ==

For the purposes of this book we will generally use cosine functions, as opposed to sine functions. If we absolutely need to use a sine, we can remember the following trigonometric identity:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \sin(\pi/2 -\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can express all sine functions as cosine functions. This way, we don't have to compare apples to oranges per se. This is simply a convention that this wikibook chooses to use to keep things simple. We could easily choose to use all sin( ) functions, but further down the road it is often more convenient to use cosine functions instead by default.

== Sinusoidal Sources ==
There are two primary sinusoidal sources: wall outlets and [[:w:Electronic_oscillator|oscillators]]. Oscillators are typically crystals that electrically vibrate and are found in devices that communicate or display video such as TV's, computers, cell phones, radios. An electrical engineer or tech's working area will typically include a &quot;[[:w:Function_generator|function generator]]&quot; which can produce oscillations at many frequencies and in shapes that are not just sinusoidal. 

RMS or [[:w:Root mean square|Root mean square]] is a measure of amplitude that compares with DC magnitude in terms of power, strength of motor, brightness of light, etc. The trouble is that there are several types of AC amplitude:
*peak
*peak to peak
*average
*RMS

Wall outlets are called [[:w:Alternating current|AC]] or alternating current.
Wall outlets are sinusoidal voltage sources that range from 100 RMS volts, 50 Hz to 240 RMS volts 60 Hz world wide. RMS, rather than peak (which makes more sense mathematically), is used to describe magnitude for several reasons:
*historical reasons related to the competition between Edison (DC power) and Tesla (Sinusoidal or AC power)
*effort to compare/relate AC (wall outlets) to DC (cars, batteries) .. 100 RMS volts is approximately 100 DC volts.
*average sinusoidal is zero
*meter movements ([[:w:Ammeter#Types|physical needles moving]] on measurement devices) were designed to measure both DC and RMS AC

RMS is a type of average: &lt;math&gt;
p_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt {{1 \over {T_2-T_1}} {\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {[p(t)]}^2\, dt}}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[:w:Three-phase_electric_power|Electrical power delivery]] is a complicated subject that will not be covered in this course. Here we are trying to define terms, design devices that use the power and understand clearly what comes out of wall outlets.</text>

== Phasor Analysis ==

The mathematical representations of individual circuit elements can be converted into phasor notation, and then the circuit can be solved using phasors.

== Resistance, Impedance and Admittance ==

In phasor notation, resistance, capacitance, and inductance can all be lumped together into a single term called &quot;impedance&quot;. The phasor used for impedance is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. The inverse of Impedance is called &quot;Admittance&quot; and is denoted with a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Y}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V}&lt;/math&gt; is Voltage and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt; is current. 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = \frac{1}{\mathbb{Y}}&lt;/math&gt;

And the Ohm's law for phasors becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = \mathbb{Z} \mathbb{I} = \frac{\mathbb{I}}{\mathbb{Y}}&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note at this point that ''Ohm's Law still holds true'' even when we switch from the time domain to the phasor domain. This is made all the more amazing by the fact that the new term, impedance, is no longer a property only of resistors, but now encompasses all load elements on a circuit (capacitors and inductors too!).

Impedance is still measured in units of Ohms, and admittance (like Conductance, its DC-counterpart) is still measured in units of Siemens.

Let's take a closer look at this equation:

{{eqn|Ohm's Law with Phasors}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V} = \mathbb{Z} \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;

If we break this up into polar notation, we get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;M_V \angle \phi_V = (M_Z \times M_I) \angle (\phi_Z + \phi_I)&lt;/math&gt;

{{Wikipedia|Electrical impedance}}

This is important, because it shows that not only are the magnitude values of voltage and current related to each other, but also the phase angle of their respective waves are also related. Different circuit elements will have different effects on both the magnitude and the phase angle of the voltage given a certain current. We will explore those relationships below.

== Resistors ==

Resistors do not affect the phase of the voltage or current, only the magnitude. Therefore, the impedance of a resistor with resistance R is:

{{eqn|Resistor Impedance}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = R \angle 0&lt;/math&gt;

Through a resistor, the phase difference between current and voltage will not change. This is important to remember when analyzing circuits.

== Capacitors ==

A capacitor with a capacitance of C has a phasor value:

{{eqn|Capacitor Impedance}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = C \angle \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

To write this in terms of degrees, we can say:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = C \angle (-90^{\circ})&lt;/math&gt;

We can accept this for now as being axiomatic.  If we consider the fact that phasors can be graphed on the imaginary plane, we can easily see that the angle of &lt;math&gt;-\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; points directly downward, along the negative imaginary axis. We then come to an important conclusion: The impedance of a capacitor is ''imaginary'', in a sense. Since the angle follows directly along the imaginary axis, there is no real part to the phasor at all. Because there is no real part to the impedance, we can see that capacitors have no resistance (because resistance is a real value, as stated above).

=== Reactance ===

A capacitor with a capacitance of C in an AC circuit with an angular velocity &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; has a reactance given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{X} = \frac {1}{\omega C} \angle (-90^{\circ})&lt;/math&gt;

Reactance is the impedance specific to an AC circuit with angular velocity &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;.

== Inductors ==

Inductors have a phasor value:

{{eqn|Inductor Impedance}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = L \angle \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where L is the inductance of the inductor. We can also write this using degrees:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} = L \angle (90^\circ)&lt;/math&gt;

Like capacitors, we can see that the phasor for inductor shows that the value of the impedance is located directly on the imaginary axis. However, the phasor value for inductance points in exactly the opposite direction from the capacitance phasor. We notice here also that inductors have no resistance, because the resistance is a real value, and inductors have only an imaginary value.

=== Reactance ===

In an AC circuit with a source angular velocity of &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;, and inductor with inductance L.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{X} = \omega L \angle (90^\circ)&lt;/math&gt;

== Impedances Connected in Series ==

If there are several impedances connected in series, the equivalent impedance is simply a sum of the impedance values:

 ----[ Z1 ]----[ Z2 ]--- ... ---[ Zn ]---   ==&gt; ---[ Zseries ]---

{{eqn|Impedances in Series}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{series} \mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z}_{series}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice how much easier this is than having to differentiate between the formulas for combining capacitors, resistors, and inductors in series. Notice also that resistors, capacitors, and inductors can all be mixed without caring which type of element they are. This is valuable, because we can now combine different elements into a single impedance value, as opposed to different values of inductance, capacitance, and resistance. 

Keep in mind however, that phasors need to be converted to rectangular coordinates before they can be added together. If you know the formulas, you can write a small computer program, or even a small application on a programmable calculator to make the conversion for you.

== Impedances in Parallel ==

Impedances connected in parallel can be combined in a slightly more complicated process:

{{eqn|Impedances in Parallel}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{parallel} = \frac{\prod_N Z_n}{\sum_N Z_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Where N is the total number of impedances connected in parallel with each other. Impedances may be multiplied in the polar representation, but they must be converted to rectangular coordinates for the summation. This calculation can be a little bit time consuming, but when you consider the alternative (having to deal with each type of element separately), we can see that this is much easier.

== Steps For Solving a Circuit With Phasors ==

There are a few general steps for solving a circuit with phasors:

# Convert all elements to phasor notation
# Combine impedances, if possible
# Combine Sources, if possible
# Use Ohm's Law, and Kirchoff's laws to solve the circuit
# Convert back into time-domain representation

Unfortunately, phasors can only be used with sinusoidal input functions. We cannot employ phasors when examining a DC circuit, nor can we employ phasors when our input function is any non-sinusoidal periodic function. To handle these cases, we will look at more general methods in later chapters

== Network Function ==

The network function is a phasor, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; that is a ratio of the circuit's input to its output. This is important, because if we can solve a circuit down to find the network function, we can find the response to ''any'' sinusoidal input, by simply multiplying by the network function. With time-domain analysis, we would have to solve the circuit for every new input, and this would be very time consuming indeed.

Network functions are defined in the following way:

{{eqn|Network Function}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H} = \frac{\mathbb{Y}}{\mathbb{X}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is the phasor representation of the circuit's output, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the representation of the circuit's input. In the time domain, to find the output, we would need to convolute the input with the impulse response. With the network function, however, it becomes a simple matter of multiplying the input phasor with the network function, to get the output phasor. Using this method, we have converted an entire circuit to become a simple function that changes magnitude and phase angle.

== Gain ==

Gain is the amount by which the magnitude of the sinusoid is amplified or attenuated by the circuit. Gain can be computed from the Network function as such:

{{eqn|Gain}}
:&lt;math&gt;Gain = \left| \mathbb{H}(\omega) \right| 
           = \frac{\left| \mathbb{Y}(\omega) \right|}{\left| \mathbb{X}(\omega) \right|}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where the bars around the phasors are the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the phasor, and not the &quot;absolute value&quot; as they are in other math texts. Again, gain may be a measure of the magnitude change in either current or voltage. Most frequently, however, it is used to describe voltage.

== Phase Shift ==

The phase shift of a function is the amount of phase change between the input signal and the output signal. This can be calculated from the network function as such:

{{eqn|Phase Shift}}
:&lt;math&gt;\angle \mathbb{H}(\omega) = \angle \mathbb{Y}(\omega) - \angle \mathbb{X}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Where the &lt;math&gt;\angle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the phase of the phasor.

Again, the phase change may represent current or voltage.</text>

== Circuit Functions ==

This appendix page will list the various values of the variable H that have been used throughout the circuit theory textbooks. These values of H are all equivalent, but are represented in different domains. All of the H functions are a ratio of the circuit input over the circuit output.

== The &quot;Impulse Response&quot; ==

The '''impulse response''' is the time-domain relationship between the circuit input and the circuit output, denoted with the following notation:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The impulse response is, strictly speaking, the output that the circuit will produce when an ideal impulse function is the input. The impulse response can be used to determine the output from the input through the convolution operation:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = h(t) * x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

== The &quot;Network Function&quot; ==

The '''network function''' is the phasor-domain representation of the impulse response. The network function is denoted as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

The network function is related to the input and output of the circuit through the following relationships:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Y}(\omega) = \mathbb{H}(\omega) \mathbb{X}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the network function can be received by dividing the output by the input, in the phasor domain.

== The &quot;Transfer Function&quot; ==

The '''transfer function''' is the laplace-transformed representation of the impulse response. It is denoted with the following notation:

:&lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;

The transfer function can be obtained by one of two methods:

#Transform the impulse response.
#Transform the circuit, and solve.

The Transfer function is related to the input and output as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(s) = H(s) X(s)&lt;/math&gt;

== The &quot;Frequency Response&quot; ==

The '''Frequency Response''' is the fourier-domain representation of the impulse response. It is denoted as such:

:&lt;math&gt;H(j \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

The frequency response can be obtained in one of three ways:

#Transform the impulse response
#Transform the circuit and solve
#Substitute &lt;math&gt;s = j \omega&lt;/math&gt; into the transfer function

The frequency response has the following relationship to the circuit input and output:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(j \omega) = H(j \omega) X(j \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

The frequency response is particularly useful when discussing a sinusoidal input, or when constructing a bode diagram.</text>

the first page will eventually turn into the second. The idea of where psychology is derived from will give psychology a lot more meaning. As with other sciences, such as sociology that is derived from history and philosophy, psychology is from philosophy and biology.

The many great contributors and thinkers that brought in their wisdom to help advance this field to the smallest degree is important because they were all building blocks. --[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 03:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''6.1 Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions''' ==


6.1.1 : If the reaction produces heat (increases the temperature of the surroundings) then it's exothermic. If it decreases the temp (that is, absorbs heat) then it's endothermic. Also, the yield of an equilibrium reaction which is exothermic will be increased if it occurs at low temps, and so for endothermic reactions at high temps.

6.1.2 : Exothermic -&gt; a reaction which produces heat. Endothermic -&gt; a reaction which absorbs heat. Enthalpy of reaction -&gt; the change in internal energy (H) through a reaction is ∆H.

6.1.3 : ∆H will be negative for exothermic reactions (because internal heat is being lost) and positive for endothermic reactions (because internal energy is being gained).

6.1.4 : The most stable state is where all energy has been released...therefore when going to a more stable state, energy will be released, and when going to a less stable state, energy will be gained. On an enthalpy level diagrams, higher positions will be less stable (with more internal energy) therefore, if the product is lower, heat is released (more stable, ∆H is -ve) but if it is higher, heat is gained (less stable, ∆H is +ve).

6.1.5 : Formation of bonds -&gt; release of energy. Breaking of bonds -&gt; gain / absorption of energy.

== '''6.2 Calculation of enthalpy change'''s ==


6.2.1 : change in energy = mass x specific heat capacity x change in temperature --&gt; E = mc∆T

6.2.2 : Enthalpy changes (∆H) are related to the number of moles in the reaction...if all the coefficients are doubled, then the value of ∆H will be doubled (attention must be paid to limiting reagents though).

6.2.3 : When a reaction is carried out in water, the water will gain or lose heat from (or to) the reaction, with hopefully little escaping the water. Therefore, the change in energy, and so the ∆H value, can be calculated with E = mc∆T where E is equal to ∆H, m is the mass of water present, and c = 4.18 kJ Kg-1 K-1. This ∆H value can then be calculated back to find the enthalpy change for each mol of reactants.

6.2.4 : The solution should be placed in a container as insulated as possible, to keep as much heat as possible from escaping. The temperature should be measured continuously , and the value used in the equation is the maximum change in temp from the initial position.

6.2.5 : The results will be a change in temperature. this can be converted into a change in heat (or energy) by using the above equation and a known mass of water. this can be used to calculate the ∆H for the amount of reactants present, and then this can be used to calculate for a given number of mols.

== '''6.3 Hess' Law''' ==


6.3.1 : Hess' Law states that the total enthalpy change between given reactants and products is that same regardless of any intermediate steps (or the reaction pathway). To calculate:

1) Reverse any reactions which are going the wrong way and invert the sign of their ∆H values (multiply by -1) 

2) Divide or multiply the reactions until the intermediate products will cancel out when the reactions are vertically added (always multiply/divide the ∆H value by the same number)

3) Vertically add the reactions.

4) Divide or multiply the resulting reaction to the correct coefficients.

== '''6.4 Bond enthalpies''' ==

6.4.1 : Bond enthalpy (aka dissociation enthalpy) -- the enthalpy change when one mole of bonds are broken homolitically in the gas phase. ie X-Y(g) -&gt; X(g) + Y(g) : ∆H(dissociation). Molecules such as CH4 have multiple C-H bonds to be broken, and so the bond enthalpy for C-H is actually an average value. These values can be used to calculate unknown enthalpy changes in reactions where only a few bonds are being formed/broken.

6.4.2 : If the reaction can be expressed in terms of the breaking and formation of bonds in a gaseous state, then by adding (or subtracting when bonds are formed) the ∆H values the total enthalpy of reaction can be found.


== '''6.5 Entropy''' ==


6.5.1 An increased disorder (entropy) can be caused by mixing two different types of particles, increased movement of particles (including state changes), or increased number of particles.  Increasing the number of particles in a gaseous state gives the largest change in entropy.

6.5.2 Since ∆S = -∆H/T, if ∆H is -, then ∆s is positive, and visa versa.

== '''6.6 Free Energy''' ==


6.6.1 Standard free energy of reaction is the free energy that a reaction takes or gives at standard values of temperature and pressure.  ∆G = ∆H - T.∆S

6.6.2 If ∆G is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. If ∆G is positive, the reaction is not spontaneous. 

6.6.3 If  ∆sT &gt; ∆H, the reaction is spontaneous. If temperature drops so that ∆sT &lt; ∆H, then the reaction is non-spontaneous.

=HL Material=

15.1

15.1.1 Standard state is what the element naturally tends to be at. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy that accompanies the formation of one mole of a compound from its elements with all substances in their standard states.

15.1.2 ∆Hof = ∑∆Hof products - ∑∆Hof reactants

15.2

15.2.1 Lattice Enthalpy is the enthalpy of a lattice structure, such as a diamond. If the sign of the enthalpy is negative, the lattice is formed. If +, it does not.

15.3

15.3.1 ∆S = ∆Sproducts - ∆Sreactants

15.3.2 Use the equation ∆G = ∆H –T∆S or ∆G = ∆Gproducts - ∆Greactants

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kinetics''' is a study of the progress of a chemical reaction, especially the rate of the reaction.

== Rates of Reaction ==
The ''rate of reaction'' is concerned with how quickly a reaction reaches a certain point. Technically, it is defined as the increase of product concentration over time, or, the decrease of reactant concentration over time. The SI unit of rate of reaction is mol/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which means moles per dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or moles per liter. In short, the rate of a chemical reaction can be generalized as the following, when X is a reactant:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta[X]}{\Delta time}&lt;/math&gt;

The rate of reaction can only be determined experimentally. 

7.1.2 : Interpretation of rate graphs. Reaction rate graphs will generally be graphed with time on the x-axis and some measure of how far the reaction has gone (ie concentration, volume, mass loss etc) on the y-axis. This will generally produce a curve with, for example, the concentration of the reactants approaching zero.

== The Collision Theory ==
The collision theory is the main theory that concerns kinetics. It tells us under which circumstances reactions occur and how different factors affect the rate of reaction. According to the collision theory, reactions can only occur when:

# Reactants collide in the correct orientation.
# Reactants have the enough energy to form its products.

The energy required for reactants to form its products is called the ''activation energy'' (denoted as E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;). The activation energy is essential in kinetics, as it allows us to determine whether if a reaction can take place. A reaction is said to be ''spontaneous'' when it able to produce reactants.

=== What Happens During a Reaction ===
A chemical reaction is essentially involves two processes, bond breaking and bond forming. As mentioned in the [[IB Chemistry/Energetics|Energetics chapter]], particles tend to react to become more stable. 

=== The Reaction Coordinate ===
The ''reaction coordinate'', also called the ''reaction pathway'', describes the changes in energy in the system throughout the reaction. The reaction coordinate is usually presented graphically, in a diagram called the ''energy profile'' (see Fig. 1).
[[File:Coordenada_reaccion.png|thumb|Fig. 1. The reaction depicted in the energy profile is A+B→C+D, where A and B are the reactants, and C and D are the products. The y-axis denotes the energy levels of the system throughout the reaction. The x-axis, on the other hand, denotes the reaction pathway.]]
The activation energy is the energy change from the reactants to the highest energy state of the reaction. 

=== Enthalpy Change ===
ΔH, or ''enthalpy change'', is the difference between the energy of the system when reactants are formed and the energy of the system when products are formed. Enthalpy is very similar to energy, but enthalpy is the energy of the system under a constant pressure. The enthalpy change is particularly important, as it determines whether if the reaction is ''exothermic'', or ''endothermic''. As you might have noticed on the graph, the energy of the A+B are lower than that of C+D. Where did the energy go? The energy is released outside the system, in other words, the ''energy is released to the environment''. Reactions that result in energy released to the environment are called ''exothermic reactions''. When the energy of reactants are lower than that of products, then energy is absorbed into the system, making the reaction ''exothermic''. 

Usually, the energy released to the environment in the form of heat energy, enabling us to detect a rise in temperature. However, the released energy can also be released in the form of light and sound energy. Similarly, endothermic reactions, which absorbs energy from the environment, cause an increase in energy in the system, usually resulting in a drop in temperature. This description leads to one of the most common misconceptions of endothermic reactions, as you may wonder why temperature decreases when energy is increased in the system. Energy is stored in bonds of the particles in the system in the form of chemical energy, rather than heat energy. Therefore, when a decrease in temperature is detected (using an instrument or through touch), ''heat energy'' is decreased in the environment. 

7.2.1 : Collision theory -- reactions take place as a result of particles (atoms or molecules) colliding and then undergoing a reaction. Not all collisions cause reaction, however, even in a system where the reaction is spontaneous. The particles must have sufficient kinetic energy, and the correct orientation with respect to each other for the two to react. Even then, the transition state may revert to the reactant molecules instead of forming the product molecules.

7.2.2 : Higher temperature causes a greater average kinetic energy of the particles in a material. This leads to a faster reaction because there are more collisions, and each collision is more likely to succeed.

Higher concentrations cause more collisions and therefore a faster reaction.

Catalysts may provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy and increase the probability of proper orientation. Each collision is more likely to succeed and this results in a faster reaction.

In heterogeneous reactions (where the reactants are in different states) the size of the particles of a solid may change reaction rate, since the surface is where the reaction takes place, and the surface area is increased when the particles are more finely divided; therefore smaller solid particles in a heterogeneous reaction cause a faster reaction.

7.2.3 : Most reactions involve several steps, which can be individually slow or fast, and which, all together, make up the complete reaction. The slowest of these steps is called the rate determining step, as is determines how fast the reaction will go. It is also not necessary that all the reactants are involved in ever step, and so the rate determining step may not involve all the reactants. as a result, increasing their concentration (for example) of a reactant which is not involved in the rate determining step will not change the overall reaction rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;'''Equilibrium'''&lt;/center&gt;

'''Equilibrium''' primarily deals with reversible reactions and the state of equilibrium itself. Equilibrium can be defined as a state reached of a reversible reaction, in which the rate of the forward and backward reactions equal.

== Dynamic equilibrium ==

8.1.1 : In all reactions, there are in fact two reactions occurring, one where the reactants produce the products, and the other where the products react to form the reactants. In some reactions, this second reaction is insignificant, but in others there comes a point where the two reactions exactly cancel each other out...thus the reactants and products remain in equal proportions, though both are continually being used up and produced at the same time.

8.2 The position of equilibrium

8.2.1 : The equilibrium constant Kc is a constant which represents how far the reaction will proceed at a given temperature.

8.2.2 : When Kc is greater than 1, products exceed reactants (at equilibrium). When much greater than 1, the reaction goes almost to completion. When Kc is less than 1, reactants exceed products. When much less than 1 (Kc can never be negative...so when it is close to zero) the reaction hardly occurs at all.

8.2.3 : The only thing which can change the value of Kc for a given reaction is a change in temperature. The position of equilibrium, however, can change without a change in the value of Kc.

Effect of Temperature : The effect of a change of temperature on a reaction will depend on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. When the temperature increases, Le Chatelier's principle says the reaction will proceed in such a way as to counteract this change, ie lower the temperature. Therefore, endothermic reactions will move forward, and exothermic reactions will move backwards (thus becoming endothermic). The reverse is true for a lowering of temperature.

Effect of Concentration : When the concentration of a product is increased, the reaction proceeds in reverse to decrease the concentration of the products. When the concentration of a reactant is increased, the reaction proceeds forward to decrease the concentration of reactants.

Effect of Pressure : In reactions where gases are produced (or there are more mols of gas on the right), and increase in pressure will force the reaction to move to the left (in reverse). If pressure is decreased, the reaction will proceed forward to increase pressure. If there are more mols of gas on the left of the equation, this is all reversed.

8.2.4 : Based on the previous section, you should be able to predict what's going to happen given a reaction if the temperature, pressure, or concentration is changed.

8.2.5 : A catalyst does not effect either Kc or the position of equilibrium, it only effects the rate of reaction.

8.2.6 : N2(g) + 3H2(g) &lt;=&gt; 2NH3(g) : delta-H = -92.4 kJ mol-1 as can be seen, there are more mols of gas on the left than the right, so a greater yield will be produced at high pressure. The reaction is exothermic, therefore it will give a greater yield at low temperatures, however this is not possible as the rate of reaction becomes too low, and the temperature must actually be increased. A catalyst of finely divided iron is also used to help speed the reaction (finely divided to maximize the surface area).

==Properties of acids and bases==

===Properties of acids and bases in aqueous solution===

A reaction between a strong acid and a strong base produces water and a salt. For a reaction between a weak acid with a strong base, or between a strong acid with a weak base, only a salt is produced. For example:

&lt;math&gt;{}^{\rm{HCl} + \rm{NaOH} \to \rm{H}_2\rm{O} + \rm{NaCl}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{}^{\rm{HCl} + \rm{NH}_3 \to \rm{NH}_4\rm{Cl}}&lt;/math&gt;

		Acids reacting with metals will produce hydrogen gas, e.g. &lt;math&gt;{}^{2 \rm{HCl} + \rm{Mg} \to \rm{MgCl}_2 + \rm{H}_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

		Acids reacting with carbonates will produce water and carbon dioxide, e.g. &lt;math&gt;{}^{2 \rm{HCl} + \rm{CaCO}_3 \to \rm{CO}_2 + \rm{H}_2\rm{O} + \rm{CaCl}_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Experimental properties of acids and bases===

{{TODO|Make this paragraph coherent}}

When acids and bases neutralize, the reaction is noticeably exothermic (i.e.,
		heat can be felt coming from the reaction). Obviously, they will
		have an effect on the color of indicators as described below.
		The hydrogen produced in the reaction of acids with metal will
		produce a 'pop' sound if a match is held to it, and the CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; from the carbonate reaction will turn limewater a milky white when bubbled trough it.
		
Examples of some acids: &lt;math&gt;{}^{\rm{HCl}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{}^{\rm{CH}_3\rm{COOH}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{}^{\rm{H}_2\rm{SO}_4}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{}^{{\rm{NH}_4}^+}&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of bases: &lt;math&gt;{}^{\rm{NaOH}}&lt;/math&gt;, NH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;, CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;COO&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;.

==Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases==
		
=== 8.1.1: Define acids and bases according to Brønsted Lowry theory ===
According to the [[w:Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted|Brønsted]]-[[w:Martin Lowry|Lowry]] theory, acids are defined as proton (H&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; ion) donors and bases are defined as proton acceptors.

=== ===
For a compound to act as a B-L acid, it must have a hydrogen
		atom in it, which it is capable of losing while remaining fairly
		stable. A BL base must be capable of accepting a hydrogen ion
		while remaining relatively stable (or reacting to form a stable
		compound, e.g. water and a salt). Some compounds (such as water)
		may act as both, e.g. (H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;O-&amp;gt; OH&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt; or H&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;). These substances are called &quot;amphoteric&quot;.

=== ===
Acid base reactions always involve an acid-base conjugate pair. If the reactant is an acid, the matching product is its conjugate base, e.g. HCl/Cl&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;, CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;COOH/CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;COO&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt;, NH&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;/NH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;.

=== ===
The conjugate base will always have one less H atom than
		the acid (or the acid one more than the base). In compounds where
		there are many hydrogen atoms, the one which is held the weakest
		is generally the one which is lost, and this must be reflected
		in the writing of the compound, as in the CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;COOH example above.

=='''Lewis theory'''==
=== ===
Lewis defined acids as electron pair acceptors and bases as electron pair donors.

A simple proton-hydroxide reaction shows that this is equivalent to Brønsted-Lowry theory:

H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + :OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; H-OH

The proton is accepted because the hydroxide has a pair of electrons with which it forms a covalent bond to the proton.

Lewis theory goes beyond Brønsted-Lowry theory to describe non-proton acid-base reactions:

F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B + :NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Ligands and nucleophiles can be classed as Lewis bases. Lewis acids include metal ions and electrophiles.

Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 :NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

==8.3 - Strong and weak acids and bases==

===8.3.1 Distinguish between strong and weak acids and bases in terms of the extent of dissociation, reaction with water and electrical conductivity. ===
Strong and weak acids are defined by their ease of losing
		(or donating) a proton. A strong acid, when placed in water, will
		almost fully ionise/dissociate straight away, producing H&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; ions from water. a weak acid will, however, only partially do
		this, leaving some unreacted acid remaining. This is set up as
		an equilibrium, and so when some of the H&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; ions produced by a weak acid are reacted, LCP means that more
		of the acid will react to form H&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; ions. This means that, given an equal number of moles of acid,
		they will be neutralized by the same amount of strong base, but
		their solutions will have different pH values. A weak base is
		the same as this, only it accepts protons and so produces OH&lt;SUP&gt;-&lt;/SUP&gt; ions from water rather than H&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt;. Any solution's ability to conduct electricity is defined by
		its ionic charges. As a result, a strong acid will produce
		more charged ions than a weak one, and so its solution will be
		a better electrical conductor than a weak acid. The same goes
		for strong/weak bases.

=== Examples of strong and weak acids and bases ===
Strong acids : HCl, HNO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;, H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;SO&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;, HClO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;, HBr
. 

Weak acids : CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;COOH, H&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;CO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;. 
Strong bases : group 1 hydroxides (e.g. NaOH, etc.), BaOH. 

Weak bases : NH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;, CH&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;CH&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;NH&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;.

===8.3.3 - Distinguish between strong and weak acids and bases and determine the relative strengths of acids and bases using experimental data. ===
The strength of an acid or base can obviously be measured
		with a universal indicator or a pH meter, and also the rate of
		reaction. Hydrogen production with metals or CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; with CaCO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; will reveal the strength of an acid. The relative acidities can also be found by
		neutralizing two acids with a strong base in the presence of an indicator.

==The pH scale==

=== ===
pH values range up and down from 7 (being the neutral value
		of pure water at 25°C and 1 atmosphere). Lower pH value are acidic; higher
		values are basic. pH can be measured with a pH meter, or with
		pH paper (paper containing a mixture of indicators to cause a
		continuous color change). pH is a measure of the concentration of H&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;O&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; ions.

=== ===
If we have two solutions with their pH values, the lower
		one will be more acidic and the higher one will be more basic
		(though they could both still be basic/acidic with respect to
		water – pH 7).
		&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;9.4.3&lt;/i&gt; : a change of 1 in the pH scale represents a 10 times change
		in the acidity or basicity of the solution (because it is a log
		scale). Concentration is equal to 10&lt;SUP&gt;-pH&lt;/SUP&gt;  or pH=-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] where [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution.

#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـثـبـتـف&lt;/font&gt; /b-θ-b-t-f/&lt;br&gt;

Remember, [θ] is the voiceless &quot;th&quot; sound as in &quot;thing&quot;.

A group of letters is shown connecting as they would in a word. Your job is to read the word from right-to-left (that is the way Arabic is written and read), and write the English transliteration letters (from left-to-right). Separate transliterated letters with dashes.

Note: Because you have not learned about writing vowels in Arabic, the transliteration only includes consonants. For example &quot;b-t-t&quot;, this means that the word contains the consonants in the word in that order, the vowels are not indicated yet. Because the vowels aren't indicated the pseudo-word might be pronounced /ba-ta-ta/, /bi-ti-ti/, /bit-ti/, /bat-tu/, /bu-tat/, /bat-ta/ and so on.


We learned previously that the letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ب&lt;/font&gt; (baa) makes the &quot;b&quot; sound, its name is &quot;baa&quot;. 
So&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; بتت &lt;/font&gt;/b-t-t/  can be spelled out (baa, taa, taa) but the pronunciation of the word is not the same as how it is spelled. Once you learn about writing vowels you will be able to read words with vowels.

Transliterate, use the reference chart below the exercise to help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Biological Basis of Behavior==

Like every other aspect of life, behavior is determined largely by an individual's [[DNA]] makeup.  DNA can be considered as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for every aspect of life.  [[Evolutionary psychologists]] study the role of natural selection in the passing on of behavioral and other psychological traits.  Genetic makeup is generally believed to account for much of an individual's [[temperament]].

===Structure and Function of DNA===

The nucleic acids are the largest of the organic molecules.  DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.  It is made up of units called [[nucleotides]], which themselves are composed of  a deoxyribose 5-carbon sugar molecule, a nitrogen base, and a phosphate group.  These nucleotides are bonded in columns by phosphate covalent bonds (very strong), and are laterally bound to other nucleotides with weaker hydrogen bonds.  Nucleotides are arranged such that they form [[genes]], which are specific biochemical units that code for a characteristic.  In [[DNA replication]], DNA is split and transcribed to form proteins, which are the basic structural units of life.
Individual-to-individual variance, introduced in reproduction and meiosis, is the basis for different personality traits and differences in temperament between individuals.

===Natural Selection in Behavioral Traits===

The theory of natural selection may be applied to psychological, as well as biological traits.  This is known as ''evolutionary psychology'' or ''the evolutionary perspective''.

The basic idea of evolutionary psychology is this; genetic mutations are capable of altering not only an organism's physical traits, but also its behavioral traits.  Like physical traits, these mutations may help the organism reproduce and pass its mutation on to the next generation.  This theory explains how behaviors like mating rituals and migration came to be multi-generation rituals in some species.

====Controversy Surrounding====
Presently, the evolutionary psychology perspective is extremely controversial as it is unable to be scientifically proven in a laboratory setting and is, by definition, very susceptible to hind-sight bias.


====In Early Human Development====
Consider the following- in a population's gene pool, the normal genotype is for an infant that is unattached to its mother- it will crawl away and does not have any &quot;love&quot; or other significant attachment to its mother.  Over time, mutations accumulate and there develops another genotype that causes infants to become uncomfortable and cry when their mothers leave.  Naturally, the crying infant that signals distress will have more protection from the elements and other predatory environmental forces.  Thus, the &quot;attached&quot; infant will have a higher chance of survival.  Over many generations, more &quot;attached&quot; infants will survive to mate and pass on the allele for secure attachment.  Thus, a new behavior has developed by means of natural selection.

This illustrates the basic idea behind evolutionary psychology in human development; that the innate behaviors of very young children are pre-programmed in their genotypes and that we can understand these behaviors by studying the environmental forces that surrounded our ancestors.

==Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development==

See link for more information on Piaget. http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/piaget.htm

==The Nature-Nurture Controversy==

One of the central debates in psychology involves the origin of human behavior.  Is it, as theorized by many, caused by biological factors present in the human body, or is it caused by interactions between the individual and its environment (including other individuals of its species) that finally lead to changes in both behavior and even physical structure?  This debate has often been termed Nature versus Nurture, and is not an easy one to solve.

'''Nature''' 
''Human behavior is the result of already-present biological factors''

Strict adherents of the nature philosophy often use genetic code as support for their theory.  It contains the instructions for millions of protein commands that eventually  determine our basic structure as human beings.  But is it definitive? And can it be changed?

'''Nurture''' 
''Human behavior is the result of interaction with ones environment''

As for Nature adherents, there is also strong evidence that supports followers of the Nurture philosophy.  It is well documented that interaction with ones environment can provoke changes in brain structure and chemistry, and that situations of extreme stress can cause problems like depression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't think pizza should be in with &quot;pie&quot;. I've heard of a &quot;pizza pie&quot; of course, but it's not a proper pie. It's not made out of pastry (more of a bread) and it's not filled with anything (only topped)... &quot;Pizza&quot; is more of a classification in and of itself (or maybe with other topped flatbreads). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:38, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, it's definitely not a pie. I'd really like to keep the page organized into sections. We can have a crust section, with links to various crust recipes, and so on. The choice of sauce is unrelated to the choice of cheese, the choice of topping is unrelated to the choice of crust, etc. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:03, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:: A pie isn't supposed to be filled with anything.  A pie is something that is baked and holds the rest of the dish together.  Pizzas are pies.  It's like a pumpkin pie or a pasty, they're all pies.  I don't see a reason for putting section divisons in a short piece like this, it's an index of sorts to the various pizza recipes to be filled in.  Hell, the Original Pizza recipe there isn't even a proper pizza, it's one of the americanized ones.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 06:40, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Nope, a pie is definitely filled. I won't agree that a pie must be pastry, because it could have a crumb crust, but a yeast bread or soda bread would be wrong. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:31, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::: The section divisions serve to divide the sections. Without section divisions, the crust info runs right into the next section and so on. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:31, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Since pizza is an American food, &quot;americanized&quot; is redundant. Pizza is no less American than Chop Suey and Crab Rangoons. I won't object to listing an Italian proto-pizza on the page though. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:31, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:::: That is very wrong-headed of you, claiming pizza for the United States is like claiming apple pie, apple pie is an English thing.  Just because someone lays a claim to something does not make it valid.  Much like the hotdog isn't American, but is just a frankfurter from Germany renamed.  And a pizza is definately a pie, claiming otherwise is either ignorance or invalid knowledge on the subject.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 08:53, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::The [http://m-w.com/ Merriam-Webster Dictionary] has, as the only two food-related definitions:
:::::#a meat dish baked with biscuit or pastry crust -- compare POTPIE
:::::#a dessert consisting of a filling (as of fruit or custard) in a pastry shell or topped with pastry or both
:::::That would include the cobbler, crisp, bearclaw, and danish. It would '''''not''''' include a pizza.
:::::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:58, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::I won't claim the apple pie. I don't want to claim the hot dog, but sadly I must. I'm quite sure that the vile concoction of beef and synthetic casing is nothing like a traditional German sausage. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:58, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

== Pizza an American Dish? No Way! ==

While pizza, in all it's myriad forms, has become a staple of Italian-American cooking, it is most definitely rooted in classic Italian cooking. Reliable ovens were a rarity in Italy until the second half of the 20th century, especially in small villages. Breads, etc. were prepared at home then taken to the village bakery for cooking. Pizza developed as a way to both utilize left-over dough and create an easy supper dish on baking days.

== Change the photo ==

That photo is just revolting. Surely there's a better, more representative photo of pizza!

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/180.137.37.182|180.137.37.182]] ([[User talk:180.137.37.182|talk]]) to last version by JamesCostlow</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Things to document ==
I think we need to add pages and samples for the following topics so that this book can really become a good starting point for comprehensive Io learning:
* Common file operations (opening, reading lines of text, writing, reading bytes and lengths and seeking through binary files)
* Socket operations (along the lines of file operations, but discuss Io's buffering and making connections or using servers and handlers in more detail)
* Discuss the 'type' slot created on protos whose slot names are capitalized
* Discuss the 'proto' and 'protos' slot and how and when to use appendProto or prependProto.

==Error?==
Enter the Io's interactive interpreter (by typing &lt;code&gt;io&lt;/code&gt; at the console) and type the following:

 write(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;)

With the interactive interpreter, this should look like:

 user@computer:~$ io
 Io&amp;gt; write(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;)
 Hello, world!
 
 ==&amp;gt; &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;

There is no message sent back in my Io version!? My output looks like this:
 Io&amp;gt; write(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;)
 Hello, world!
 
 ==&amp;gt; Nil

Use print, assign the string to a variable, put the code in a file then use io or try return it.

*Not an error. Nil is the return value of the write method. The wikibook may be wrong, or the display is implementation dependant. -- Edwin

But there is an issue if you try to run Io in some implementations of Emacs and other 'shell' programs that offer readline, editline or some type of libedit for cmd history and edits.  Io fails to output to Stdout in those cases, prehaps because it does not consider the re-directed STDOUT to be a handle.  I have raised this issue in my blog at plymouthreliable.com</text>

The letters written above are called (again from the right) ''Haa'', ''Kaff'', ''Miim'', and ''Yaa''.

* Haa (ه) makes the [h] sound like the first sound in &quot;hat&quot;. It is never silent.
* Kaaf (ك) makes the [‎k] sound. This is almost the same as the 'k' in &quot;kill&quot; or the 'c' in &quot;cap&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The only difference is that it is not aspirated. Normal English speakers can't tell the difference and it's unlikely Arabic speakers can either&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mem (م) makes the [m] sound like the first sound in &quot;mom&quot;.
* Yaa (ي) makes the [j] sound. This is ''not'' the normal English 'j' (as in 'jam'). It is like the 'j' in &quot;fjord&quot;. In English this is usually written with the letter 'y'; [j] is the first sound in &quot;you&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;.

The unique thing about ه (haa) is that in most styles of writing all its forms look different. Recall that every Arabic letter has 4 forms (usually only 2 significantly differing forms).

'''''Levicorpus''''' levitates a victim in the air by their feet.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell is one of the spells that Harry Potter learned from the Half-Blood Prince's ''Advanced Potion-Making'' textbook.

Harry first sees his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], use this spell on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] in one of Snape's memories. Harry later attempts this spell on Ron not knowing what it would do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My extended bio can be found at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alexevasion]

Some of my thoughts about the direction of the wikiversity project follow... My name is Alex Goldman.  I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Florida. You can find out more about me at www.clas.ufl.edu/users/agoldman. The idea of open source social science has recently captivated my attention.  presented a poster [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/agoldman/opensourcesocialscience.ppt] at the American Sociological Society this August on the concept and I hope to find as many other people as possible to help develop this project further. I am also in the process of writing a social theory paper based on the idea that the information technologies that have made the Wikimedia  projects possible now provide the impetus for a real transition away from our educational and journalism institutions (and the industries that support them) having a monopoly on the power to produce and distribute &quot;knowledge&quot;. 
I don't want to come off as here as sounding pompous (no worries – it’s really poorly written) or overly judgmental, since this is my first contribution to the wiki project, but I am very skeptical of the way that this idea of wikiversity is currently being characterized (and I guess advanced albeit slowly).  The idea of accreditation to me seems folly as does the overriding focus of reproducing the textbook paradigm (which as anyone in education can tell you one of the ugliest rackets around).  What encouraged me to really get involved in this project was a post I found by a &quot;WoWo&quot; [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Alternative_Theory]] whom I have not yet been able to contact.  I have no expertise in anything but the social sciences, so I will do my best to keep my remarks centered on matters I see as directly related to this supposed body of knowledge. 
The wikibooks project (which is certainly an improvement over Project Gutenberg) is a noble idea that is motivated by a true hope for more widespread public access to information.  I understand that access problems abound. However, I would posit that the larger dimension of the access problem has to do with the way that most &quot;credible knowledge&quot; looks today.  Most of the books that get produced in today’s universities are so highly specialized that  99% is directed at only a small community of like-minded specialists would be interested enough to even try to comprehend it. Most of the really cool cutting edge stuff is published in academic journals anyway.   For a layperson to be able to begin to fully comprehend this kind of material, they would need access to the preceding work which made the &quot;production&quot; of this new &quot;knowledge&quot; possible.  The current system behind academic journals makes access very expensive.  Still, none of this really matters because the information presented within is so densely jargon laden and pedantic (at least in the social sciences) that no one would want to read it anyway.  
To me, the purpose of the wikiversity project (as the wikipedia project) is to provide a structure that rewards people for slogging through this information and helping to digest and excrete a well summarized version of what the document had to say.  This is possible to do.  In fact, this is what graduate students in the social sciences spend most of their time doing.  The problem is that the various summaries do not follow a set format and are not archived in a centralized location.  This should be the most basic role for this social science wiki.  The next step is to begin to integrate this knowledge into a format more centered on debates over current events. The founding purpose of the social sciences was to help the public find ways to improve the quality of their lives.  Many would say that this mandate has never really been fulfilled, but instead distorted and repackaged into mostly impotent academic institutions.  This project must revitalize these concerns by organizing itself around the issues that concern the public most.  
For instance, there is greatly uninformed discussion taking place all over the country (but in my home state of Florida in particular) about the issue of child molestation.  To even begin to understand the nature of this phenomenon, you need to understand what studies in psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, law, history, and other research areas have to contribute to the discussion.  I could spend the next five hundred words engaged in delineating just the broadest disciplinary areas that address the different but interlocking angles on this issue, but I will instead leave it as a worthy thought exercise for the general readership. At current, no information source exists where that people can get a good synthesis of the knowledge that relates to this issue.  The mainstream media will produce a butchered abridged version made with entertainment in mind (though NPR did the best they could in an hour) and academics will produce disparate studies that touch on various angles of the problem that they could procure institutional funding to carry out, but they will likely never be put in a context where they can speak to one another to produce a higher level account of the situation and what needs to be done.  
Open Source Social Science holds the promise of enlisting the general public to take on this job - which is one that neither academics nor journalists were suited for in the first place.  Disciplinary boundaries are not entirely useless (but likely outmoded by ever increasing specialization), but it is a waste of energy to focus on reproducing them here.  Our job is to facilitate the production of small summaries of recent social science documents which will in turn provide the materials cited in a central synthesis which should be marketed toward the literate public.  The challenge is to provide a structure for these &quot;issue pages&quot; that will be able to honor and integrate the many different explanations that the different disciplines (and factions within the disciplines) will provide.  Other than the nasty habit of confronting powerful groups, the key factor which has held the social sciences back since their inception is their ununified accounts (this is always in comparison to the natural sciences) about what is happening in the world.  Infighting is largely unproductive and should be minimized through wiki talk pages and left mostly to academics.  However, I believe that this diversity of thought is indeed an advantage if it can be presented in the correct format.  This project can do this only because of the &quot;liquid information&quot; advantage that the internet - and open source wikis in particular - now provide.  
To get this idea off the ground, I recommend the following strategies:  Find professors who are interested in teaching (they can’t be too research oriented or they would never take on the added burden) and convince them to alter the nature of their class assignments to provide the necessary summarizing student labor force needed to produce primary raw source material on which this project will run.  I believe this can be done in a way that actually improves how much students learn in a course (see my syllabus).  Alternatively, if they are not willing to go that route for one reason or another, there is the other option of producing summaries and extensions of the information that makes up various textbooks in a particular course (there are many competing publishers).  This is not up to date material, but its saving grace is that it supposedly represents an index of the best studies ever produced in a particular field, which of course would be a significant boon to the project (its backbone really).  
Now, to get the general public involved in the process, I think two main strategies are appropriate.  One would be to have them searching just outside of the academic gates of journal subscriptions and college library cards.  This means that they will scour other materials that are available to them: journalism sources, blogs, websites, public records, census data, etc.  The phenomena of a news dump is perhaps the most analogous concept.  Basically, you put out a call for help on finding info on a particular topic and interested people go to work.  The only issue is how to keep them from doing redundant work, but I think that issue is of a more technical and organizational nature – programmers and leaders please stand up.  Another would be to have them actually develop their own research agendas.  This could be as simple as just talking to some neighbors or much more complicated using research methodology that hopefully we could provide them with scaffolding to help them acquire necessary skills through this very project.  At first blush, independent public research would likely produce myriad ethics controversies, but here is not the place to deliberate on this matter.  
Finally, a permanent search committee should be established to find individuals with the skills and knowledge background necessary to produce the synthesis issue pages that will serve as the front door to the world.  They must be able to comprehend and cull an incredible amount of information to produce worthy overarching position pieces.  However, it would seem that as soon as these pages go up, they will recruit more and more people who have more attuned and thus more efficient information gathering skills.  A system to rate the quality of particular contributors from their past submissions could likely be established to improve efficiency further.  This is still but a skeletal idea structure, but I hope it advances the general debate I have seen.  If nothing else, it represents me throwing my hat in the ring.  I’m serious about making these ideas a reality and I hope to find like minded others to collaborate with on this project as soon as possible.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Alexevasion. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Alexevasion~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is a resource for collecting vintage watches on a budget.

There are plenty of resources for collecting expensive watches--There are some brands with more articles on them than watches produced.  On the other hand, information on everyday middle-class watches can be hard to find.  

This book will (eventually) cover most aspects of collecting inexpensive vintage (mostly mechanical) watches, as well as inexpensive methods to get them running again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If the shell prompt is on a remote server, '''ssh''' is the most common way to access it. The server must be running the '''sshd''' server software to accept your connection. The SSH protocol encrypts your connecting to prevent spying and stealing of passwords. All that is required is that you trust the computer that you connect from and the server where your account is located.

To connect, open your SSH client, specify the name of the server and your username. Most servers use the default port 22, so specifying the port is not necessary. (Be careful with ports 1024 and higher because these are controlled by users, not the system administrator.)

====Using SSH from a Shell Prompt====
To connect to one Unix-like system from another, you can the '''ssh''' shell command. This command is often [[w:OpenSSH|OpenSSH]], a popular SSH implementation from OpenBSD. For example, Tux wants to connect to an account (username '''tux''') on the computer &quot;linux.example.edu&quot;:
 $ '''ssh tux@linux.example.edu'''
 tux@linux.example.edu's password:

If Tux has the same username on the local computer, then specifying the username is optional:
 $ '''whoami'''
 tux
 $ '''ssh linux.example.edu'''
 tux@linux.example.edu's password:

====Accepting the Key Fingerprint====
The first time you connected, you saw a message similar to the following:
 The authenticity of host 'linux.example.edu (1.2.3.4)' can't be established.
 RSA key fingerprint is a4:3d:fe:10:7e:45:2b:29:d0:fe:ed:ba:a3:21:66:a1.
 Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

If you are reasonably sure that you connected to the correct computer (an attacker on the Internet might steal your connection to learn passwords) then you can answer 'yes' and add linux.example.edu to the list of known hosts. Some SSH clients also allow you to say 'yes' to one session only.

When you say 'yes', you get a message such as: &lt;tt&gt;Warning: Permanently added 'linux.example.edu,1.2.3.4' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.&lt;/tt&gt;

This means that your SSH client &quot;knows&quot; linux.example.edu. It will verify that future connections to &quot;linux.example.edu&quot; reach the same computer (or cluster). You will be alerted if an attacker steals your connection, but also if linux.example.edu changes its key. Thus, if you know that linux.example.edu changed its key and you recognize the key, then you can ignore the alert.


== graphical connections ==

Most tasks on a Unix machine can be done in text mode, from the shell prompt.

However, once the text-mode ssh connection is working, many people feel more comfortable switching to a graphical interface.

A typical setup has a VNC viewer on the local end and a X11/VNC server on the remote end, and a ssh tunnel.
(Any VNC viewer -- including ssvnc, sshvnc, or a Java-enabled web browser -- will work with any VNC server).
The ssh software grabs all information that would normally flow through the VNC ports (ports 5900 through 5906 and ports 5800 through 5806) and funnels them through the ssh tunnel (by default, port 22).

[[Image:Chufa.jpg|thumb|120px|A tigernut, or ''Chufa''.]]

'''Tigernuts''' are not [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]], but edible tubers with a slightly sweet, nutty flavour compared to the more bitter tasting tuber of the &quot;purple nutsedge&quot;. They are quite hard and are generally soaked in water before they can be eaten. They have various uses, in particular they are used in Spain to make [[Cookbook:Horchata|horchata]]. They are sometimes known by their Spanish name, '''''chufa'''''. Other common names for these tubers are &quot;earthalmond&quot; and &quot;yellow nutsedge&quot;.

The tubers were originally cultivated by the ancient Egyptians. Commercial production in Europe is almost exclusively in the Valencia region of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]]. West African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria are major producers for the domestic market.


Tiger nuts have excellent nutritional qualities with a fat composition similar to [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] and a rich mineral content, especially phosphorus and potassium. Tiger nuts are also [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] and cholesterol free, and have a very low [[Cookbook:Salt|sodium]] content. 

According to the ''Consejo Regulador de Chufa de Valencia'' (Regulating Council for Valencia's Tigernuts)[http://www.chufadevalencia.org/], the nutritional composition/100 ml of a classical [[Cookbook:Tigernut|Horchata de Chufas]], or ''Orxata de Xufes'' in Valencian language, is as follows: energy content around 66 kcal, [[Cookbook:Protein|proteins]] around 0.5 g, [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] over 10 g with starch at least 1.9 g, [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]s at least 2 g.

Identifying a vintage watch can be frustrating.  Only a few have any easy means of identifying when a particular watch was made. Timex mechanicals and electromechanicals after 1962 have a model number on the dial, the last two numbers correspond to the year made.  Bulova brands after 1948 have a 2 character code-The first digit is the decade, the second is the year.  Waltham and Elgin have serial number databases on-line covering early watches.  For some watches the only clues are the movement and the overall style--Even the brand name may not explain anything.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most (possibly all) mechanical Timex watches from 1963 until the end of mechanical production in 1993 have a reference number, usually at the bottom of the dial. The last two numbers correspond to the year the watch was produced. The two (occasionally 3) numbers before that are the movement number, the remaining numbers are the catalog number. For example, 2495210592 would indicate catalog number 24952, movement 105, year 1992. In some cases this number is hidden under the bezel and cannot be viewed without removing the movement from the case. 

Some earlier Timexes have an ink-stamped date code on the inside caseback consisting of one letter and one number. The numeral denotes the year of manufacture as follows: 1959-8, 1960-7, 1961-6, 1962-5 1963-4 1964-3 1965-2 1966-1 1967-9.

Watches from 1985 and later generally have a 2 digit code on the caseback indicating year and month of manufacture:

I don't say that out of ego (OK a little bit) but more out of responsibility: &quot;I own this mess.&quot; 

And because sometimes folks like to know who wrote what and what their background is and why they think they could do something like write something like this.

Who am I? I live in the Midwest (Minnesota at this writing.) where I've had a career in Technical Education and Computer Systems for almost 20 years. Most of the later has been with a mix of graphic arts systems and high end networking.

I've liked working with my hands much longer.

I come by that honestly I think. I've got family on both sides going back a way who seem to do pretty good with their hands. My paternal Grandfather was always doing some crafty thing and had some kind of gaget or another catching his fancy. The other Grandfather actually was a blacksmith although I regret he never taught me the craft: we were busy doing other work. He did teach me how to work and gave me an appreciation for work.

== Moving Resonators ==

&lt;p&gt;
Consider the situation shown in the figure below.  We have a typical Helmholtz resonator driven by a massless piston which generates a sinusoidal pressure &lt;math&gt;P_G&lt;/math&gt;, however the cavity is not fixed in this case.  Rather, it is supported above the ground by a spring with compliance &lt;math&gt;C_M&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume the cavity has a mass &lt;math&gt;M_M&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recall the Helmholtz resonator ([[Engineering Acoustics/Electro-acoustic analogies#Examples of Electro-Acoustical Analogies|see Module #9]]).  The difference in this case is that the pressure in the cavity exerts a force on the bottom of the cavity, which is now not fixed as in the original Helmholtz resonator.  This pressure causes a force that acts upon the cavity bottom.  If the surface area of the cavity bottom is &lt;math&gt;S_C&lt;/math&gt;, then Newton's Laws applied to the cavity bottom give

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sum{F} = p_CS_C - \frac{x}{C_M} = M_M\ddot{x} \Rightarrow p_CS_C = \left[\frac{1}{j\omega C_M} + j\omega M_M\right]u&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to develop the equivalent circuit, we observe that we simply need to use the pressure (potential across &lt;math&gt;C_A&lt;/math&gt;) in the cavity to generate a force in the mechanical circuit.  The above equation shows that the mass of the cavity and the spring compliance should be placed in series in the mechanical circuit.  In order to convert the pressure to a force, the transformer is used with a ratio of &lt;math&gt;1:S_C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
A practical example of a moving resonator is a marimba.  A marimba is a similar to a xylophone but has larger resonators that produce deeper and richer tones.  The resonators (seen in the picture as long, hollow pipes) are mounted under an array of wooden bars which are struck to create tones.  Since these resonators are not fixed, but are connected to the ground through a stiffness (the stand), it can be modeled as a moving resonator.  Marimbas are not tunable instruments like flutes or even pianos.  It would be interesting to see how the tone of the marimba changes as a result of changing the stiffness of the mount.   

For more information about the acoustics of marimbas see http://www.mostlymarimba.com/techno1.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">The American Waltham Company was the first mass-produced watch, using interchangeable parts.  

In 1954, Waltham established a Swiss subsidiary, [http://waltham.ch/index.asp Waltham International SA].  Because of peculiarities of Swiss law at the time, they could not establish a wholly-owned subsidiary, and when American Waltham went bankrupt in 1957, the Swiss company remained independent.  As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, rights to the Waltham name in the US and Canada were sold as part of the assets, while the rights to the name in the rest of the world remained with Waltham International SA.  

Walthams sold in the US are inexpensive quartz watches, part of the MZ Berger company along with Elgin and Gruen

Walthams sold in the rest of the world (primarily Japan) are high-end, mostly mechanical, and marketed by Waltham International SA.  While Waltham International is a Swiss company, it is owned by a Japanese businessman.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology to the legal process.'' - American Board Of Forensic
Anthropology (revised 9/15/05)

Forensic anthropologists help to identify badly decayed or skeletal human remains by determining age, ancestry, sex, stature, and in rare cases occupation. They are often called upon to assist the police department, the county coroner's office, medical examiner's office, homicide detectives from the local police department, or field archaeologists investigating a burial site.

==Terminology==
''Anatomical position'' - Standing erect with the palms facing forward

''Anterior'' - The front of the body or situated near the front of the body

''Coronal plane'' - Vertical plane running through the body that divides it into more or less equal front and back halves

''Distal'' - Away from the point of attachment to the trunk or the centre of the body. Used especially to denote parts of limbs.

''Inferior (caudal)'' - Toward the soles of the feet

''Palmar'' - Direction the palms are facing, however they may be oriented (forward in anatomical position)

''Plantar'' - Direction the soles of the feet are facing, however they may be oriented (inferior in anatomical position)

''Proximal'' - Nearer the centre of the body or away from the point of attachment to the trunk. Used especially to denote parts of limbs.

''Posterior'' - The back of the body or situated near the back of the body

''Sagittal plane'' - Vertical plane running through the body that divides it into more or less equal right and left halves

''Superior (cranial)'' - Toward the crown of the head

''Transverse plane'' - Horizontal plane (at right angles to the sagittal and coronal) that divides the body into more or less equal upper and lower halves

===Features Of A Bone===
''Condyle'' - A knuckle-like prominence at the end of a bone, usually where it connects to another bone

''Diaphysis'' - The shaft or central section of a long bone.

''Epiphysis'' - Growing end of a long bone. it is separated by a cartilage from the shaft of the bone.

''Foramen'' - A hole in the bone that allows for the passage of veins and/or nerves into and out of the bone

''Fossa'' -  A more or less circular depression in the bone

''Sinus'' - An air space in the bone

==Methods used==
===Examination of Skeletal Remains===
''Human bones'' - The bones should be sorted out into Human and Non Human bones. 

''Determination of Age'' - The appearance and union of centres of bone growth and changes in bones and teeth helps the investigator in determining the age of the individual at the time of death.

''Determination of Sex'' - The adult skeleton has several morphological differences between the sexes which are used to determine the sex of the individual. 

''Determination of Race'' - Although race is not biological, bones have morphological characteristics which are confined to individuals of a particular race. There are a variety of factors that account for this including cultural practices, but also differences between populations. IE, a 20 year old Caucasian from 1786 will have different morphological characteristics from a 20 year old Caucasian from 2014. Determinations of race are only accurate 80% of the time. 

''Height'' - The height of the individual can be calculated with reasonable accuracy by applying formulae to the length of individual bones, especially the long bones of limbs.

''Duration of interment'' -

== Success Tips ==

Designing a blended learning environment can be a complicated and involved process. Several experienced authors have offered tips for success in such an endeavor. One such author, who appears at every attempt to search the web for blended learning information, is Frank J. Troha. This section of the chapter on the Design on Blended Learning in a K-12 environment attempts to outline his six tips for success, and comment on their relevance to a K-12 learning environment. 

In his article entitled “Ensuring E-learning Success: Six Simple Tips for Initiative Leaders”, Troha offers the following six tips for success:


# ''From design, to development to deployment, consider everyone your learning initiative will impact, identify the key players within each constituency and involve them from the very start.''
# ''Precisely define - and get agreement on - roles and responsibilities from the get-go.''
# ''Do not bring in e-learning providers until you have a thorough understanding of your target audience’s needs, management’s expectations, the scope of the initiative, likely constraints (e.g., limited resources), learning objectives, content to be covered, evaluation strategy and a host of other basic design matters.''
# ''Carefully select the right provider for the job.''
#* ''Develop and confirm precise, comprehensive selection criteria (e.g., past experience addressing similar topics for similar organizations, fee structure, service standards, references, etc.) before meeting with any prospective providers.''
#* ''Use the preliminary design document and selection criteria to interview prospective providers.&lt;br /&gt;
#* ''If you are new to e-learning or blended learning, start small.''
# ''From start to finish, keep all key individuals informed and appropriately involved.''
# ''Strive for self-sufficiency and control.''


Let us examine each tip and discuss the implications for K-12 educators. 

'''1. From design, to development to deployment, consider everyone your learning initiative will impact, identify the key players within each constituency and involve them from the very start.'''
The focus is on the involvement of and input from the key players in an organization. In an educational setting, this may include but is not limited to teachers, administrators, content chairs, parents, and other staff members. This success tip may be the most important in that without the support of the people directly impacted, the success or failure of the program may be severely negatively affected. In an educational environment, specifically K-12, it is crucial that you have the support of all key players. Without the involvement and participation of everyone affected, the program is sure to encounter difficulties that could be prevented with this consideration in mind.

'''2. Precisely define - and get agreement on - roles and responsibilities from the get-go.'''
Without clearly defined roles and responsibilities, the key players within an organization may not fulfill their obligations to the program. For example, if it is the primary responsibility of the school district curriculum designer to outline the curricular content of the blended learning initiative, the resulting content may not fit the exact needs of the teachers who are asked to implement the blended learning model. Conversely, if teachers are involved in a serious way in the development of the blended learning course, they personally will feel ownership of the program and will subsequently become the promoters and even defenders of the program.

'''3. Do not bring in e-learning providers until you have a thorough understanding of your target audience’s needs, management’s expectations, the scope of the initiative, likely constraints (e.g., limited resources), learning objectives, content to be covered, evaluation strategy and a host of other basic design matters.'''
In an educational setting, often an outside provider is not used, but the success tip is no less valid. The point is still that before a blended learning model is constructed and implemented, it is crucial that an understanding of all aspects of the program is established and communicated to all key players. As in most aspects of education at the K-12 level, communication is key to the success of any endeavor. The collaboration of different players is what makes the program being developed more successful, more useful, and ultimately may dictate whether the course is adopted on a permanent level.

'''4. Carefully select the right provider for the job.'''
This tip is more relevant to a business audience where hiring outside vendors is more common. A school district is more apt to choose an internal employee to both help with the design of a blended learning model, as well as serve as a pilot to test the effectiveness of the resulting program. However, the point is still an important one, but can be rephrased in an educational setting to “Carefully select the right instructor for the job.” It is important to choose someone who has an interest in utilizing the inherent benefits of a blended learning course, as well as someone who has the technical expertise to effectively help in the design and implementation of such a course. In schools where there is a dedicated Technology professional, this person may be the obvious choice for playing a key role in both the design and implementation of the blended learning course. This should not be a limitation, however, for there are many able people within each curricular department of a school who would make able and competent contributors to the design and implementation of a blended learning program.

'''5. From start to finish, keep all key individuals informed and appropriately involved.'''
Not only is it important for the key players to feel like they are a part of the process in order to gain support from them, it also reduces the amount of time that is needed to answer questions and provide training for said individuals. As was mentioned earlier, a sense of ownership by key players needs to be developed and nourished throughout the process in order to facilitate the positive development and future success of the blended learning model.

'''6. Strive for self-sufficiency and control.'''
This tip is probably the most applicable to educators, as they are likely to embark on such an endeavor without any outside help from professional providers. Teachers have the advantage of experience in curriculum design and in the implementation of a course based on their specific curriculum. They also have an idea of what the end result should look like, and the experience needed to successfully design the blended learning curriculum for the specific needs of their students. Teachers have been educated about different learning styles. This knowledge can help the blended learning curriculum to best fit the needs of a diverse audience of students. They know from experience what is fair and reasonable to expect from their students. Teachers also know about their students’ socioeconomic backgrounds, which may play a key role in the design of the instructional blended learning model. For example, in some communities technology limitations may have an effect on choices of content delivery. 

These tips for success are a good reference when designing a blended learning course. Of course, they should not be relied upon in isolation. The best advice for a school instituting blended learning is simple: look for successfully examples. A growing number of schools and other institutions have realized the benefits blended learning adds to instruction. Time needn't be wasted trying to “reinvent the wheel,” when so many excellent programs already exist as models for others to follow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To understand the FORTH language we can start by examining what FORTH does when you type a command line to it. Here is a formal definition of the cycle of &quot;interpretation&quot; (&quot;do this now&quot;) or &quot;compilation (&quot;do this later&quot;). While it may be difficult to see the forest for the trees, let's briefly describe the whole process, and then go back through it and explain the significance in greater detail.

FORTH has simplified the process of human-to-machine commands by making it very uniform. To give your instructions to a FORTH system, a series of words is typed to the computer. FORTH then &quot;reads&quot; these words from first to last. To tell where one word ends and another begins, a simple rule is used: the words are separated by one or more ASCII blank characters (code 32). Each word is processed in order typed (or read in from a source file).

As each incoming word is broken out of the input stream, FORTH will determine whether it already has a definition for it in its &quot;dictionary&quot;. FORTH refers to its symbol table, arranged as part of a &quot;dictionary&quot; structure. A match to the name of the word is searched for in the name field of each dictionary entry (starting with the most recently defined word and ending with the oldest word in the dictionary). If the word is not found in the dictionary, FORTH considers whether the input word could be interpreted as a number in the present base. If not, the input is incomprehensible to FORTH, and it rejects it with a message indicating no such word can be found in the dictionary.

If a definition was found or the input is a recognizable number, FORTH considers whether it is supposed to do this command now or later. If the answer is &quot;now&quot; (&quot;interpretation&quot;), it executes the definition of the word associated with its dictionary entry, or pushes the number atop FORTH's central switchyard for data, the stack. If the answer is &quot;later&quot; (&quot;compilation&quot;) it usually means that we are in the process of adding a new word to the dictionary to become the most recently defined word.

Accordingly, we place a reference to the input word or number as the next entry in the definition of the word being defined. It will execute in its turn later, but only when someone requests the execution of the new word we are in the process of defining.

Then we repeat the above process to parse the next word in the input stream. This continues until there isn't any more input.

What are the implications of the above process? How does it compare with other approaches?
(Note: the terms &quot;word&quot; and &quot;subroutine&quot; are used interchangeably in the following section to emphasize the parallel.)

* Accessibility:
Any word in the dictionary can be called from the command line. So every word in a dictionary and the applications it contains can be individually tested without further ado. Just call the word in question from the command line. Find a bug? Unlike traditional toolchains, you are not required to recompile the application to include custom debug oriented calls to internal subroutines to get visibility. Just call the failing word from the command line. Fails? Look at its definition. Type each of these words in order to the command line. Does any one of these fail. Repeat. The problem can be isolated without a need to take special measures to make internal subroutines callable.

* Vocabularies.
This does not mean that every internal word needs to be available to the customer at all times, including dangerous ones that e.g. erase their files. Groups of words can be organized in vocabulary lists, and particular vocabulary lists made available to particular command lines.

* Natural discouragement of circular definitions and thinking: Words must be added to the dictionary in a sensible natural order. When building the definition of a word, if one calls for the use of a word that is not yet in the dictionary, one gets a &quot;WORD NOT IN DICTIONARY&quot; error. So one must organize a series of words starting with the foundation words that rely only on themselves, followed by a layer of words that rely on them, followed by the words that rely on them. This helps structure the dictionary in a logical manner.

* Simplifying and combining the compile and load parts of the toolchain:
Traditional toolchains have distinct compile and load phases. Compilers place object code modules into libraries that are later loaded and linked, either in a static or dynamic manner. Only then are missing subroutine reports generated. FORTH simplifies and combines these steps. It is as if each library module is loaded and given a fixed address in memory. Once its address is established, the modules that call it can be loaded (later words in dictionary). These calling words then can point directly to the memory address of the entry of the word they wish to call, compared with a traditional linkers external reference process.

* The distinction between source and object code evaporates. 
It turns out this was unnecessary baggage of the other computer languages and may not be a useful concept after all. In this language, we see a small overhead to define a new word, (store its name, attach it to the rest of the dictionary, and other wrapper overhead). Compiling the &quot;source code&quot; definition of the word into the &quot;object code&quot; definition amazingly is no more than taking the name of each word in ASCII found in the source text and placing the corresponding memory address of its entry point into the executable &quot;object code&quot;. This process is easily reversible.
Compilation turns out to be removing the human readable comments found in the source code (machine doesn't need them in object code, it can't read them) and converting the human readable name of each word called into the corresponding numerical machine address that the hardware uses.
The &quot;compiler&quot; as a mystified mountain of megabytes of exception case riddled code fighting your brain is no longer. Just a few well defined lookups. What was all that other compiler scholasticism actually useful for?

* COMPILATION, in this system, means adding (a new word) to the top of the dictionary. To do this, each called wordname is translated from the ASCII name found in the source text to the corresponding memory addresses of its entry point. This number is added to the end of the &quot;object code&quot; definition of the word.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Calculus Class == 

Hello,

I've taken up teaching the Calculus class, it's not incredibly serious, if you want to help, that would be nice, and I would tell you in what ways you could, I'm not credited, in fact, I'm a math undergrad at ISU; and, as of right now, there are no students.  But I saw your name in the discussion board, so I thought I'd give you a ring.

== Wikibooks Embassy and technical help ==

Thanks for helping with new embassy. I moved it to [[Wikibooks:English Embassy]] and linked it from [[MetaWikipedia:Wikimedia Embassy]].

You asked me ([[User talk:Kernigh#Wikibooks Embassy and technical help]]) if you would find potential ambassadors by posting in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] or on their user talk pages. Maybe you should try both. However, before posting on a User talk page, check their &quot;User contributions&quot; to make sure that the user is active &amp;ndash; so that you avoid messaging someone who has not edited English Wikibooks since March 2006 (or January 2006, or 2004 ...).

About [[Russian]]: I noticed that the Wikibook already has a template, [[Template:Russian]]. To put that template on a page, one writes &lt;code&gt;{{tl|Russian}}&lt;/code&gt;. If you need more templates, just create some &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Templtae:XXX]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; page and write &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{XXX}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

If you want to change [[Template:Russian]] into a box, you need to use a CSS &quot;style&quot; attribute with an HTML tag or MediaWiki table. For example &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&lt;/nowiki&gt; style=&quot;border: 1px dashed orange; padding: 0 0.5em; background-color: #ccffff;&quot;&gt;insert ''text'' here&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, makes:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px dashed orange; padding: 0 0.5em; background-color: #ccffff;&quot;&gt;insert ''text'' here&lt;/div&gt;

The easy way is to copy and adapt someone's box, like [[Template:Guide to X11]], [[Template:NetHack]], [[Template:Java Programming]]. There is also a way to make a &quot;Show/Hide&quot; button, though I do not understand it well. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:37, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

== Russian language ==

Hello, Paul. I am [[:ru:Участник:Ramir|Ramir]], ''de facto'' the manager of [[:ru:]]. Among my long-term plans is to write a Russian language textbook for those who know the core of the Russian grammar and understand it well, but have difficulty expressing their thoughts precisely and choosing the right words. The more advanced part of the book will be targeted at native-level speakers of Russian who still need to be taught how to use their vocabulary more meticulously. So the textbook will combine an “Advanced Russian” grammar and a thorough “Style Guide” (that will both give rigid instructions and explain the reasoning behind them). You can help the process by giving me, or whomever else interested, the most general and/or common problems faced by students of Russian. You can do that on the page [[:ru:Обсуждение:Русский язык]] (here is a [http://ru.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5:%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA&amp;action=edit direct editing link]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about an embassy. Tell me exactly what you need it for. The Russian Wikibooks has a good, yet very small community of authors, and, at least in the beginning, I will be the only regular participant. But perhaps our activity will attract other people and we’ll be able to make a regular Russian-English language school on Wikibooks. [[User:Ramir|Ramir]] 04:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

: ''(having read your reply)'' I am ready to support your idea. Again I say: now there are very few (less than 10 regular) contributors to the Russian partition of Wikibooks, and even they are not the kind that would form a tight and permanent community. I am only prepared to advise about Russian language, communicate news and proposals to the community (also to ru.Wikipedians), and translate to and from English. There is no point in doing anything beyond our immediate interest until more people join:  you and me alone can not do much. In the following week I will talk to people on other active Wikibooks about setting up &quot;embassies&quot; there, or (I like this idea more) making a common forum for all Wikibooks projects for discussing matters of interlingual significance. And regarding your study of Russian, please be welcome to ask questions: as I have said, they will be helpful later, in writing a Russian language Wikibook. [[User:Ramir|Ramir]] 10:04, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

: On verbs and prefixes: the general rule to remember is that in Russian (like in all Synthetic languages, for that matter) a prefix, or generally an affix, can have different meanings. The first and easy step to remember those meanings is to associate each Russian prefix with an English preposition or a Latin prefix. For instance, ''передавать'' literally means “to give over” — that is, “to transmit” (note the prefix ''trans-'') or “to pass on”. Although there is no strict corresponcence between ''пере'' and ''over'' or ''trans-'', you ''can'' always be sure that if a verb is prefixed with ''пере'', it has something to do with ''over-'' someting, and '''just like in English''', this “over” can take different meanings; compare: пережа́рить (to ''over''roast), переде́лать (to do ''over'', to ''re''do), перейти́/переходи́ть (to have gone.../to go ''over'', traverse). Of course, there are some ''пере-''words that do not translate with ''over'', but still imply it somehow: перевари́вать [пи́щу] means “to digest [food]”, but if you think of the word “digest” itself, it kinda implies a transformation, a passing of a critical point of being raw to being processed and worked through. The literal morpheme-by-morpheme translation of переваривать is “to cook/boil over”. [[User:Ramir|Ramir]] 00:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)


== social sciences bookshelves ==

I have been watching the [[Wikibooks:Economics bookshelf]], and very little has been added to any of the books on this bookshelf. There is such little content, I would suggest many of the modules be deleted, and the rest be moved to the [[Wikibooks:Social sciences bookshelf]]. It seems like the same story with the [[Wikibooks:Business bookshelf]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Wikibooks:Law bookshelf]]. Here are some of the modules I think should be deleted.

*[[Technical Analysis|Stock Market Technical Analysis]] &lt;b&gt;delete&lt;/b&gt;- only one page, untouched since September 2005
*[[Economics:Resource_Economics:Bioeconomics|Bioeconomics]] &lt;b&gt;delete&lt;/b&gt;- only one page, no real content added since October 2005
*[[EcologicalEconomics|Ecological Economics]] &lt;b&gt;delete&lt;/b&gt;- no real content.
*[[EconometricTheory]] &lt;b&gt;unsure&lt;/b&gt;- there is some good content here, althoguh it hasn't been touched since August 2005.
*[[A-level_Economics/OCR]]- some content, but has been untouched since November 2005, and not really in wiki format. I suggest this module deleted or moved elsewhere unless someone decides to do something with it soon.
*[[Asset Allocation]] -there is some content, added in January of 2006, but it seems like it may be original research. I suggest contacting the author, [[User:Paul.Paquette]].
*[[New Zealand Economics]] &lt;b&gt;delete&lt;/b&gt;- raw dump of essay material, untouched since September 2005

I also suggest that the wikibooks [[Macroeconomics]], [[Principles of Economics]], [[Introduction to Economics]] and [[Microeconomics]] be merged, as all the content seems to be of basic economics principles. Most universities have courses on Principles of Microeconomics, Principles of Macroeconomics, then upper division courses Microeconomic Theory and Macroeconomic Theory, although the first two and last two courses often use the same textbook. 

[[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 22:59, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

:Alot of those books that you have listed do contain enough useful material that I suffest they be merged instead of deleted outright. I would suggest that perhaps we create 3 books total: &quot;Macroeconomics&quot;, &quot;Microeconomics&quot;, and &quot;Advanced Economics&quot;. The advanced book would by necessity contain the information that is important to real-life and research (the stock market, bioeconomics, ecological economics, etc). Also, perhaps we should include a book on economic history, which could include all sorts of information about Smith, Keynes, and Marx. 
:If you contest that macroeconomics and microeconomics are related enough by basic principals that they should be merged together, then perhaps we could reduce our entire bookshelf to &quot;Economics&quot; (a combination of micro and macro), &quot;Advanced economics&quot; (topics above the basic level), and &quot;historical economics&quot; (to cover historical issues). If you would like, I am willing to help out in this project, although i confess that I know very little about economics. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:37, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

:I looked at that New Zealand book, and while i think that it should be deleted in general, it does have some good discussion of the subjects involved. you probably know the subject better then i do, so if you say it's trash, then i will delete it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:53, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

:: Wait a day before doing things unilaterally! Any of the sub-disciplines listed on [[w:Economics#Areas of study in economics]] should be acceptable as book topics. Someone will eventually take over and work on them. If I recall correctly, [[Resource Economics]] had its chapters already fleshed out, and as such should have been kept as one book. [[Ecological Economics]] should be kept as its own book (if it had anything more than a one paragraph introduction). [[A-level Economics]] is a book for a specific course and should be left alone. I suppose [[New Zealand Economics]] can be deleted on the grounds of orginal research and NPOV (although I think {{tl|cleanup}} tagging it is better), but not on the subject matter. 

:: I think we should merge [[Wikibooks:Business bookshelf|business]] and [[Wikibooks:Economics bookshelf|economics]] into a [[Wikibooks:Business and economics bookshelf]]. [[Wikibooks:Law bookshelf|The law bookshelf]] has enough content for its own bookshelf. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 13:38, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

== wikistudy and wikiprofessional ==

Jguk, why can't there just be a bookshelf for both of these? it seems kind of excessive to give them their own page, and put them on the sidebar. Is there a discussion about this somewhere? [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 21:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:Thank you for your interest in what I am doing. This was an example of being bold, rather than discussing first - although I have mooted the idea around without actually proposing it a number of times. I feel that these areas are part of the core areas Wikibooks should be addressing, along with Wikijunior and Wikiversity, which already have special &quot;sidebar&quot; status. Of course, Wikibooks should have textbooks that don't fit within any of those four descriptions too, and these can all be found through the bookshelves. I think the Wikistudy area - essentially a place for textbooks addressed at specific syllabuses on core school subjects - is a particularly important one. It is here that we have the most (as yet untapped) outside interest. I hope to assist in getting that interest turned into useful school textbooks both here at Wikibooks and through my work with Wikimedia UK. It is also the Wikistudy area that could make a real difference, especially given the high cost of purchasing copyrighted texts. I hope the future of Wikibooks has the Wikistudy concept as an excellent core which then spans out to cover textbooks on other areas, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:35, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== Ancient History ==

Hi, Paul.
I'm a middle school teacher who teaches ancient and medieval history, and some English literature.  I know a lot about the subject, but a lot of what I know is not very in-depth.  It seems to me that my major contribution here could be to make a basic text available to edit.  In some ways, it's sad that everything I write here may eventually get covered over by the work of others... but maybe I can help get it started, anyway.

I'd also like to ask about whether or not it's acceptable to get my own students involved in contributing to the project.  They have to write all sorts of things for me about the major topics; it would be nice to require their work not only typed, but dedicated to the service of Wikibooks.  I'd have to work out some policies and procedures here at school so they could get credit for contributing, and maybe you could help me work those issues out between now and September.  Ideally, I'd like them to contribute a well-written paragraph or two on specific cultures as we study them, but we'd have to drill them thoroughly on copyright and plagiarism. What do you think?

== Merge [[Macroeconomics]] and [[Microeconomics]]? ==

Why merge these two books? It's better to have several developing books on subfields of science rather than one well-done [[Science]] book. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:36, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]]==

This policy needs a few more people to take a look at it and vote. Any help would be most useful. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:29, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== Wikicode. ==

Instead of using html tags for bold &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;TEXT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; you should just use wikicode. For '''bold''' text use three apostrophes (&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;). For ''italics'', use two (&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Hope this helps. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 03:21, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical classification]] size ==

After changing two letters to {{tl|bi}}, the size of the page has increased from 30KB to 40KB. Converting the entire page to {{tl|bi}} is therefore not an option. With infoboxes, we would be able to change the page to an automatically updating [[:Category:Books alphabetically|category]], and create an extended list page for broadband users. Do you think we should go this route, or do something else? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

Can you make all books that have an infobox appear in the category automatically, or would we have to add the category to each book's title page separately? Either way, it sounds like a good idea. I mainly wanted to change the books in the alphabetical list just to make sure every book is in a bookshelf, so everything will be a bit more organized. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 04:23, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

On a side note, I'd really like to make sure all the books are in some bookshelf, then get rid of really old stubs/merge them with current books. Then, if the bookshelves are sorted out, we could add links for needed textbooks (your idea), and really see what we have/what we need. I just really don't think we have over 1000 books, and would like to know how many we really have. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 04:33, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, a book is automatically added to the category if an infobox is on the title page of the book. At the present I'm looking through [[Special:Allpages]]. I only have A-D left, after which I'll look through [[Special:Lonelypages]] and [[:Category:Not linked Wikibooks]]. Then I help you out on organizing and merging books. BTW, I'm done adding parameters to {{tl|Infobox/Parameters}}, so unless you have ideas for any others, we can continue adding infoboxes to books. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

==asset allocation==
You can erase it if you want, even thought it required a lot of work, it is simply ever changing and not many people seem to be interested in helping me with it. [[User:Paul.Paquette|Paul.Paquette]]

== [[Basic Economics]] ==

''Endless melee, I would suggest the book be titled Principles of Economics, if the audience is going to be undergraduate college students. Most basic level college courses are titled Principles of Microeconomics or Macroeconomics.? Of course, if this book is geared towards highschool or a &quot;not for majors&quot; college course, the name Basic Economics is fine. What do you think? DettoAltrimenti 20:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)''
::^--DettoAltrimenti (Mr. Lynch), I think you're definitely right about the generality of undergraduate econ textbook titles. However, this text is in fact designed to be more broadly applicable than to just economics majors and enthusiasts. The economics wikibooks as they currently stand are, in my opinion, haphazard and lack any sort of uniform direction. I, therefore, decided to start from the bottom up. This text is supposed to be for students with no background in economics as well as for those purely curious about the subject. It is my hope that it will be general and basic enough to adhere to the needs of many different types of students, and not limited to economics majors. So then the title 'Basic Economics' seems apt. However, I do think it would be best for a more in depth economics text, possibly adopting the 'Principles of...' prefix, to be constructed. The current [[Principles of Economics]] is incomplete and could definitely benefit from renovation. But that's not my current goal. For now I want to complete [[Basic Economics]]. Thanks for your feedback though! I'm glad somebody cared enough to notice. --[[User:Endless melee|Endless melee]] 15:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
:::Hello again. In hindsight, following some grueling macroeconomics homework, I realized that perhaps it is better to have an 'principles; econ text rather than a 'basic' econ text for a few reasons:
:::*A - There are already two texts ([[Principles of Economics]] and [[Introduction to Economics]]) that need to be merged and reorganized anyway
:::*B - Economics is, arguably, applied mathematics. So it would be a great injustice to disillusion students with an approach to economics that is too soft on math.
:::With that in mind I think it's important to retain the 'principles' prefix as you recommended. This way I can get rid of the two &quot;half&quot;-finished texts as well as open up the ability to dive a little deeper into economic theory in this text. Thanks for your feedback! You've helped me re-think this project into a more concise and (hopefully) more useful one.  --[[User:Endless melee|Endless melee]] 21:47, 26 July 2006 (UTC)


== help requested ==
I have recently finished to write a book on [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]] in Russian wikibook [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]]. I want to find somebody to translate it to English. Can you help me with this?
P.S. I am interesting to write some books on math and computer science. On math I am currently working on [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]] and on computer science on [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] and [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (all this is on currently on hold). In my English texts I have a lot of grammar mistakes, so I need somebody to correct one. I want that all that I am writing will be on English. It can be translating of written on another language text or original text. 

P.P.S. I have some material on math in Hebrew. Also hebrew wikibook has some material. It can be nice, while not mandatory, if you will know Hebrew too.

Я недавно закончил писать книгу в русском викиучебнике  [[m:b:ru:Философия науки|Философия науки]] . Я хотел бы найти кого-то ктобы перевёл бы его на английский [[m:b:en:Philosophy of Science]]. Не могли бы вы мне в этом помочь? 
P.S. Я хочу написать пару книг по математике и компьютерным наукам (программированию). По математике я начал работать над [[m:b:ru:Знакомство с методом математической индукции]], а по компьютерным наукам над  [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/Object oriented|Object oriented]], [[m:b:en:Computer programming/Procedural programming]] и [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/Computer programming/How Objects should be correctly compared in Java]] (пока я оставил это). Я пишу на английском со многими грамматическими ошибками, мне нужен кто-то, чтобы их исправлять. Я хочу, чтобы все мои книги были на английском. Это может быть как перевода с другого языка, так и оригинальный, изначально написанный на английском текст.

Most user accounts have only limited access to Unix. For example, it is common that users cannot delete files of other users or parts of system. Users can typically install new software in their home directories, but not into system directories like &lt;tt&gt;/usr&lt;/tt&gt;. To install such software, change permissions on system files, start servers on the reserved ports &lt; 1024, or do any other tasks from which normal users are banned, one must become the ''superuser''. The superuser has a username of ''root'', user ID of zero, and is allowed to do ''anything regardless of system permissions'' - restrictions on user activity ''never apply to root''.

NOTE: For [[w:Ubuntu Linux|Ubuntu]] and [[w:Kubuntu|Kubuntu]], see [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo this].

==Login as Root==
The oldest way to access the superuser account is to login as ''root'', using the root password. For security reasons, and because many crackers on the net seem to know root's username, root logins are normally only permitted on local consoles. (Some systems allow root to login through ssh because that is the only way in. A good system administrator would disable root logins when they are no longer necessary, for example by uncommenting the &quot;PermitRootLogin no&quot; line in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/tt&gt; on systems running OpenSSH.)

In general, it is bad to use root logins. One should require using '''su''' or '''sudo''' instead, so that a user must authenticate with a normal user account before becoming root. The only good reason to use a root login is during the initial setup of a Unix system, before another user account is created and &quot;su&quot; or &quot;sudo&quot; are tested. After this, root logins should be disabled on local consoles too.

Some installation programs let you create the first user account during installation. You never get a root password or make a root login, but the first user account can use ''sudo''. Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X are both distros which do this.

==Use su==
The '''su''' command allows anyone who knows the root password to get a root shell, and thus have all of the powers of root:
 $ '''su'''
 Password:
 #

The acronym &quot;su&quot; means ''switch user'' or ''substitute user''. One can specify a user (&lt;tt&gt;'''su USERNAME'''&lt;/tt&gt;) but by default it switches you to root.

If su is followed by a &quot;-&quot; (&lt;tt&gt;'''su -'''&lt;/tt&gt;); shell-type, working directory, environmental-variables and shell-aliases will be as if the user you switch to (root) had logged-in normally (at the &quot;user&quot;-prompt of a virtual-terminal).

Some systems require that you join the wheel group to have access to su. The requirement is that your username be listed in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/group&lt;/tt&gt; on the line for group &quot;wheel&quot;, group id zero. This requirement does not exist on some systems.

When one finishes with the root shell created by su, one should exit the root shell, so that it is not accidentally used later for normal user activity:
 # '''exit'''
 exit
 $

==Use sudo==
There is a very configurable command called sudo which several Unix-like distros include. This allows one to run individual commands as root. In most cases, running ''sudo'' prompts one for one's own user account password instead of a root password, so ''sudo'' is good for administrators that prefer not to memorize a separate root password, especially if they rarely use root.

The syntax to run a COMMAND as root is:
 $ '''sudo COMMAND'''

For example, we try to view the log for email sent through a Unix-like system:
 $ '''less /var/log/maillog'''
 /var/log/maillog: Permission denied

Because the permission was denied, we use sudo to run the command as root:
 $ '''sudo less /var/log/maillog'''

Another way to so that would be to use the &lt;tt&gt;!!&lt;/tt&gt; command. The &quot;bang-bang&quot; expands to re-print the last command entered to the shell, and then executes it.

 $ '''sudo !!'''
 sudo less /var/log/maillog

Note that this is a &lt;tt&gt;bash&lt;/tt&gt; feature. The feature doesn't work in &lt;tt&gt;sh&lt;/tt&gt;. By default, most modern unix-like systems tend to use bash. [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Comparing_Shells#Why_Bourne_Shell|Just don't use it for shell scripts!]]

===Configuring sudo===
On some systems, sudo must be configured before you can use it. This is a useful configuration line to put in /etc/sudoers. It might already be there, but commented out.
 %wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL

What does it mean? The first word, &quot;%wheel&quot; is the user allowed to use sudo for something. The percent sign indicates that all users in group &quot;wheel&quot; can do this. The first &quot;ALL&quot; means this is allowed on all computers. (That is useful if you copy the same sudoers file to several different Unix-like systems.) The &quot;(ALL)&quot; is the user  for which the commands will have privileges. We could say &quot;(root)&quot;, but someone who can use root can use all other accounts anyway, so we just say &quot;(ALL)&quot;. The last &quot;ALL&quot; indicates which commands are allowed.

Thus, the line provides that ''every user in group wheel'' can ''run any command'' as ''any user'', including root. The only requirement is that the user enter a password: their own password, not root's password.

===Useful defaults===
This line in /etc/sudoers disables two options.
 Defaults        !insults, !lecture

The &quot;insults&quot; feature would give a random insult to any user entering an incorrect password. The &quot;lecture&quot; gives a message to a user that uses &quot;sudo&quot; for the first time (after each boot of the system). It is intended for systems where the administrator grants (possibly limited) sudo access to many users; if only administrators use sudo, then this option is not necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to Unix}}

This book is a ''Guide to Unix'' and Unix-like operating systems, such as GNU/Linux and *BSD. Other systems like Mac OS X, Solaris, and OSF/Tru64 also belong in the list.

Because of this book's incomplete state, it might be hard to find the chapter that you want.

== Structure of this book ==
After this introduction, there are three main parts of this book.

* The [[../Why Unix-like/]] page introduces the Unix system-like platform. The various Platforms such as [[../BSD/]] then highlight particular Unix-like distributions. This book needs to add more platform pages other than [[../BSD/]] and [[../Linux/]].
* The [[../Explanations/]] section contains a list of various topics which ''introduce'' and ''explain'' the use and administration of Unix-like systems. For example, [[../Explanations/Shell Prompt/]] introduces the shell prompt, and [[../Explanations/Filesystems and Swap/]] explains the use of storage devices. Many of the sections are incomplete or missing, but this section is being expanded. The current division into six parts might need to be changed later.
* The Quick References chapters list the [[../Environment Variables/]], [[../Files/]], [[../Commands/]]. There actually is not much here except for the '''[[../Commands/]]''' section.

==Conventions==
This book uses (or will use) the following conventions.

=== Shell prompt ===
The shell prompt looks like:
 $

A root shell prompt (see [[../Explanations/Becoming Root/]]) looks like:
 #

When the user types commands or other text, it appears in bold. The following is an example. The user typed the &quot;cat&quot; command and then several lines which the computer echoed.

 $ '''cat'''
 '''This is an example.'''
 This is an example.
 '''^D''' $

Control characters are written like '''^D'''. This means to hold the Control key and press D. Note that some control characters sometimes do not appear on the screen. For example, the user typed '''^D''' but no &quot;^D&quot; actually appears on the screen.

=== Commands and files ===
:''This convention might need improvement. Currently, a good example is [[../Explanations/Shell Prompt/]].''

A command name is introduced in bold, like '''uname'''. Later, it is mentioned as &quot;uname&quot;. In the future, the bold version might be a link to the command in [[../Commands/]].

Filenames usually appear like &lt;tt&gt;/dev/null&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/tt&gt;. Entire commands look like &lt;tt&gt;'''ls /dev/null /etc/sshd_config'''&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;'''echo a1 a2 a3'''&lt;/tt&gt;. Mentioning again the parts or arguments of these commands looks like &quot;a1&quot; and &quot;a2&quot;. When introducing a new part (like a new option) not mentioned before, that looks like '''-r''' or '''-o loop'''. Text from files is also quoted, for example &quot;# comment&quot;.

=== Audience ===
:''This is a '''proposed''' convention, because it is mostly unimplemented in this book.''

The book targets multiple audiences.
* Unix or non-Unix users seeking background
* Unix system users (background and user instructions)
* Unix system administrators (background and administrator instructions)

To handle this, there might be some templates.
* {{tl|Guide to Unix:u}} begin user instructions
* {{tl|Guide to Unix:eu}} end user instructions
* {{tl|Guide to Unix:i}} begin administrator instructions
* {{tl|Guide to Unix:ei}} end administrator instructions

=== Command links ===
:''This is a '''proposed''' convention, because it is mostly unimplemented in this book.''

# In [[Guide to Unix/Commands]], there is a {{tl|Guide to Unix/Clink}} with links to outside Internet resources like manual pages and wikis.
# In addition, the clink template links between [[Guide to Unix/Commands]] and [[Guide to Unix/Explanations]]. There are two template calls; link both ways. For example, connect [[Guide to Unix/Explanations/bc]] and bc's entry in [[Guide to Unix/Commands]].

== Overview ==

'''''Regulus [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Black Family|Black]]''''' is the brother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. He is also a former [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], although he quit and was subsequently killed, supposedly by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] himself.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Mentioned in passing only; discussing the tapestry of the Ancient and Honorable House of Black on the parlor wall at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|12 Grimmauld Place]], Sirius mentions his brother Regulus, and that he is believed to be dead. As mentioned, he was taken in by the Death Eater idea, and was apparently fairly high in the ranks when he came to his senses and tried to quit. Sirius dismissed him as not being important enough for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] to have killed him personally, instead believing that he was simply ordered to be killed.

Later on, shortly after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] sees the vision of Sirius getting tortured, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] suggests that &quot;Sirius' brother&quot; (meaning Regulus) could have told Sirius how to retrieve the &quot;weapon&quot; that Voldemort has apparently been hunting, since Regulus had been a Death Eater.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

He is mentioned a few times early on. First [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] mentions that Regulus was in his house while he was a teacher. Later [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] tells Harry that Regulus only managed to live a few days after trying to leave the Death Eaters.

When Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] go on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|a mission]] to recover a supposed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] of Voldemort's, it [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 28|turns out]] to have been already replaced by a locket. This locket contains a note signed by one &quot;R.A.B.&quot;. Many readers believe this signature to be Regulus'.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

On the day after their return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], Harry sees the sign on Regulus' bedroom door and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 10|discovers]] that Regulus' middle name is Arcturus. From this, he concludes that Regulus is the one who left the note, signed R.A.B., in the locket Harry and Dumbledore found in the cave. While Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] immediately search for the locket, they discover nothing. Hermione remembers that they had found a locket when trying to clean up the house, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] had a habit of stealing back those Black family relics he considered valuable. When Kreacher's lair proves empty, Harry summons Kreacher, who eventually tells them about the locket.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] had demanded a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]], and Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. The Dark Lord had taken Kreacher to an island on a lake, and had forced him to drink a potion that made him remember horrible things. The Dark Lord had put a locket in the bowl where the potion was, had refilled the bowl, and then had left Kreacher there. Kreacher had crawled to the edge of the lake to drink, had been seized by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]], and been dragged underwater. He had then returned to his master, Regulus, as ordered.

On hearing what the Dark Lord had done, Regulus had ordered Kreacher to take him to the place. He had then ordered Kreacher to force him to drink the potion in the basin, then take the locket, replace it with one he would provide, and destroy the locket. Regulus had drunk all the potion, and had then crawled to the waters' edge to drink, and had been dragged under by Inferi. Kreacher had never seen Regulus again, and he was distraught that, despite having managed to put the replacement locket in the basin, he had been unable to destroy the locket from the basin, and that the locket had been stolen from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]].

Harry wins Kreacher over by telling him that they, too, have the mission of destroying the locket, and by giving him the locket that Regulus had told Kreacher to put in the basin. Overjoyed at having this artifact of his late master returned to him, Kreacher heads off to find Mundungus and bring him back to Harry for questioning.

Kreacher leads the other house-elves into battle telling them to fight in the name of Harry Potter and Regulus Black.

== Strengths ==

Regulus must have been relatively skilled in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] to have blocked Voldemort from reading his thoughts regarding the Dark Lord's evil plans. He also likely knew a lot about the dark arts seeing as he knew about Horcruxes.

Regulus showed courage and integrity when, finally rejecting Voldemort's beliefs, he attempted to destroy Voldemort's Horcrux that was hidden in the sea cave, even knowing he would never survive. Although he intended for Kreacher, his House-elf, to complete the task, his plan failed. However, his actions later allowed Harry to find and destroy the real Horcrux.

== Weaknesses ==

Like his family, Regulus was easily swayed by Lord Voldemort's &quot;pure-blood&quot; rhetoric. He learned too late that the Lord Voldemort's beliefs were far more evil than he had ever realized and being a Death Eater involved far more unpleasantness than he was capable of. Once he entered the Dark Lord's service, however, he was unable to escape.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Brought up in a rabidly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|Pureblood]] family, Regulus found that Voldemort's blood purity ideas resonated with him, and he became a Death Eater during Voldemort's first rise to power. His loyalty to Voldemort seems to have waned when he discovered how Voldemort put his ideas into practice, and he turned against Voldemort with his last living acts.

Sirius tells us that Regulus was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|his mother's]] favorite, as, in so far as she knew, he had stayed true to the ideas of blood purity that she had espoused.

== Analysis ==

It is interesting how much we can see about Regulus without ever actually meeting him. Initially, at any rate, Regulus' motives remain unclear; Sirius tells us that he had gotten relatively deep into Voldemort's organization, then, they believe, gotten scared and tried to get out, and been personally murdered by Voldemort for his troubles. As it turns out, his disillusionment with Voldemort's organization was probably growing for quite some time, as when he did choose to act, it was a fairly major stroke against Voldemort. By that time, Regulus must have been reasonably close to Voldemort's inner councils, as he had been aware that Voldemort wanted a house elf, so he would likely have been within range of Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|legilimency]]. Because of that, he would have had to protect his mind from inspection as his disillusionment grew.

In the end, his sacrifice was apparently futile, as Kreacher was never able to destroy the locket he carried away, and as Voldemort had, at that time, possibly as many as four additional Horcruxes hidden away. The Horcrux within the locket is, of course, eventually found and destroyed. Kreacher might have been able to destroy it if Regulus had told him what it was, but Kreacher apparently was not told that it was a Horcrux he was trying to destroy, though Regulus' note indicates that he knew what it was.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A verb is a word that tells us that someone or something is doing something. For example,
&quot;I went to school.&quot;
In that sentence the word &quot;went&quot; is a verb. A verb tells us what action is happening, that is why verbs are called &quot;action words&quot;. 

In Arabic, like English, verbs are conjugated. This means that the verb changes depending on who is doing the action. For example:

&quot;I went to school&quot;

&quot;He went to school&quot;

In an Arabic translation of the above two sentences, the word for &quot;went&quot; would differ between the sentences. In one it would be ذهبت (dhahabtu) and in the other it would be ذهب (dhahaba). This is what conjugation is all about. When the person doing the action is different (for example I, instead of he) the verb also changes in Arabic. They differ depending on the pronoun.

For example, in English:

I go.
BUT
He goes.
NOT
He go.

Just like in Arabic.
(a-na a''dh''-hab (u))أنا أذهب 
BUT
(hu-wa ya''dh''-hab(u)) هو يذهب
Not
(hu-wa a''dh''-hab (u)) هو أذهب 


So why can't one use the same verb? Because verbs conjugate. If you do not conjugate the verb properly two things can happen:
*People don't understand who you are talking about (because the way the verb is conjugated doesn't match up to what you are talking about)
*People don't understand what verb you are using, conjugating improperly, might make people think you meant something else.

So 
*Conjugation is important
*Conjugation happens in English as well as Arabic

Here is a table of pronouns: Verbs are conjugated according to the pronoun that represents the one who is doing the action.

أنا is always normally prounced a-na even though it's spelling indicates a-naa. The exception to this rule is in specific places of the Quran (qur'aan).

      <text xml:space="preserve">If a watch has a scratched up plastic crystal, chances are very good that it can be cleaned up easily.  

[[Image:CrystalPolish1.jpg]]

Materials:  
Wet sandpaper in 600 and 400 grit, 320 optional for really bad crystals like this one.  Grits are approximate, different brands might not have exactly the same ratings. 
Padded mouse pad, optionally a soft cloth if the mouse pad doesn't have an appropriate soft cloth texture.
Brasso or Wright's Silver polish
Water


Water is to keep the sandpaper from clogging with plastic residue. You may want to skip the water if using more sandpaper is less objectionable than getting the watch wet. 

Wet the coarsest sandpaper you'll be using and place it over the mouse pad.  Check the height of the crystal, the angle you'll need to sand, and make sure you won't sand the bezel--If that's a danger, tape it up or remove the crystal. Sand in one direction, across the direction of the worst scratches by moving the crystal back and forth over the paper.  
You may decide to leave some traces of very severe scratches, or scratches around the edges if removing them might make the crystal too thin.  

[[Image:Wetsand2128text.jpg]]

The result:

[[Image:SandedCrystal2132.jpg]]

Continue with successively finer grades of sandpaper until you get to 600. With each new grade, sand across the direction of the old one, and stop when the old scratches are no longer visible.  You'll need to dry the crystal to check progress. 

The first time you use it, put a small amount of polish on your damp cloth or mouse pad.  If you re-use the same cloth or pad without cleaning it, you may not need fresh polish every time, just re-wet.  If using a cloth, place it over the pad. Polish in a circular motion, again concentrating on the edges until the crystal is clear. Again, you'll need to dry it to check progress.  

[[Image:PolishCircle.jpg]]

The results:

[[Image:FinishedCrystal2142.jpg]]

(Note that this case was floating around in my parts, and there is still a visible scratch at 7--That's on the inside.  unusual to find an inside scratch on a complete watch, and they are a bear to remove. Not gonna bother here, since it's not going to be used.

An alternate method of sanding crystals is to use sanding sticks of decreasing coarseness followed with a polishing compound. These sticks may be purchased in hobby shops and have the advantage of being flexible. This allows them to conform to the shape of the crystal when polishing.  The method used is to place the crystal on a suitable surface (I use a mousepad) face up and sand holding the sanding stick in the thumb and first two fingers of the hand. Using this method there is no danger to the bezel since the crystal has been removed.
My results have been quite favorable.

Another method I had good results with is, for the final polish I use 1200 wet and dry sandpaper and wet it with some penetrating oil, to prevent clogging. When done with that, I turned the paper over and use the back side with some liquid metal polish like Brasso or Silvo. The results are really very good.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Foundation Privacy Policy and this information ==

While I understand that Angela doesn't want her personal information published even though it has been publically distributed through other means, I fail to see just how collecting this information goes against the Foundation Privacy Policy.

That policy only states that the Foundation will not be forcing you to publishing this information, but it further warns that even if you edit anonymously and don't even &quot;log in&quot;, that your contributions can in theory be tracked down to your computer and that it can be linked to your name and that you made the contribution.  In short, this is a disclaimer, not a protection of privacy statement.  While Angela may want to keep her contributions anonymous, the fact that she logged in with her account, together with her very visible status as a member of the Foundation board makes every contribution logged in through that account tied in with a specific person.

In addition, if you don't like the wording of how I'm asking for this information.... '''CHANGE IT!!!!'''  This is a Wiki, which means it doesn't have to be &quot;engraven in stone&quot;.  I never intended that to be the case either, but in this case there are some assumptions some people are making about how Wikimedia projects are organized and the psuedo-anonymous way people think they are contributing that really isn't the case.

I'm just trying to give proper credit to those individuals who want to claim credit, and collect that information voluntarily.  I'm also very surprised both with the individuals who are complaining about this issue, and the fact that they choose to complain outside of this talk page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:09, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

If you are having problem with an admin getting over zealous and deleting this Wikibook, please let me know.  I can &quot;undelete&quot; the Wikibook if it somehow gets purged and you really want to add content.  There are a lot of book stubs floating around right now in Wikibooks, so I support a general &quot;cleanup&quot; of the project where possible.  My vote in the VfD discussion was only due to the fact that it didn't appear that any new edits had been done on the Wikibook for some time, and that it appeared to be a dead project.  Raising an objection to the deletion request due to the fact that you are adding content is valid, and a good reason to keep the Wikibook.

Thank you for contributing to Wikibooks, and I hope that you find other interesting projects as well.  Wikibooks is finally starting to come together with some actual books getting &quot;ready&quot; for publication.... at least to a &quot;1.0&quot; level for now.  This is an exciting time to be participating with this project, and I hope you continue to make contributions here.  

If you have continued to add content and want to get rid of the &quot;VfD&quot; warning at the top of the Feel the Magic Wikibook, wait about a week or so for further comments to be added then go ahead and delete the warning and &quot;archive&quot; the stuff on the VfD discussion page.  If you are not sure how to do that, drop me a line on my talk page and I can help you out as well.  I don't think anybody is going to get angry with you for removing that discussion, especially due to the nature of the comments there.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:36, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called A Link to the Past. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name A Link to the Past~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Thanks for your work on the Arabic wikibook.  If you know anybody or if you yourself can use audio clips for exercises like they are [[French/Lessons/Greetings|on French pages]], that would be incredibly helpful.  Just make sure to mark anything as dialect.  If I can help you out with my very-limited/non-existent ability please tell me.

Hello, I just categorised your pages that are part of the Arabic Wikibook. In future could you please make sure that your pages are categorised. Thanks. [[User:Arsenalfan|Arsenalfan]] ([[User talk:Arsenalfan|talk]]) 02:05, 8 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

== [[Sonic R]] ==

Why not help out with the book if you know anything about it? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 20:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

== New Lolo template ==

Hey there.  I saw your interest in my game guide.  I decided to make up a template for laying out levels rather than cluttering up the Wikibooks with hundreds of screenshots.  With the template, I actually made the level into a sort of grid for more specificity on where to put objects.  My first test is on [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/Level 3]].  I was hoping you'd take a look and tell me what you think.  I'll need to add a thing for powers, but that'll come in time.  --[[User:Sivak|Sivak]] 04:15, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

== [[Eggerland]] ==
I noticed your question on [[User talk:Hagindaz]]. The [[Eggerland]] land book probably ''will'' be moved off somewhere else in the future. You will probably have noticed that many video game books have moved off to other wikis, for example I moved the [[Sonic R]] book to [http://www.wikiknowledge.net/wiki/index.php?title=Sonic_R my own wiki]. If you releace you work into the public domain, then you are welcome to move [[Eggerland]] over to WikiKnowledge also. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 14:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

=== WikiKnowledge or Gameinfo ===
Well, Gameinfo has 293 pages after starting in February 2005, while WikiKnowledge has close to 1000 pages and it only started a few months ago. Gameinfo offers the advantage that it is licensed under the GNU FDL, so the content can be moved over without any problems. Moving the pages to WikiKnowledge will require you to release them into the Public Domain first. WikiKnowledge offers the advantage that  several pages have already been moved from WikiBooks to WikiKnowledge, including the ones I wrote: Sonic 3, Sonic 2, Sonic R, etc as well as the entire WikiBooks Pokédex. I also have advertising space bought in two UK games magazines for the site. If you confirm that you are happy to release the work into the Public Domain (so it is no longer covered by copyright) then I would be happy to move them over for you (including the pictures). Thanks, [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 15:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)


:I have moved Eggerland to [http://www.wikiknowledge.net/wiki/index.php?title=Eggerland WikiKnowledge]. As for your work on MegaMan games, whether you write it at gameinfo or WikiKnowledge is up to you. It's just a case of which wiki you would prefer to use and nothing says you can't write it at both wiki's if you want. Again I would be happy to move the work you have done to WikiKnowledge for you if you wish. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 16:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article explains '''how to make a demonstration transformer'''. A transformer is a device that converts one AC voltage to another. A detailed description of how they work is given  under transformer. The purpose of this page is to give details of how a  demonstration transformer can be made very simply in a classroom in order to teach the basic principles. Demonstrations similar to this are usually performed in schools by pupils aged around 13 years old, under the supervision of a qualified science teacher.

==You will need==

* Some pieces of soft iron, preferably in a U shape but a cylinder will do.
* Plastic-coated wire
* Some 6 V mes bulbs (torch/flashlight bulbs) in a suitable bulb holder
* Connecting wire with 4 mm plugs
* Alligator clips
* A 4 V AC power supply that is fitted with a 5 A trip switch '''(IMPORTANT!) ''Under no circumstances should this home made transformer be plugged into home current.'''''

 Also you should mention that your 4v power supply has to be AC.  [[Daniel MacKay]]

OK, that diagram '''sucks'''. It doesn't look ''anything'' like [[Optimus Prime]]. --[[User:Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]] 08:09 12 Jul 2003 (UTC)
:True, but it does ''transform''. Move the two bulbs down, the  u shaped cores over them, as wheel arches and make a chassis with the rest of the lines and you've got a pretty damn good go-cart [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 04:39 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)
----
Wouldn't the bulb also dim when cores are set apart? Should this be mentioned? [[User:Nikola Smolenski|Nikola]] 19:38, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Yes the bulb would dim, but setting them apart with an air gap would be very difficult to do in practice. You'd either get no light at all or if you move them closer together the magnetic attraction between the C cores forces them together. There's no way I can pull them apart. I suppose you could put something in the gap to keep them from slamming together I might give it a go and see what happens.Watch this space.

I am somewhat concerned that the removal of the disclaimer may be problematic if someone tries these instructions (clumsily) and gets hurt. [[User:Waveguy|Waveguy]] 18:04, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)

As maverick said, the disclaimer hasn't  been removed, as it's already on the bottom of every page.It ''was'' a bit OTT in my opinion. I hate for it to put people off. This is a '''safe''' experiment. I have seen it done loads of times over the years by adults and 13-16 year olds and have never seen  anything bad happen.The only way that I can think of in which someone might get seriously hurt is if they tried to plug it into the mains and got an electric shock. You'd have to be a real dimbo to do that, but just in case I've added instructions not to on the page. [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 13:29, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Guitar tablature is a form of written music in which the fret and string to place your finger on is shown in order of how it appears on the song. Sometimes, various methods are used to denote timing, and often effects such as &quot;slides&quot; or &quot;bends&quot; are notated as well. This is the only way to learn many popular songs (unless one transcribes it straight from audio) and is an easy, free way to learn songs on guitar with little or no previous musical knowledge.


There are many sources of guitar tablature online and in most cases these are in the form of html documents, displaying the written music using text characters. However there are also guitar tablature software which allow the user to write, edit, listen and print out tablature. These programs are infact becoming so powerful that many of them support multiple tracks, making it possible to tabulate all the instruments in a band in one tablature file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Westminster motor kits''' are prefabricated kits for making educational [[w:electric motor|motor]]s in school. They are available to buy from educational science suppliers and allow students to build their own motors from two magnets and about a meter of plastic coated wire.

The instructions that come with the kits are aimed at an adult readership so child friendly notes should be given to schoolchildren.

The most common causes for the motor not to work include:

* One of the magnets being turned the wrong way round.
* Insulation issues: the spindles are made of metal and have to be insulated with sticky tape.
* Poor Contact with the 'brushes'

This is a ''How-to'' about a '''School science experiment--Indian rope trick (magnetism)'''. This is a good demonstration that is used in schools to teach the idea of magnetic materials. It can be fiddly to set up, but it's worth the effort.

== Materials ==
*Magnet
*Sticky tape or Duct tape
*Samples of materials to insert in the gap

== Method ==
#Clamp the magnet in the clamp stand.
#Tie some cotton onto a [[w:steel|steel]] paper clip and allow the paper clip to stick to the magnet.
#Gently pull the cotton down so that there is an air space between the paper clip and the magnet, and then stick it to the bench with some sticky tape. This demonstration works best if the air gap is sufficiently large that the paperclip is only just held up by the magnet. It takes a fair amount of adjustment to get it perfect.
#Insert a non-[[w:ferromagnetic|ferromagnetic]] material into the air gap, e.g. a piece of [[w:paper|paper]] or a sheet of [[w:copper|copper]]. The paper clip stays up.
#Insert a ferromagnetic material such as an [[w:iron|iron]] nail or sheet of [[w:nickel|nickel]] and the paperclip falls.

== How does it work? ==

The [[w:force|force]] that holds the paperclip up is due to an induced magnetic [[w:dipole|dipole]] forming in the clip. In other words, if the south pole of the magnet is down, for example, the [[w:magnetic domain|magnetic domain]]s in the paper clip orient themselves so that the top end of it becomes a north pole, the bottom a south. Like poles repel and opposite poles attract. The attraction of the magnet for the (induced) north pole is greater than the repulsion of the induced south one, because it is closer. That holds the paper clip up.  If the north pole of the permanent magnet is down, the same argument applies with north and south interchanged. You can verify that the paper clip has become a miniature magnet, by the way, by showing that iron filings will stick to it, but don't let the filings get on the big magnet or you will have a job cleaning it!

Why is the magnetic field of the bar magnet strongest near its poles? This can be visualized in terms of lines of force that emanate from it, as can be seen by sprinkling iron filings on paper. These lines are called [[w:magnetic field line|magnetic field line]]s. The closer the lines are together, the bigger the ''[[w:magnetic flux|magnetic flux]]'' and the stronger the force pulling magnetisable objects, such as the paperclip, along the lines.  Because of the shape of the field lines for a bar-shaped magenet, the places where the lines are closest together are the ends of the magnet.

Magnetic field lines pass straight through most materials, as if the materials were not there. Put a piece of paper in the air gap and the magnetic field lines pass straight through and hold up the paperclip. Some materials, however, affect a magnetic field. They create a magnetic ''short circuit'' through which the lines of force pass readily, and so they can't extend on the other side.  If you put something made of these materials (known as ferromagnetic materials) into the gap, the field lines distort so as to pass through the short circuit.

If the paperclip is set up so that it is on the brink of falling, then any disturbance in the field that is holding it up will cause it to drop. That's why it is suggested to do the experiment with the clip barely levitated. Otherwise, there is a chance that some of the magnetic lines from the bar magnet may penetrate the inserted lamina or reach round it, and the demonstration will be spoiled.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Book/Page|next=Chapter 2|tab=1|title=The Riddle House}}
== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

The story opens in the small village of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]] at &quot;The Riddle House.&quot; Many villagers still call it that, even though many years have passed since the Riddle family actually lived there. Atop a hill overlooking the village, the former manor is the largest building in the area.

The house has a bad reputation. Half a century ago, the Riddle family, including the son, then about thirty years old, and his parents, were found dead in the living room. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], the Riddles' gardener, was arrested on suspicion of homicide but was released when it was determined the victims were not murdered; they simply died, apparently of fear. But the villagers remain suspicious that Frank was responsible.

Bryce now lives alone on the Riddle property, caring for the house and grounds for its absent owners as best he can despite his advancing age. Late one night, Bryce investigates a light in one of the house's windows. Inside, he overhears [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew)]] planning to take action after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], though Bryce has no idea what that is. Lord Voldemort apparently distrusts Wormtail to act alone, and talks about his &quot;''faithful'' servant&quot;. It appears they have already killed someone named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]].

Bryce is discovered by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], Voldemort's giant pet snake, and Wormtail forces him into the room. Bryce threatens them with the police; Voldemort, calling him a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]], completely disdains Bryce's threat and slays him with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]].

Two hundred miles away, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] suddenly awakens with a sharp pain in his scar.

== Analysis ==

This marks the second time in the series that a book has opened somewhere other than with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] at the Dursleys. The first was ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''. Readers are also witness to a murder first-hand, whereas before, murdered victims were mentioned after-the-fact. Arguably, Harry is viewing the events in a dream, although given the detail he sees and his strong reaction to it, it is likely much more than that. Harry's recollection seems to be as a detached third party, as he later recalls seeing Frank fall and the armchair swivel from Frank's viewpoint.

This chapter is somewhat confusing initially. We are not given any cues to indicate that the death of the Riddle family, announced to the town by a screaming maidservant, is occurring 50 years before the main story. We only recognize the time-frame of the initial events when the story shifts to Frank Bryce's current point-of-view. 

It should be mentioned that Voldemort, discussing his &quot;''faithful'' servant,&quot; is clearly referring to someone other than Wormtail. This third person's identity is left unclear, and it leaves Wormtail quite frightened, as it implies that Voldemort does not entirely trust Wormtail, and he is therefore subject to punishment and perhaps death. This again illuminates Voldemort's character: he rules his associates through fear, intimidation, and pain, rather than commanding their respect or fidelity.

Voldemort's snake, Nagini, makes its first appearance. Wormtail is apparently milking Nagini for some substance, possibly venom, to keep Lord Voldemort alive. Milking venomous snakes is not unique to the Wizarding world; it is by this technique that we are able to produce antivenom. The fact that Voldemort uses this process himself is perhaps unusual, but considerably less dangerous for Voldemort and Wormtail than it is for Muggle harvesters, because of the control Voldemort has over the snake.

As noted, we actually see Frank Bryce being murdered here, apparently by something speaking with Voldemort's voice, though we don't see what it is. If this is truly Voldemort, and not just a nightmare for Harry, then even in his disembodied state, Voldemort's power is already strong and likely growing.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
#Why does the Riddle manor have a &quot;creepy&quot; reputation? Why has no one lived in it for so many years?
#Why was Frank Bryce accused and later exonerated of the Riddle family's murders? What could have killed them?
#Why was Bertha Jorkins recently killed?
#Can anyone else talk to snakes like Voldemort does with Nagini? How is that possible?

=== Further Study ===
#Who might the &quot;rich&quot; owner of the Riddle house be? Is Voldemort concerned about the house's ownership? Why or why not?
#Why does Harry awaken in pain, 200 miles away, just as Frank Bryce is murdered?
#Who might the &quot;faithful servant&quot; that is mentioned be? Give supporting reasons.
#How and why does Nagini seem to act differently than other snakes?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Events in this chapter lead us to believe that the Riddle family that we find murdered in this chapter are Voldemort's Muggle father and grandparents; this is alluded to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 32|later in this book]], and confirmed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|the sixth book.]]

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 29|Later in this book]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|also in a subsequent one]], Harry will have &quot;dreams&quot; that appear to reflect actual events occurring as Voldemort is seeing them; internal evidence in the book suggests that events in this chapter may well be such a &quot;dream&quot;. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], as we have seen, has already connected Harry's scar paining him with the residual effects from Voldemort's curse when he tried to kill baby Harry. On hearing about this dream, Dumbledore further suspects that the murder attempt may have sheared off a portion of Voldemort's soul, transferring it to Harry, thus unintentionally making Harry one of Voldemort's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. Much later, Dumbledore informs Harry that he believes this may constitute a true link between their minds. Voldemort initially seems unaware that this connection exists, but he later becomes aware of it, and exploits it in an attempt to entrap Harry; this happens throughout [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|the fifth book]].

Nagini seems more biddable and intelligent than a snake ought to be. Finding a Muggle standing in the hall, as Nagini does, a normal snake would attack, hide, or otherwise react; instead, Nagini slithers past unconcernedly and promptly reports Frank Bryce's presence to her master. And though readers saw Harry talking to the boa constrictor at the zoo in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], Voldemort's connection to Nagini seems deeper and darker than this. Nagini, we discover later, is also a Horcrux, and perhaps some human-like intelligence was passed to the snake when Voldemort moved his soul shard to her. 

The viewpoints mentioned in this chapter also do not tally completely with what we believe now, and what is discovered later, that Harry is likely to be able to see. This chapter's vital events are seen from Frank Bryce's viewpoint, but Harry, we believe at this point, is actually sharing Voldemort's mind, and so may be able to perceive things either from Voldemort's or Nagini's point of view. (That Nagini may be a Horcrux, also sharing a fragment of Voldemort's soul, is not suggested until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 23|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], though the evidence for this is revealed a year earlier, at Christmas in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].) Examining Harry's thoughts about this dream, and combining this with what we know about the communication channel between Harry and Voldemort as revealed in later books, would indicate that Harry is largely experiencing the events through Nagini's eyes. Because of this, and because Harry will only have started experiencing this dream when Bryce was discovered and Voldemort became angry, we must assume that all Harry knows of what preceded Bryce's discovery comes from Bryce's comments to Voldemort.

While the &quot;''faithful'' servant&quot; Voldemort mentions is never explicitly identified, we are meant to suspect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], given Harry's relationship with him. However, by closely inspecting Wormtail's and Snape's careers, we can see that each reacted similarly at Voldemort's downfall: Wormtail went into hiding, while Snape continued working for Dumbledore, using Dumbledore's snow-white reputation as a shield. Neither, during Voldemort's absence, professed loyalty to his ideals; each, in his own way, repudiated Voldemort's scheme for Wizardkind. In fact, as Snape seemed to have been hindering Voldemort's attempts to regain the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|the first book of the series]], it is likely that Voldemort believes Snape has turned against him, an assumption which may be echoed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 33|a later chapter of this book]]. Even given what we know now, if we consider things from Voldemort's viewpoint, it would seem Snape is no more trustworthy than Pettigrew. This lack of trustworthiness in Voldemort's eyes is not (apparently) repudiated in detail until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|the sixth book]]. We only learn the truth of Snape's loyalty in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|the final book]].

While it is never explicitly stated who Voldemort's ''faithful'' servant is, it is likely that Voldemort is referring to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], whose existence he had discovered by questioning Bertha Jorkins. The &quot;one more curse&quot; that Voldemort refers to is likely the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] which Wormtail will cast on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]]. Other curses will be necessary, of course, but the curse that disables [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] does not have to be cast by Voldemort or Pettigrew; instead, it, and any other curses required, may be cast by Barty Crouch Jr. once he is restored to Voldemort's service.

=== Connections ===
* While we have been made aware of a link between Harry and Voldemort that manifests as pain in Harry's scar, this is the first time that we have been allowed to see that actual impressions and events can be transferred via that channel. We will see this again [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 29|in this book]], and Voldemort, learning of this channel, will use it to set a trap for Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|in the next book]]. Harry will reverse the channel, receiving useful information from Voldemort, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|in the final book]].
* Harry will also visit Little Hangleton and the environs of the Riddle House again, later [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 32|in this book]], when captured by Voldemort; and again via the memories of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 10|two years from now]]. We will also learn that Voldemort had concealed a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] in Little Hangleton; Harry will perceive Voldemort's rage at finding that hiding place empty, and knows that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] had retrieved that Horcrux from there.</text>

'' Ч is always mild.''
No, it's not.

Conside the word ЧИ. The letter И cannot be used after a soft vowel, therefore it's hard.

''И - there is no exact match in English(English does not have this sound, therefore this is the hardest sound to pronounce); the closest way to pronounce it would be like y in myth. The 'i' in 'big' is also an approximation.(Sounds exactly like Russian sound Ы)''

Complete and utter rubbish. The Ukrainian sound is ɪ and the Russian sound is ɨ. In fact, ''myth'' and ''bit'' have almost the exact pronunciation of the Ukrainian sound, but not the Russian sound.

Also, how the hell do you expect people to pronounce words when you don't even give the position of the stress? Are they supposed to guess? Use an online dictionary and then pronounce them?

I'm going to have to fix this one later. -[[User:Iopq|Iopq]] 12:34, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] awakes with a start, his scar burning painfully. He goes over the dream he just had and remembers seeing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] in a dark room, killing an old man. Concentrating, he recalls that they were also plotting to kill someone else&amp;mdash;him. Focusing on his current whereabouts, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], Harry deliberates over what to do about this&amp;mdash;his burning scar usually has something to do with Voldemort. Should he tell his friends? [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] comes to mind, and he imagines her advice; he should just tell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] would want to ask [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|his Dad]] about the usual behaviour of scars made by Curses.

He decides to write to his godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], and tell him what has been happening with the Dursleys and his scar. He finishes the letter and waits for his owl, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], to return from hunting.

== Analysis ==

Much familiar ground is revisited – reintroducing Harry, his friends, his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|school]], and the Wizarding world in general. This is a common pattern in the series, and the author may feel it is necessary to reestablish ground rules and bring new readers up to speed on the plot, or at least the characters and situation in between each book. It may also be intended to make each book stand more or less on its own.

Ron and Hermione re-enter the story by Harry's imagined reactions to him telling them his latest news. The Dursley family is also mentioned in this way, as is Professor Dumbledore, through Harry's thoughts about what the consequences might be if he were to reveal what has happened. Harry's relationship with Sirius Black is also revisited, and Harry believes his godfather is the one person he can confide in about his dream without any concern over how he will react. This may indicate that Harry now fully considers Sirius as his real family.

Harry's dream leads us to believe that he has experienced a real event, judging by the previous chapter. Its narration travels seamlessly from past episodes of which Harry would have no knowledge, through current events as seen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], finally returning us into the story with Frank's fatal encounter with Voldemort and Wormtail. Harry doubts its reality, and there is no actual proof yet, but the pain in Harry's scar indicates that he may have perceived real events occurring in Voldemort's life.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
# When was the last time Harry's scar was burning?
# In the dream, Wormtail attempts to discourage Voldemort from using Harry in Voldemort's scheme. Why would Wormtail do this?
# Why does Harry choose to write to his godfather rather than Ron or Hermione about his scar hurting?

=== Further Study ===
# Why doesn't Voldemort experience the same mental connection with Harry that Harry has with him? 

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Harry's scar has taken on a significant new role. While it has always been a focal point in the story, until now it has mostly served as a visible symbol of Harry's near-fatal encounter with Voldemort, and also has acted as a warning beacon, alerting Harry to Voldemort's presence by causing pain. Now it seems somehow related to a mental connection between Harry and Voldemort, allowing Harry glimpses into Voldemort's thoughts. Voldemort is still apparently unaware that this connection exists, but that will change. And while Harry remembers few details about his dream, which was not a dream at all, we have learned that Wormtail (Pettigrew) seemed unwilling to involve Harry in whatever scheme Voldemort is planning. This may be tied to the life debt Wormtail now owes Harry. Voldemort may be unaware that his servant has such an obligation to his greatest enemy, and will likely be extremely displeased when he discovers this.

Harry perceiving Voldemort's mind only when he is asleep is important to the storyline. Voldemort reveals things to us that Harry would likely pursue if he recalled them. In particular, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] is mentioned in the &quot;dream,&quot; and will be mentioned repeatedly in the next months. If Harry could recall that name, he likely would tell someone, most likely Arthur Weasley or Professor Dumbledore, and our story probably would develop differently.

No real reason is ever given as to why Harry can sense Voldemort's thoughts, but Voldemort is unable to detect Harry's until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|over a year later]]. We can only speculate why: Harry is able to perceive Voldemort's thoughts only when Voldemort is experiencing extremely strong emotions. During this sequence, for instance, Voldemort is first plotting his most hated enemy's demise, and he is likely inflamed with rage against Harry for daring to exist; and then, he is murdering Frank Bryce, casting a spell which requires feeling deep hatred for the target. In this book, and the subsequent one, Harry only senses Voldemort's thoughts when he is asleep or nearly so. One can assume that the reverse transmission of thoughts can only occur when Harry is feeling strong emotions, and when Voldemort is in a similarly relaxed state. It is likely accidental timing that Voldemort is never in a receptive mind set when Harry is experiencing his strongest emotions. It may be that Voldemort is also affected because he is still physically weak, and not yet completely human again. It is only after his body is fully resurrected and has regained his strength that he later detects Harry's thoughts.

There is a small inconsistency regarding when Harry actually learns Sirius is his godfather. It says in this chapter that &quot;he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.&quot; In fact, it was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 10|around the previous Christmas]] when he overheard, in a conversation in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Three Broomsticks|the Three Broomsticks]], that Sirius was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]]'s best friend and Harry's godfather. However, at that time, he still believed Sirius was a mass murderer and responsible for his parents' deaths, so he could have disavowed the connection. It may have only been after the revelations in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], which happened just two months before this chapter, that Harry finally accepted that Sirius was truly his godfather.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] enters the kitchen where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] is serving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] a grapefruit quarter. Dudley has been on a diet since his school wrote a letter saying they did not have any knickerbockers large enough to fit him. To make it easier for Dudley, Aunt Petunia has put the entire family on a diet. A hungry Harry had requested help by owl post and has received snacks from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] that he stashed under the floorboard upstairs. They and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] had also each sent him cakes for his birthday, now two weeks past, and he still has two left.

A letter arrives from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]], which was surprisingly sent through Muggle mail rather than by owl post. To [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]'s dismay, the envelope is nearly completely covered in stamps, and the postman has rung because this is unusual. Mrs. Weasley invites Harry to attend the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] with the Weasley family, and suggests he stay with them until school starts. This creates a quandary for Uncle Vernon: if he lets Harry go, it will be something fun for him, which he always tries to prevent; however, it also means Harry would be gone a good two weeks earlier than Vernon and Petunia could have hoped for.

After a long discussion, Uncle Vernon is about to forbid Harry to go the Weasleys when Harry deliberately mentions that he has to finish his letter to Sirius Black. He says his godfather has not heard from him in a while and might be getting worried. Suddenly afraid, Uncle Vernon grants Harry permission to go to the Weasleys. When Harry returns to his room, he finds owls waiting. Ron sent a letter via [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|his tiny owl]], saying that they will come and get him whether the Dursleys like it or not. Harry sends a reply saying that he has permission. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig, his own owl,]] has returned from hunting, so Harry finishes his message to Sirius, explaining where he is going, and gives it to Hedwig.

== Analysis ==

While the story is advanced somewhat, it is cousin Dudley and Uncle Vernon that are highlighted here. In addition to his increasingly abusive and bullying personality, Dudley, who rarely exhibits restraint in anything, has grown so fat that he is unable to fit into his school clothes. (For US readers, we note that knickerbockers are a particular type of short trousers, evidently forming part of the school uniform and possibly only available through the school.) Mortified, Petunia not only puts Dudley on a diet, but the entire family as well, feeling that Dudley should not have to suffer alone, even though Harry is perpetually under-nourished. Without his friends' assistance, Harry might literally starve. Additionally, there are some visible changes in Uncle Vernon's behavior; as Harry grows older, Vernon, knowing what wizards are capable of, begins showing fear, if not necessarily respect, towards Harry. His underlying motivation continues to be to make Harry's life as miserable as possible, but now he does so with more passive-aggressive behavior. Aware that his status in the household has begun to increase, Harry is not averse to using his new-found power judiciously to obtain what he wants, though from what we see here, he does so sparingly and apparently not in a malicious or harmful manner.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
#Why does Aunt Petunia insist on putting the entire family on a diet when it is Dudley who is overweight?
#Why is Uncle Vernon conflicted over giving Harry permission to visit the Weasleys?
#Why does Harry mention that he is writing to his godfather? What is Uncle Vernon's reaction?

=== Further Study ===
#How and why has the relationship between Harry and Uncle Vernon changed? 
#Why did Molly Weasley send the Dursleys a letter using Muggle mail service rather than Owl Post? Does it make a difference?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

There is surprisingly little in this chapter that has any bearing on what will happen in the future of this book or of the series. It is true that Harry's letter, when it reaches Sirius, will cause him to try to return to England to confer directly with Harry; and similarly, and as we now expect, Harry will attend the Quidditch World Cup. Apart from that, the only change that might be signaled by events in this chapter is in Dudley: over the next year, his diet will prove effective in causing him to lose weight, but true to his nature as a bully, he will take up boxing and become an urban tough.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] finishes packing his belongings by noon the next day and eagerly awaits  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|the Weasleys']] arrival. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] is, of course, worried about the neighbors noticing anything strange happening and starts asking how the Weasleys will be dressed—will it be those odd Wizard's robes or &quot;normal&quot; peoples' clothes? Uncle Vernon also wonders by what means they arrive.

The hour comes and passes. Finally, the Weasleys arrive by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]], which was specially connected to the Dursleys' fireplace. However, the Dursleys' hearth has been blocked up, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] has to blast his way through. After this rocky start, Mr. Weasley has no luck in engaging the Dursleys in a conversation, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] fetch Harry's trunk. Fred drops a bag of toffees, collecting all but one before he, George, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] depart for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]]. Harry and Mr. Weasley are still there when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|cousin Dudley]] finds and eats the toffee. His tongue promptly expands to several feet in length. Uncle Vernon starts attacking Mr. Weasley, who he blames for this outrage, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] tries to pull the supposed foreign object out of Dudley's mouth. Harry exits for the Burrow as Uncle Vernon starts throwing china figurines at Mr. Weasley.

== Analysis ==

Although the Dursleys meeting with the Weasley clan is humorously depicted, Vernon and Petunia's steadfast refusal to acknowledge Mr. Weasley and the others' presence symbolizes the deep division that exists between the Wizarding and Muggle realms; it likely represents how many Muggles might react if they knew such a world existed. Vernon and Petunia are particularly resistant to any interaction with magic, and, fearing and loathing what they are unable to understand, they simply choose to ignore its existence as much as possible. Being forced to raise a young wizard in their home only exacerbates their intolerance to anything or anyone different from themselves, which is why Harry is forbidden to acknowledge his own magical abilities while under their roof. The Twins, with their usual mischief, only make matters worse, though they are generally unconcerned whether it is wizard or Muggle who falls prey to their unique pranks. For Harry, any opportunity to escape from this restrictive and unhappy household is a welcome respite, and he is grateful to the Weasleys for arranging his early departure, regardless of how much it angers or offends his aunt and uncle. 

This is the second time that we have seen Floo powder used since [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] (where it was introduced). [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] may have used Floo powder or something similar to summon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] to his study in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']].

The fireplace was certainly not walled up [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 3|in the first book]], because letters were delivered through it at that time. This may be an error on the part of the author, but it is equally likely that during Harry's absence at school, Vernon had all the fireplaces walled up to prevent that sort of thing happening again, and the author simply didn't choose to mention the fact.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
#Why do the Dursleys refuse to talk with Arthur Weasley, despite his friendly attempts to make conversation?
#Why is Uncle Vernon so concerned about how the Weasleys will be dressed and how they will arrive?

=== Further Study ===
#There is definitely magic happening here—the Floo powder, the wall being blown apart, figurines being destroyed, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ton-Tongue Toffee|Ton-Tongue Toffees]], at the very least. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] chastised Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 2|two years ago]] because of a simple Hover Charm performed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]]. Why are there no such missives this time?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

This is the first time Fred and George Weasley have been seen deliberately tormenting other people; granted, Dudley may have deserved it, and the damage inflicted was only temporary. While their pranks will largely remain harmless, there will be occasional episodes that could be described as viciousness in this book, and in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], though in every case seemingly directed at a deserving victim. 

Eventually, the Twins' magical abilities are such that the joke products they invent will evolve into defensive weapons that are used by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] in the fight against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]].

Although Uncle Vernon despises anything different from what he knows or is unable to understand, he also truly fears the Wizarding world, though probably not for the same reasons as Petunia. Her feelings are deeper and more complex. As seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], her hatred of the Magical world mostly seems rooted in jealousy over her sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]], Harry's mother, being magical while Petunia was not. It is only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|the final book in the series]] that we learn the deepest roots of that jealousy. And while Petunia is mostly motivated by spite that she directs at Harry, her fear is somewhat justified. She knows most wizards are benign and never harm Muggles, but she is also aware that Dark wizards exist, and that Harry, and by extension herself and her family, have been specifically targeted either by Voldemort or his agents. Her hatred and resentment may partially stem from what her sister's unique abilities has left Petunia to cope with.  

A few more details about the Floo Network are revealed in this chapter. Not all fireplaces are automatically linked to the Network, and it is a department within the Ministry of Magic that regulates the Floo system. In the next book, we learn that the Ministry can monitor, as well as control, how fireplaces are used on the Network. This plays a role in the fifth book, as Harry must find an unmonitored fireplace to safely contact [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black's]] ancestral home. And in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|the seventh book]] this again becomes a plot point, as Harry is unable to leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] via the Floo Network because it is being monitored.

=== Connections ===
* This is the first time we see original magical artifacts created by the Twins. We will shortly find out that these are to be the basis of their chosen career, innovators in the magical jokes field. The process of financing the start-up of their joke shop, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], will be a subplot throughout this book, and testing of products for that shop will be a subplot in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|the next book]], as well as something of a bone of contention between the Twins and Hermione. The shop itself will be launched, and we will see it [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 6|in the following book]],  at which time we will learn that some of the Weasley products are in use by the Ministry in the battle against Dark wizards.
* The Floo network being regulated by the Ministry is mentioned here. It will become a factor again in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', where a discussion with Sirius [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 17|is nearly intercepted]]. The interception is explained when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28| says that all the fireplaces are now monitored]], resulting in Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 29|breaking into her office]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 32|twice]] to try to communicate with Sirius. It also is the reason that Harry cannot use the Floo network to leave the Dursleys' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|in the final book]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Negative Binomial Distribution===

Just as the Bernoulli and the Binomial distribution are related in counting the number of successes in 1 or more trials, the Geometric and the Negative Binomial distribution are related in the number of trials needed to get 1 or more successes.

The Negative Binomial distribution refers to the probability of the number of times needed to do something until achieving a fixed number of desired results. For example:

* How many times will I throw a coin until it lands on ''heads'' for the 10th time?
* How many children will I have when I get my third daughter?
* How many cards will I have to draw from a pack until I get the second Joker?

Just like the [[Statistics:Distributions/Binomial|Binomial Distribution]], the Negative Binomial distribution has two controlling parameters: the probability of success p in any independent test and the desired number of successes m. If a random variable X has Negative Binomial distribution with parameters p and m, its [[Wikipedia:probability mass function|probability mass function]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;P(X=n) = {n-1 \choose m-1} p^m (1-p)^{n-m} \mbox{, for } n \ge m&lt;/math&gt;.

====Example====
A travelling salesman goes home if he has sold 3 encyclopedias that day. Some days he sells them quickly. Other days he's out till late in the evening. If on the average he sells an encyclopedia at one out of ten houses he approaches, what is the probability of returning home after having visited only 10 houses? 

Answer:

The number of trials X is Negative Binomial distributed with parameters p=0.1 and m=3, hence:

:&lt;math&gt;P(X=10) = {9 \choose 2} 0.1^3 0.9^7 = 0.0172186884&lt;/math&gt;.

5 + 5 =2

====Mean====
The mean can be derived as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_i f(x_i)  \cdot x_i = \sum_{x=0}^\infin  {x+r-1 \choose r-1} p^x (1-p)^r  \cdot  x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {0+r-1 \choose r-1} p^0 \left(1-p\right)^r  \cdot  0 +  \sum_{x=1}^\infin  {x+r-1 \choose r-1} p^x (1-p)^r  \cdot  x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = 0 +  \sum_{x=1}^\infin  {(x+r-1)! \over (r-1)!x!} p^x (1-p)^r  \cdot  x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {rp \over 1-p}\sum_{x=1}^\infin  {(x+r-1)! \over r!(x-1)!} p^{x-1} (1-p)^{r+1}&lt;/math&gt;
Now let ''s = r+1'' and ''w=x-1'' inside the summation.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {rp \over 1-p}\sum_{w=0}^\infin  {(w+s-1)! \over (s-1)!w!} p^w (1-p)^s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {rp \over 1-p}\sum_{w=0}^\infin  {w+s-1 \choose s-1} p^w (1-p)^s&lt;/math&gt;
We see that the summation is the sum over a the complete pmf of a negative binomial random variable distributed NB(s,p), which is 1 (and can be verified by applying [[w:Binomial_theorem#Newton.27s_generalized_binomial_theorem|Newton's generalized binomial theorem]]).
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {rp \over 1-p}&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====

We derive the variance using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - (\operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;

We have already calculated E[''X''] above, so now we will calculate E[''X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''] and then return to this variance formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_i f(x_i) \cdot x^2

= \sum_{x=0}^\infin {x+r-1 \choose r-1} p^x (1-p)^r \cdot x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = 0+\sum_{x=1}^\infin {x+r-1 \choose r-1} p^x (1-p)^r x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_{x=1}^\infin {(x+r-1)! \over (r-1)!x!} p^x (1-p)^r x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {rp \over 1-p}\sum_{x=1}^\infin {(x+r-1)! \over r!(x-1)!} p^{x-1} (1-p)^{r+1} x&lt;/math&gt;
Again, let let ''s = r+1'' and ''w=x-1''.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {rp \over 1-p}\sum_{w=0}^\infin {(w+s-1)! \over (s-1)!w!} p^w (1-p)^s (w+1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {rp \over 1-p}\sum_{w=0}^\infin {w+s-1 \choose s-1} p^w (1-p)^s (w+1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {rp \over 1-p}\left[\sum_{w=0}^\infin {w+s-1 \choose s-1} p^w (1-p)^s w+\sum_{w=0}^\infin {w+s-1 \choose s-1} p^w (1-p)^s\right]&lt;/math&gt;
The first summation is the mean of a negative binomial random variable distributed NB(s,p) and the second summation is the complete sum of that variable's pmf.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {rp \over 1-p}\left[{sp \over 1-p}+1\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = {rp(1+rp) \over (1-p)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
We now insert values into the original variance formula.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = {rp(1+rp) \over (1-p)^2} - \left({rp \over 1-p}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = {rp \over (1-p)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called I Lie In The Shade. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name I Lie In The Shade~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

One way to add a realistic feeling to your 3d environment in a game engine is to create a skybox. A skybox is a large cube which has on its inside a projection of a 360&amp;deg; environment. When the player (camera) is inside this environment, the scene is rendered with the illusion of being inside a gigantic world. This is a similar effect to Quicktime VR (see http://fullscreenqtvr.com for examples). And, by setting up the skybox as a simple cube shape, you place the least amount of strain  on the graphics engine. It's a great advantage for your game with very little overhead.

This tutorial will show you how to create skyboxes relatively easily from panoramic photos. My favorite part is, you can do it easily using free tools such as Blender and the Gimp.

Using the Gimp to manipulate images is not really in the scope of this tutorial... check out some other page on using that software. You should have an understanding of how to edit images and apply alpha channels. (You could also use the Gimp to apply a polar coordinate texture to your rectangular image in order to create a fisheye image. Hint: it's not the sphereize filter.)

== Gather your graphics ==

You can take panoramic images yourself using a regular digital camera and a tripod. A quick way to accomplish this is to draw marks on your tripod base at every 30 degrees (think of the hours on a clock face). Make a single mark on the swivel of your tripod to allow you to line up your shots -- twelve shots at 30 degrees each. Then, using a program such as [http://www.gimp.org the Gimp] or the incredibly cool [http://www.autostitch.net Autostitch] to merge the photos into one big panorama. 

Or, if you're lazy like me, you can just grab photos online to use as templates to create original images. There are also many places you can download non-copyrighted photos for free as well. One resource for cloudy sky textures, as well as panoramic photography instructions, is Philippe Hurbain's site [http://www.philohome.com Philo's Home Page]. This tutorial will use a fisheye sky photo from his copyright-free Panoramic Skies images collection.

You'll also probably want a photo for your ground, unless you prefer to use real models such as buildings in your skybox. This [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Mountains_Out_Of_Molehills earlier chapter] on creating landscapes can be incorporated into setting up your skybox. However, this tutorial will use the sky photo for the top half of our world, and a panoramic landscape with an alpha channel for the bottom half. I've created a ground image using copyright-free textures obtained from [http://www.accustudio.com Accustudio].

Here are the images I'll be using (you'll want to use images with higher resolution):  Note that the sky has trees, etc.

[[Image:skybox_sky.png]]

[[Image:skybox_ground.png]]

Note: I've outlined the horizon of the ground texture with an alpha channel which will allow me to place the ground mesh right against the sky mesh with a very natural feel.

== Create a dome for the sky ==

Open a new file in Blender. Your default new file will probably be a two-unit cube in the center of the screen, with a single light source and a camera. You can delete the light source because we won't be needing it. Leave the cube, because that is what will become our skybox.

[[Image:Skybox tut1.png||skybox tutorial 1]]

The cube will be the center of our environment, so use Object-&gt;Snap-&gt;Cursor To Selection if your cursor is not centered. Then, from the top view [KEYPAD-7], Use [KEY-SPACEBAR] to insert a new mesh; make it a UV sphere. I find a 32-segment, 32-ring sphere to be sufficient. We create the sphere from the top view because that is the projection from which we want to add the sky texture.

[[Image:Skybox tut2.png||skybox tutorial 2]]

Scale up the sphere so it resembles a large &quot;arena&quot; in comparison to your cube, and select and delete the lower half of the vertices, using the front view [KEYPAD-1] and [KEY-B] to create a bounding box. It helps if &quot;Select Visible&quot; is turned off so you can select all of the vertices in one go.

[[Image:Skybox tut3.png||skybox tutorial 3]]

Turn on proportional editing with [KEY-O], then select the bottom row of vertices and scale them up with [KEY-S] so that the bottom of the sphere gets a bell shape. Because the projection of the sky texture will be from the Y-axis (ceiling) we need the bottom faces of the sphere to be at an angle, to catch the texture. (Faces perpendicular to the projection will look like smears.) Alter the influence of proportional editing with [KEY-PAGEUP] and [KEY-PAGEDOWN]. Linear or Sharp falloff works best with the sphere shape.

[[Image:Skybox tut4.png||skybox tutorial 4]]

Now you're ready to add your sky texture to this mesh. In the Materials menu, create a new material and a new texture. Be sure to set your material not to receive shadows by clicking the &quot;Shadeless&quot; button. Then, in the Texture menu, set the texture type to Image, and click the Load Image button to insert our sky texture. Back in the Materials-&gt;Texture-&gt;Map Input menu, you may need to scale your image to get rid of the distorted textures at the edges of the fisheye by setting the Size to, say, 0.950 for X, Y and Z.

[[Image:Skybox tut5.png||skybox tutorial 5]]
[[Image:Skybox tut6.png||skybox tutorial 6]]

At this point, if you wish, you can reposition the camera and render the scene to see how your sky mesh looks.

== Create a dome for the ground ==

I found it easiest to move the sky dome to a new layer with the [KEY-M] move to layer command. Then you can select the cube, Object-&gt;snap cursor to selection if you need to, select the top view [KEYPAD-7] and insert another UV sphere just as before -- except this time, remove the top hemisphere of vertices. I left an extra row of vertices at the &quot;equator&quot;, scaled up, to function as a &quot;billboard&quot; to display the horizon of our ground texture with the alpha channel. This sphere should be slightly smaller than the sky hemisphere.

[[Image:Skybox tut7.png||skybox tutorial 7]]

This time, I will apply the ground texture with a tube projection, so it is projected onto the mesh horizontally [Materials panel | Map Input tab | Tube button]. Because I have an alpha channel on this texture, I click &quot;Use Alpha&quot; in the Texture menu and Map To -&gt; both Col and Alpha buttons [Materials Panel | Map To Tab | -&gt; both Col and Alpha buttons]. You will also need to set ZTransp in the Mirror Transp menu [Materials Panel | Links and Pipelines Tab | ZTransp button] so that your alpha channel shows up in the envmap (which will become your skybox), and Alpha to 0 [Materials panel | Material tab | A slider ] to allow the masked areas to be transparent. (Alpha channels appear to require Z buffering to appear on procedural textures.) Also, you may need to adjust the offset of the ground texture (Y-axis), so that the horizon appears properly on the &quot;billboard&quot; area of your 
ground hemisphere.

[[Image:Skybox tut8.png||skybox tutorial 8]]
[[Image:Skybox tut9.png||skybox tutorial 9]]

Again, you can reposition the camera and render the scene to make sure everything is properly aligned. Be sure to activate the layer where you moved the sky mesh. Your results will look similar to the following image. Set OSA on in the render screen for best results. Also, use higher resolution images with cleaner alpha channels -- the image below is rather blurry and you can see a halo around the horizon.

[[Image:Skybox tut10.png||skybox tutorial 10]]

== Render the environment map ==

The last step is to use the procedural Envmap texture to project the dome textures onto the cube, which will become our skybox. Select the cube and create a new material. Set the material to &quot;Shadeless&quot; [Materials Panel | Materials Tab | Shadeless button]. Add a new texture and make its type Envmap. Set the CubeRes [Envmap tab | CubeRes setting ] to whatever you want the resolution of your skybox to be (512 is a good resolution for a game; 1024 or 2048 are fairly high-res; I stuck with low-res for this tutorial). If your sky &amp; ground hemispheres are very physically large, you may also need to increase the ClipEnd value to include all of the faces. You may want to set the Envmap calculation to Anim so you don't have to keep freeing envmap data if you're experimenting. (Anim automatically clears Envmap data with every render, otherwise you must click 'Free Data' to reset the Envmap.)

[[Image:Skybox tut11.png||skybox tutorial 11]]

Once you've created the Envmap texture, you should be ready to render the Envmap for your skybox. If you want to set your file format such as JPG or PNG, you should do that first. Then, simply go to the render screen and click &quot;Render.&quot; Again, make sure all layers are visible. The rendering window appears. First, Blender renders the environment map of the cube. Afterward, the camera view is rendered, at which point you can hit [KEY-ESCAPE] to stop rendering -- we are only interested in the environment map which is already complete.

Select the cube again, then get to its texture menu. You will see the newly-rendered Envmap on the sample texture. Click &quot;Save EnvMap&quot; in the texture menu to save the rendered Envmap.

[[Image:Skybox tut12.png||skybox tutorial 12]]

Blender environment maps are saved as a 3x2 matrix of squares, as seen here:

[[Image:Skybox tut13.png||skybox tutorial 13]]

The cube faces are in the following order.

[[Image:Blender env order.png||skybox tutorial 13]]

You can now load this image as an envmap texture in a new cube, which you can incorporate into your game as a skybox. This file can also be edited in the Gimp to remove any unwelcome artifacts such as trees, buildings, jet trails, etc. Also, because I used a tube projection on the lower hemisphere, in the bottom face of the envmap you see a strange star shape at the &quot;pole.&quot; You'll most likely have a floor in your game, so you probably won't see that face anyway, but sticklers can avoid it with clever use of the Filters-&gt;Distorts-&gt;Polar Coords filter in the Gimp or Filter-&gt;Distort-&gt;Polar Coordinates (Polar to Rect.) in Photoshop. Patching also works well.

To make the skybox appear as a static background in your game, vertex-parent it to the current active camera object.

== Let your hair hang down ==


To learn how to make '''fur or hair''', click on the link below and scroll to the bottom. It is the last tutorial.

Or...

Example of sphere with fur-like particles


== Creating Fur in Blender 2.40 ==
''Tyaedalis, twentytortures''

First off, select the object you want to be furry. Do this in Object Mode. (You don't have to duplicate the mesh any more!) For this tutorial we'll use a UV sphere with 32 rings and 32 segments. Then, go to the &quot;Object&quot; tab ('''F7'''), and click on the &quot;'''Physics'''&quot; tab ''(to the right, on the button window menu bar)''.  (Or Press '''F7''' repeatedly to &quot;cycle&quot; between the '''Object''' and '''Physics''' ''SubPanels'')

[[Image:Physicstab2.4.jpg|Physics Tab]]&lt;br&gt;
''Blender Physics Tab''

Under the &quot;Particles&quot; palette, click on &quot;'''NEW'''&quot;.  ''For best results you should be in object mode.'' 

A bunch of things will pop up in place of that &quot;New&quot; button.  Several things are important for the creation of hair/fur.  The most important are:&lt;br&gt;
* Static - makes particles static
'''Emit'''
* Amount - amount of particles to draw
* Step - don't draw redundant particles
* Life - how far/long particles go
* Display - percentage of particles displayed in viewport
'''Display:'''
* Vect - makes particles look like strands
* Mesh - renders the mesh
'''From:'''
* Verts - draw particles from vertices
* Faces - draw particles from faces
* Rand - draw particles randomly
* Even - draw particles evenly

[[Image:Bntpfurry1.jpg|Particles Palette]]&lt;br&gt;
'''The &quot;Particles&quot; palette'''



'''And under the &quot;Particle Motion&quot; palette:'''&lt;br&gt;
'''Velocity:'''
* Normal - length of hair
* Random - randomizes direction/size
'''Force'''
* And the &quot;Z&quot; (or possibly X or Y, depending on the result you want.)under &quot;Force&quot; - simulates a force

[[Image:Bntpfurry2.jpg|Particle Motion]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Particle Motion'''


Anyway, back on the &quot;Particles&quot; palette, push &quot;'''Static'''&quot; and then &quot;'''Animated'''&quot; if you want it to be in an animation.  Then in the &quot;'''Display'''&quot; section push &quot;'''Vect'''&quot; so that the particles look like strands in your viewport. If you push &quot;'''Mesh'''&quot;, then your mesh will be visible as well as your hair when you render. 

'''User Note''' - For those who are using a newer version of blender, there will not be a static button. Instead, change the particle system type to hair. To give them length, go to global effects and change the acceleration(acc) variables.

Under the &quot;'''Emit'''&quot; section, increase the amount of particles to about 20 thousand or so. We want a really furry sphere. You can leave &quot;'''Step'''&quot; at its default value of 5. Life is 50 by default. I find I get better results when I decrease this number to 10 or so. It is very important that you decrease the &quot;'''Disp'''&quot; number. It by default says 100. This means that 100% of the particles are visible in your viewport. You could leave it at 100 if you have a really powerful computer, but for those of us who don't, we'll want to turn it down. I like mine around 20% or so. It leaves enough particles visible to be able to imagine the final product but it also increases my computer's performance.

In the &quot;'''From'''&quot; section there are some buttons that have some importance. &quot;'''Verts'''&quot; and &quot;'''Faces'''&quot; are the areas where your particles are drawn from. &quot;'''Rand'''&quot; and &quot;'''Even'''&quot; are how your particles are drawn. I find that clicking even is important because it displays all the hair evenly around your object.

Afterwards, in the &quot;'''Particle Motion'''&quot; palette, under the &quot;'''Velocity'''&quot; section, adjust the &quot;'''Normal'''&quot; value until the hair is as long as you like, if we left the &quot;'''Life'''&quot; at 50 then we would have extremely long hair even though our normal value would be .01.  Increase the '''randomness''' value for added realism. ''(Not too much, though!)''  Then, make the value of &quot;Z&quot; under &quot;'''Force'''&quot; somewhere around -0.02. This will simulate the hair falling down because of gravity.

[[Image:Bntpfurry3.jpg|Results]]&lt;br&gt;
Isn't it cool what you can make in so little time?

==Strands Material Settings==
In the &quot;'''Materials'''&quot; tab, there are some options specific to this type of particle. These can be accessed with the &quot;'''Strands'''&quot; button, under the &quot;'''Render Pipeline'''&quot; heading in the &quot;'''Links and Pipeline'''&quot; tab.

The &quot;'''Start'''&quot; parameter sets the width of the fur at the base of the particle (from the vertex or face where it originally spawned). &quot;'''End'''&quot; is the width at the other end of the fur, so in general this should be smaller than &quot;'''Start'''&quot;.

The ''Shape'' option controls how the width of the fur changes, between these two points. A lower value will result in the width of the middle being closer to the width at the end than at the start.

[[Image:Bntpfurry4.jpg|Strands]]&lt;br&gt;

Good hair and fur material will often be partially transparent, lower the value of the ''A'' underneath the colours in ''Material'' tab, and be sure to set the ''ZTransp'' option in the Render Pipeline options, it's above the strands button. Using Raytraced Transparency limits the number of strands deep you can see in the render.

Blender 2.42 also adds a new preview type useful for working on strands, the 5th button from the top on the ''Preview'' tab will draw a collection of Hair strands using your material settings.

Using my sphere from the previous section, I'll show you how to make the fur look real neat with Blender's default textures. I'm not going to go into too much detail about how to add textures and stuff because that should be covered in other tutorials.

I'm first going to play around with the &quot;'''Blend'''&quot; texture type. Using the textures colorband settings, I made it fade from red to green to transparent black. 

Under the &quot;'''Map Input'''&quot; section under the &quot;'''Materials'''&quot; tabs, I clicked the &quot;'''Strand'''&quot; button. This will make the texture follow the strands, neat eh?

[[Image:Bntpfurry5.jpg|Map Input]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Bntpfurry6.jpg|Preview]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Bntpfurry7.jpg|Results]]&lt;br&gt;

If I select the default &quot;'''Orco'''&quot; button then we get different results.

[[Image:Bntpfurry8.jpg|More Results]]&lt;br&gt;

There are all sorts of things that can be done with the default textures! Just play around a bit, it's the best way to learn how to use the particle system.

==Curve Guides==
Strands can be affected by Blender's Fields simulation. The controls can be accessed from the Physics Buttons (First select '''Object''' or press F7 until the Physics Buttons appear). There is a combo box labeled ''fields'' on the ''Fields and Deflection'' tab.

Although hair and fur can be affected by any of these fields types (except ''none'' of course), you will find the ''Curve Guide'' option most useful. Before using it though, you will need to create a path for your curves to follow.

So, to give your furball a pony tail, first create a curve that you want the fur to follow.
Do this by selecting ''Add-&gt;Curve-&gt;Path'' from the main menu. Editing the vertices in a curve is just like editing the vertices in a mesh object. You can extrude a path from a vertex on either end. Make sure one end of the path is in the base of the hair you want to be affected by the curve.

When you have your curve the way you want, exit edit mode and set the fields type to ''Curve Guide''. You can then change the radius that your curve guide will affect. If it won't pick up the hair that is in this radius, and drag it along the path, your curve may be the wrong way round. To fix this, enter edit mode again. You will need to select your curve (use ''a'' to select all vertices) and hit ''w'' to get the specials menu. Then select switch direction. Your curve should now be affecting the hair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before I do exponential amouts of damage to the [[Puzzles:Chess problems|Chess problems]] section, what do you think a &quot;non-pathologically meaningless title&quot; for [[Puzzles:Chess_problems:Chess_directmates:Fourteen-move_chess_directmate_1]] and similar pages in that section be? --[[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] 20:08, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

: That title isn't too bad by itself, though I'd be inclined to make it a little less redundant.  Maybe [[Puzzles:Chess problems:Directmates:Fourteen-move directmate 1]].  Hmm.... -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 10:29, 4 November 2005 (UTC)


: I see you've started moving them around a bit.  Just a small suggestion: I tend to do it top-down.  That is, first move section pages, starting with those at the highest level, before moving the individual puzzle and solution pages within them.  That way, it will be quick and easy to update the navigation header while at each one.  True, there are also links from the section pages to the puzzles to update, but updating these later will be a little easier as there are fewer pages to update them on. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:54, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks for the suggestion, will implement. --[[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] 01:16, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

== Re: Puzzles ==

Sorry, I didn't look up Puzzles talk page. I moved these pages because they were hanging in main namespace and were quite confusing to me at recent changes I patrol. I don't have time to help with this book, but when I meet further chapters of Puzzles book I will name them correctly. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:16, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for your work on moving the puzzle books. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

: I see you are doing hard job moving all these pages. I think you would like to see such things done automatically in the future. Please, sign your support vote at [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Naming convention bot]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:31, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

== tsca.bot ==

If you have any technical issues, please ask tsca - i'm neither bot author not bot operator. I'm not particularly interested in how bot works - because I know that it just works from my experience (I saw its contributions at sister projects). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:00, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:Hello. I am working on it. Quite a lot has been done already. However, I must clarify one thing: the bot is supposed to do '''mass''' changes. It doesn't pay to program the bot to edit just one page or to understand all possible inconsistent spellings of one title - such single fixes are better and faster done by hand.
:So, if there are, say, 30 pages to rename, the bot can move the 28 regular links, but the 2 links whose names do not fit the pattern will have to be moved by hand.
:In general, your request is nicely documented, but it is not exactly how requests are made. You basically asked me to take part in the concept work and do research. I cannot afford to do that, since I am working on several projects and lack the time. Normally requests for the bot are on a lower level, eg: &quot;all pages linking to [x] must be renamed to [y:title]&quot;, or &quot;all links to [d] must be changed to link to [g] instead&quot; - and it only makes sense to ask for a bot if there are more than 10 edits per change to be made. Your request requires more human than automated work. [[user:tsca|tsca]] [[user talk:tsca|✉]] 13:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

:: Thank you.  Since I had had no answer on how your bot works, I just proceeded to write a specification of an algorithm by which the work could be done.  What &quot;concept work&quot; or &quot;research&quot; are you claiming I was asking you to do exactly?  I just wrote an algorithm that I believed to be well-defined and implementable straight out of the box.  I also did a few manual tweaks before asking you to run the bot, e.g. on [[Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles]] changing the link text of &quot;Hotel refund&quot; to &quot;Hotel Refund&quot; and other similar cases, with the expectation that it would tell your bot that the new title of the linked-to page should be [[Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles:Hotel Refund]] as per the spec, not [[Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles:Hotel refund]].  Did you misread this bit of the spec, or decide that this detail wasn't implementable under the constraints?  If the latter, then why didn't you tell me sooner?

:: If the spec was too complicated for you to have time to implement, then we could maybe have found someone else who was willing to program a bot to do it.  However, I'm not asking you and your bot to abandon the task right now - while it isn't perfect, at least it's getting some things right, and the page titles it is generating are no worse than the ones we had before. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:23, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

Frankly, I don't see the bit about capitalising the second part of the title (I saw the one about capitalising &quot;Solution&quot;, which I did). About the naming of the &quot;chess&quot; pages: I see your point (although your example of ''Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles:'' doesn't suggest avoiding repetitions). 
* About the chess pages: how do you want to rename ''Puzzles:Chess problems:Chess directmates:Two-move chess directmate'':
** → Puzzles:Chess problems:Directmates:Two-move chess directmate ?
** → Puzzles:Chess problems:Directmates:Two-move ?
* &quot;Pass 2: Tidying up the pages&quot; - let's wait with that until we've finished pass 1
* For instant communication, I am usually available on jabber: tsca@jabber.gda.pl and irc: [irc://chat.freenode.net/wikislownik #wikislownik @ chat.freenode.net]. Or the talk pages, of course.
* Shouldn't we add categories as well?
* As said above: if there's just one sub-sub page to move, let's do that manually
[[user:tsca|tsca]] [[user talk:tsca|✉]] 19:43, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

: It's not just capitalisation - that was just an example.  What made me wince is that it changed &quot;Luxury Cars - Puzzle&quot; to &quot;Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles:Luxury Cars - Puzzle&quot; rather than just &quot;[[Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles:Luxury Cars]]&quot; as it would have been if the link text had been honoured as per my spec.  The naming I had thought of using for the chess problems is &quot;Puzzles:Chess problems:Directmates:Two-move directmate ?&quot;.  That way, the title is not too bloated while still looking right to the average human reader.  But anyway.... -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 21:02, 10 February 2006 (UTC)


== Wikibooks is not a paper puzzle book? ==
I am new to Wikibooks but not wikipedia.  I read [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Two Boys and a River|Puzzles:Logic_puzzles:Two_Boys_and_a_River]] and was going to leave an alternative solution after seeing alternitive solutions on the other puzles in [[Puzzles:Lateral_puzzles]].  I created a Username and just checked out [[User_talk:62.49.166.122]] who had left a coment on the talk page with another solution.  your explanation of &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;Wikibooks is not a paper puzzle book&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; dosn't make sence to me because [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Search?ns0=1&amp;ns1=1&amp;ns2=1&amp;ns3=1&amp;ns4=1&amp;ns5=1&amp;ns6=1&amp;ns7=1&amp;ns8=1&amp;ns9=1&amp;ns10=1&amp;ns11=1&amp;ns12=1&amp;ns13=1&amp;ns14=1&amp;ns15=1&amp;ns102=1&amp;ns103=1&amp;search=Wikibooks+is+not+a+paper+puzzle+book&amp;fulltext=Search a search] only brings up your post on this policy.  Could you please link to the policy page.  All the Warnings on Wipidia all have links to the conected policy.  Sorry if i am asking wrong but could you please link to this policy beose i asumed a WikiBook would be like Wikipidia in that all the users are colaberating to make the document better.  Unless your post was on another coment that user made in that case i am sorry and it is apropeat to post alternive solutions on a talk page.--[[User:Yskyflyer|Yskyflyer]] 05:49, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

:As for [[User talk:smjg#Wikibooks is not a paper puzzle book?|your comment]], you miss the point.  If you have a paper puzzle book that you bought from the newsagent, then if you're like many of us then you would solve the puzzles by writing/drawing on them in the book.  On Wikibooks, where one copy is shared by everyone, solving them by writing on the puzzles themselves is nothing but vandalism.  You are of course welcome to contribute solutions to the puzzles.  My point is that this is to be done on the '''solution''' page, not on the '''puzzle''' page.

I wasn't quoting a Wikibooks policy.  I was pointing out what follows directly from:
* the nature of Wikibooks and the Puzzles wikibook
* the existing structure of the Puzzles wikibook
* common sense
Even if what I was describing an official Wikibooks policy, I don't have to have quoted it word for word, do I? -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 11:37, 29 March 2006 (UTC)


::Thanks I probably saw one coment the other user made and asumed that was the one you were talking about.

== RE:  You've been thinking ''too'' fast ==

I'm sorry.  I didn't know I was altering things that were important to the discussion of the naming policy.  I was just altering the links so they would point to articles and not the redirects which I created that night.

I agree that I was thinking too fast.  I should have remember what [[w:John Wooden|John Wooden]] said:  &quot;Be quick—but don't hurry.&quot; --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 02:40, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|the Weasleys]]' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|home]] and is introduced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]], the two oldest Weasley brothers. Charlie works with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragons]] in Romania, while Bill, a one-time [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Head Boy|Head Boy]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] who now works for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in Egypt, is a surprise: he sports a pony tail, an earring (with what looks like a fang), and Dragon-hide boots.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] are having a row with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|their father]] over them dropping a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ton-Tongue Toffee|Ton-Tongue Toffee]], apparently deliberately, and causing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Harry's cousin Dudley's]] tongue to grow several feet long. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] enters the argument, demanding to know if it had anything to do with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] enter the room behind Mrs. Weasley; Hermione, to avoid the family argument, suggests they show Harry where he is sleeping.

On the way to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s bedroom, Ron and Hermione explain to Harry about &quot;Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes&quot;, which are magical tricks and jokes the Twins have invented. What they just escaped was an ongoing battle: Mrs. Weasley wants the Twins to work for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], but they want to open their own joke shop.

Ron's room is much the same as it was two years ago, except for his new owl, given to him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], which is bouncing excitedly in its cage. Ginny named it [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]], which Ron often shortens to &quot;Pig.&quot;

When the fight between Mrs. Weasley and the Twins has apparently ended, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny return to the kitchen, where they catch a small rant about Fred and George from Mrs. Weasley while she prepares dinner. Outside, Charlie and Bill are jousting with the picnic tables and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] is chasing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|Gnomes]]. As evening falls, the Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione enjoy a lovely dinner in the garden, with home-made strawberry ice cream for dessert. Conversation at the table ranges widely, covering the upcoming [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], Bill's personal appearance, Sirius Black's whereabouts, a missing Ministry Witch named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], and a top secret event that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] mentions in apparent hopes that someone will ask him about it, so he can enhance his own importance by refusing to tell them about it.

== Analysis ==

The story is only advanced slightly in this chapter. Much time is devoted to reintroducing the Burrow's atmosphere, the Weasley family home, and contrasting its somewhat grubby friendliness with the Dursley household's overly antiseptic aloofness. This is also the first time the entire Weasley clan has been seen together, and the differences between the seven siblings are evident. The more Bohemian and unconventional Bill and Charlie, displaying an irreverent sense of humor similar to the Twins when they are seen dueling each other with the picnic tables, are a stark contrast to the authoritarian Percy, whose starchy and bossy personality irritates his siblings. Ron is neither rowdy nor sedate and usually feels overwhelmed and intimidated by his talented older brothers. Ginny, being the youngest and the only girl, is able to develop her own magical abilities and strong-willed persona despite from her doting and protective family, though she may feel slightly isolated being the only female child.

Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes is introduced. The Twins are planning to open their own joke shop after leaving Hogwarts, although Mrs. Weasley, who constantly chastises them for wasting time with their incessant pranks, strongly disapproves. Failing to recognize their unique magical talents and entrepreneurial abilities, she instead wants them to pursue more conventional and secure occupations. For American and international readers, it should be noted that a &quot;wheeze&quot; in England can be a joke; the idea is that you laugh so hard it leaves you wheezing.

There is independent confirmation regarding some events in Harry's &quot;dream&quot; from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|Chapter 1]] as well: specifically, that Bertha Jorkins, a Witch who works for the Ministry of Magic, has unexpectedly not yet returned from a vacation in Albania. Bertha appeared in Harry's dream, even if Harry is unable to remember it; and Albania has been mentioned before in conjunction with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]. This is an indication that Voldemort is alive as a separate entity, and that, as predicted, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] has returned to his service.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
#Why does Ron feel overwhelmed by his brothers, while Ginny apparently does not?
#What secret might Percy be hinting at? Why does no one want to ask him about it?
#Why is Mr. Weasley so angry about the Twin's prank?
#Why might Bertha Jorkins be missing? Is anyone actually concerned? Explain.

=== Further Study ===
# It is only two days since Harry's &quot;dream&quot;, and Bertha Jorkins' name, mentioned in that dream, has just come up in a conversation that she was in Albania and is now missing. Recalling the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] sources say that Voldemort is hiding in Albania. Why might Harry not have recalled his &quot;dream&quot;, with so much prompting?
# Why is Mrs. Weasley so strongly opposed to the Twins opening their own joke shop? Would working for the Ministry of Magic, as she wants them to, be a good career option for them? Explain.
# Why does Mrs. Weasley object to Bill's appearance?
# Compare and contrast the Weasley children's personalities. How does Ron compare to his siblings?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The dinner table conversation is intriguing in that it foreshadows events in this book, and, to a certain extent, later books.

Mrs. Weasley's ongoing battle with Bill over his long hair will continue until he cuts it for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|his wedding]] in book 7. Harry suspects at that time, though, that once Bill is safely out of Mrs. Weasley's range, his hair will be long again.

Percy, meanwhile, is apparently &quot;hiding&quot; some secret, though he seems to be hoping that someone will ask about what he is hinting at, only so he can inflate his own status by refusing to answer. It is revealed later that several characters at the table already know the secret, specifically, Mrs. Weasley, Charlie, and Bill. We can safely assume that it was Mr. Weasley who provided them this information, as we find out later it came from the Ministry. It is interesting to contrast how Percy handles this confidential information with how his family members do. The secret in question is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], a dangerous competition that is being revived after many years. It will form the axis on which the entire book turns, ensnaring Harry in a dangerous plot.

The conversation about Bertha Jorkins, as mentioned, somewhat confirms to us that Harry's dream actually reflected real events. Pettigrew, we will learn, brought Bertha to Albania, where she was then murdered by Voldemort. Before being killed, she revealed information about the Tournament to Voldemort, while also revealing that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], a fanatically devout [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] had escaped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. Bertha further revealed that authorities believed Barty was dead, where he was hiding, and what would be necessary to make him available to execute Voldemort's plan to capture Harry.

Sirius is some distance away. As mentioned, his last few messages were delivered by tropical birds. Harry has sent him a note about his scar hurting, and as soon as he receives it, Sirius will return to England, much against Harry's wishes. Sirius' actual location, though, remains unknown until he arranges to meet with the Trio outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade village]].

The Twins' joke shop will be in full operation by Harry's sixth year. It has been mentioned that each twin earns only a handful of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWLs]] (later revealed to be three apiece), but throughout this book and the next, we will see that the Twins are extremely deft practical Wizards, creating and selling magical materials of amazing quality. In fact, some of their magical wares are so good that the Ministry buys them to protect their less-able Wizards. Harry, Ron, and Hermione will also make significant use of their wares throughout the later part of the series.

=== Connections ===
* Bill's hair will be the despair of Mrs. Weasley, as it has been for so many other mothers of long-haired boys, throughout this visit. She will not comment on it during her visit to Hogwarts with Bill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 31|later in this book]], possibly because she is present to see Harry compete in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], but she will convince Bill to cut his hair for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|his wedding in the seventh book]].
* While we first saw original magical artifacts created by the Twins in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 4|previous chapter]], we now find out that these are to be the basis of their chosen career, innovators in the magical jokes field. The process of financing the start-up of their joke shop, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], will be a subplot throughout this book, and testing of products for that shop will be a subplot in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|the next book]], as well as something of a bone of contention between the Twins and Hermione. The shop itself will be launched, and we will see it [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 6|in the following book]],  at which time we will learn that some of the Weasley products are in use by the Ministry in the battle against Dark wizards.</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

It is far too early the next morning when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is awakened by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]. He, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]] are traveling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]], while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]] will meet them there. Fred and George wanted to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] like the older boys, but they are not licensed yet, and without training, they would probably get ''splinched''—leaving parts of themselves behind. Ginny and Hermione complain about the early hour, but Mr. Weasley explains they have a bit of a walk ahead. Harry wonders if they are walking to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. Mr. Weasley starts to explain, but Mrs. Weasley, who has discovered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ton-Tongue Toffee|Ton-Tongue Toffees]] hidden in George's pockets, interrupts. She confiscates all the hidden toffees in the Twins' pockets and cuffs with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|&quot;Accio&quot; charm]]. 

Mrs. Weasley, who is staying behind, remains in a bad humour, and neither she not the twins speak to each other before the twins shoulder their bags and stride off.

During the chilly morning walk, Mr. Weasley explains the huge logistical problem in locating a site for approximately one hundred thousand wizards to gather. The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] created a stadium in the backwoods, charming it to look unappealing to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]]. Transporting so many people without being noticed was also a problem, so the Ministry has arranged for wizards to arrive at camp sites around the stadium over several weeks, with those getting cheaper tickets arriving earlier and staying longer. Additionally, two hundred [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]] have been located around Britain for those who cannot or will not Apparate. They are using the one at Stoatshead Hill.

At Stoatshead Hill, they meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|his father, Amos]]. Mr. Diggory makes a big fuss over his son being the Seeker in the only Quidditch match in which Harry's team was beaten [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 9|the previous year]], though Cedric is more modest. Mr. Diggory mentions that the Lovegoods have already left, and the Fawcetts were unable to get tickets. Mr. Weasley checks his watch and has everyone hold onto an old boot. As the countdown reaches zero, Harry feels himself being yanked rapidly through the air, landing hard on the ground. A voice says &quot;Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill.&quot;

== Analysis ==

While the Quidditch World Cup may seem more like an interesting and fun diversion to open the story, its importance in introducing a critical and ongoing theme, mutual cooperation, cannot be overemphasized. The World Cup is far more than a mere sporting event&amp;mdash;it is a means to unite wizards from many countries. Organizing such a huge international event is a massive venture, requiring extensive planning, collaboration, and coordination among the world's magical populations. It is probably the most difficult wizard undertaking to be kept hidden from Muggles, though, as will be seen, there are occasional security leaks. And while there are the usual rivalries among the teams and fans, it is the commonly shared passion for the sport that bonds the magical community together in a peaceful setting that helps build lasting global recognition, understanding, and harmony. Harry relishes this experience, yet he still fails to realize that if [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is to be defeated, it must be accomplished through a similarly united effort, rather than by one person alone. 

More is learned here about Cedric Diggory, who was introduced in the previous book and will play a significant role in this one. Cedric, a Hufflepuff, strongly believes in honesty and fairness, to such an extent that he offered to replay the Quidditch match against Gryffindor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 9|(in the previous book)]]; he felt Hufflepuff's win was invalid because the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] interfered. His strong ethical sense will play a strong role throughout the story. We can already see differences between Cedric and his father, Amos, and it may be interesting to compare their personalities. It is possible that Cedric and Amos are intended as a contrast to Harry's feelings about his own father, James. Cedric and Amos are quite different people; though both are competitive, Cedric steadfastly believes that virtue and fair competition are paramount, while Amos shades more towards the Slytherin view that advantages are to be taken. Harry should be able to observe here that fathers and sons can be quite different from one another, but, very soon, he will fail to apply this lesson to himself.

We are also shown the Accio spell, which is used for summoning items. Harry may find this particularly useful later on, and it is likely to be used repeatedly throughout the series.

It is Rowling's attention to detail that helps make the Harry Potter books such an intriguing adventure. One hundred thousand wizards are expected to attend the World Cup. Exactly how do so many people travel to such an event without alarming Muggles or revealing the Wizarding world's existence? Harry's introduction to the Portkey demonstrates one way wizards are transported, though, as readers have seen, there are other methods, each with its own limitations. The author's explanation as to how this particular logistical puzzle is managed, while not critical to the storyline here, shows she understands her characters' needs and makes the story more complex, textured, and believable.

We will note that the number of wizards expected for this event can lead us to some conclusions about the wizard population of the world. There is some speculation [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#School population|in the article on Hogwarts]] about the population of the school and what this means about the number of wizards in the world. In that article, we speculate that the number of wizards worldwide could be either about three hundred thousand, or one million, based on the assumptions we choose. If we are expecting a hundred thousand wizards at this event, a world total population of only three times that seems an unreasonably large attendance rate at any single event; that a solid one third of all the wizards in the entire world would attend seems unlikely in the extreme, particularly given that approximately half of them would be arriving a week or more early, and staying a week or more after the end of the event, based on what Mr. Weasley tells us. The commerce of the Wizarding world would be severely upset by such a mass exodus. Attendance by one tenth of a world Wizarding population of one million is still alarmingly high, but seems less likely to cause an economic failure.

We will further note that in the Muggle world, as of 2012, there are only eleven stadiums capable of holding 100,000 spectators, six of which are in the United States.

Readers should, perhaps, make a mental note regarding how Portkeys work, as they are also quite likely to be seen again.

The Lovegood and Fawcett families are mentioned here, though not actually seen. The author often introduces characters, objects, or places by name prior to their actual appearance, often several books before. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] was merely mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] before appearing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], playing a crucial role. Rowling may want readers to have an early indication that some seemingly insignificant characters may become important later in the storyline.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The Portkey, which Wizards use to travel from one location to another, becomes a device that will unexpectedly transport Harry and Cedric Diggory into a deadly situation. Creating Portkeys is apparently regulated by the Ministry. Perhaps this is why Portkeys are only used seven times in the entire series: four times in this book (to the World Cup and back, and to the cemetery and back), twice in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] (from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s office to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]], and from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] to Dumbledore's office), and once in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]] (from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Tonks]]' house to The Burrow &amp;ndash; though apparently there are five or six other unseen Portkeys in use in that last episode). The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]] and Disapparating seem to be more common transportation methods, though, as Mr. Weasley points out, many Wizards avoid Disapparating because Splinching is an inherent risk.

Based on nothing more than the name, we assume that &quot;the Lovegoods&quot; mentioned in this chapter refer to characters which we will see in future books. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], the Trio's rather odd schoolmate and future fellow [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] member, will be introduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. The family also includes Luna's widowed father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]], who appears in the final book. The Lovegoods will be invited to Bill Weasley and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour's]] wedding, which will play a significant part in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. Both characters play important roles in that book. Mention in this chapter is apparently intended to indicate that the Lovegood household is within walking distance of Stoatshead Hill, and thus within range of the Burrow; this point will prove important in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 20|the final book]], as it will mean that Ron knows where to find his home.

The Fawcett family plays no particular role in the book, though there is a student, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawcett|identified only as Fawcett]], who has a small part in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']].

=== Connections ===
* Mention of the Lovegoods here establishes that their home, like the Fawcetts' and the Diggorys', is within walking distance of The Burrow. When discussion with Xeno Lovegood becomes necessary in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', it is only because of this physical closeness that Ron is able to find the Lovegood home. This careful mention of the Lovegood family at this point indicates that the plot was at least well enough developed to require the existence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']], and its anti-Ministry stance, in future books. It also suggests that the author had already determined that this would result in Harry's needing to visit Xeno in the final book.</text>

== Starting the Apache web server ==
Using Mac OS X as a web server is easier than you might think.  The reason for this is that Mac OS X is shipped with the powerful and widely used [http://www.apache.org/ Apache] web server software built right in.

To begin, open Applications &gt; System Preferences (look for it in the Dock) and go to the ''Sharing'' pane. Under the Services tab, check ''Personal Web Sharing'' or select it and click Start.  The Apache web server should now be running and will automatically start everytime your computer boots unless you change the settings in the System Preferences.

Because Apache runs as a background service or ''daemon'' and not a normal application, it won't appear as an item in the Dock when it's running.

== Setting up your web pages ==
Open a web browser - like Safari - and type in &lt;tt&gt;localhost&lt;/tt&gt; in the address bar. You should see a page that says something along the lines of &quot;Seeing this instead of the website you expected?&quot;  This message is the default page that the Apache web server will show when it's first installed.  It means that Apache is configured and working correctly and that you're ready to put your site up!

Naturally, you don't want people to see the default homepage when they go to your web site, you want them to see ''your'' own web page.  To do this, open a Finder window and go to /Library/WebServer/Documents/.  You should see a group of HTML and image files including one called &lt;tt&gt;index.html&lt;/tt&gt;.  These files are used in the default Apache page you just viewed.

You can delete these files (or put them somewhere else if you want) and you'll then be ready to put your own web pages in this folder.  When you've put your own HTML and image files into the /Library/WebServer/Documents/ folder, go back to &lt;tt&gt;localhost&lt;/tt&gt; in your browser and refresh the page.  You should now see your web pages instead of the default Apache one.  Give yourself a pat on the back, you have now established a web server!  However, you are not quite done yet...

== Giving others access to your web site ==
Now you've got your web server set up, you need to give people an address to visit your web site.

This part of the tutorial assumes that your computer is connected directly to the internet and isn't behind a firewall or connected using a network hub or DSL router.  If your computer is connected through a router, you may need to consult the manual that came with it to enable ''port forwarding'' a facility that allows your Apache web server to send data to the internet via the router.  The built in Mac OS X firewall automatically allows Apache to send web pages to the internet but other firewall software may differ.

If your computer ''is'' connected directly to the internet, you could just give people the IP address of your computer which you can find out using [http://www.whatismyip.org WhatIsMyIP] but there can be problems with doing this...

The problems start because most internet service providers (ISPs) give their home user's computers a new dynamic IP address each time they connect to the internet.  The IP address is used to identify each individual computer on the internet.  This means that as your computer's unique IP address changes, the corresponding address of your website will change and therefore any links and bookmarks to your site will stop working!

Fortunately there's a solution to this problem called [http://www.dyndns.org/ DynDNS], a service that forwards visitors to a web address of your choice (URL) to your dynamic IP address.  All you have to do is register with DynDNS, download the Mac OS X client program, set it up and it will automatically update your DynDNS account with your IP address whenever it changes.

If you are lucky enough to have a static IP (which doesn't ever change) then you won't need a DynDNS account, but you might want to buy a domain name so people don't have to type in a number to visit your page.  DynDNS also offers you free domain names for static IPs.

Once you're set up with DynDNS, you can get to your website by typing in the domain name you chose to use with them (note sometimes, the DynDNS service takes a while to update when you first set up your account).

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Apache isn't running ===

If you can't see pages on your web server from your own computer, check that Apache is running.  In the Finder, open the menu Go &gt; Utilities and open the ''Activity Monitor'' application.  In the window that appears, look for an item in the list of running processes called ''httpd''.  This is the Apache web server and if its missing from the list, Apache isn't running.

To start Apache, you can either turn on ''Web sharing'' in the ''Sharing'' pane of the System Preferences or go into the Terminal and type &lt;tt&gt;sudo apachectl restart&lt;/tt&gt; followed by your password when prompted for it.

=== Can't access your site from your own computer ===

If Apache is running and you can't see your website from the Mac it's running on, check that the address bar says either &lt;nowiki&gt;http://127.0.0.1/&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  If it does, check that you have put some files into your Apache web sites folder.

=== Can't access your website from the internet ===

If Apache is running but you can't see your website from a computer outside your network or by typing in a DynDNS address, there may be a network problem preventing computers outside your network from connecting to your Mac.  Check your router to see if port forwarding is enabled and configured correctly.

If you still can't get to your website from outside your home network, If it is enabled, check that your ISP allows you to operate webservers on their network.  Some ISPs block TCP/IP port 80 which is used for the HTTP protocol used by web servers and browsers.  If this port is blocked, then you will have to use dyndns or no-ip.com to bypass port 80 and use another port such as 8080. This need to configure your apache too.

== Web pages for multiple users ==

If you have more than one user set up on your Mac OS X computer, you may be interested to know that each of these users can have their own web site as well.  You might have noticed that every user on Mac OS X has a folder in their home directory called ''Sites''.

HTML and other web page files you put into this folder can be viewed by opening the URL  &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost/~username/&lt;/nowiki&gt; in a web browser where ''username'' is the shorthand version of your Mac OS X user account name (the name of your home folder in the Finder).

== Security Considerations ==
There are some important issues to consider if your Mac hosts a webserver exposed to the internet.  This is especially true if you use scripts (like perl, PHP, JSP, etc.)  It's worth taking the time to get informed.  Also, if you don't know what you're doing, do not attempt to configure Apache manually.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can edit and contribute to most wiki projects, including this one.  If you've got something useful, please contribute, even if you can't spel, or you don't know how to format to match the rest of the site--The information is the most important, someone else can (and probably will) fix errors or formatting. 

If you have an idea, think of a good title for your contribution.  Click on the &quot;edit&quot; tab of the [[Budget Watch Collecting]] title pages, or the most appropriate sub-section, and add your title like this:

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Budget Watch Collecting/your title]]


Then click save.  You'll be on the page you just added your title, which should show up in red.  (If it is blue, you've picked an already-used title, so go back and make it more specific).  Click on the red link you just created--That will take you to the edit page where you can add your text. 


The square brackets are how you link to any wikibooks page.  To add a link to an outside webpage, use single square brackets, the URL, a space, then the clickable text you want.
  
[http://www.google.com The best search engine]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

becomes

A note about pictures

Wikibooks doesn't allow outside pictures, so you MUST upload pictures by clicking on the &quot;upload file&quot; link in the sidebar.  Pictures must be either public domain, or under a Wikimedia compatible license.  Picture names must be unique within the entire Wiki project--If you try to upload a file with a &quot;used&quot; name, you'll get a warning message asking if you want to replace the already existing file.  

To use a picture once it has been uploaded (or any existing Wikibooks or Wiki Commons picture) use the format

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:BudgetWatchesMovement231.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;  

I name the pictures with a descriptive filename, followed by the last 3 or 4 numbers of the original filename.

'''BISECT ANGLE''' &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC &lt;/math&gt;
# Use a compass to find points D and E, equidistant from the vertex, point B. 
# [[../Our_tools:_Ruler_and_compasses# how to draw a line?| Draw the line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Geom bisect angle 04.png|396 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
# [[../Constructing equilateral triangle|Construct an equilateral triangle]] on &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE}&lt;/math&gt; with third vertex '''F''' and get &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt;.

#  [[../Our_tools:_Ruler_and_compasses# how to draw a line?| Draw the line]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{BF}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Geom bisect angle 06.png|396 px]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

== Claim ==
# The angles &lt;math&gt;\angle ABF &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\angle FBC &lt;/math&gt; equal to half of &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC &lt;/math&gt;.

== The proof ==
# &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE}&lt;/math&gt; is a segment from the center to the circumference of &lt;math&gt;\circ B,\overline{BD} &lt;/math&gt; and therefore equals its radius.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\overline{BE}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\overline{DF}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt; are sides of the equilateral triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt;.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\overline{DF}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline{EF}&lt;/math&gt;.
# The segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{BF}&lt;/math&gt; equals to itself
# Due to [[../The Side-Side-Side congruence theorem|the Side-Side-Side congruence theorem]] the triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABF &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\triangle FBC &lt;/math&gt; congruent.
# Hence, the angles &lt;math&gt;\angle ABF &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\angle FBC &lt;/math&gt; equal to half of &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC &lt;/math&gt;.

== Note ==
We showed a simple method to divide an angle to two. A natural question that rises is how to divide an angle into other numbers.
Since Euclid's days, mathematicians looked for a method for [[../Some impossible constructions#Trisecting the angle|trisecting an angle]], dividing it into 3. Only after years of trials it was proven that no such method exists since such a construction is impossible, using only ruler and compass.

== Exercise ==
# Find a construction for dividing an angle to 4.
# Find a construction for dividing an angle to 8.
# For which other number you can find such constructions?

In this chapter, we will learn how to bisect a segment. Given a segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, we will divide it to two equal segments &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{CB}&lt;/math&gt;. The construction is based on [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI10.html book I, proposition 10].

== The construction ==
# [[../Constructing equilateral triangle|Construct the equilateral triangle]]  &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABD &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[../ Bisecting an angle |Bisect an angle]] on &lt;math&gt;\angle ADB &lt;/math&gt;  using the segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE}&lt;/math&gt;.
#  Let '''C''' be the intersection point of &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Claim ==
# Both &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{CB}&lt;/math&gt; are equal to half of &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.

== The proof ==
# &lt;math&gt;\overline{AD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt; are sides of the equilateral triangle &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABD &lt;/math&gt;.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\overline{AD}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt;.
# The segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{DC}&lt;/math&gt; equals to itself.
# Due to the construction &lt;math&gt;\angle ADE &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle EDB &lt;/math&gt; are equal.
# The segments &lt;math&gt;\overline{DE}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{DC}&lt;/math&gt; lie on each other.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\angle ADE &lt;/math&gt; equals to &lt;math&gt;\angle ADC&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\angle EDB &lt;/math&gt; equals to &lt;math&gt;\angle CDB &lt;/math&gt;.
# Due to [[../The Side-Angle-Side congruence theorem| the Side-Angle-Side congruence theorem]] the triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ADC &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\triangle CDB &lt;/math&gt; congruent.
# Hence, &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{CB}&lt;/math&gt; are equal.
# Since &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of &lt;math&gt;\overline{AC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{CB}&lt;/math&gt;, each of them equals to its half.

{{Programming/Navigation|lang=Java|previous=Unicode|next=Coding conventions}}
__NOTOC__{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A comment allows to insert text that will not be compiled nor interpreted. It can appear anywhere in the source code where whitespaces are allowed.

It is useful for explaining what the source code does by:
* explaining the adopted technical choice: why this given algorithm and not another, why calling this given method...
* explaining what should be done in the next steps (the TODO list): improvement, issue to fix...
* giving the required explanation to understand the code and be able to update it yourself later or by other developers.

It can also be used to make the compiler ignore a portion of code: temporary code for debugging, code under development...

== Syntax ==
The comments in Java use the same syntax as in [[C++ Programming|C++]].

An end-of-line comment starts with two slashes and ends with the end of the line. This syntax can be used on a single line too.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-105&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.105: Slash-slash comment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// A comment to give an example

int n = 10; // 10 articles
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A comment on several lines is framed with '/' + '*' and '*' + '/'.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-106&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.106: Slash-star comment in multiple lines.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
/*
 * This is a comment
 * on several lines.
 */

/* This also works; slash-star comments may be on a single line. */

/*
Disable debugging code:

int a = 10;
while (a-- &gt; 0) System.out.println(&quot;DEBUG: tab[&quot;+a+&quot;]=&quot; + tab[a]);
*/
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

By convention, subsequent lines of slash-star comments begin with a star aligned under the star in the open comment sequence, but this is not required. Never nest a slash-star comment in another slash-star comment. If you accidentally nest such comments, you will probably get a syntax error from the compiler soon after the first star-slash sequence.

{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-107&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.107: Nested slash-star comment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
/* This comment appears to contain /* a nested comment. */
 * The comment ends after the first star-slash and
 * everything after the star-slash sequence is parsed
 * as non-comment source.
 */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If you need to have the sequence */ inside a comment you can use html numeric entities: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&amp;amp;#47;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Slash-star comments may also be placed between any Java tokens, though not recommended:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-108&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.108: Inline slash-star comment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int i = /* maximum integer */ Integer.MAX_VALUE;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

However, comments are not parsed as comments when they occur in string literals.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-109&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.109: String literal.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String text = &quot;/* This is not a comment. */&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It results in a 33 character string.

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.26''': Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-26&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.26: Commented code.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
int a = 0;
// a = a + 1;
a = a + 1;
/*
a = a + 1;
*/
a = a + 1;
// /*
a = a + 1;
// */
a = a /*+ 1*/;
a = a + 1; // a = a + 1;
System.out.println(&quot;a=&quot; + a);
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

What is printed in the standard output?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}

{{XConsole|1='''Output for Answer 3.26'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
a=4
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;answer-26&quot;&gt;'''Answer 3.26: Commented code.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13&quot;&gt;
int a = 0;
// a = a + 1;
a = a + 1;
/*
a = a + 1;
*/
a = a + 1;
// /*
a = a + 1;
// */
a = a /*+ 1*/;
a = a + 1; // a = a + 1;
System.out.println(&quot;a=&quot; + a);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The highlighted lines are code lines but line 11 does nothing and only the first part of line 12 is code.

== Comments and unicode ==
Be aware that Java still interprets Unicode sequences within comments. For example, the Unicode sequence &lt;code&gt;\u002a\u002f&lt;/code&gt; (whose codepoints correspond to */) is processed early in the Java compiler's lexical scanning of the source file, even before comments are processed, so this is a valid star-slash comment in Java:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-110&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.110: Unicode sequence interruption.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
/* This is a comment. \u002a\u002f
String statement = &quot;This is not a comment.&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

and is lexically equivalent to

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-111&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.111: Unicode sequence interruption effect.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
/* This is a comment. */
String statement = &quot;This is not a comment.&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

(The &lt;code&gt;'*'&lt;/code&gt; character is Unicode &lt;code&gt;002A&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;'/'&lt;/code&gt; character is Unicode &lt;code&gt;002F&lt;/code&gt;.)

Similar caveats apply to newline characters in slash-slash comments.

For example:
{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-112&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.112: New line.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// This is a single line comment \u000a This is code
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

That is because &lt;code&gt;\u000a&lt;/code&gt; is Unicode for a new line, making the compiler think that you have added a new line when you haven't.

== Javadoc comments ==

[[Java Programming/Javadoc|Javadoc]] comments are a special case of slash-star comments.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-113&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.113: Javadoc comment.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
/**
 * Comments which start with slash-star-star are Javadoc comments.
 * These are used to extract documentation from the Java source.
 * More on javadoc will be covered later.
 */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Hey Orderud, I don't think we need to merge the three book shelves. Here's what an ideal organization would be:
# Computer Science -- the more &quot;math-like&quot; stuff you would get in college
# Programming -- language guides, library tutorials, programming tips and recipies
# IT -- about computer programs, using them, set up of networks, so long as you aren't writing much &quot;code&quot;
That's just my two cents, but the differences between CS and IT are so great that they shouldn't belong on the same shelf. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
:There's a reply for you on my user page. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:16, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

== Programming:MS Visual Studio ==

Hello there Orderud,

What is your view on moving all C++ content from Programming:MS Visual Studio to Programming:C plus plus this is already a Win32 and MFC section there if the content in the future gets to big a separate book can be created to keep it as I see now it consists only on some wikipedia links and a single module also consider that in the C++ book it will get more visibility and probably more contributions, if not consider at least on using transclusion for content that relates only to C++ (non Visual Studio dependent)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:45, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

: Sounds like a good suggestion. Feel free to move the content as you please :) --[[User:Orderud|Orderud]] 19:34, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

:: Txs, new location of the content is [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:C_plus_plus/MS_Visual_Studio/Using_Static_Libraries Using Static Libraries]], if you have more just add to it's parent...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:45, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

== C++ Libraries, linker and navigation ==
Can you provide a motive for the page moves of the library sections (I've read the comments) and they don't make sense, since it was evolving toward the other side of the spectrum, (it's been implement across the book, so retracing it would require a major restructure) we do sacrifice clarity of path to enable easier navigability (better that using navigational aids and templates), even what you said on the comment is incorrect, since C++ (and C also) &quot;programs&quot; will consists of one or more translation units that are '''compiled''' separately, this results in separated object files are then '''linked''' together to produce an executable file. Keeping the navigational structure intact is very important and rational on this case (I have fixed the one I know, broke the book structure and the print version), if you agree with the concept, can you see if you can undo the moves and correction of paths ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:04, 5 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
We can use redirects also to improve path visibility if you think it is important, I was going to experiment with those to enable more logical navigation but I'm going from start to end (in relation to the TOC), another example of the use of this navigational structure that is still incomplete is on the /Code/ this will slowly extend to the rest of the book see [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions/Documentation]]...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:06, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

* Sorry for breaking the book structure. I'm not that experienced when it comes to wikibook editing, and have no idea about book structure and how print versions are built. My intention was only to make the module paths more intuitive. Especially, I found the ''/Compiler/Linker/Libraries/'' path structure very strange, and therefore moved some modules beneath ''/Libraries/'' instead. As for navigation, I don't see any ''prev'' or ''next'' links or a navigation bar anywhere to navigate between the modules. How are users supposed to navigate through the book? --[[User:Orderud|Orderud]] ([[User talk:Orderud|talk]]) 00:06, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

:No big problem, so far I only detected that break and you fixed most of the links and didn't tag the redirects for deletion (so they are virtual placeholders) for the previous content. As for prev and next I the first part of the book addresses it by including references to those section that are relevant (you corrected some of those links they are labeled as something Section, and I also used old Wikipedia (were possible and on scope) to local book pages that cover the issues as for the navigation one must use the ones provided by the strange paths (like the example I gave above [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions/Documentation]] or use the category link [[:Category:C++ Programming]] (that will show all pages of the book, this is not as great as using a navigational template, but come close and is easier to maintain, especially if we move pages about, the normal way people navigate book is to use the toc and the browser back or history function will cover that, the major problem is that the root page or cover page doesn't hold the real toc of the book (were clicking on C++ Programming would show the toc), there is a pending request for the administration to fix that...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:55, 6 January 2009 (UTC)
:The book had a navigational scheme in the past but was not maintained and was voted for removal, this method can be more confusing but if you look at toc1 is easy to fallow he arrangement, and enables users not professional with templates to make changes due to the use of transclusiom...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:57, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

== Overview ==
An '''''invisibility cloak''''' is a cloak designed to conceal its wearer. It is made of a special type of material that makes its occupant invisible. When nobody is inside it, it looks like a silvery, almost transparent fabric.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Invisibility cloaks are very rare, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] receives one for Christmas in his first year; it turns out to have been originally the property of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]], and was given to Harry by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. Harry uses it a number of times in the books, whenever he needs to go somewhere unobserved, often with one or more of his friends; he does note that it is a mixed blessing, as it hides you from vision, but you still have to be careful about making sounds or bumping into things or people.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] apparently owns two Invisibility Cloaks; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sturgis Podmore|Sturgis Podmore]] is wearing one of them when he is arrested in the Ministry, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] is wearing the other when he is attacked by the snake, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

== Analysis ==

The invisibility cloak is the perfect device for moving around undetected. As Harry often has the need to break rules, he needs a device such as this and an invisibility cloak seems like the perfect choice. Unlike the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disillusionment|Disillusionment charm]], which makes an object a near-perfect chameleon, the invisibility cloak makes the object transparent, and can only be pierced by magical – or possibly cat – eyes: Professor Moody's magical eye seems to be able to see through it easily, and there is the suggestion that both [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]]&lt;!-- PS/SS: Mrs. Norris seems to be watching Harry as he heads to the library at Christmas --&gt; and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] can sense Harry under it, though in fact the cats may be hearing rather than seeing the passage of those within. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] also senses Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] under the Cloak in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], though it is obvious that he is hearing rather than seeing them. Additionally, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] looks right at Harry and Ron underneath the Invisibility Cloak while in Hagrid's hut, suggesting that Dumbledore might actually be able to see through the Invisibility Cloak. Dumbledore had hinted&lt;!-- &quot;Back &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;, Harry?&quot; - italics mine - Chazz --&gt; at this ability in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], when he caught Harry in front of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]].

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is noted elsewhere that Dumbledore is able to make himself invisible without using a cloak; Dumbledore says this himself in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Philosophers' Stone'']]. And yet, James Potter left his invisibility cloak in Dumbledore's care. What need of an invisibility cloak would Dumbledore have? [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=23 The author has stated] that this is an important question to ponder.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we learn that this is because James Potter's Invisibility Cloak is, indeed, something special. Talking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]], the Trio learn of the possible existence of the three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. Xeno reminds them that most Invisibility Cloaks are either simple traveling cloaks to which a Disillusionment Charm has been applied, or are woven out of the hair of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Demiguise|Demiguise]], but all such become damaged or fade into visibility with time. Only one Invisibility Cloak, the third of the three Hallows, and supposedly the Cloak of Death himself, does not suffer the ravages of time, and cannot be damaged by magic. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are uncomfortably aware at this point that the Cloak in Harry's possession matches this description perfectly.

It turns out that Dumbledore, in his youth, had heard the legend of the three Hallows, and had been trying to find them. Though his active search for them had stopped by the time he was a teacher at Hogwarts, his youthful obsession with them had never completely faded, and he had borrowed James' Cloak, once he had heard of its properties, because he recognized it as a Hallow. It was while he was examining it that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] killed James and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]], and tried to kill Harry.

There is some question as to exactly how functional an Invisibility Cloak is, given that Alastor Moody's magical eye can see through it without difficulty, Harry's presence on the Marauder's Map is not changed by his being under his cloak, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]] evidently can see Arthur Weasley in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. In the latter case, however, we note that a careful reading of the text would suggest strongly that Arthur has fallen asleep and the cloak has slipped partially off him. As such, we believe that snakes (notably pit vipers, who have infrared sensors as well as eyes) may be able to detect the presence of someone under a cloak, but only by the heat they radiate; it is unlikely that they can directly see the person under the cloak. There is no mention of Voldemort having added extra senses in his efforts to make himself appear more snake-like.

On Professor Dumbledore's ability to sense Harry underneath the Invisibility Cloak, we believe that Dumbledore is actually being rather more devious than we expect him to be so early in the series; we learn, gradually, as the story arc progresses, exactly how little of his knowledge Dumbledore is allowing to escape. We feel it is most likely that Dumbledore is actually not perceiving Harry under the cloak, but rather is using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]] to see what Harry is seeing, and working backwards from that to determine where he is. We suspect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] attempts to do this as well, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 30|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

It is noted also that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] are not impeded by Invisibility Cloaks. It is noted that Invisibility Cloaks only stop one from seeing someone who is wearing it; Harry, for instance, has difficulty making his way through the Hogwarts Express, while wearing his cloak, because of the extreme care he must take not to bump into anyone or step on feet. Since Dementors do not have eyes, the senses they use to detect and identify people must be somehow other than visual, probably related to the mental effects they have on people. Clearly, these senses are not stopped by Invisibility Cloaks.

From the above, we believe that an Invisibility Cloak will completely shield the user from anyone else's eyes. The few exceptions that we have noted are Moody's magical eye, and those artifacts and creatures that use something other than eyes to perceive the individual. (Note that Moody's magical eye likely is, in fact, just such an artifact. Moody, being nearly paranoid, would charm his magical eye with any additional information-gathering charms he could, and if the Marauders can do it with the Marauder's Map, it is extremely likely a wizard of Moody's ability could charm his Eye the same way.)

[[w:H.264/MPEG-4_AVC|MPEG4-AVC]] provides the most efficient compression compared to every other codec out there.

There are some opensource H.264 encoders (e.g. [[w:X264|x264]]), and people have used them to successfully compress video, but they are buggy at present.

Probably the most cost effective way to produce H.264 is to use Apple Quicktime 7 Pro.  The video really deteriorates below about 512kbps but 1Mbps is pretty nice.

==Encoding H.264 Quick Times from Premiere Pro==
First, download the most recent version of [http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone.html Apple Quicktime].

Then take a look at Apple's [http://www.apple.com/quicktime/tutorials/h264.html H.264 encoding guide].

Beware: encoding H.264 using two passes on QT Pro 7.0.3 takes a long time (a 3 minute SD video took 2 hours to encode on an Athlon64 2.4GHz).

===Problems setting datarate===
For some reason, if you try to use the Adobe Media Encoder from within Premiere Pro 1.5.1 then you can't set the datarate.  So export from PPro as an uncompressed AVI, import into Quicktime 7 Pro, compress as MP4 and set as H.264.  Or, alternatively, change the &quot;export size&quot;.  In premiere when you look at your transcode settings in the Media encoder, it is under the Video area. Underneath where you choose the video codec settings, you can tell the encoder a frame size. 

* [http://forums.creativecow.net/cgi-bin/new_read_post.cgi?univpostid=857416&amp;forumid=3&amp;postid=857441&amp;pview=t  &quot;Can't set bitrate when encoding QT H.264 using Adobe Media Encoder&quot;] thread on Creative Cow.

===Gamma problems===
RGB movies can look washed out when converted to H.264.  You need to convert to YUV colour space first.

===Banding===
There seem to be some serious problems with banding.  Any ideas?!

==Encoding WMV9 from Premiere Pro==

This is a bit long winded and there's probably a better solution out there... but this works:

# Decrypt and copy the [[w:VOB|VOBs]] to your hard disk (e.g. using DVD Decrypter.  Note that decrypting DVDs that you do not own the copywrite for is illegal!)
# Convert the video to an uncompressed [[w:AVI|AVI]] using [http://arbor.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jackeikuo/dvd2avi/ DVD2AVI 1.9]
# Rename the [[w:VOB|.VOB]] to [[w:MPEG|.MPG]]
# Import both the uncompressed AVI and the [[w:MPEG|.MPG]] into Premiere Pro
# Use the audio from the [[w:MPEG|.MPG]] and the video from the [[w:AVI|AVI]]

For some reason, DVD2AVI doesn't export the audio properly.  And, for some reason, Premiere Pro really doesn't like decoding the [[w:MPEG|.MPG]] video!  So you have to use the two together.  If Premiere Pro behaved itself, it would be possible to import the [[w:VOB|.VOB]] directly into PPro (after renaming it to [[w:MPEG|.MPG]]).

The core of the problem with Premiere's MPEG handling is caused by the fact that Premiere asks Windows to connect it to the MPEG decoder. (This is as opposed to how it handles DV, for which it uses the MainConcept codec exclusively.) Any given computer probably has at least 2 or 3 decoders on it, and whatever is the most recently installed will be what Windows feeds back to Premiere. The decoder in use may or may not play nicely with Premiere. In particular, the Intervideo WinDVD decoder seems to be especially unfriendly.

The solution is to change which DVD decoder has highest priority. Preferably the MainConcept decoder, which Premiere installs, will be the one. Try searching the Premiere Pro forum on the Adobe site, there have been some tools mentioned there that will change MPEG decoder priority (or you can just hack the registry if you know where to go).

Another solution that has been reccomended on the Premiere Elements forum is to install the free K-Lite codec package. It includes the MainConcept decoder (which calls into question the legality of this package), and if you select MC to be the default during the K-Lite install, all seems to be fine with at least Premiere Elements and MPEG handling. PrPro shouldn't behave differently. Basically, with this solution, you're just pasting another version of the MC codec on top of whatever's already there.

=Handbrake=

Handbrake is an all-in-one system for converting from DVD to MPEG-4 (even AVC).  At the time of writing it runs well on Mac OS X and Linux and a port is available for Windows althought it's currently unstable.

http://handbrake.m0k.org/

However, it should be noted that MPEG-4 is not a good choice of codec for video editing.

'''Google''' is your friend.  The Internet has a lot of example and command samples to perform tasks all you have to do is run a search.  This is often the only approach because the built in help really requires you to know the command name to start with which is not very useful.

For samples of actual code, you can try the [http://www.google.com/codesearch Google code search] with the option lang:shell.

===Friends and support groups===
You should never be shy of asking for help from knowledgeable people around you.  They often will give you a quick answer that you have to research or tune to get the complete answer however it will give you a starting point for the following commands to be truly useful.

Work and Learning

Although this Wikibook is primarily focused on Blended Learning in the K-12 envirornment, it is worth pointing out that Blended Learning occurs most often at the university level, and as a method of professional development in the business world. 

One of the distinct advantages of Blended Learning in the workplace is that it allows employees to continue their professional development, while customizing their learning to fit their own needs. Thus an employee can immediately apply what he or she learns to their job. (Singh and Reed, 2001).

This is less applicable to a K-12 setting, except in terms of differentiation. It seems unlikely that a K-12 student would be participating in the type of work that would benefit from this type of course design. On the other hand, a Blended Learning course could allow a student to apply knowledge to other tasks, i.e. extra-curricular activities.</text>

One of the harshest criticisms of Blended Learning is that the focus tends to be on the instructor, rather than on the learner. (Oliver and Trigwell, 2005). 

Alonzo ''et al.'' point out that the concept of e-learning is new enough that practitioners have not yet begun to apply pedagogical principals to the process of e-learning. (2005)

Ideally, they continue, e-learning (and therefore Blended Learning) should be focused on the individual learner. The course designer should be able to utilize cognitive and constructionist theory to design an effective course. (Alonzo ''et al.'', 2005)

This course would be carefully organized so that students can easily insert new knowledge into their pre-existing schema. The organization should then reinforce the acquisition of new knowledge and activities should provide a scaffolded approach to help learners practice new skills by applying their knowledge. All of this is consistent with cognitive theories of learning, which tend to focus on the processes of information acquisition, organization, retrieval, and application. 

Constructivist theories of learning describe learning as a process whereby the learner takes in new information, and inserts it into existing schema. Each learner constructs meaning differently based upon their own experiences.  In other words, there is a disconnect between knowledge that is taught, and knowledge that is learned, because the learner will re-interpret what is being taught, and construct his or her own meaning from that knowledge. 

To support the constructivist approach, a learning community should be created, and then guided through the process of collaboration so that learning is constructed by the group, rather than just the individual. (Alonzo ''et al.'', 2005)

In a traditional face-to-face learning environment, one of the more common methods of constructing group meaning is through discussion. The instructor typically begins the discussion by posing a question. The instructor then invites members of the class to make an impromptu response. Other class members then respond to the first student, and a discussion develops. In this way, students are exposed to several perspectives, and the answer to the original question is constructed for each learner based upon the individual's assessment of the group's responses. 

In a blended environment, this discussion format can be easily adapted and enhanced. The discussion could be held synchronously, in group chat, or could be held asynchronusly, in a forum to which learners post responses. In a blended environment, students have the capability of responding to several points at once. Since an asynchronus discussion can continue over a longer period of time, students can take time to formulate responses, and can respond to a particular part of a comment, even if the discussion has taken another route.</text>

Thanky ou harryhaber@hotmail,com

== merging this wikibook ==

Would anyone be opposed to merging this book with the wikibook [[Energy_Efficiency_Reference|&quot;Energy Efficiency Reference&quot;]]?? I think this would allow for a much more robust wikibook to be created. Comments? --[[User:Mdkoch84|Michael Koch]] ([[User talk:Mdkoch84|talk]]) 08:05, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

== moving this page ==

it would be more sensible to have this book's title changed from &quot;How to reduce home energy costs&quot; to &quot;How to reduce home energy usage,&quot; as this encompasses positive environmental effects of reducing usage, as well as economic ones. if no one objects, this page should be moved.
-------------------------------
Edited - 03/10/06 *added/bolded two cautions of existing tips.

== format and topics ==

This &quot;book&quot; is more of a checklist.  The format should be changed, the elements expanded and explained, diagrams and photos added where appropriate, and similar items.

I would recommend going area by area, rather than as it is now.  For example, a section could be on &quot;central heating&quot;, another on &quot;water&quot;, and another on &quot;electricity&quot; ...

Each element should be tested for relevance to the topic; many items are not.  For example: How does buying bigger items help with home energy conservation? (''answer: it doesn't'' ).  Another example: how does recycling help with home energy conservation? (''answer: it doesn't'' ).

Now if I just would have logged in first....

== Domestic ventilation ==

Some of the advice given is unsound. If I understand correctly, using a fan to blow house air into the roofspace is OK. In the UK, this most certainly would not be OK. House air has a sufficiently high moisture content to cause loft ( roofspace) condensation, and indeed in the UK we seek to seal out the ceiling as much as possible. There are one or two exotic ventilation systems which supply air form the roof, but these are not in general use.

Modesty forbids me from referring readers to my book &quot;Handbook of Domestic Ventilation&quot; (Elsevier) for more detailed information........


Check the degrees celcius conversions. You're about 5 degrees off. 25.5C = 78F, not 30C.

== Transwiki ==

This transwiki may yield useful content: [[Transwiki:Weatherization]] '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:05, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

== Fan in Reverse?! ==

What moron would run the fan in reverse to, as this entry says &quot;move the air up to the ceiling.&quot;

The second the heat leaves the insert ... it's headed straight for the ceiling!  Why on earth would you waste your time using a ceiling fan to do what its alreay doing?

You run the fan COUNTER CLOCKWISE to pull the heat down from the ceiling, dispersing it out and into other rooms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">No program is an island unto itself. Not even the Bourne Shell. Each program executes within an ''environment'', a system of resources that controls how the program executes and what external connections the program has and can make. And in which the program can itself make changes.

In this module we discuss the environment, the habitat in which each program and command lives and executes. We look at what the environment consists of, where it comes from and where it's going... And we discuss the most important mechanism that the shell has for passing data around: the ''environment variable''.

==The Environments==
When discussing a Unix shell, you often come across the term &quot;environment&quot;. This term is used to describe the context in which a program executes and is usually meant to mean a set of &quot;environment variables&quot; (we'll get to those shortly). But in fact there are two different terms that are somehow a  program's environment and which often get mixed up together in &quot;environment&quot;. The simpler one of these really is the collection of environment variables and actually is called the &quot;environment&quot;. The second is a much wider collection of resources that influence the execution of a program and is called the ''command execution environment''.

===The command execution environment===
Each running program, either started directly by the user from the shell or indirectly by another process, operates within a collection of global resources called its '''command execution environment''' (CEE).

A program's CEE contains important information such as the source and destination of data upon which the program can operate (also known as the [[../Files and streams|standard input]], [[../Files and streams|standard output]] and [[../Files and streams|standard error]] handles). In addition, variables are defined that list the identity and home directory of the user or process that started the program, the hostname of the machine and the kind of terminal used to start the program. There are other variables too, but that's just some of the main ones. The environment also provides working space for the program, as well as a simple way of communicating with other, future programs, that will be run in the same environment. 

The complete list of resources included in the shell's CEE is:

*Open files held in the parent process that started the shell. These files are inherited. This list of files includes the files accessed through redirection (such as standard input, output and error files).
*The current working directory: the &quot;current&quot; directory of the shell.
*The file creation mode:The default set of file permissions set when a new file is created.
*The active [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Debugging and signal handling|traps]].
*Shell parameters and variables set during the call to the shell or inherited from the parent process.
*Shell [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Modularization|functions]] inherited from the parent process.
*Shell options set by ''set'' or ''shopts'', or as command line options to the shell executable.
*Shell aliases (if available in your shell).
*The process id of the shell and of some processes started by the parent process.

Whenever the shell executes a command that starts a child process, that command is executed it its own CEE. This CEE inherits a copy of part of the CEE of its parent, but not the entire parent CEE. The inherited copy includes:

*Open files.
*The working directory.
*The file creation mode mask.
*Any shell variables and functions that are marked to be exported to child processes.
*Traps set by the shell.

====The 'set' command====
The 'set' command allows you to set or disable a number of options that are part of the CEE and influence the behavior of the shell. To set an option, set is called with a command line argument of '-' followed by one or more flags. To disable the option, set is called with '+' and then the same flag. You probably won't use these options very often; the most common use of 'set' is the call without any arguments, which produces a list of all defined names in the environment (variables and functions). Here are some of the options you might get some use out of:

;+/-a:When set, automatically mark all newly created or redefined variables for export.
;+/-f:When set, ignore filename [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Control_flow#Regular_expressions_and_metacharacters|metacharacters]].
;+/-n:When set, only read commands but do not execute them.
;+/-v:When set, causes the shell to print commands as they are read from input (verbose debugging flag).
;+/-x:When set, causes the shell to print commands as they will be executed (debugging flag).

Again, you'll probably mostly use set without arguments, to inspect the list of defined variables.

===The environment and environment variables===
Part of the CEE is something that is simply called the ''environment''. The environment is a collection of name/value pairs called ''environment variables''. These variables technically also contain the shell [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Modularization|functions]], but we'll discuss those in a [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Modularization|separate module]].

An environment variable is a piece of labelled storage in the environment, where you can store anything you like as long as it fits. These spaces are called variables because you can vary what you put in them. All you need to know is the name (the label) that you used for storing the content. The Bourne shell also makes use of these &quot;environment variables&quot;. You can make scripts that examine these variables, and those scripts can make decisions based on the values stored in the variables.

An environment variable is a name/value pair of the form

{{bcode:Example|''name''&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''variable''}}

which is also the way of creating a variable. There are several ways of using a variable which we will discuss in the module on [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Substitution|substitution]], but for now we will limit ourselves to the simple way: if you prepend a variable name with a $-character, the shell will substitute the value for the variable. So, for example:

{{code:Output|Simple use of a variable|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ VAR=Hello
$ echo $VAR&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello
|}}

As you can see from the example above, an environment variable is sort of like a bulletin board: anybody can post any kind of value there for everybody to read (as long as they have access to the board). And whatever is posted there can be interpreted by any reader in whatever way they like. This makes the environment variable a very general mechanism for passing data along from one place to another. And as a result environment variables are used for all sorts of things. For instance, for setting global parameters that a program can use in its execution. Or for setting a value from one shell script to be picked up by another. There are even a number of environment variables that the shell itself uses in its configuration. Some typical examples:

;IFS:This variable lists the characters that the shell considers to be whitespace characters.
;PATH:This variable is interpreted as a list of directories (separated by colons on a Unix system). Whenever you type the name of an executable for the shell to execute but do not include the full path of that executable, the shell will look in all of these directories ''in order'' to find the executable.
;PS1:This variable lists a set of codes. These codes instruct your shell about what the command-line prompt in the interactive shell should look like.
;PWD:The value of this variable is always the path of the working directory.

The absolute beauty of environment variables, as mentioned above, is that they just contain random strings of characters without an immediate meaning. The meaning of any variable is to be interpreted by whatever program or process reads the variable. So a variable can hold literally any kind of information and be used practically anywhere. For instance, consider the following example:

{{code:Basic|Environment variables are more flexible than you thought...
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo $CMD

$ CMD=ls
$ echo $CMD
ls
$ $CMD
bin  booktemp  Documents  Mail  mbox  public_html  sent&lt;/source&gt;}}

There's nothing wrong with setting a variable to the name of an executable, then executing that executable by calling the variable as a command.

===Different kinds of environment variables===
Although you use all environment variables the same way, there are a couple of different kinds of variables. In this section we discuss the differences between them and their uses.

====Named variables====
The simplest and most straightforward environment variable is the named variable. We saw it earlier: it's just a name with a value, which can be retrieved by prepending a '$' to the name. You create and define a named variable in one go, by typing the name, an equals sign and then something that results in a string of characters.

Earlier we saw the following, simple example:

{{code:Basic|Assigning a simple value to a variable|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ VAR=Hello&lt;/source&gt;}}

This just assigns a simple value. Once a variable has been defined, we can also redefine it:

{{code:Basic|Assigning a simple value to a variable|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ VAR=Goodbye&lt;/source&gt;}}

We aren't limited to straightforward strings either. We can just as easily assign the value of one variable to another:

{{code:Basic|Assigning a simple value to a variable|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ VAR=$PATH&lt;/source&gt;}}

We can even go all-out and combine several commands to come up with a value:

{{code:Basic|Assigning a combined value to a variable|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ PS1= &quot;`whoami`@`hostname -s` `pwd` \$ &quot;&lt;/source&gt;}}

In this case, we're taking the output of the three commands 'whoami', 'hostname', and 'pwd', then we add the '$' symbol, and some spacing and other formatting just to pad things out a bit. Whew. All that, just in one piece of labeled space. As you can see environment variables can hold quite a bit, including the output of entire commands.

There are usually lots of named variables defined in your environment, even if you are not aware of them. Try the 'set' command and have a look.

====Positional variables====
Most of the environment variables in the shell are named variables, but there are also a couple of &quot;special&quot; variables. Variables that you don't set, but whose values are automatically arranged and maintained by the shell. Variables which exist to help you out, to discover information about the shell or from the environment.

The most common of these are the positional or argument variables. Any command you execute in the shell (in interactive mode or in a script) can have command-line arguments. Even if the command doesn't actually use them, they can still be there. You pass command-line arguments to a command simply by typing them after the command, like so:

{{bcode:Example|''command'' ''arg0'' ''arg1'' ...}}

This is allowed for any command. Even your own shell scripts. But say that you do this (create a shell script, then execute it with arguments); how do you access the command-line arguments from your script? This is where the positional variables come in. When the shell executes a command, it automatically assigns any command-line arguments, in order, to a set of positional variables. And these variables have numbers for names: 1 through 9, accessed through $1 through $9. Well, actually zero though nine; $0 is the name of the command that was executed. For example, consider a script like this:

{{code:Basic|WithArgs.sh: A script that uses command-line arguments|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh

echo $0
echo $1
echo $2&lt;/source&gt;}}

And a call to this script like this:

{{code:Output|Calling the script|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ WithArgs.sh Hello World&lt;/source&gt;|
WithArgs.sh&lt;br/&gt;
Hello&lt;br/&gt;
World|}}

As you can see, the shell automatically assigned the values 'Hello' and 'World' to $1 and $2 (okay, technically to the variables called 1 and 2, but it's less confusing in written text to call them $1 and $2). What happens if we call this script with more than two arguments?

{{code:Output|Calling the script with more arguments|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ WithArgs.sh Hello World Mouse Cheese&lt;/source&gt;|
WithArgs.sh&lt;br/&gt;
Hello&lt;br/&gt;
World
|Did the mouse eat the cheese?}}

This is no problem whatsoever &amp;mdash; the extra arguments get assigned to $3 and $4. But we didn't use those variables in the script, so those command-line arguments are ignored. What about the opposite case (too few arguments)?

{{code:Output|Calling the script with too few arguments...|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ WithArgs.sh Hello&lt;/source&gt;|
WithArgs.sh&lt;br/&gt;
Hello&lt;br/&gt;

|}}

Again, no problem. When the script accesses $2, the shell simply substitutes the value of $2 for $2. That value is nothing in this case, so we print exactly that. In this case it's not a problem, but if your script has mandatory arguments you should check whether or not they are actually there.

What about if we want 'Hello' and 'World' to be treated as one command-line argument to be passed to the script? I.e. 'Hello World' rather than 'Hello' and 'World'? We'll get deeply into that when we start talking about [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Control_flow#Quoting|quoting]], but for now just surround the words with single quotes:

{{code:Output|Calling the script with multi-word arguments|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ WithArgs.sh 'Hello World' 'Mouse Cheese'&lt;/source&gt;|
WithArgs.sh&lt;br/&gt;
Hello World&lt;br/&gt;
Mouse Cheese
|There are the mouse and the cheese!}}

=====Shifting=====
So what happens if you have more than nine command line arguments? Then your script is too complicated. No, but seriously: then you have a little problem. It's allowed to pass more than nine arguments, but there are only nine positional variables (in Bourne Shell at least). To deal with this situation the shell includes the '''shift''' command:

{{bcode:Example|'''shift''' [n]|Where n is optional and a positive integer (default 1)}}

'''Shift''' causes the positional arguments to shift left. That is, the value of $1 becomes the old value of $2, the value of $2 becomes the old value of $3 and so on. Using '''shift''', you can access all the command-line arguments (even if there are more than nine). The optional integer argument to shift is the number of positions to shift (so you can shift as many positions in one go as you like). There are a couple of things to keep in mind though:

* No matter how often you shift, $0 always remains the original command.
* If you shift n positions, n must be lower than the number of arguments. If n is greater than the number of arguments, no shifting occurs.
* If you shift n positions, the first n arguments are lost. So make sure you have them stored elsewhere or you don't need them anymore!
* You cannot shift back to the right.

In the module on [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Control_flow#The_while_loop|Control flow]] we'll see how you can go through all the arguments without knowing exactly how many there are.

====Other, special variables====
In addition to the positional variables the Bourne Shell includes a number of other, special variables with special information about the shell. You'll probably not use these as often, but it's good to know they're there. These variables are

;$#:The number of command-line arguments to the current command (changes after a use of the '''shift''' command!).
;$-:The shell options currently in effect (see [[#The_.27set.27_command|the 'set' command]]).
;$?:The exit status of the last command executed (0 if it succeeded, non-zero if there was an error).
;$$:The process id of the current process.
;$!:The process id of the last background command.
;$*:All the command-line arguments. When [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Control_flow#Quoting|quoted]], expands to all command-line arguments as a single word (i.e. &quot;$*&quot; = &quot;$1 $2 $3 ...&quot;).
;$@:All the command-line arguments. When [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Control_flow#Quoting|quoted]], expands to all command-line arguments quoted individually (i.e. &quot;$@&quot; = &quot;$1&quot; &quot;$2&quot; &quot;$3&quot; ...).

===Exporting variables to a subprocess===
We've mentioned it a couple of times before: Unix is a multi-user, multiprocessing operating system. And that fact is very much supported by the Bourne Shell, which allows you to start up new processes right from inside a running shell. In fact, you can even run multiple processes simultaneously next to each other (but we'll get to that a little later). Here's a simple example of starting a subprocess: 

{{code:Basic|Starting a new shell from the shell|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ sh&lt;/source&gt;}}

We've also talked about the Command Execution Environment and the Environment (the latter being a collection of variables). These environments can affect how programs run, so it's very important that they cannot inadvertently affect one another. After all, you wouldn't want the screen in your shell to go blue with yellow letters simply because somebody started Midnight Commander in another process, right? 

One of the things that the shell does to avoid processes inadvertently affecting one another, is environment separation. Basically this means that whenever a new (sub)process is started, it has its own CEE and environment. Of course it would be damned inconvenient if the environment of a subprocess of your shell were ''completely'' empty; your subprocess wouldn't have a PATH variable or the settings you chose for the format of your prompt. On the other hand there is usually a good reason NOT to have certain variables in the environment of your subprocess, and it usually has something to do with not handing off too much environment data to a process if it doesn't need that data. This was particularly true when running copies of MS-DOS and versions of DOS under Windows. You only HAD a limited amount of environment space, so you had to use it carefully, or ask for more space on startup. These days in a UNIX environment the space issues aren't the same, but if all your existing variables ended up in the environment of your subprocess you might still adversely affect the running of the program that you started in that subprocess (there's really something to be said for keeping your environment lean and clean in the case of subprocesses).

The compromise between the two extremes that Stephen Bourne and others came up with is this: a subprocess has an environment which contains ''copies'' of the variables in the environment of its parent process &amp;mdash; but only those variables that are marked to be ''exported'' (i.e. copied to subprocesses). In other words, you can have any variable copied into the environment of your subprocesses, but you have to let the shell know that's what you want first. Here's an example of the distinction:

{{code:Basic|Exported and non-exported variables|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
$ VAR=value
$ echo $VAR
value
$ sh
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
$ echo $VAR

$&lt;/source&gt;}}

In the example above, the PATH variable (which is marked for export by default) gets copied into the environment of the shell that is started within the shell. But the VAR variable is ''not'' marked for export, so the environment of the second shell doesn't get a copy.

In order to mark a variable for export you use the '''export''' command, like so:

{{bcode:Example|'''export''' ''VAR0'' [''VAR1'' ''VAR2'' ...]}}

As you can see, you can export as many variables as you like in one go. You can also issue the '''export''' command without any arguments, which will print a list of variables in the environment marked for export. Here's an example of exporting a variable:

{{code:Basic|Exporting a variable|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ VAR=value
$ echo $VAR
value
$ sh
$ echo $VAR

$ exit #Quitting the inner shell
$ export VAR #This is back in the outer shell
$ sh
$ echo $VAR
value&lt;/source&gt;}}

More modern shells like Korn Shell and Bash have more extended forms of '''export'''. A common extension is to allow for definition and export of a variable in one single command. Another is to allow you to ''remove'' the export marking from a variable. However, Bourne Shell only supports exporting as explained above.

===Your profile===
In the previous sections we've discussed the runtime environment of every program and command you run using the shell. We've talked about the command execution environment and at some length about the piece of it simply called &quot;the environment&quot;, which contains environment variables. We've seen that you can define your own variables and that the system usually already has quite a lot of variables to start out with.

Here's a question about those variables that the system starts out with: where do they come from? Do they descend like manna from heaven? And on a related note: what do you do if you want to create some variables automatically every time your shell starts? Or run a program every time you log in?

Those readers who have done some digging around on other operating systems will know what I'm getting at: there's usually some way of having a set of commands executed every time you log in (or every time the system starts at least). In MS-DOS for instance there is a file called autoexec.bat, which is executed every time the system boots. In older versions of MS-Windows there was system.ini. The Bourne Shell has something similar: a file in every user's home directory called ''.profile''. The $HOME/.profile (HOME is a default variable whose value is your home directory) file is a shell script like any other, which is executed automatically right after you login to a new shell session. You can edit the script to have it execute any login-commands that you like.

Each specific Unix system has its own default implementation of the .profile script (including none &amp;mdash; it's allowed not to have a .profile script). But all of them start with some variation of this:

{{code:Basic|A basic (but typical) $HOME/.profile|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh

if [ -f /etc/profile ]; then
 . /etc/profile
fi
PS1= &quot;`whoami`@`hostname -s` `pwd` \$ &quot;
export PS1&lt;/source&gt;}}

This .profile might surprise you a bit: where are all those variables that get set? Most of the variables that get set for you on a typical Unix system, also get set for all other users. In order to make that possible and easily maintainable, the common solution is to have each $HOME/.profile script start by executing another shell script: ''/etc/profile''. This script is a systemwide script whose contents are maintained by the system administrator (the user who logs in with username ''root''). This script sets all sorts of variables and calls scripts that set even more variables and generally does everything that is necessary to provide each user with a comfortable working environment.

As you can see from the example above, you can add any personal configuration you want or need to the .profile script in your directory. The call to execute the system profile script doesn't have to be first, but you probably don't want to remove it altogether.

==Multitasking and job control==
With the arrival of fast computers, CPUs that can switch between multiple tasks in a very small amount of time, CPUs that can actually do multiple things at the same time and networks of multiple CPUs, having the computer perform multiple tasks at the same time has become common. Fast task switching provides the illusion that the computer really is running multiple tasks simultaneously, making it possible to effectively serve multiple users at once. And the ability to switch to a new CPU task while an old task is waiting for a peripheral device makes CPU use vastly more efficient.

In order to make use of multitasking abilities as a user, you need a command environment that supports multitasking. For example, the ability to set one program to a task, then move on and start a new program ''while the old one is still running''. This kind of ability allows you as a user to do multiple things at once on the same machine, as long as those programs do not interfere. Of course, you cannot always treat each program as a &quot;fire and forget&quot; affair; you might have to input a password, or the program might be finished and want to tell you its results. A multitasking environment must allow you to switch between the multiple programs you have running and allow those programs to send you some sort of message if your attention is needed.

To make things a little more tangible think of something like downloading files. Usually, while you're downloading files, you want to do other stuff as well &amp;mdash; otherwise you're going to be sitting at the keyboard twiddling your thumbs a really long time when you want to download a whole CD worth of data. So, you start up your file downloader and feed it a list of files you want to grab. Once you've entered them, you can then tell it &quot;Go!&quot; and it will start off by downloading the first file and continue until it finishes the last one, or until there's a problem. The smarter ones will even try to work through common problems themselves, such as files not being available. Once it starts you get the standard shell prompt back, letting you know that you can start another program. 

If you want to see how far the file downloader has gotten, simply checking the files in your system against what you have on your list will tell you. But another way to notify you is via the environment. The environment can include the files that you work with, and this can help provide information about the progress of currently running programs like that file downloader. Did it download all the files? If you check the status file, you'll see that it's downloaded 65% of the files and is just working on the last three now.

Other examples of programs that don't need their hand held are programs that play music. Quite often, once you start a program that plays music tracks, you don't WANT to tell the program &quot;Okay, now play the next track&quot;. It should be able to do that for itself, given a list of songs to play. In fact, it should not even have to hold on to the monitor; it should allow you to start running other software right after you hit the &quot;play&quot; button.

In this section we will explore multitasking support within the Unix shell. We will look at enabling support, at working with multiple tasks and at the utilities that a shell has available to help you.

===Some terminology===
Before we discuss the mechanics of multitasking in the shell, let's cover some terminology. This will help us discuss the subject clearly and you'll also know what is meant when you run across these terms elsewhere.

First of all, when we start a program running on a system in a process of its own, that process with that one running instance of the program is called a ''job''. You'll also come across terms like process, task, instance or similar. But the term used in Unix shells is job. Second, the ability of the shell to influence and use multitasking (starting jobs and so on) is referred to as ''job control''.

;Job:A process that is executing an instance of a computer program.
;Job control:The ability to selectively stop (suspend) the execution of jobs and continue (resume) their execution at a later point.

Note that these terms are used this way for Unix shells. Other circumstances and other contexts might allow for different definitions. Here are some more terms you'll come across:

;Job ID: An ID (usually an integer) that uniquely identifies a job. Can be used to refer to jobs for different tools and commands.
;Process ID (or PID): An ID (usually an integer) that uniquely identifies a process. Can be used to refer to processes for different tools and commands. Not the same as a Job ID.
;Foreground job (or foreground process): A job that has access to the terminal (i.e. can read from the keyboard and write to the monitor).
;Background job (or background process): A job that does not have access to the terminal (i.e. cannot read from the keyboard or write to the monitor).
;Stop (or suspend): Stop the execution of a job and return terminal control to the shell. A stopped job is not a ''terminated'' job.
;Terminate: Unload a program from memory and destroy the job that was running the program.

===Job control in the shell: what does it mean?===
A job is a program you start within the shell.  By default a new job will suspend the shell and take control over the input and output: every stroke you type at the keyboard will go to the job, as will every mouse movement. Nothing but the job will be able to write to the monitor. This is what we call a ''foreground'' job: it's in the foreground, clearly visible to you as a user and obscuring all other jobs in the system from view.

But sometimes that way of working is very clumsy and irritating. What if you start a long-running job that doesn't need your input (like a backup of your harddrive)? If this is a foreground process you have to wait until it's done before you can do anything else. In this situation you'd much rather start the program as a ''background process'': a process that is running, but that doesn't listen to the input devices and doesn't write to the monitor. Unix supports them and the shell (with job control) allows you to start any job as a background job.

But what about a middle ground? Like that file downloader? You have to start it, log into a remote server, pick your files and start the download. Only after all that does it make sense for the job to be in the background. But how do you accomplish that if you've already started the program as a foreground job? Or how about this: you're busily writing a document in your favorite editor and you just want to step out to check your mail for a moment. Do you have to shut down the editor for that? And then, after you're done with your mail, restart it, re-open your file and find where you'd left off? That's inconvenient. No, a much better idea in both cases is simply to ''suspend'' the program: just stop it from running any further and return to the shell. Once you're back in the shell, you can start another program (mail) and then resume the suspended program (editor) when you're done with that &amp;mdash; and return to the program exactly where you left it. Conversely, you can also decide to let the suspended process (downloader) continue running, but now in the background.

When we talk about job control in the shell, we are talking about the abilities described above: to start programs in the background, to suspend running programs and to resume suspended programs, either in the foreground or in the background.

===Enabling job control===
In order to do all the things we talked about in the previous section, you need two things:

* An operating system that supports job control.
* A shell that supports job control and has job control enabled.

Unix systems support multitasking and job control. Unix was designed from the ground up to support multitasking. If you come across a person claiming to be a Unix vendor but whose software doesn't support job control, call him a fraud. Then throw his install CDs away. Then throw ''him'' away.

Of course you've already guessed what comes next, right? I'm going to tell you Bourne Shell supports job control. And that you can rely on the same mechanisms to work in all compatible shells. Guess what: you're not correct. The original Bourne Shell has no job control support; it was a single-tasking shell. There was an extended version of the Bourne Shell though, called ''jsh'' (guess what the 'j' stands for...) which had job control support. To have job control in the original Bourne Shell, you had to start this extended shell in interactive mode like this:

{{bcode:Example|'''jsh -i'''}}

Within that shell you had the job control tools we will discuss in the following sections.

Pretty much every other shell written since incorporated job control straight into the basic shell and the POSIX 1003 standard has standardized the job control utilities. So you can pretty much rely on job control being available nowadays and usually also enabled by default in interactive mode (some older shells like Korn shell had support but required you to enable that support specifically). But just in case, remember that you might have to do some extra stuff on your system to use job control. There is one gotcha though: in shell scripts, you usually include an interpreter hint that calls for a Bourne Shell (i.e. '''#!/bin/sh'''). Since the original Bourne Shell doesn't have job control, several modern shells turn off job control by default in non-interactive mode as a compatibility feature.

===Creating a job and moving it around===
We've already talked at length about how to create a foreground job: type a command or executable name at the prompt, hit enter, there's your job. Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt.

We've also already [[../Running_Commands#A_useful_thing_to_know:_background_processes|mentioned]] how to start a background job: by adding an ampersand at the end of the command.

{{code:Basic|Creating a background job|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls * &gt; /dev/null &amp;
[1] 4808
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

But that suddenly looks different than when we issued commands previously; there's a &quot;[1]&quot; and some number there. The &quot;[1]&quot; is the ''job ID'' and the number is the ''process ID''. We can use these numbers to refer to the process and the job that we just created, which is useful for using tools that work with jobs. When the task finishes, you will receive a notice similar to the following:

{{code:Basic|Job done|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;[1]+  Done     ls * &gt; /dev/null &amp;&lt;/source&gt;}}

One of the tools that you use to manage jobs is the 'fg' command. This command takes a background job and places it in the foreground. For instance, consider a background job that actually takes some time to complete:

{{code:Basic|A heftier job|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; while [ $CNT -lt 200000 ]; do echo $CNT &gt;&gt; outp.txt; CNT=$(expr $CNT + 1); done &amp;&lt;/source&gt;}}

We haven't gotten into [[../Control flow|flow control]] yet, but this writes 200,000 integers to a file and takes some time. It also runs in the background. Say that we start this job:

{{code:Basic|Starting the job
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ CNT=0
$ while [ $CNT -lt 200000 ]; do echo $CNT &gt;&gt; outp.txt; CNT=$(expr $CNT + 1); done &amp;
[1] 11246&lt;/source&gt;}}

The job is given job ID 1 and process ID 11246. Let's move the process to the foreground:

{{code:Basic|Moving the job to the front
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ fg %1
while [ $CNT -lt 200000 ]; do
    echo $CNT &gt;&gt; outp.txt; CNT=$(expr $CNT + 1);
done

&lt;/source&gt;}}

The job is now running in the foreground, as you can tell from the fact that we are not returned a prompt. Now type the '''CTRL+Z''' keyboard combination:

{{code:Basic|Stopping the job
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;'CTRL+Z'
[1]+  Stopped                 while [ $CNT -lt 200000 ]; do
    echo $CNT &gt;&gt; outp.txt; CNT=$(expr $CNT + 1);
done
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

Did you notice the shell reports the job as stopped? Try using the 'cat' command to inspect the outp.txt file. Try it a couple of times; the contents won't change. The job is not a background job; it's not running at all! The job is suspended. Many programs recognize the '''CTRL+Z''' combination to suspend. And even those that don't usually have some way of suspending themselves.

===Moving to the background and stopping in the background===
Once a job is suspended, you can resume it either in the foreground or the background. To resume in the foreground you use the 'fg' command discussed earlier. You use 'bg' for the background:

{{bcode:Example|'''bg''' ''jobId''}}

To resume our long-lasting job that writes numbers, we do the following:

{{code:Basic|Resuming the job in the background
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ bg %1
[1]+ while [ $CNT -lt 200000 ] do
    echo $CNT &gt;&gt; outp.txt; CNT=`expr $CNT + 1`;
done &amp;
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

The output indicates that the job is running again. In the background this time, since we are also returned a prompt.

Can we also stop a process in the background? Sure, we can move it to the foreground and hit 'CTRL+Z'. But can we also do it directly? Well, there is no utility or command to do it. Mostly, you wouldn't ''want'' to do it &amp;mdash; the whole point of putting it in the background was to let it run without bothering anybody or requiring attention. But if you really want to, you can do it like this:

{{bcode:Example|'''kill -SIGSTOP''' ''jobId''}}

or 

{{bcode:Example|'''kill -SIGSTOP''' ''processId''}}

We'll get back to what this does exactly [[../Debugging_and_signal_handling#System_signals|later]], when we talk about signals.

===Job control tools and job status===
We mentioned before that the POSIX 1003.1 standard has standardized a number of the job control tools that were included for job control in the jsh shell and its successors. We've already looked at a couple of these tools; in this section we will cover the complete list.

The standard list of job control tools consists of the following:

;bg:Moves a job to the background.
;fg:Moves a job to the foreground.
;jobs:Lists the active jobs.
;kill:Terminate a job or send a signal to a process.
;CTRL+C:Terminate a job (same as 'kill' using the SIGTERM signal).
;CRTL+Z:Suspend a foreground job.
;wait:Wait for background jobs to terminate.

All of these commands can take a job specification as an argument. A job specification starts with a percent sign and can be any of the following:

;%n:A job ID (n is  number).
;%s:The job whose command-line started with the string s.
;%?s:The jobs whose command-lines ''contained'' the string s.
;%%:The current job (i.e. the most recent one that you managed using job control).
;%+:The current job (i.e. the most recent one that you managed using job control).
;%-:The previous job.

We've already looked at 'bg', 'fg', and CTRL+Z and we'll cover 'kill' in a [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Debugging_and_signal_handling#Trap|later section]]. That leaves us with 'jobs' and 'wait'. Let's start with the simplest one:

{{bcode:Example|'''wait''' [''job spec''] ...
|Where ''job spec'' is a specification as listed above.}}

'Wait' is what you call a ''synchronization mechanism'': it causes the invoking process to suspend until all background jobs terminate. Or, if you include one or more job specifications, until the jobs you list have terminated. You use 'wait' if you have fired off multiple jobs (simply to make use of a system's parallel processing capabilities) and you cannot proceed safely until they're all done.

The 'wait' command is used in quite advanced scripting. In other words, you might not use it all that often. Here's a command that you probably will use regularly though:

{{bcode:Example|'''jobs''' [-lnprs] [''job spec''] ...
|Where &lt;br/&gt;
* -l lists the process IDs as well as normal output
* -n limits the output to information about jobs whose status has changed since the last status report
* -p lists only the process ID of the jobs' process group leader
* -r limits output to data on running jobs
* -s limits output to data on stopped jobs
* ''job spec'' is a specification as listed above}}

The ''jobs'' command reports information and status about active jobs (don't confuse active with running!). It is important to remember though, that this command reports on jobs and not processes. Since a job is local to a shell, the 'jobs' command cannot see across shells. The 'jobs' command is a primary source of information on jobs that you can apply job control to; for starters, you'll use this command to retrieve job IDs if you don't remember them. For example, consider the following:

{{code:Output|Using 'jobs' to report on jobs
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ CNT0=0
$ while [ $CNT0 -lt 200000 ]; do echo $CNT0 &gt;&gt; outtemp0.txt; CNT0=`expr $CNT0 + 1`; done&amp;
[1] 26859
$ CNT1=0
$ while [ $CNT1 -lt 200000 ]; do echo $CNT1 &gt;&gt; outtemp1.txt; CNT1=`expr $CNT1 + 1`; done&amp;
[2] 31331
$ jobs&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;[1]-  Running                 while [ $CNT0 -lt 200000 ]; do
    echo $CNT0 &gt;&gt; outtemp0.txt; CNT0=`expr $CNT0 + 1`;
done &amp;
[2]+  Running                 while [ $CNT1 -lt 200000 ]; do
    echo $CNT1 &gt;&gt; outtemp1.txt; CNT1=`expr $CNT1 + 1`;
done &amp;&lt;/pre&gt;
|The 'jobs' command reports the state of active commands, including the command line and job IDs. It also indicates the current job (with a +) and the last job (with a -).}}

Speaking of state (which is reported by the 'jobs' command), this is a good time to talk about the different states we have. Jobs can be in any of several states, sometimes even in more than one state at the same time. The 'jobs' command reports on state directly after the job id and order. We recognize the following states:

;Running:This is where the job is doing what it's supposed to do. You probably don't need to interrupt it unless you really want to give the program your personal attention (for example, to stop the program, or to find out how far through a file download has proceeded). You'll generally find that anything in the foreground that's not waiting for your attention is in this state, unless it's been put to sleep.
;Sleeping:When programs need to retrieve input that's not yet available, there is no need for them to continue using CPU resources. As such, they will enter a sleep mode until another batch of input arrives. You will see more sleeping processes, since they are not as likely to be processing data at an exact moment of time.  
;Stopped:The &lt;b&gt;stopped&lt;/b&gt; state indicates that the program was stopped by the operating system.  This usually occurs when the user suspends a foreground job (e.g. pressing CTRL-Z) or if it receives SIGSTOP.  At that point, the job cannot actively consume CPU resources and aside from still being loaded in memory, won't impact the rest of the system.  It will resume at the point where it left off once it receives the SIGCONT signal or is otherwise resumed from the shell. The difference between sleeping and stopped is that &quot;sleep&quot; is a form of waiting until a planned event happens, whereas &quot;stop&quot; can be user-initiated and indefinite.
;Zombie:A '''zombie''' process appears if the parent's program terminated before the child could provide its return value to the parent.  These processes will get cleaned up by the ''init'' process but sometimes a reboot will be required to get rid of them.

===Other job control related tools===
In the [[#Job_control_tools_and_job_status|last section]] we discussed the standard facilities that are available for job control in the Unix shell. However, there are also a number of non-standard tools that you might come across. And even though the focus of this book is Bourne Shell scripting (particularly as the lingua franca of Unix shell scripting) these tools are so common that we would be remiss if we did not at least mention them.

====Shell commands you might come across====
In addition to the tools previously discussed, there are two shell commands that are quite common: 'stop' and 'suspend'.

{{bcode:Example|'''stop''' ''job ID''}}

The 'stop' command is a command that occurs in the shells of many System V-compatible Unix systems. It is used to suspend background processes &amp;mdash; in other words, it is the equivalent of 'CTRL+Z' for background processes. It usually takes a job ID, like most of these commands. On systems that do not have a 'stop' command, you should be able to stop background processes by using the 'kill' command to send a SIGSTOP signal to the background process.

{{bcode:Example|'''suspend''' ''job ID''&lt;br/&gt;'''suspend''' [-f]}}

The other command you might come across is the 'suspend' command. The 'suspend' command is a little tricky though, since it doesn't always mean the same thing on all systems and all shells. There are two variations known to the authors at this time, both of which are shown above. The first, obvious one takes a job ID argument and suspends the indicated job; really it's just the same as 'CTRL+Z'. 

The second variant of 'suspend' doesn't take a job ID at all, which is because it doesn't suspend any random job. Rather, it suspends the execution of the shell in which the command was issued. In this variant the -f argument indicates the shell should be suspended even if it is a login shell. To resume the shell execution, send it a SIGCONT signal using the 'kill' command.

====The process snapshot utility====
The last tool we will discuss is the process snapshot utility, 'ps'. This utility is not a shell tool at all, but it occurs in some variant on pretty much every system and you will want to use it often. Possibly more often even than the 'jobs' tool.

The 'ps' utility is meant to report on running processes in the system. Processes, not jobs &amp;mdash; meaning it can see across shell instances. Here's an example of the 'ps' utility:

{{code:Output|Using the 'ps' utility
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ps x&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;PID    TTY     STAT  TIME    COMMAND
32094  tty5    R     3:37:21 /bin/sh
37759  tty5    S     0:00:00 /bin/ps&lt;/pre&gt;
|Typical output, including process state.}}

Typical process output includes the process ID, the ID of the terminal the process is connected to (or running on), the CPU time the process has taken and the command issued to start the process. Possibly you also get a process state. The process state is indicated by a letter code, but by-and-large the same states are reported as for job reports: '''R'''unning, '''S'''leeping, s'''T'''opped and '''Z'''ombie. Different 'ps' implementations may use different or more codes though.

The main problem with writing about 'ps' is that it is not exactly standardized, so there are different command-line option sets available. You'll have to check the documentation on your system for specific details. Some options are quite common though, so we will list them here:

;-a:List all processes except group leader processes.
;-d:List all processes except session leaders.
;-e:List all processes, without taking into account user id and other access limits.
;-f:Produce a full listing as output (i.e. all reporting options).
;-g ''list'':Limit output to processes whose group leader process IDs are mentioned in ''list''.
;-l:Produce a long listing.
;-p ''list'':Limit output to processes whose process IDs are mentioned in ''list''.
;-s ''list'':Limit output to processes whose session leader process IDs are mentioned in ''list''.
;-t ''list'':Limit output to processes running on terminals mentioned in ''list''.
;-u ''list'':Limit output to processes owned by user accounts mentioned in ''list''.

The 'ps' tool is useful for monitoring jobs across shell instances and for discovering process IDs for signal transmission.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;لو&lt;/font&gt; (lau)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;لو &lt;/font&gt;(lau) means if. But it has a more specific use than the English word &quot;if&quot;. &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لو &lt;/font&gt;(lau) is used for events that didn't happen. For example if the following sentence were translated into Arabic with the word&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لو &lt;/font&gt;(lau) as a translation for the word &quot;if&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
If I had been trained, I wouldn't have made mistakes.&lt;br&gt;
Then a person who read the translation, understands that the person saying the sentence was NOT trained. Using &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لو &lt;/font&gt;(lau) makes sure this doesn't happen.
&lt;br&gt;
Speaker 1: If I were stupid, then...&lt;br&gt;
Listener 1: Were you stupid?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;then&quot; word for&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لو&lt;/font&gt;  is&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; لـ&lt;/font&gt; . It is added to the beginning of the word.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لو ..1..لـ ...2...ـ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
if ...1.... then ...2....&lt;br&gt;
example: If I didn't go to school, my mom would get angry (but I did go to school).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لم أهزمهم&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
lam ahzim-hum&lt;br&gt;
lam--ah-zim-hum&lt;br&gt;
(I) hadn't beaten them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لو لم أهزمهم لكانو هزموني&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
lau lam ahzim-hum la-kaanoo hazamoo-nee&lt;br&gt;
lau--lam--ah-zim-hum--la-kaa-noo--ha-za-moo-nee&lt;br&gt;
If I didn't beat them up they would beat me up. (assuming the speaker did &quot;beat them up&quot;)&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although the Vocational Series Honors were once antiquated as a category they have again returned to regular use.  Some of them use outdated forms and skills, their preservation however is excellent for the history and skill development of the youth.  If you are considering submitting an updated version of one these Honors to the NAD, please consider creating an additional honor rather than a replacement Honor.  Forms for submitting new honors are available through [http://www.pathfindersonline.org pathfindersonline] and [http://www.xtremeyouthresources.org Xtremeyouthresources.org], and submitting them for piloting through these resources can give them more public attention.

Do you think this is funny? Anyway, Wikibooks is not a jokebook, this textbook is completely useless.

 Please, for God's sake, keep tabs on people who edit this page. They're probably dangerous psychotics who you'll see on the news some day.

You'd better stop a bit. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 07:06, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

I think I have a reasonable suggestion for the Finals section
The line:

aau	ow as in &quot;bow&quot;

Is that 'bow' as in a knot ('Tie a bow in the ribbon')
or
'bow' as in the front of a ship?

In the first case you could use 'rainbow' and in the second case you could probably use 'power' to prevent any confusion.

---------------------------------
I think I'm going to try to incorporate some IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbols in here. I think it'll be helpful for people who have experience with IPA. Of course, I'm going to leave the current examples for people who don't use IPA.

Some of this Yale is being mis-explained.  Here are some changes I'm making.  Let me say, thank GOODNESS it's Yale that's being used here.  It's by far the clearest system around.  The other romanisations are bizarre, unnatural, and/or difficult.
*b - as in 'spa'... this takes away the aspiration from the b sound.  This may be barely more correct (not even sure about that), but the difference is really not noticeable, and it's not worth the confusion.  Just use a regular b example.
*d - as in 'stick'... same issue of unnecessary confusion.  Use a regular d.
*g - same thing.
*j - z as in Mozart... this is partially correct.  It's not a standard j, but it's not strictly that dz as in Mozart.
*ch - cats... also a blend.
*gw - same faux non-aspiration.
*aau - good comment earlier.
*aam - no l sound...
*aan - pawn has too much of an o sound.

Uh... et cetera.  You can check the history page for the rest.  Please add your corrections if you think I got it wrong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
A Network is essentially a group of computers hooked up by cable or wireless signal. Networks are especially important these days, since they let you share high-speed Internet connections among more than one computer. This chapter will show you how to set up and maintain your very own network of all Macs or a mix of Macs and PCs.

=Types of Network Connections =

==Ethernet==

===Setting Up===

===Maintaining===

==Airport (Wireless Networking)==

===Setting Up===

===Maintaining===

==Firewire==

===Setting Up===

=Things You Can Do On A Network=

==Share an Internet Connection==
You can share your Internet connection by opening System Preferences, and selecting the the ''Sharing'' pane. Go to the ''Internet'' tab, and use the drop-down menu to choose which connection to share. Then check the box(es) of the interfaces you want to share your connection through. If you are sharing through AirPort press the ''AirPort Options...'' button to configure the wireless network. Now press the ''Start'' button to start sharing your connection. The ''Start'' button will change to ''Stop'', which you can press to stop sharing.

==Share Files==

==Mount a Network Disk==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Command Line==
A more advanced way of accessing the command line is if you have an application like Apple's X11 or XDarwin installed. These allow you to use a range of  Unix shells (including bash, csh, ksh, zsh, and tcsh), assuming you have such shells installed on your system.

There are two ways to bypass Apple's Aqua altogether and load Dawin with a Command Line Interface. 
You can enter a console on a per session basis by entering your username as &quot;&gt;console&quot; (without quotes). (If you have an automated logon, or a selection of user names instead of an area to type the username you can use &quot;System Preferances&quot; and under &quot;Accounts&quot; you can select login options and and change &quot;Display login window as&quot; to &quot;Name and Password.&quot; If the Mac is booted up and showing you a list of users, you can switch it to the field-based login by pressing option-return. You may need to first move the selection by pressing any key to highlight one of the listed users.) [Note that 'Enable Firewall Logging' must be turned off in Sharing Preferences or this method will not work.]   

The second method will drop you in the console each time you start up. To do this open a terminal and type: &lt;br&gt;
''&quot;sudo nano /etc/ttys''&quot; &lt;br&gt;
You should see something like this (the #s mark the start of a comment):

 #
 #       @(#)ttys        5.2 (Berkeley) 6/10/93
 #
 # name  getty                           type    status          comments
 #
 # If the console is marked insecure, single-user requires
 # the root password.
 #console        &quot;/usr/libexec/getty std.9600&quot;   vt100   on secure
 console &quot;/System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app/Contents/MacOS/loginwindow&quot;

Notice the two lines that start with the word &quot;console&quot;? The first one is commented out, which means that the second is used. The second loads the LoginWindow. To bypass LoginWindow, comment out its line by preceding it with a # mark. The nano editor does not wrap the line, so be careful that during your changes parts of the LoginWindow line don't get pushed down to the next line. If they do, use backspace to move them back, being careful to maintain white space.

Now uncomment the first console line. You've now switched which of the two lines is commented out. Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X. Reboot your system and you should now see your system's complete boot process and then be presented with a standard BSD-style login.

You can swap the two comments round again, if you decide you don't want to boot into the console. When in the console and you decide you want a minimal GUI, you can install X11, and type: &lt;br&gt;
''&quot;sudo /usr/X11R6/bin/startx&quot;'' &lt;br&gt;
to start the X GUI server.

By typing the following:&lt;br&gt;
''sudo /usr/sbin/nvram boot-args=&quot;-v&quot; '' &lt;br&gt;
you can stop the graphical loader, and get a chance to see what apple does when booting. You can get this same reaction by pressing Comand-v shortly after the startup chime and holding it down until you see plain text appear in the upper-left or the screen.

==X11==
Outside of Mac OS X, most [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX UNIX] applications sporting a graphical interface rely on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11 X11]. X11 refers to version 11 of the X Window System protocol. Versions of Mac OS X since 10.3 (Panther) have shipped with Apple's implementation of X11, based heavily on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86 XFree86 Project]. In addition to the actual implementation of the X11 protocol, Apple's X11 distribution includes a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager window manager] (very loosely analogous to a theme or skin in modern graphical interfaces) that makes windows created by most X11 applications appear as standard Mac OS X Aqua windows. Quartz-wm, as it is called, also allows X11 windows to be minimized to the Mac OS X dock.

In addition, Apple's X11 is capable of running both in full screen, or rootless mode. In full screen mode, as its name implies, X11 takes control of the user's entire screen. It is possible to switch back and forth between the standard Mac OS X desktop and X11 on-the-fly, but this is a wholesale switch, and repeating it frequently quickly becomes cumbersome. To alleviate this, rootless mode is provided. Instead of taking control of a user's entire screen area, rootless mode allows X11 and Mac OS X applications to run side by side.

To start X11 in fullscreen mode, call startx from the terminal as:
startx -- -fullscreen

To start X11 in rootless mode (default), call startx as
startx -- -rootless

Apple's implementation of X11 is designed to allow UNIX and Linux applications to be more easily ported to Mac OS X. It is a fairly standard X11 distribution, and as such is still configured primarily through configuration files stored throughout the system. Setting up a customized X11 environment is not easily done by users who have never before used the X Window System, and most users may never realise the need for, nor use Mac OS X's X11 environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">EJB stands for Enterprise JavaBeans. Freshers should not confuse this with Java Beans of Core Java.

== Introduction ==
This page is about Enterprise JavaBeans 2.1. It also covers EJB 2.0, which is still in widespread use.  Just as the Java platform has revolutionized the way we think about software development, Enterprise JavaBeans has revolutionized the way we think about developing mission-critical enterprise software. It combines server-side components with distributed object technologies, asynchronous messaging, and web services to greatly simplify the task of application development. It automatically takes into account many of the requirements of business systems, including security, resource pooling, persistence, concurrency, and transactional integrity.

This book shows you how to use Enterprise JavaBeans to develop scalable, portable business systems. But before we can start talking about EJB itself, we'll need a brief introduction to the technologies addressed by EJB, such as component models, distributed objects, asynchronous messaging, and web services. It's particularly important to have a basic understanding of component transaction monitors, the technology that lies beneath EJB.

It is assumed that you're already familiar with Java; if you're not, read [[Java Programming]] first. This book also assumes that you're conversant in the JDBC API, or at least in SQL. If you're not familiar with JDBC, see [[Java JDBC using SQLite]].

One of Java's most important features is platform independence. Since it was first released, Java has been marketed as &quot;write once, run anywhere.&quot; While the hype has gotten a little heavy-handed at times, code written with Sun's Java programming language is remarkably platform-independent. Enterprise JavaBeans isn't just platform-independent—it's also  implementation-independent. If you've worked with JDBC, you know a little about what this means. Not only can the JDBC API run on a Windows machine or on a Unix machine, it can also access relational databases of many different vendors (DB2, Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, etc.) by using different JDBC drivers. You don't have to code to a particular database implementation—just change JDBC drivers, and you change databases. It's the same with EJB. Ideally, an EJB component—an enterprise bean—can run in any application server that implements the EJB specification.  This means that you can develop and deploy your EJB business system in one  server, such as BEA's WebLogic, and later move it to a different EJB server, such as Pramati, Sybase EAServer, IBM's WebSphere, or an open source project such as Apache Geronimo, OpenEJB, JOnAS, or JBoss. Implementation independence means that your business components are not dependent on the brand of server, which gives you many more options before, during, and after development and deployment.

In addition to supporting distributed business objects, Enterprise JavaBeans supports asynchronous messaging. EJB 2.1 also allows enterprise beans to be exposed as web services, so that their methods can be invoked by other J2EE applications as well as applications written in other programming languages on a variety of platforms. Web services in EJB 2.1 supports both RPC-style and document-style messaging.  Support for web services is based on a new web service API: JAX-RPC.

== Server-Side Components ==
Object-oriented  languages such as Java, C++, and C# are used to write software that is flexible, extensible, and reusable—the three axioms of object-oriented development. In business systems, object-oriented languages are used to improve development of GUIs, to simplify access to data, and to encapsulate the business logic. The encapsulation of business logic into business objects is a fairly recent focus in the information-technology industry. Business is fluid, which means that a business's products, processes, and objectives evolve over time. If the software that models the business can be encapsulated into business objects, it becomes flexible, extensible, and reusable, and therefore evolves as the business evolves.

A server-side component model may define an architecture for developing distributed business objects that combine the accessibility of distributed object systems with the fluidity of objectified business logic. Server-side component models are used on the middle-tier application servers, which manage the components at runtime and make them available to remote clients. They provide a baseline of functionality that makes it easy to develop distributed business objects and assemble them into business solutions.

Server-side components can also be used to model other aspects of a business system, such as presentation and routing. The Java servlet, for example, is a server-side component that is used to generate HTML and XML data for the presentation layer of a three-tier architecture. EJB 2.1 message-driven beans, which are discussed later in this book, are server-side components that can be used to consume and process asynchronous messages.

Server-side components, like other components, can be bought and sold as independent pieces of executable software. They conform to a standard component model and can be executed without direct modification in a server that supports that component model. Server-side component models often support attribute-based programming, which allows the runtime behavior of the component to be modified when it is deployed, without having to change the programming code in the component. Depending on the component model, the server administrator can declare a server-side component's transactional, security, and even persistence behavior by setting these attributes to specific values.

As an organization's services, products, and operating procedures evolve, server-side components can be reassembled, modified, and extended so that the business system reflects those changes. Imagine a business system as a collection of server-side components that model concepts such as customers, products, reservations, and warehouses. Each component is like a Lego&amp;trade; block that can be combined with other components to build a business solution. Products can be stored in the warehouse or delivered to a customer; a customer can make a reservation or purchase a product. You can assemble components, take them apart, use them in different combinations, and change their definitions. A business system based on server-side components is fluid because it is objectified, and it is accessible because the components can be distributed.
 
== Enterprise JavaBeans Defined ==
Oracle's definition of  Enterprise JavaBeans is:

:''&quot;The Enterprise JavaBeans architecture is a component architecture for the development and deployment of component-based distributed business applications. Applications written using the Enterprise JavaBeans architecture are scalable, transactional, and multi-user secure. These applications may be written once, and then deployed on any server platform that supports the Enterprise JavaBeans specification.&quot;''

That's a mouthful, but it's not atypical of how Sun defines many of its Java technologies—have you ever read the definition of the Java language itself? It's about twice as long. This book offers a shorter definition of EJB:

Enterprise JavaBeans is a standard server-side component model for distributed business applications.

What this means is the EJB offers a standard model for building server-side components that represent both business objects (customers, items in inventory, and the like) and business processes (purchasing, stocking, and so on).  Once you have built a set of components that fit the requirements of your business, you can combine them to create business applications.  On top of that, as “distributed” components, they don’t all have to reside on the same server:  Components can reside wherever it’s most convenient:
a Customer component &quot;live&quot; near the Customer database, a Part component can “live” near the inventory database, and a Purchase business-process component can “live” near the user interface: you can do whatever’s necessary for minimizing latency, sharing the processing load, or maximizing reliability.

== Distributed Object Architectures ==
To understand EJB, you need to understand how distributed objects work. Distributed object systems are the foundation for modern three-tier architectures. In a three-tier architecture, as shown in Figure 1-1, the presentation logic resides on the client (first tier), the business logic resides on the middle tier (second tier), and other resources, such as the database, reside on the backend (third tier).

=== Figure 1-1. Three-tier architecture ===
All distributed object protocols are built on the same basic architecture, which is designed to make an object on one computer look like it's residing on a different computer. Distributed object architectures are based on a network communication layer that is really simple. Essentially, there are three parts to this architecture: the business object, the skeleton, and the stub.

The business object resides on the middle tier. It's an instance of an object that models the state and business logic of some real-world concept, such as a person, order, or account. Every business object class has matching stub and skeleton classes built specifically for that type of business object. For example, a distributed business object called &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; would have matching &lt;code&gt;PersonStub&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PersonSkeleton&lt;/code&gt; classes. As shown in Figure 1-2, the business object and skeleton reside on the middle tier, and the stub resides on the client.

The stub and the skeleton are responsible for making the business object on the middle tier look as if it is running locally on the client machine. This is accomplished through some kind of [[Java Programming/Remote Method Invocation|Remote Method Invocation]] (RMI) protocol. An RMI protocol is used to communicate method invocations over a network. CORBA, Java RMI, and Microsoft .NET all use their own protocols.  Every instance of the business object on the middle tier is wrapped by an instance of its matching skeleton class. The skeleton is set up on a port and IP address and listens for requests from the stub, which resides on the client machine and is connected via the network to the skeleton. The stub acts as the business object's surrogate on the client and is responsible for communicating requests from the client to the business object through the skeleton. Figure 1-2 illustrates the process of communicating a method invocation from the client to the server object and back. The stub and the skeleton hide the communication specifics of the RMI protocol from the client and the implementation class, respectively.

=== Figure 1-2. RMI loop ===
The business object implements a public interface that declares its business methods. The stub implements the same interface as the business object, but the stub's methods do not contain business logic. Instead, the business methods on the stub implement whatever networking operations are required to forward the request to the business object and receive the results. When a client invokes a business method on the stub, the request is communicated over the network by streaming the name of the method invoked, and the values passed in as parameters, to the skeleton. When the skeleton receives the incoming stream, it parses the stream to discover which method is requested, then invokes the corresponding business method on the business object. Any value that is returned from the method invoked on the business object is streamed back to the stub by the skeleton. The stub then returns the value to the client application as if it had processed the business logic locally.

== Component Models ==
The term ''component model'' has many different interpretations. Enterprise JavaBeans specifies a server-side component model. Using a set of classes and interfaces from the &lt;code&gt;javax.ejb&lt;/code&gt; package, developers can create, assemble, and deploy components that conform to the EJB specification.
The original  JavaBeans&amp;trade; is also a component model, but it's not a server-side component model like EJB. In fact, other than sharing the name &quot;JavaBeans,&quot; these two component models are completely unrelated. In the past, a lot of the literature referred to EJB as an extension of the original JavaBeans, but it was a misrepresentation. The two APIs serve very different purposes, and EJB does not extend or use the original.

== JavaBeans component model ==
JavaBeans is intended to be used for intra process purposes, while EJB is designed for inter process components. In other words, the original JavaBeans was not intended for distributed components. JavaBeans can be used to solve a variety of problems, but it is primarily used to build clients by assembling visual (GUI) and nonvisual widgets. It's an excellent component model, possibly the best one ever devised for intraprocess development, but it's not a server-side component model. EJB, on the other hand, is explicitly designed to address issues involved with managing distributed business objects in a three-tier architecture.

Given that JavaBeans and Enterprise JavaBeans are completely different, why are they both called component models? In this context, a component model defines a set of contracts between the component developer and the system that hosts the component. The contracts express how a component should be developed and packaged. Once a component is defined, it becomes an independent piece of software that can be distributed and used in other applications. A component is developed for a specific purpose but not a specific application. In the original JavaBeans, a component might be a push button or a spreadsheet that can be used in any GUI application according to the rules specified in the original JavaBeans component model. In EJB, there are several different types of components: components that represent entities in a database (entity beans) have a slightly different contract with their container than components that represent business processes (session beans).  For example, a component might be a Customer business object, represented by an entity bean, that can be deployed in any EJB server and used to develop any business application that needs a customer business object. Another type of component might be a &lt;code&gt;MakePurchase&lt;/code&gt; object, represented by a session bean, that models what happens when a customer buys a particular product.  (Although the act of making a purchase isn’t itself represented in a database, a purchase involves a complex interaction between a customer, a sales person, inventory, accounts receivable, and possibly other entities).  The &lt;code&gt;MakePurchase&lt;/code&gt; object has a different contract with its container than the &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; object, but it too can still be deployed in any EJB server and used in any business application that needs to support purchases.  A third type of EJB, the MessageDrivenBean, has a slightly different contract with its container—but it, too, can be deployed in any EJB server.

== Competing Component Models:  Microsoft's .NET Framework ==
Enterprise JavaBeans did not appear out of nowhere; it is one of a number of component transaction monitors (CTMs), which in turn have their origin in older transaction processing monitors (such as Tuxedo) and Object Request Brokers. However, the most important competition for EJB is Microsoft’s .NET framework.  .NET has its origins in the Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which was arguably the first commercially available CTM.  MTS was later renamed COM+. Microsoft's COM+ is based on the  Component Object Model (COM), originally designed for use on the desktop but eventually pressed into service as a server-side component model. For distributed access, COM+ clients use the  Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).

When MTS was introduced in 1996, it was an exciting development because it provided a comprehensive environment for business objects. With MTS, application developers could write COM components without worrying about system-level concerns. Once a business object was designed to conform to the COM model, MTS (and now COM+) took care of everything else, including transaction management, concurrency, and resource management.

COM+ has become part of Microsoft's new .NET Framework. The core functionality provided by COM+ services remains essentially the same in .NET, but the way it appears to a developer has changed significantly. Rather than writing components as COM objects, .NET Framework developers build applications as managed objects. All managed objects, and in fact all code written for the .NET Framework, depends on a  Common Language Runtime (CLR). For Java-oriented developers, the CLR is much like a Java virtual machine (VM), and a managed object is analogous to an instance of a Java class; i.e., to a Java object.

The .NET Framework provides first class support web services via the  SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) protocol, which enables business components in the .NET world to communicate with applications on any other platform written in any language. This can potentially make business components in .NET universally accessible, a feature that is not easily dismissed.  In fact, .NET was the impetus that motivated Sun Microsystems to extend EJB and the rest of the J2EE platform to support web services.  Microsoft's .NET platform represents the greatest threat to the dominance of the Java platform since the Java programming language was introduced in 1995.

Although the .NET Framework provides many interesting features, it falls short as an open standard. The COM+ services in the .NET Framework are Microsoft's proprietary CTM, which means that using this technology binds you to the Microsoft platform. If your company plans to deploy server-side components on a non-Microsoft platform, .NET is not a viable solution. In addition, the COM+ services in the .NET Framework are focused on stateless components; there's no built-in support for persistent transactional objects. Although stateless components can offer higher performance, business systems need the kind of flexibility offered by CTMs, which include stateful and persistent components.

== Benefits of a Standard Server-Side Component Model ==
What does it mean to be a standard server-side component model? Quite simply, it means that you can develop business objects using the Enterprise JavaBeans component model and expect them to work  in any application server that supports the complete EJB specification. This is a pretty powerful statement, because it largely eliminates the biggest problem faced by potential customers of Microsoft .NET products: fear of vendor &quot;lock-in.&quot; With a standard server-side component model, customers can commit to using an EJB-compliant application server with the knowledge that they can migrate to a better server if one becomes available. Obviously, care must be taken when using proprietary extensions developed by vendors, but this is nothing new. Even in the relational database industry—which has been using the SQL standard for a couple of decades—optional proprietary extensions abound.

Having a standard server-side component model has benefits beyond implementation independence. A standard component model provides a vehicle for growth in the third-party products. If numerous vendors support EJB, creating add-on products and component libraries is more attractive to software vendors. The IT industry has seen this type of cottage industry grow up around other standards, such as SQL; hundreds of add-on products can now be purchased to enhance business systems with data that is stored in SQL-compliant relational databases. Report-generating tools and data-warehouse products are typical examples. The  GUI component industry has also seen the growth of its own third-party products. A healthy market for component libraries already exists for GUI component models such as Sun's original JavaBeans component model.

Many third-party products for Enterprise JavaBeans exist today. Add-on products for credit card processing, legacy database access, and other business services have been introduced for various EJB-compliant systems. These types of products make development of EJB systems simpler and faster than the alternatives, making the EJB component model attractive to corporate IS and server vendors alike. The market for prepackaged EJB components is growing in several domains, including sales, finance, education, web-content management, collaboration, and other areas.

== Titan Cruises: An Imaginary Business ==
To make things a little easier, and more fun, we will discuss all the concepts in this book in the context of one imaginary business, a cruise line called ''Titan''. A cruise line makes a particularly interesting example because it incorporates several different businesses: it has ship cabins that are similar to hotel rooms, it serves meals like a restaurant, it offers various recreational opportunities, and it needs to interact with other travel businesses.

This type of business is a good candidate for a distributed object system because many of the system's users are geographically dispersed. Commercial travel agents, for example, who need to book passage on Titan ships will need to access the reservation system. Supporting many—possibly hundreds—of travel agents requires a robust transactional system to ensure that agents have access and that reservations are completed properly.
Throughout this book, we will build a fairly simple slice of Titan's EJB system that focuses on the process of making a reservation for a cruise. This exercise will give us an opportunity to develop Ship, Cabin, TravelAgent, ProcessPayment, and other enterprise beans. In the process, you will need to create relational database tables for persisting data used in the example. It is assumed that you are familiar with relational database management systems and that you can create tables according to the SQL statements provided. EJB can be used with any kind of database or legacy application, but relational databases seem to be the most commonly understood database, so I have chosen this as the persistence layer.

== What's Next? ==
To develop business objects using EJB, you have to understand the life cycle and architecture of EJB components. This means understanding conceptually how EJB's components are managed and made available as distributed objects.

The way the Swiss watch industry worked was that there were a very few companies that made most of their own parts--Most bought either complete movements or Ébauches (&quot;movement kits&quot;) from one of a few movement houses (now mostly owned by the Swatch group), and frequently bought cases from someone, and dials from someone, and...  Sometimes these would be assembled by the brand, other times they were assembled by someone else.  

This isn't unique to the Swiss--American watch companies worked in a similar way. When you bought an early Elgin or Waltham pocketwatch, you usually bought a movement with dial and hands, and had it cased by your local jeweler in a case of your choice, sold by an unrelated company.   The difference here is that your watch would be known as an Elgin, rather than by the name of the casemaker or whoever assembled it. 

The good news is that you can usually identify the movement used in these &quot;generic Swiss&quot; watches, and that will give at least a few clues as to quality, market and era.  Most of these will have a movement number--Usually under the balance wheel, sometimes on a bridge and occasionally on the dial side of the main plate.  Roland Ranfft has a great [http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&amp;ranfft&amp;&amp;uswk Movement Database] with a search feature and great illustrations--Type whatever you think the number is, and see if it matches the picture.

Incidentally, the R-Swiss-R is a clue that the watch dial is before 1968, and likely sometime in the 1950's or older.  The R stands for Radium, used to make the hands glow in early watches.  In many ways it was superior to modern glow, as it would glow for years without exposure to light.  Unfortunately it is also slightly dangerous.  Radium was replaced by Tritium, a weaker and much, much safer radioactive compound, and later by Luminova and Lumabright, phosphor-based chemicals that will glow for many hours after brief exposure to light.   Some replica watches will have Tritium markings, even though they use non-Tritium lume.

      <comment>Non timex mainsprings</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Generic instructions for cleaning a Timex pinlever mechanical or a similar non-jeweled movement.  This is a modification from the official 1966 Timex service manual procedure.   If using these steps on a non-Timex, you need to handle the mainspring differently--Timex has a lubricating coating that isn't removed by watch cleaning solutions.  Other watches will either need the mainspring to be re-lubricated (preferably) or at least removed prior to cleaning so the existing lube isn't washed away. 

This is essentially a rough draft. If you have questions, please ask in the discussion section. 

Most &quot;overwound&quot; &quot;wound too tight&quot; or similar mechanical watches are just dirty. Timex are particularly easy to clean, since little disassembly is needed.

Tools:

Case knife

Jeweler's screwdrivers

Cleaner

Watch oil

Oiler (or blunted insulin syringe)

I'd use household ammonia for about 5-10 minutes, followed by Ronsonol lighter fluid (Naphtha) as a rinse. I personally use L and R cleaning fluids in an L and R machine, but that's a bit extreme for normal people (I work on a couple of watches a week, and do mostly jeweled movements). Frequently naptha itself will work, but sometimes it won't remove heavy deposits.  Some have had success with shampoo or dish soap and water--However I recommend rinsing in Naphtha after any water-based solution. 

If the watch is not a Timex, let down the mainspring.  There should be a medium sized gear near the stem meshing with a larger one at the mainspring.  One of these gears will have the &quot;click&quot;, the device that keeps the mainspring from unwinding at the stem.  Wind the stem a tiny bit and hold pressure, and with a small screwdriver hold the click so it does not mesh with the gears.  Slowly let the stem unwind--if you begin to lose your grip, let the click go while you get your grip back.  

On most watches, remove the back, then remove the stem. In some cases the &quot;stem hole&quot; is between case and back, on these you will not need to remove the stem before moving the movement 

[[Image:Timex-movement496.jpg]]

Most Timex movements have a lever holding the stem, and you just back off the screw that holds the lever, don't completely remove it. Others have a lever that needs to be lifted off the stem--In this case, prying down with a screwdriver here will lift the lever off the stem.  

[[Image:TimexMovement505.jpg]]


Other movements may have a screw or button close to where the stem enters the movement--buttons get pushed, screws get backed out while trying to wiggle the stem out--stop when the stem comes out, you don't want to completely undo this screw.  A few movements can only be removed through the front, with a variety of methods of dealing with the stem.  In some  the back will come off to release the stem, some the bezel is removed and the stem is between the bezel and main case.  In a few a special wrench is needed to unscrew the crown. 

Remove the second hand if it's got one. I use a hand puller, it can be done with screwdrivers or tweezers. Before you remove hands, cut a slot in a piece of paper, and slide it over the dial, with the post for the hands in the slot. Try very hard to avoid bending the second hand pivot when you pull up, especially if you are using screwdrivers--Pry evenly on both sides at the same time. 

Remove the dial.  On a Timex and some other pinlevers, you can leave the hour and minute hands attached, on others you must remove the minute hand. Timex dials are held on by tabs that bend over the movement plate--Bend these as little as possible, and you can usually remove the dial while only bending two tabs.  (If you have to remove the dial again, try to remember to bend other tabs the next time)

[[Image:TimexMovement500.jpg]]

Other types may have posts that go through the plate with screws either at the top of the movement or along the side. (Adapting these instructions to other watches you probably want to remove the minute hand first, most are built differently than Timex)

On a Timex, I prefer to start with a partially wound watch, if it is fully wound, that's OK.

If you are doing a Timex automatic movement, you'll need to remove the rotor.  There are two holes in the rotor to access 2 screws.  Once these screws are removed, slide the rotor off sideways.  Lifting will damage the cam follower. 

The official Timex procedure says to remove the balance, but unless you're used to working with watches I think this step is more trouble than it is worth--Timing is guaranteed to be off by a good bit if you do this. I've had success with no further disassembly during cleaning, I now back the balance screw off a little bit. 

[[Image:TimexMovement503.jpg]]

For non-Timex watches with a balance cock, I will remove that. Carefully remove the cock and the balance without over-stretching or kinking the hairspring.  

A critical difference between Timex and other brands is the mainspring.  Timex has a permanent coating on the mainspring that both lubricates and protects from rust.  This allows Timex mainsprings to go through a cleaning machine without harm.  Other brands lack this coating-if you clean without re-lubricating the mainspring it is almost certain to rust and break in a fairly short time.  Because of this, you will also need to disassemble far enough to remove the mainsspring on non-Timex.  Sometimes this can be done with little disassembly, other times it will require a complete teardown.  It is better to leave a non-Timex mainspring uncleaned than to clean it without re-lubricating it. 

To remove the Timex balance you'll need to remove the little tapered brass peg where the hairspring attaches to the plate of the watch. Push the thin side with a screwdriver then remove with tweezers

[[Image:TimexMovement513.jpg]]

don't lose it.


Put the rest of the movement (as well as the balance if you've removed it) in the cleaner, ans swish it around for 5-10 minutes. If you use ammonia, follow with a Ronsonol rinse. The watch can sit in Ronsonol for a long time, don't go too long in ammonia, it will attack brass or copper parts.  If the ammonia starts to turn blue, that is a sign it is attacking, remove the movement immediately and rinse. Dry thoroughly.

If you did not remove the balance, remove the balance screw now. Fill it 3/4 full with watch oil. Fill the cup on the other side of the balance with about the same amount of oil--This will be the hardest part if you didn't remove the balance. Be really careful so you don't damage the hairspring, but you should be able to get just enough clearance to get oil into that cup.  Don't get oil on the hairspring--if you do, you will need to clean the oil off somehow, and the easiest method might be to re-clean the whole movement again. 

If you did remove the balance, replace it now, and get the balance screw in but not tight. The impulse peg of the balance wheel has to be on the same side as the fork--If you completely removed the balance you can rotate it around where it needs to be before you re-pin the hairspring, otherwise you just have to be careful. Tighten the balance screw so there is no play in the balance, but NO FARTHER!) If you removed the balance, re-pin the hairspring-This is easier if you use a bit of cleaning putty or similar (Handi-Tac, blue-tac or other &quot;thumbtack replacement&quot; putties are decent substitutes for Rodico cleaning putty) to hold the balance in place.

[[Image:TimexMovement3521.jpg]]
[[Image:TimexMovement524.jpg]]

The watch should start here, although the balance might not swing very far without oil. (This assumes the watch was wound when you started) If it doesn't start, make sure the balance screw isn't too tight, and gently turn the balance in both directions--If you feel _any_ resistance, stop--You've probably got the fork and impulse pin on opposite sides, fix that before continuing.

Oil all the pivots on both sides, with the smallest drops of oil you can.  Some watchmakers advocate not oiling the fork pivots. 

[[Image:TimexMovement525.jpg]]

Oil the impulse pin on the balance, and 3 teeth of the escape wheel. Don't oil the other movement gears, but do oil the gears on the outside of the plate and the ones the stem touches. The movement should be running well at this point, with at LEAST 1/2 turn of the balance at each cycle. I'd let it run for at least 20 minutes or so, ideally with a cover so dust doesn't fall on it. 

If you did not remove the hands, set the hands to exactly midnight and replace the dial. If you did remove all the hands, make sure the hour and minute wheels are in place, as well as the dial washer. Replace the hour hand, set it to an exact hour, then set the minute hand pointing to 12.  Replace the second hand.  Temporarily install the stem, set the watch and make sure the hands don't drag or foul on anything. Remove the stem, re-case the movement, re-install the stem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of the famous old American brands are now owned by other companies.  

Hamilton is now owned by the Swatch group, still makes mechanicals. 

Elgin is owned by MZ Berger, makes cheap quartz watches, mostly with Chinese manufacture. 

Gruen was an American brand using mostly Swiss parts, is now owned by MZ Berger, mostly cheap quartz.  Recently experimented with a Swiss Automatic, but failed. 

Waltham is now two separate brands.  MZ Berger owns the rights to the name in North America, Waltham International SA owns the brand in the rest of the world, concentrating on Japan. Waltham International was established by the original American Waltham. 

Timex is still basically the original company, Norwegian ownership, US headquarters, worldwide production.  

Bulova has had several ownership changes, but is still around, although with no US manufacturing. 

Accutron--Bulova moved the Accutron name to standard quartz watches, and now makes mechanical Accutrons.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is unofficial documentation of Brunswick's Business Integration Engine - BIE, and covers version 6.04. Development from the original team seems to have stopped, and a fork was started. The fork is called [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bie-gpl/ BIE-gpl], and a beta version of 6.05 is available for download. BIE is now sold by [http://www.redberri.com/bie Redberri].

== Introduction ==
Licensed under the [http://www.fsf.org/ Free Software Foundations'] [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html The GNU General Public License], Brunswick WDI's Business Integration Engine is [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html free (as in freedom) software] and [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#TOCCommercial available at no cost]. BIE can help you transform messages and transport messages between applications which does not have these capabilities.

BIE uses a number of free (as in freedom) software components as its foundation. The original contributions to the free software community are the web application Dashboard and the Java client Map Builder.

Dashboard lets you create workflows using drag-and-drop and connectivity in and out of BIE. The Map Builder helps you set up translation from one XML schema to another.

== Installation ==
=== GNU/Linux ===
* Download BIE 6.04 for your platform from Sourceforge.net at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=79291. Choose the zipped archive file bie-linux-6.0.4.tar.gz.
* Unzip the archive file any way you like. Here is one way using a console window:
 tar xfvz bie-linux-6.0.4.tar.gz
The result is a new subdirectory called bie-linux-6.0.4.
* Change to superuser mode or root with su, enter root's password.
* Change directory to the new subdirectory and type
 ./install.sh
to install BIE. A GUI opens up, just follow the instructions given. 
* The install defaults to /usr/local/BIE.
* Check the box Start BIE
* The default user is
 admin
and the default password is
 123qwe
* You are done.

==== Files and sub directories ====
See [[/File Tree Structure/]].

== Setup ==

Hit the Save button before testing.  

====== Test Mail Configuration ======
Run this test to see if your mail server is accessible by BIE
   
* Enter E-Mail Address - type your email address here

Hit the Run Test button.

==== JDBC Drivers ====
You can add database connections to BIE using JDBC drivers. BIE ships with a MySQL (won't work with new versions of MySql, e.g.:5.0,) ,  and an ODBC driver. You are using something else, you must add the appropriate driver.
===== Oracle =====
 Oracle driver can be added as follows. 
  1.	Click on the System --&gt; JDBC Drivers menu option
  2.	In the Manage JDBC Connections screen, click on “Register a Driver” link
  3.	In the “Register JDBC Driver” screen enter the parameters as follows
        a)	Driver Name : Oracle
        b)	Driver Class Name : oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
        c)	Driver Archive : ojdbc.jar 
        Click on the Register button.
  4.	Add a connection to the DUMMY schema as follows, Click on the Add Connection button against the newly registered      
        driver.
  5.	In the “Choose JDBC Driver” screen enter the values 
        a)	Select Driver :  Oracle (The driver that we added in the previous step)
        b)	Connection URL : jdbc:oracle:thin:@&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;:DUMMY
        Click on the continue button.
  6.    Set the connection properties as 
        a)  Connection Name: DUMMY
        b)  URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@&lt;HOSTNAME&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;:DUMMY
        c)  Username: username
        d)  Password: password
        Click on the “Save” button.
  7.	In the “Manage JDBC Connections” , we can find the newly added connection listed.
  8.    Click on the Test button next to the newly added connection .


===== MySQL =====
The MySQL JDBC driver that ships with BIE 6.04 is version 2.014, which does not appear to work with MySQL version 4.1.7 or newer. 
The latest stable MySQL JDBC driver is version 3.1.13, which may be downloaded from http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/j/
The latest driver solves the issue of connecting BIE to a MySQL on the same server, but you may need to add localhost.localdomain in the Host column to your User table in the MySQL database.

===== PostgreSQL =====

The PostgreSQL driver may be downloaded from http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html.

===== HSQLDB =====
BIE uses an internal Hypersonic database, now called HSQLDB, that contains configuration, state, and audit information. See 

===== Other JDBC drivers =====

[http://www.redmountainsw.com/wordpress/archives/jdbc-connection-urls Chui's counterpoint] lists a number of JDBC driver and JDBC URLs.

Some drivers like DB2 require more than one jar file. If so, just create a dummy driver for each extra jar file as a way to upload it. You may need to restart the BIE service before it notices the new jar files.

==== LDAP Connections ====
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol or LDAP is a protocol for querying directories. Here you can add your companies LDAP directory service.

==== Web Services ====

=== Workflow ===
==== Workflow ====
A common mistake/issue when trying to run a workflow, is not provide a start message.
The default config for a newly added workflow is to receive InputMessage, with the message format as StandardXML.
So, to start a worflow, you've got to provide at least a minimun xml tag, e.g.: &lt;ok/&gt;
Changing the format to StandardRaw will solve this issue.

==== Message Formats ====
BIE only understands XML, so you must express any input or output as XML schemas before you can use BIE. If you receive a file containing Comma Separated Values - CSV for short - BIE can help you generate the necessary schema.

== Map Builder - moving data between applications with XML Schemas ==
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. 

Map Builder is a Java application, which lets you load an input schema and output schema, and then use drag and drop to establish links between matching fields from the input schema to the output schema. Once a link is established, you may add processing instructions to the link, e.g. mathematical, logic, string operations and so on. 

The map is then saved as an XSLT transformation file, meaning it shows how input documents are converted to output documents.

=== Testing maps ===
IMPORTANT: Don't use a file with Comma Separated Values (CSV) when testing your map! A error box with the following message will appear:

 Error
 An unexpected error occurred.
 Source:
 Content is not allowed in prolog.

Hit the OK button to close the box.

CORRECT WAY: Use an XML version of the CSV file. The Dashboard can be used to generate the correct parsed XML output for a given message format. Copy and paste this parsed output to a file, and use this file for testing your map in Map Builder. See tutorial below for details.

== Tutorials ==
Some assumptions are made in the following tutorials:
* You have read the entire tutorial before proceeding, and understand that you follow the instructions at your own risk.
* You have administrator or root rights to the server where BIE is installed.
* BIE has been started. A standard installation on GNU/Linux can be started this way

 Lesson1.xsd
in the text field. DON'T HIT THE &quot;Save to Server&quot; button just yet.
:* Parsed Ouput - a BIE typo, should be Parsed Output. Select the parsed XML output, copy, and paste into a new file in your text editor. Save the file as 
 Lesson1.xml
:* NOW you can hit the &quot;Save to Server&quot; button. We did it this way to avoid back-button browser problems.
* Open Map Builder, and hit the &quot;Create a new map&quot; button in the top left corner. The steps is outlined to the left, and you can you select
 Lesson1.xsd
as your source schema, then hit the Next button.
* Select Lesson1 as the source schema's root element, and hit the Next button
* Select the suggested File Name for the base path for source includes/imports by hitting the Next button
* Select
 Lesson1.xsd
as your target schema. Yes, it's the same one, but for the purposes of this lesson it will do. Hit the Next button.
* Select Lesson1 as the target schema's root element, and hit the Next button.
* Select the suggested File Name for the base path for source includes/imports by hitting the Next button.
* Save the map file to the map folder with the file name
 Lesson12Lesson1.xml
by hitting the Finish button.
* The map is loaded with the source schema's fields on the left, and the destination schema's fields on the right.
* Click the source schema's row icon and hold down the mouse button while moving it to the destination schema's row icon before you let the mouse button go. You should now a blue link between the two schemas.
* Repeat the linking process - MyName to MyName, MyAddress to MyAddress, MyPhone to MyPhone, MyCountry to MyCountry.
* Hit the Compile XSLT button from the tool bar.
* Hit the Test XSLT transformation button, and select
 Lesson1.xml
* The Save result dialog opens, change the file name to
 Lesson1_transformed.xml
and hit the Save button.
* Open your text editor, and load the file
 Lesson1_transformed.xml
You should see that the data from the source fields have been accurately mapped to destination fields.
* Right-click the MyName field in the source schema and select Unlink. Do the same with MyAddress.
* Now link the source field MyName to the destination field MyAddress. Link the source field MyAddress to the destination field MyName.
* Save the new map.
* Compile the new map.
* Test XSLT transformation using
 Lesson1.xml
as the source file and save the result as Lesson1_transformed_again.xml
* Open
 Lesson1_transformed_again.xml
in your text editor. You should see that Joe Schmoe is now in the MyAddress field, and his address has become his name.

Lesson1 is now over. You should try BIE to find what works or not. Come back here and create new lessons. :-)

=== Lesson 2 - creating a workflow ===
In Lesson 1 you learned how to create a map between one XML Schema to another in Map Builder, and to test the transformation. The point of BIE is to automate these kinds of mappings, and that is what we are going to do in this lesson. This time we will be mostly working in the Dashboard, creating a workflow. 

To be continued... In the interim, please look at the JonesPubPO workflow.

=== Lesson 3 - validate input against DTD ===
=== Lesson X - setting up EDI of encrypted documents ===
An idea for a future lesson:

Health professionals exchange sensitive patient information electronically using encrypted XML Schemas. Referrals and reports are transported by the thousands every single day of the year. This lesson will describe the use of GNU Privacy Guard, perhaps Idealx X.509 Certificate Authority and BIE for this purpose.

==Description==

* Sen (س) makes the [s] sound as in &quot;see&quot;. Never pronounce it like a [z]. In English we often mix our [z] and [s] sounds subconsciously.
* Sħen (ش) makes the [ʃ] sound as in &quot;she&quot;. It is often spelled &quot;sh&quot; in English, but has several other spellings too.
* Sžaad (ص) makes the emphatic [sˁ] sound. Refer to the description of emphatic sounds in [[Arabic/LearnRW/Row_2|Row 2]].
* Džaad (ض) makes the [d̪ˁ] sound.&lt;ref&gt;Often pronounced as a [zˁ] in non-standard dialects&lt;/ref&gt; It is the same as د, only emphatic.
* Qaaf (ق) makes the [q] sound — another non-English sound. It is similar to [k], but it is pronounced farther back in the mouth, almost touching the very back.
* Laam (ل) makes the [l] sound as in &quot;lip&quot;. It might actually be [l̪], in which case it would be pronounced farther forward that the English version, with the tip of the tongue on the back of the teeth.
* Non (ن) makes the [n] sound as in &quot;now&quot;.

== 1. Write 200 words or give a three-minute oral report about the history of computers.== 
;1936: The first programmable computer is the Z1 originally created by Germany's Konrad Zuse in his parents living room in 1936 to 1938 is considered to be the first electrical binary programmable computer. The first digital computer, the ABC started being developed by Professor John Vincent Atanasoff and graduate student Cliff Berry in 1937.  
;1943: Then followed the ENIAC, then the EDSAC as the first stored program electronic computer.  
;1954: Toshiba introduces its first computer, the TAC digital computer.
;1958: NEC builds its first computer, the NEAC 1101
;1960: Digital Equipment Corporation released its first of many PDP computers, the PDP-1
;1966: Hewlett Packard released its first general computer, the HP - 2115
;1974: XEROX ALTO is considered to be the first workstation. 
;1975: Ed Roberts coined the term personal computer when he introduced the Altair 8800, although the first personal computer is considered to be the Kenback-1.  
;1981: IBM introduced the IBM PC.
;1983: Compaq released its first computer and the first 100% IBM compatible computer, the Compaq Portable
;1984: IBM PCD later released the IBM portable. 
;1985: Dell introduced its first computer, the Turbo PC
;1994: IBM introduces the IBM thinkPad 775CD, the first notebook with an integrated CD-ROM. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded.

;2010: iPad is released (first commercially successful tablet computer).

== 2. Define the following terms ==
=== Hardware ===
Hardware is any physical portion of a computing device, such as memory, motherboard etc

=== Software ===
Software is a term describing a set of instructions that control the operation of a computer.    Software can be easily changed and updated.  Once it has been created, it can be reproduced very cheaply.  This is because software is not something that can be touched or held in a person's hand.   The media on which the software is written can be touched, but the media does not generally look any different after the software is written to it.  Software can be stored on many types of media, and can in fact be distributed without the use of a storage medium (other than its final storage destination on a computer's hard drive).

=== Floppy Disk ===
A floppy disk is a removable storage media for computers.  It consists of a plastic disk coated with a magnetic material encased in a plastic sheath.  Data can be stored on them by changing the magnetic properties of very tiny areas on the disk.  The data can be read back by detecting these magnetic fields.  Floppy disks are no longer in widespread use, having been replaced by writable CD Roms, flash drives, and computer networks.  In their heyday, they were used for distributing software, exchanging data between computers, data storage, and for data archival.

=== Hard drive ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Hard drive}}

=== Mainframe ===
A mainframe is a large, powerful computer shared by many users.  It is generally located someplace in a building separate from where its users are.  The users of a mainframe connect to it through a terminal consisting of a keyboard and a monitor.  A mainframe can be connected to many terminals - and therefore - many users at a time.  The terminals are connected to the mainframe by a network.   Some terminals are also equipped with a mouse and speakers.  Full access to a mainframe is usually reserved for the system administrator who is responsible for installing software, performing maintenance, and creating user accounts.  Regular mainframe users generally do not have privileges to install new software or alter files belonging to other users.

=== Desktop Computer ===
A desktop computer is a small computer system that is dedicated to a small number of users.  This type of computer is often found in homes and offices and is capable of running stand-alone (that is, in the absence of another computer such as a mainframe).  Desktop computers do not take up a lot of space, but they are not easy to move from one location to another (like a laptop).

=== Laptop Computer ===
A laptop computer is a small, portable computer.  They are generally not as powerful as desktop computers selling for the same amount.  Laptops come in a &quot;clamshell&quot; design, such that the video display can be folded down over the keyboard when the computer is not in use, or when it is transported.  The circuitry is located beneath the keyboard.  Laptops are designed to maximize battery life and minimize size and weight.

=== ROM ===
ROM is an acronym that stands for Read Only Memory.  This is a form of computer memory whose contents cannot be altered except when it is manufactured.  It is typically used to store a computer's boot program.  The boot program is the first program to execute when a computer is turned on, and it typically loads an operating system into main (writable) memory from some other storage media (such as a harddrive, cd rom drive, or network).

=== RAM ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/RAM}}

=== Alphanumeric ===
The set of all letters and numbers.  An alphanumeric value is any string made up of only letters and numbers.  For instance, &quot;a12bgj&quot;, &quot;1234&quot;, and &quot;ABCD&quot; are all alphanumeric, whereas &quot;aB$4&quot; is not (it contains the '$' symbol which is neither a letter nor a number).
=== CPU ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/CPU}}
=== Circuit Board ===
A circuit board is a stiff sheet of material upon which various components of a circuit are soldered.  It supplies the connections between the components as well as a platform on which they are mounted.  
=== Cursor ===
The cursor is a visual indicator on a computer display.  It shows where on the display the next keyboard entry will be made.  In a graphical system, the cursor may be moved around the screen with a mouse.  In a text system, the cursor may be moved around using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
=== Port ===
A port is an external connection on a computer.  It provides a connection to an external device such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, external modem, camera, or other device.
=== Program ===
A program is a series of computer instructions that when executed performs a predetermined task.
=== DOS or OS ===
OS stands for &quot;Operating System&quot; and DOS stands for &quot;Disk Operating System.&quot;  An operating system is a program that coordinates the rest of the computer.  It allows other programs to run and generally provides an easy mechanism for other programs to access various hardware devices on the computer.  A Disk operating system is an operating system that is loaded from a harddrive or floppy drive.  
=== CD Rom ===
A CD Rom is a type of computer storage medium.  &quot;CD ROM&quot; stands for &quot;Compact Disc, Read Only Memory&quot;.  These devices were originally developed for storing music, but were pressed into service for storing all kinds of computer data after their initial introduction.  A typical CD Rom can store approximately 650 megabytes of data.  The data on a CD Rom is read from the disc by a laser beam in a CD Rom drive.

== 3. What are the proper handling and storage techniques for disks? ==
Disks should be stored away from devices that create magnetic fields such as speakers and video monitors.  They should be kept free from dust and moisture, and should not be bent or folded.  Care should be taken to not scratch compact discs.

== 4. Describe the function of and point out the following components of a personal computer ==
=== Keyboard ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Keyboard}}


=== Monitor ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Monitor}}


=== System Unit or Central Processing Unit ===
The system unit is the part of a computer that contains the microprocessor, memory, and hardrive.  It is the &quot;main&quot; component of a desktop computer system or a mainframe.  All other devices (such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.) plug into it.  It is sometimes also called the &quot;Central Processing Unit,&quot; although that term is also used to describe the microprocessor.

=== Printer ===
A computer printer is a device which records computer output to paper.  Printers come in many forms as described in a later section.

=== Disk Drive ===
A disk drive is a device which stores data onto a platter (the disc) which has been coated with a magnetically sensitive material.  Data on a disk drive can be stored for long periods of time even when the device is powered off.  There are two types of disk drives: hard drives and floppy drives.

== 5. Know the difference between and uses for the following printers: ==
=== Letter Quality ===

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A letter-quality printer was a form of computer impact printer that was able to print with the quality typically expected from a business typewriter such as an IBM Selectric.

Over time, several different technologies were used including automating ordinary typebar typewriter mechanisms (such as the Friden Flexowriter), automating IBM Selectric mechanisms (such as the IBM 2741 terminal), and, finally, the daisy wheel printer. The Selectric-based and daisy wheel printers offered the additional advantage that the typeface was readily changeable by the user to accommodate varying needs.

Because of its low cost, the daisy wheel printer became the most successful of the three types. Most letter quality printers were available either as complete computer terminals with keyboards or as print-only devices.

Nowadays, printers using non-impact printing (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications.

=== Dot Matrix ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A dot matrix printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of computer printer with a print head that runs back and forth on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.

Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a &quot;wire&quot; or &quot;pin&quot;, which uses the power of a tiny electromagnet or solenoid to drive it forward, either directly or through small levers.  

In the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix impact printers were generally considered the best combination of expense and versatility, and until the 1990s they were by far the most common form of printer used with personal computers.

=== Laser ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Laser printer}}

=== Plotter ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Plotters print their output by moving a pen across the surface of a piece of paper. This means that plotters are restricted to line art, rather than raster graphics as with other printers. They can draw complex line art, including text, but do so very slowly because of the mechanical movement of the pens. (Plotters are incapable of creating a solid region of color; but can hatch an area by drawing a number of close, regular lines.)

Plotters are used primarily in technical drawing and CAD applications, where they have the advantage of working on very large paper sizes while maintaining high resolution. Another use has been found by replacing the pen with a cutter, and in this form plotters can be found in many garment and sign shops.

=== Ink Jet ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Computers/Ink jet printer}}

=== Thermal ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A thermal printer (or direct thermal printer) produces a printed image by selectively heating coated paper when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. Two-color direct thermal printers are capable of printing both black and an additional color (often red), by applying heat at two different temperatures.

Thermal printers are often faster and quieter than dot matrix printers.  They are also more economical than other types of printers since their only consumable is the paper itself. Possible  applications of thermal printers include filling station pumps, information kiosks, and cash register systems.  Thermal printers are useful anywhere low cost is more important than high quality.

== 6. Show or describe how to protect a computer system from dust, dirt, static electricity, power surges and outages, or other potentially dangerous factors that could hamper or hurt a computer system. ==
=== Dirt and Dust ===
One way to protect a computer from dust and dirt is to locate it in an area where there is little dust or no dirt at all.  A computer should be elevated off the floor.  It can be stored on a desk, or even on top of a block of wood - getting it even an inch or two off the floor will prevent it from accumulating much dust.

=== Static Electricity ===
Computer circuitry can be damaged by static electricity.  One generally doesn't have to worry about that too much as long as the cover of the computer is on.  However, when installing a new card in a PC, adding an internal hard drive, or performing any maintenance that requires one to remove the cover, care must be taken to discharge static electricity.  This can best be done by wearing an anti-static wrist strap while handling components.  One end of the strap is worn around the wrist, and the other is connected to the same electrical ground that the computer is connected to.  However, not all computer users own an anti-static strap.  In those cases, other precautions can be taken to avoid static discharge into the electronic components.  One way this his can be done is by touching the metal frame of the computer before touching any of the sensitive electronic components inside.

When installing new components into a computer, the component should be left in its protective packaging until it is ready to be inserted into the computer.  Touch the package first, then remove the component.  If not wearing a wrist strap, touch the computer's frame next, and then install the component.

=== Power Surges and Outages ===
Computers should be protected from power surges by plugging them into a surge protector.  These can be purchased at computer stores, office supply stores, or even hardware stores.  A surge protector will not protect a computer from a power outage though.  For that, an uninterruptible power supply (or UPS) can be used.  An UPS is a device that will continue to supply electrical power to the computer for a short while after the power fails.  Some UPS's can supply power for hours, while others can supply power for only a few minutes - long enough to shut the computer down to prevent loss of data.  A good UPS can tell the computer when it has lost its primary source of power and instruct the computer to shut itself down when backup power is nearly spent.

=== Other Dangers ===
Be careful about eating or drinking around a computer.  It is easy to drop food crumbs into a computer keyboard, and more than one computer has been destroyed by a spilled drink.  Don't set a drink down next to a computer, or worse yet, on a shelf or desk above the computer.  It is best to keep these things away from the computer, but if that cannot be avoided, they should be placed in a position such that a spill is unlikely to reach the computer.

Computers should be protected from other forms of liquid as well - if the roof begins to leak, unplug the computer and move it to a dry area.  

Do not drop a computer.  Some of the components are easily damaged by the shock, especially those components with moving parts such as disk drives.  A sharp jolt to a computer may also dislodge components, bend connectors, or in severe cases, break solder joints.

Operate a computer in a cool environment.  Excessive heat can damage a computer or cause it to lose stability.  Programs can misbehave, and memories and other devices can fail in high temperature environments.  

When transporting a computer, pack it appropriately.  Laptops should be carried in special bags made for that purpose.  Desktop systems should be boxed in their original packaging when possible.  If transporting a monitor by car, place the screen against the back of the seat.  The front of the screen is the heaviest side of the monitor, so placing it against the back of the seat will make it less likely to slide around, as well as protect the screen from other objects that might fly around (such as a keyboard!) during a sudden stop.

== 7. Name at least four input devices for computers ==
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Digital Camera
* Scanner
* Microphone
* Network Interface Card
* Modem
* Flash Drive
* Floppy Drive
* CD Rom Drive
* Frame Grabber

== 8. What does it mean to back up a disk or a file?  Why is it important? ==
Backing up a disk or a file means making another copy of it.  Although computers are highly reliable machines, they are not perfect.  Floppy discs can be lost or damaged.  All hard drives will eventually fail.  When this happens, it can be difficult, expensive, and even impossible to recover the data that was stored on them.  For this reason, all important data should be backup up.  This can be accomplished by copying it to another computer, burning the data onto a CD Rom, copying it to a floppy drive, a second hard drive, or a flash drive.  In some cases, a file can be backed up by emailing it to oneself so that the data is stored on an email server, although in this case, care must be taken that the data really is stored on a different computer.

== 9. What is computer preventative maintenance?  Why is it important? ==
=== Guard Against Malicious Software ===
There are many things a computer user can do to keep the computer running smoothly.  The most important is to prevent the computer from getting infected with a virus, a worm, or spyware.  Many places on the internet will entice the user to download malicious software, so computer users should be especially careful.  An infected computer system can get so bogged down with junk programs that it is virtually inoperable.  Sometimes the only way to &quot;cure&quot; it is by performing a complete reinstall of all the programs and the operating system.  Anti-virus and firewall software can be an effective means to protect a computer from malicious software.

=== Security Updates ===
Software vendors often issue security updates to the software they provide.  Often, a vulnerability  in a program is discovered, and the software vendor fixes the problem an issues an update.  These updates should be applied as soon as possible (or better - automatically) because there are other people in the world who are watching for these updates with evil intent.  As soon as the security update is announced, these individuals will attempt to develop a program to exploit the vulnerability.  These programs, once they have breached a computer, usually put the computer to work looking for ''other'' vulnerable computers, and thus, the infection spreads.  Do not believe that because you are an anonymous person, your computer will not be affected.  These programs do not care ''who'' you are - they are only concerned that your ''computer'' is vulnerable.  Sometimes these programs only attempt to spread themselves around.  Other times, they can install themselves invisibly, log the user's keystrokes, and forward them to the author of the malicious program.  In these cases, the program is looking for sensitive information about ''you'': bank account numbers, social security numbers, etc.  Keep your computer software secured and up to date!

=== Defragment the Hard Drive ===
Another thing a computer user can do to tune the computer's performance is to defragment the hard drive.  This operation puts all the data from each file sequentially on the hard drive, so it can be accessed more quickly.  A computer can store data from single file in locations physically scattered all over the drive.  The data is still presented to the computer as if it were stored sequentially - it just takes it a lot longer to collect all that information.

=== Dust Bunnies Inside ===
A computer should be dusted any time it is opened.  Dust can be blown out using a can of compressed air.  Care should be taken when this operation is performed - the dust can easily fly back into the maintainers face and get into the eyes.  Be careful that all fans are operating properly after they are cleaned.  Cooling fans often fail immediately after they are cleaned. One should also check under the cooling fan to make sure the fins of the heat sink are clean.  If the heatsink is plugged up with dirt and grime the processor will overheat.

== 10. Successfully boot, load (install), and use a prepared software program for use in a computer system. (No computer games.) ==
There are many programs that can be used to meet this requirement.  Some programs can be purchased at a store, and others can be downloaded for free (legally!) from the Internet.  Some excellent programs that can be downloaded for free include [http://openoffice.org OpenOffice] (an Office suite with a word processor, spread sheet, presentation program, and drawing package), [http://getfirefox.com Firefox] (a web browser), [http://getthunderbird.com Thunderbird] (an email program), and [http://gimp.org The Gimp] (a photo/image editing program).  All of these programs are of excellent quality and compare very favorably to their commercial counterparts.  Best of all, they are FREE.

== 11. Tell several ways an individual or family could use a personal computer other than for games. ==
Tracking finances, staying in contact with other family members, record keeping, making documents, producing web pages, connecting to the Internet, researching a school (or work) assignment, getting directions, finding lost friends, downloading pathfinder honors requirements and answers, and many, many more!

==Description==

These letters have the hook tail which looks like this: L. Remember tails only show up in the end and the lonely form of the letter. 

* Jem (ج) makes the [d͡ʒ] sound.&lt;ref&gt;In some dialects this is pronounced as [ɡ] as in &quot;good&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In English this is usually written as &quot;j&quot; as in &quot;Juliet&quot;. With a good Arabic accent it sounds slightly different than the English version of this sound.

* Hžaa (ح) makes [ħ], a non-English sound. People who are new to Arabic often confuse it with [h], the sound that the letter ه (haa) makes. Although they sound similar, they are different. ح (Hžaa) is pronounced further up in the throat. To produce this sound, leave your mouth open and constrict your throat a bit. Then breathe out. It will sound something like the noise Darth Vader makes when he breathes. All Arabs pronounce this properly; mispronouncing this letter will make  your Arabic very difficult to understand. Never pronounce it the same as خ (kħaa). Some beginners make this mistake.

* Kħaa (خ) makes [x], a non-English sound. Many languages have this sound. German has it in the &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;Bach&quot;, Russian has it in the &quot;ch&quot; of Rachmaninoff, and Scottish English has it in the &quot;ch&quot; of &quot;loch.&quot; It is similar to the sound people make when preparing to spit.

* Rħayn (ع) makes [ʕ], a non-English sound. Non-Arabs confuse it with ء (hamza), the glottal stop. Rħayn is the voiced version of ح (Hžaa). It is often referred to as the &quot;choking sound&quot;, it sounds like an odd sort of growl. Mispronouncing this sound will make you incomprehensible in Arabic.

* Gayn (غ) makes [ɣ], a non-English sound. It is the voiced version of خ (khaa). It is similar to the sound everyone makes when they gargle water. In Arabic, the tongue is somewhere between the location [k] (ك) and [q] (ق).

== Description ==
The following two letters are often called emphatic. This means that the sound is both pharyngealized and partly velarized. The very back of the tongue is pushed against the back of the throat. In layman's terms, think of pronouncing the sound while simultaneously choking yourself. Phonetically, we write this by adding ˁ right after the sound.

* Tžaa (ط) makes the [t̪ˁ] sound, like the 't', only emphatic.
* Dhžaa (ظ) makes the [ðˁ] sound, like the 'th' in &quot;either&quot;, only emphatic.

==Extension Development==
The most comprehensive site for Extension development is at the Mozillazine Knowledge Base found [http://kb.mozillazine.org/Extension_development here]. Other helpful tools include the [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/inspector/ DOM Inspector] included in Firefox and the JavaScript console. 

Firefox is especially developer-friendly.  It allows even the most casual web developer to crib useful HTML techniques from most any website they visit, and offers a host of other features for more serious users.

==Source viewing==
Perhaps the most-used development feature is the ability to highlight images and text in any website, and choose to view source from a drop-down menu.  When this feature is used, Firefox displays the HTML source that was used to generate the highlighted content.  

For instance, highlighting the above paragraph and section heading, right clicking, and choosing &quot;''Vi&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;w Selection Source''&quot;, will display the following in a new window:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Source_viewing&quot; id=&quot;Source_viewing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Source viewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most-used development feature is the ability to highlight images and text in any website, and choose &quot;&lt;i&gt;View selection source&lt;/i&gt;&quot; from the drop-down menu. Doing this will bring up a pop-up window, with the HTML source that was used to generate the highlighted content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Combining this technique with a good markup language reference source, such as the [[Main_Page|Wikibook]] [[HTML Programming]], will allow you to learn from every new website you visit.

==Epidemiology==
The overall incidence of symptomatic acoustic neuromas is 1/100,000 persons, however, autopsy results have shown that subclinical acoustic neuromas are present in up to 1% of people.  Acoustic neuromas account for ~8% of intracranial tumors and 80-90% of CPA tumors.  Most people with symptomatic acoustic neuromas will present between the ages of 30 and 50.  
They are almost always unilateral; bilateral acoustic neuromas are limited to patients with NF-2.  

==Risk Factors==
*Acoustic trauma: OR of 2.2 if 10 years exposure to extremely loud noise, OR of 13.1 if 20 or more years of exposure.  
*Parathyroid adenoma: OR of 3.4 for acoustic neuromas.  
*NF-2: Accounts for 10% of patients with acoustic neuroma, typically bilateral.  Recall that NF2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes a membrane cytoskeletal protein called merlin or schwannomin that appears to be involved in actin-cytoskeleton organization.  NF2 associated with bilateral ANs, gliomas, meningiomas, cataracts, and neurofibromas.

==Pathology==
Acoustic neuromas arise from the Schwann cell perineural elements of the affected nerve and occur with equal frequency on the superior and inferior branches of the vestibular nerve (rarely affect the cochlear portion of CN VIII).  They arise at the junction of the central myelin produced by glial cells and peripheral myelin produced by Schwann cells (Obersteiner-Redlich zone).  On light microscopy one will see zones of alternately dense and sparse cellularity called Antoni A and B areas, respectively.  Acoustic neuromas will also stain positive for the S100 protein. 
  
==Natural History==
The natural history of acoustic neuromas is variable.  The average growth rate is 1.9mm/year.  40% of tumors overall (higher for smaller tumors) will show no growth or even shrinkage on serial images.   However, there is no predictive relation between growth rate and size of tumor at presentation.  

==Clinical Presentation==
The symptoms involved with acoustic neuroma are due to cranial nerve involvement and tumor progression.  
*Acoustic nerve: Symptomatic involvement in 95% of patients, major symptoms being hearing loss and tinnitus.  Hearing loss present in 95%, but only about 66% were actually aware of this deficit.  The hearing loss is usually chronic (over years).  Tinnitus is present in 63% of patients.  
*Vestibular nerve: Involved in 61% of patients and manifests as mild to moderate unsteadiness while walking.  True spinning vertigo is uncommon due to the slow growing nature of these tumors.  
*Trigeminal nerve: Disturbance occurs in 17% of patients with symptoms such as facial numbness, hypesthesia, and pain.  These symptoms usually occur after hearing loss is present for more than two years, and vestibular symptoms for more than one year.  
*Facial nerve: Involved in 6% of patients.  Seen as facial paresis and taste disturbances.           
*Posterior fossa:  Compression on the cerebellum or brainstem results in ataxia.  May also see serious complications such as brainstem compression, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, hydrocephalus, and death.  

==Work-up==
[[Image:Tumor_Acoustic_Neuroma.JPG|thumb]]
*Physical Exam: 
**Confirm sensorineural hearing loss with Rinne test (tuning fork on mastoid bone, AC&gt;BC) and Weber test (vibratory sound louder on the “good” side)
**Also check for other CN deficits (absent corneal reflex, facial twitching, hypesthesia)
*Audiometry: 
**The best initial screening test
**Typically shows asymmetric SHL, usually more prominent in the higher frequencies. Functional hearing typically described as &lt;50 dB and &gt;50% speech discrimination
**Hearing loss does not necessarily correlate with tumor size.
*Brainstem auditory evoked potentials: Delay in conduction time on the affected side.  
*Imaging: MRI with gadolinium can detect tumors as small as 1-2mm.  Seen as an enhancing lesion “ice cream cone” in the region of internal acoustic canal or a “dumbbell” extending into the foramen magnum.

==Treatment==
The three treatment options for acoustic neuroma are surgery, radiation therapy, and observation.

==Surgery==
Typically performed by an otologist and a neurosurgeon.  The learning curve is very steep, on the order of 20-60 cases.  There are three surgical approaches used in the removal of acoustic neuromas.  
*Retromastoid suboccipital: An incision is made behind the ear and the mastoid bone and some inner ear structures are removed.  Advantages to this approach include decreased risk of facial nerve damage and ability to attempt hearing preservation.  A disadvantage is that using this approach, if the tumor extends distally into the IAC, complete removal may not be possible.
*Middle fossa: This approach involves an incision just anterior to the ear with removal of the underlying bone to expose the area of interest.  Hearing preservation is attempted with this approach, but depending on location of the tumor complete removal may not be feasible.  
*Translabyrinthine: This approach goes directly through the inner ear and invariably sacrifices hearing.
Results: Anatomic preservation of the facial nerve is achieved in 93% of patients and of the cochlear nerve in 68%.  Hearing preservation rate for surgery is 47%.
Complications of surgery: Death (1%), hemiparesis (1%), CN palsey (5%), hematomas (2.2%), CSF fistulas (9.2%), hydrocephalus (2.3%), bacterial meningitis (1.2%), wound revisions (1.1%).
(Samii, Neurosurgery 1997 Jan;40(1):11-21)

==Radiosurgery==
GKS--Patient’s head is fixed in MRI compatible Leksell stereotactic frame and 1-1.5mm slice MRI is obtained.  Prescribe dose of 12.5-13.0 Gy to the 50% isodose line.  TV defined as macroscopic tumor seen on MRI/CT.  Evaluate dose fall-off to cochlea and brain stem.  Tumor control rate (97%), Normal facial function (&gt;99%), Trigeminal function (97%), Hearing preservation (up to 77%). (Lunsford, J Neurosurg 2005 Jan;102 Suppl:195-9)

Proton Beam Radiosurgery--Now only used for pts with non-serviceable hearing and tumors &lt;2.0cm.  Use 3 fiducial markers in the outer table of the cranium, as well as placement of head in a stereotactic frame.  A 3D CT based planning system is used.  160 MeV proton beam is used to administer 3 converging beams to a max dose of 13 cobalt Gray equivalents to TV.   Evaluate dose fall-off to brainstem and cochlea.   Excellent tumor control (95%) and preservation of CNs V (89%) and VII (91%)  Hearing preservation: 33%. (Weber, Neurosurgery 2003 Sep;53(3):577-86)

Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy--Patient’s head is immobilized in a mask and linear accelerator is used to apply the radiation.  Dose: 50-55 Gy in 25-30 fractions to the 80% isodose line.  The data for FSR has shown excellent tumor control, preservation of hearing/CN function, and reduced treatment related toxicity. (Combs, IJROBP 2005 Sep 1; 63 (1):75-81)

==Observation==
In certain cases it may be feasible to observe the patient and his/her VS with MRI scans every 6-12 months.  Problems with this approach include ongoing hearing loss, and possible mass effects with large tumors.


==External Beam RT==

**Retrospective. 89 patients. Two dose levels: 50.4 Gy vs 46.8 Gy. Median F/U 4.4 and 5.4 years
**Outcome: Tumor control 100% both groups.
**Toxicity: Raw 3-year hearing preservation 46.8 Gy 79% vs. 50.4 Gy 68% (SS). Pure tone hearing better in low-dose cohort 46.8 Gy 33db vs. 50.4 Gy 40 db (SS). Actuarial hearing preservation rate significantly longer for low-dose group 3.2 years vs. 1.5 years (SS). Predictors for hearing dose cohort and pretreatment hearing class
**Conclusion: Lower dose of 46.8 Gy had 100% local control with better hearing preservation rate

*'''Harvard; 2005''' (1992-2001) PMID 15987541 -- &quot;Stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannomas: favorable outcome with minimal toxicity.&quot; (Chan AW, Neurosurgery. 2005 Jul;57(1):60-70; discussion 60-70.)
**Retrospective. 70 patients (new 47%, progressive after observation 31%, postop 3%, recurrent 19%), NF2 in 11 patients. Treated with linac SRT. Median dose 54/30 to 95% isodose. Median tumor volume 2.4 cm3. Median F/U 3.8 years
**Outcome: 3-year LC 100%, 5-year LC 98%. Freedom from resection 98% and 92%. Initial tumor volume predictive of resection: 5-year FFR if &lt;8 cm3 97% vs. &gt;8 cm3 47%. No difference due to NF2 status
**Toxicity: 3-year facial nerve 99%, trigeminal nerve 96%. Prior surgery predictive of TN toxicity (86% vs. 98%)
**Conclusion: Conventionally fractionated SRT results in very favorable outcome

*Baylor, 2002 (1993-2000) - PMID 12459364 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of acoustic neuroma: stereotactic radiosurgery vs. microsurgery.&quot; Karpinos M et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Dec 1;54(5):1410-21.
**Retrospective. 75 pts with Gamma Knife, 25 with microsurgery. 
**No difference in tumor control. RS more effective in: preservation of measurable hearing (57% vs 14%). Microsurgery had higher rate of: facial neuropathy (35%/6%) and trigeminal neuropathy (22%/12%). Also no difference in: serviceable hearing, tinnitus, imbalance, dysarthria, dysphagia, and headache. Longer hospital stay and more perioperative complications (47% vs 4%) for microsurgery.

==Comparison of SRS and FSRT==
*'''Amsterdam; 2003''' PMID 12873685 -- &quot;Single-fraction vs. fractionated linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: a single-institution study.&quot; (Meijer OW, IJROBP. 2003 Aug 1;56(5):1390-6).  129 patients with ANs from 1992-1999 were prospectively selected for SRS or FSRT based on whether or not they had teeth.  All treatments were linac based.  The dentate patients received FSRT (20Gy/5fx and 25Gy/5fx) and the edentate patients received SRS (10Gy and 12.5Gy).  Mean follow-up was 33 months.  Results in table below.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|               || Tumor Control || CN V preservation|| CN VII Perservation || Hearing Preservation || 
|- 
| SRS          || 100%                      || 92% || 93% || 75% || 
|-
| FSRT     || 94%                        || 98% || 97% || 61% || 
|}
**Conclusion: Comparable rate of tumor control and preservation of hearing, CN V, and CN VII.  

*'''Thomas Jefferson; 2001''' (1994-2000) PMID 11483338 -- &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of acoustic schwannomas: comparative observations of 125 patients treated at one institution.&quot; (Andrews, IJROBP.  2001 Aug 1;50(5):1265-78).
**Retrospective. 122 patients (GKS 69, fractionated 52). GKS dose 12 Gy, fractionated dose 50/25. Mean F/U 2.3 years
**Outcome: tumor control SRS 98% vs. FSRT 97% (NS)
**Toxicity: CN V preservation 95% vs. 93% (NS), CN VII preservation 98% vs. 98% (NS); functional hearing 33% vs. 81% (SS)
**Conclusions: Comparable rates of tumor control and CN preservation, improvement in servicable hearing

==Proton Therapy==
*'''Harvard; 2003''' (1992-2000) PMID 12943574 -- &quot;Proton beam radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: tumor control and cranial nerve toxicity.&quot; (Weber DC, Neurosurgery. 2003 Sep;53(3):577-86; discussion 586-8.)
**Retrospective. 88 patients, proton SRS. Median volume 1.4 cm3. Prior surgery 17%. Facial nerve function normal 90%, good/excellent hearing 9%, servicable hearing 15%. Median dose 12 CGE (10-18 CGE) prescribed to median 70% isodose line. Median F/U 3.2 years
**Outcome: 5-year LC 94%, radiological reduction in 95%
**Toxicity: In GR Grade 1-2, 33% retained servicable (GR Grade 2) hearing. 5-year normal facial nerve 91% and trigeminal nerve 89%. Facial neuropathy predicted by prescribed dose, maximum dose, and inhomogeneity
**Conclusion: Proton beam SRS effective treatment, reduced prescribed dose associated with decrease in facial neuropathy

All these letters are non-connectors. They have two forms: connected (being connected to), non-connected (not being connected to).

* Alif (ا) has several uses. The first is that whenever a word begins with a vowel it begins with an alif. The second use of it is the long &quot;aa&quot; sound as in &quot;bat&quot;. The second use of it occurs when the alif is plain and does not begin a word. The third use is indicating the glottal stop, but this usually requires a diacritic.
* Daal (د) makes the [‎d̪] sound. In the same way as the ت in [[Arabic/LearnRW/Row_4|Row 4]], this is very similar to the English 'd' with some minor differences.
* Dħaal (ذ) makes the [ð] sound. In English, this is like &quot;th&quot; in &quot;weather&quot;, not the one in &quot;think&quot;.
* Raa' (ر) sounds like [r], the trilled &quot;r&quot; sound. This sound does not exist in standard English, but it is used sometimes in 'proper' British English. It is the same as the 'r' in Italian or Latin. It is not the same &quot;r&quot; sound as in standard English, but one can still be understood pronouncing it as such.
* Zay (ز) makes the [z] sound, like the first sound in &quot;zap&quot;.
* Waaw (و) makes the [w] sound, like the first sound in &quot;week&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Smalltalk is a fully object oriented language. 

The most important and consistent ideas in the language are that:
 (1) there are objects
 (2) send messages to objects 
 (3) get back an object as the result.

So 2 + 3 is considered as &quot;sending a message + to object 2, with argument 3 and the result of the message is another object 5&quot;

Now that you know what blended learning is, you may be asking yourself, &quot;Why do I need to know about blended learning? Why is it important?&quot; Over the years, many groups of people have asked this same question. These groups have included classroom teachers and others in the field of education, but have also included people in the business field as well. Blended learning makes up the “fastest growing use of technologies in learning—much faster then the development of online courses.” (Alvarez, 2005) Because of the interest in blended learning, there have been many research studies done to find the potential strengths and weaknesses of blended learning as compared to just the traditional classroom or e-learning.

== In Education ==

Educators seem to have the most interest in blended learning, for obvious reasons.  Because of this, much of the research on blended learning has been based around classroom situations.  All levels of education have been researched with blended learning, from the elementary school grades up to graduate school.  Educators’ interests in blended learning is best summarized by Flavin in his E-Learning Advantages in a Tough Economy. He states:

Ironically, the notion of blending is nothing new.  Good classroom teachers have always blended their methods—reading, writing, lecture, discussion, practice and projects, to name just a few, are all part of an effective blend.  Blending is only a revelation for those who have been trying to do everything with just one tool—usually the computer—and ending up with less than ideal results.  Understanding that using the right tool, in the right situation, for the right purpose should be a guiding design principle. (Flavin, 2001)

One clear advantage of blended learning in education is its connection with differentiated instruction.  Differentiated instruction involves “custom-designing instruction based on student needs.” (deGula, 2004)  In differentiated instruction, educators look at students’ learning styles, interests, and abilities.  Once these factors have been determined, educators decide which curriculum content, learning activities, products, and learning environments will best serve those individual students’ needs.  Blended learning can fit into a number of these areas.  By using blended learning, educators are definitely altering the learning environment when students work collaboratively in learning communities online, for example.  Teachers could also add relevant curriculum content that would be unavailable or difficult to comprehend outside of the internet.  Learning activities and products can also be changed to use technologies in a classroom that uses blended learning.

So what does the research say?  In a study by Dean and associates, research showed that providing several online options in addition to traditional classroom training actually increased what students learned. (2001) Another study showed that student interaction and satisfaction improved, along with students learning more, in courses that incorporated blended learning. (DeLacey and Leonard, 2002) 

Another advantage of blended learning is pacing and attendance.  In most blended learning classrooms, there is the ability to study whenever the student chooses to do so.  If a student is absent, she/he may view some of the missed materials at the same time that the rest of the class does, even though the student cannot be physically in the classroom. This helps students stay on track and not fall behind, which is especially helpful for students with prolonged sicknesses or injuries that prevent them from attending school. These “self-study modules” also allow learners to review certain content at any time for help in understanding a concept or to work ahead for those students who learn at a faster pace. (Alvarez, 2005) 
    
Because of the ability of students to self-pace, there is a higher completion rate for students in blended learning classrooms than to those in strictly e-learning situations. (Flavin, 2001) This self-pacing allows for the engagement of every learner in the classroom at any given time. Students also see that the learning involved becomes a process, not individual learning events.  This revelation allows for an increased application of the learning done in the classroom. (Flavin, 2001)

With the given research, it is clear that using blended learning in education improves the teaching and learning done in a given course.  Educators want to teach in a way that best reaches all of their students.  If blended learning accomplishes this, then more teachers will begin to use these methods.  When teachers begin to explore blended learning and the resources that can be found through the internet and other technologies, they can structure their classroom in a way that best suits their teaching style and their students’ learning styles.  Blended learning allows “[teachers] and [their] students to have the best of both worlds.” (Alvarez, 2005)  The traditional classroom and e-learning both have advantages and disadvantages.  As Alvarez states, “the online environment is not the ideal setting for all types of learning.  Classrooms are not perfect either…. That’s why so many teachers and corporate trainers are concentrating their efforts on integrating internet-based technologies and classrooms to create blended learning environments.  It just makes good sense.” (2005)

As stated above blended learning should provide students and teachers with the best of both worlds. I Agree that this should happen, but I am not convinced that this does happen. Teachers that have been teaching for numerous years may be stuck in their traditional teaching methods. These same teachers may not be technology literate which in turn limits what they can do with technology. Teachers must be trained and required to use some type of technology in the classroom if blended learning is going to successfully take place. The teachers may use a variety of teaching styles, but without technology the students are being cheated out of what they need to be successful in today's world. Proper teacher training is the only way teachers and students will &quot;get the best of both worlds.&quot;  Bret M. Helms

== In Business ==

Blended learning is also of interest to corporate world.  Through different studies, blended learning has been shown to be an effective tool in worker training and education.  One of the best advantages of blended learning for the business world is its cost-effectiveness.  When a business relies purely on instructor-led training, besides paying the cost of the trainer, there are also transportation, hotel, food, and other expenses.  Blended learning helps reduce these expenditures by reducing the amount of time needed to face-to-face instruction. (Alvarez, 2005)  “Effective blending lets an organization spend the dollars in the most beneficial, cost effective way.” (Flavin, 2001)  A business can decide what mix of face-to-face and e-learning would best fit their learning objectives.

One study which illustrates some of the benefits of blended learning in today’s business world is the Thomson Job Impact Study. (2003)  This study had 128 participants from a number of corporate and academic organizations, including Lockheed-Martin, Utah State University, National Cash Register, and the University of Limerick in Limerick, Ireland. The researchers wanted to determine if blended learning increased the overall learning in a number of areas.  What they found supports the use of blended learning in the corporate world.  The blended learning group “significantly” out-performed the traditional and e-learning group in spreadsheet application performance and they took less time to complete the real-world tasks than did the e-learning group.  Overall, the blended learning classroom achieved a performance improvement of 30 percent. (Thomson, 2003).  Given these apparent benefits, it is only natural that the business world is now also incorporating blended learning techniques into their employee training and education programs.  By doing a quick internet search, a business could find a number of manuals and examples of how to incorporate blended learning strategies into their own programs.  There are also companies which specialize in bringing blended learning programs into the business world.

As one can see, the benefits of using blended learning have been carefully researched.  Most people would agree that these benefits support the use of blended learning in the classroom and in the business realm as well.  It is up to the individual educator or business how best to use the tools of blended learning to meet their own goals and those of their students/workers. really</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== EE ==

I doubt that you want to mix your work with your time on wikibooks, but I've created a number of books in the Electrical Engineering bookshelf that you might be able to lend a helping hand with. If not, I understand (you don't want to come home after a long day of engineering, to write about engineering on wikibooks). 

On a personal note, i'm a young EE that recently graduated. Where do you work? What do you do? I just started grad school myself, so i'm out of the job market for a few years anyway, but it never hurts to learn about opportunities. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:36, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

:It doesn't really matter where you reply to these comments, i'll see them no matter where you are. Don't feel obligated to help out the EE bookshelf, i just like to inform knowledgable contributors that the bookshelf has expanded greatly in the past few months, and that there are plenty of opportunities to help out. I recently started a [[Digital Signal Processing]] book, and there is also an [[Embedded Systems]] one if you want to write more about software. Talk to you later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

== Category ==

I'm currently trying to categorise each module in Wikibooks. The idea is to make it possible for anyone to find a module they are looking for in Wikibooks through the category system. Also, as &quot;module&quot; for the module count means any page that isn't very short that has some kind of link in it, this also means that I am added modules without links to the module count too. This sounds trivial, but is important as wikis get measured by the number of &quot;good articles&quot;.

Most books easily fall within certain categories. Your book, however, doesn't appear to me to do so (although lobbing it into &quot;candidates for book of the month&quot; might be an idea:) ). I've therefore just added the same category to each page. If you could continue to do the same for new pages, it would be appreciated. Alternatively, if you have a good way of categorising that pages, please implement that.

And by the way, keep up the good work, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:07, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:I second that... great book!
:I'm sort of following behind Jguk and doing more detailed categorisation. I'll probably add a lot of subject-area tags to individual pages, assumming that's OK with you :).  --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:40, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

::Actually, I was going to put them in general topic categories, not specific to the book. I mostly work on the how-tos category, and a lot of the pages of the AY book are excellent how-tos (better than most, in fact). Since there can be more than one how-to on any particular subject (more than one way to skin a cat, so to speak), I think it will be nice to be able to follow category paths, even if only for finding &quot;see also&quot; links. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

== Adventist reverts ==
Hi - I notice you are reverting these now.  I did do a few earlier on and placed a question on the IP talk page concerned (got nothing back!).  The edits ''starting'' looking more authentic so I was unsure about reverting any more.  I'll keep an eye and know for the future.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:59, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
:Sure you'll notice but they've been at it again.  Reverted so far! Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:50, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

==Thanks for your help==
Hi, I just now saw your messages to me, and I'm not sure I've figured out much of the wiki stuff, but as you have modified equations and added formatting info, I've learned by looking at what you are doing.

I've been having a hard time staying focused on one topic, so I've been bouncing around. Yes, I'm interested in the knot tying, as well as looking at the stars and advanced stars, so as I get better at wiki editing, you may see me touch more areas.

 --[[User:Rodneyeast| Rodney East]]

==Spiders==
Hi Jim,
Thanks for the help and encouragement.I am so new that I don't know how all this works. How and where am I to respond when someone puts something in &quot;My Talk&quot;? Also, I haven't figured out how to add pictures. I'd like to add pictures of spiders form the reference in #1 that requires the drawing of the spiders. I placed the website link to the pictures in that requirement. Can you either tell me how to add pictures or will you add them?

Thanks for all you do. --[[User:Stephanieeast|Stephanieeast]] 03:03, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

==Apologies==
I took out the template marks as I understand &quot;templates&quot; to be quite different to chapters in the book (they certainly are in the rest of Wikibooks). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:14, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
This might be useful to you [[Help:A quick guide to templates]] as the {{ brackets are for templates --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
::Hi Jim
::Maybe it's me but I guess I took templates to be largely about organising the way a part or part page looks throughout a book.  However I fully accept that if you plan using the same text in several places your approach may well be the best one and sorry for the removal (I'll still keep an eye for vandals - watching gives you a flavour for what is going on).  The &quot;popups&quot; bit is some java script that makes checking changes and reverting them rather easier.

== Me again ==
Hi Jim , just browsing (as I do) I see that you are adding the category to each page.  Of course this means that all pages get categorised under &quot;A&quot; for Adventist.  Not an issue to me but it depends on how you think/want people to look at the category.  If you place &lt;nowiki&gt;|{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; after the current text and before the final ]] brackets you may prefer the way the category sorts the page?  I've just done [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Sand]] to show you how it looks - in the category in nows shows as N for Nature.  Let me know if I can help - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
:Up to you Jim but if you do want it doing I can do it semi automatically and much faster than you (no disrespect) as I have a bit of software that can help - let me know - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:10, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
::Done 50 or so - will do more later or tomorrow (it does spelling too!).

:::OK Jim that &quot;ran&quot; at 9 pages per minutes overall so if you can  go faster ....  There are one or two that needed manual review which I'll look at when I can but let me know if/when you want another run - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

== Page Edit Bot ==

Hey Jim! Haven't spoken to you in a while. I saw all your efforts to categorize the pages in your book. I just wanted to let you know that I have created a bot that can make edits to multiple pages at once. My bot can do things like add category links to all the pages in a book, for instance. If you have any other changes that you would like to make to multiple pages at once, let me know, and I can save you alot of effort! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:24, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

:If you are interested in my bot, and if you know perl, you might be interested in reading some of the documentation I have written about it at [[User:Whiteknight/Bot]]. My bot is written in 100% perl. I wrote a module that uses LWP to submit edits, and then I have been using TK to write GUIs for my library, so that I can make edits to multiple pages at once (with a foreach loop). I can send you some of the source code if you want. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 05:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

== Bots, edits &amp; welcomes ==

Hi Jim.  Looking at the post to WK on bot type stuff do let me know if I can help, it's quite a powerful piece of software that I have not explored all corners of yet but it can do a lot of editing to pages on a semi automatic basis.  Once I've setup the &quot;run&quot; to cat your pages it can easily be run again - it will ignore pages that do not need editing.  In passing I noticed that you &quot;welcome&quot; your contributors which is great - would it be wise to incorporate some of the conventional &quot;welcome&quot; template so that they have some hints about help, polices and the like? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:18, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
:No idea Jim - I just use it!  But if you want more info [[w:WP:AWB]] is the place I got it (I picked it up when I was more regular on Wikipedia).  As you'll see the features are quite extensive and I've enabled the spell checking on here tho I did notice yesterday it slipped up on a couple of words so I must see if there is an update.  All the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:34, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

:Thinking it thro Jim - there is another approach to this.  I declined admin earlier on but a run in with someone similar changed my mind - I was frustrated that such a mindless idiot could get away with that kind of behaviour. I would have no problem at all nominating you for adminship.  You are a strong, conscientious and thoughtful editor.  However from your point of view I guess there is a sort of obligation to help on a project wide basis if only to a limited degree.  I can tell you from three days experience it is quite scary but if you are interested you know where I am and &quot;no thanks&quot; will not mean I won't do what I can to help you!  I suggest that you &quot;reflect&quot; rather than &quot;react&quot; but do think about it.

::Jim - I'll get back to you as soon as i can on FF stuff, if you like I'll &quot;load&quot; your monobook.js with some bits - clear the cache and voila - play around, the worst that happens is you blank it if you don't like it.  Also I'm not trying to &quot;drag&quot; you out of your spot.  I've always been a rather general editor anyway but I like the place &amp; the people! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:13, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
==Requirements Outlined==
Hi Jim. The requirements are outlined for all the honors that have the requirements available. Now it should be easier for others to fill in the answers. I hope the formatting and header info are correct. Rodney and I have done some of this work late at night. Let me know if you find things I need to fix.
Thanks for all your hard work and commitment.

== Templates and other included content ==

I noticed you put some sections in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Music]] into templates. I just wanted to alert you to an alternative which is to include normal pages. Any page can be included by typing
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Name of page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Templates are a specialized type of shared content, intended for very frequently used notation, formatting, labelling, notification, etc. and therefore have a seperate namespace. The template-namespace means that they will not be searched by default while included normal pages would. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Swift,

:I didn't know I there was a better way to include content on multiple pages other than with templates.  Thanks for the tip.  I thought I had seen something on doing that a long time ago, but when I needed it, I couldn't find the info on how to do it.  And I ''did'' do a pretty thorough search! I finally mistakenly concluded that I must have been thinking about templates, so I went with that.  I have probably fifty such templates that I used for first aid and camping too.  Luckily, I prefixed them all with &quot;Ay&quot; when I created them, so maybe that will make them easier for me to find (though some of them should remain templates as they take arguments and are used throughout my book).  I think what you are suggesting is that I should make them &quot;regular&quot; pages, and then include them in all the place they are used.  Thanks again. [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 14:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:: You're welcome. Yes, this is precisely what I was suggesting. Regarding finding the pages, you can use the special page [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Ay]]. Regarding resources on MediaWiki syntax, you might want to keep an eye on http://www.mediawiki.org/ where they are slowly buidling &amp;mdash; among other things &amp;mdash; a user manual/handbook. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 15:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Hi Swift.  Is there a way to figure out what modules include a template?  As it turns out &quot;fifty&quot; was off by at least a factor of two &amp;mdash; perhaps three.  I have about fifty [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:First aid|First aid]] templates, and I have used them in a ''lot'' of places &amp;mdash; not only in the First Aid honors, but in some of the recreation ones as well (e.g. [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Winter Camping|Winter Camping]] requires knowledge for treating hypothermia and frostbite).  I also found a bunch of [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Knot|Knot]] templates that are used all over the place.  If I have to search for them manually, it's going to take a lot of digging.

:::: &quot;''Is there a way to figure out what modules include a template?''&quot; Yes, you can use the &quot;What links here&quot; tool in the toolbox just below the search box in the side-bar (e.g. [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Camping/Choosing_a_campsite]]). Included pages will have a &quot;(inclusion)&quot; behind the page link (just as redirects have &quot;(redirect)&quot;).
:::: Is this what you were looking for? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:41, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: Yes, that's it.  I hadn't noticed the &quot;What links here&quot; link under the search box, but I did find the same thing when I was moving my templates - the request to check for double redirects does the same thing.  Anyhow, I have made a lot of progress moving the templates to regular pages now.  There's still a lot of work to do though.  Thanks again for the tip.

:::::: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:42, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

Jim - Consider the cat run done - later today hopefully - it really is easier than individually editing everything.  Back to FF do you use the default monobook? If so I will happily edit your .js or point you to the WP pages where I found stuff.

Community wide thoughts - if you are interested I think I would probably recommend looking at the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] and it's discussions as well as [[WB:VFD|Votes for deletion]] and probably [[WB:RFA|Request for Admin]] to get a flavour of what is around.

== Dealing with vandalism ==

Hi Jim - sorry to trouble you but I do know that this is something that concerns you too.  Could I ask you to look at [[WB:RFA]] in the checkuser sections.  This additional tool allows vandal fighters to discover what IP address was used by a named vandal and allow people to block that address to prevent creation of further accounts.  There is a requirement for 25 votes to obtain these rights which on a small wiki is not easy.  I stress I am not asking you to vote or to vote for a particular person but if you, and any registered contributor to your project, could look at this it may be helpful for the Wikibooks in the future.  I hope you don't object to my approach.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
:My thanks - &amp; if I can help you, you do know that I will --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== Checkuser ==

Hi Jim - I was hoping that someone who was one would get back to you on this so may not be fully correct or complete.  The right allows someone to look into the &quot;login&quot; data past the user name.  It allows viewing of the IP address which a named user logs in from.  That way if we have a vandal with a name at present I can block the name permanently but I can only block the IP address for a short period &amp; I will not be able to see the actual address.  With checkuser rights I would see that IP address and be able to look at any other activity from that IP address.  That way if there is a history of vandalism from that source I should be able to deal with the problem on a more permanent basis.

The checks that are now being requested when someone wants any additional rights on the RfA page are something that [[User:SB_Johnny]] and I both see as desirable.  If you are seeking the trust of the community someone should take a look behind the name as it were to see if there is any history of problems with the IP address (something I think has been an issue on Wikipedia and less likely to be one here but I see it as a valid sign of trust).  I hope this helps and thanks again for your support - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:46, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

== Honor requirement Discussion ==

Hi Jim- As I have looked at a number of the honors, I've been concerned with how poorly written some are. Would the discussion section of a particular honor be a good place to entertain a discussion of the honor requirements themselves and possibly generate enough feedback to get some of these things changed?

I was working with my nephew over the Christmas holiday, on the Fishes honor. 10 families of fishes does not express the amount of variety that exist. For example does the fishes honor include the three classes of fish that currently exist. I was not sure from the wording if lamprey, or sharks are even a part of the honor. I personally think it would be good to talk about the 3 classes and then go down the taxonomic tree describing phylum or families, but to jump directly to families of fish denies much of the diversity.

When working on the Physics honor I was concerned with how little of physics was actually covered, You would not know that lighit, waves, quontum mechanics, thermodynamics or a number of other areas of physics were even part of the honor. In this case, I'd recomend some rewriting of the requirements, but also the writing of an advanced honor.

My question is should we have a special area to discuss possible changes to the honor. (To put this in context, ever year my area Coordinator asks for editorial changes for the honors, but it is always at the last minute, and I don't have notes of the problems just lying around- I'm looking for a repository for discussion of problems or improvements), And should this discussion area include the possibility of an Advanced honor? 

or

Should we leave the normal Discussion section for this type of endevor?

Please look at the Mammal honor. I had some trouble with some of the pictures. If you could let me know what I did wrong I'd appreciate it.

Hi Jim, I tried to follow your directions and I couldn't get it to work.  I was able to copy the metadata and paste it in, but when I pasted the name into the Source File Name I got this error message, &quot;The file you uploaded seems to be empty. This might be due to a typo in the file name. Please check whether you really want to upload this file.&quot; I copied the file name and pasted it in.
What next?

== New rights ==
Jim - by way of thanks for the support and information.  There was a vandal up to the usual on the 3rd, had you been around you would have seen him and had I been around I would have blocked him but no other information would have been available.  Now I can tell you that the same IP address had been used quite recently for the same type of vandalism and equally that IP address has not been used recently for legitimate editing.  As a result I was able to block the IP address for a while at least which will give us some peace from that particular one for a while.  Thanks again for the support, regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)


== Optics images and Some General ideas ==

Jim, I had thought the same thing about the optics images. I think I'd like to see them as separate images even so there is more flexibility for whoever wants to use them.

I'm planning on doing the slide projector and telescope to match the quality of some of the images (Like casagrain, or coude telescopes) 

Stephanie and I have been working on the mammals honor recently. We decided to do one together. As I was working on it I started thinking about two somewhat related issues and how to best deal with them.
:::1) Units- It seems to be common practice on wikipedia to have metric units followed by English units. I find this irritating. I think one of the main reasons that we still use English units in the United states is that all math courses are taught with conversions from one unit to another. This translates to &quot;difficult&quot; in peoples brains.

In the wiki format we have the ability to give just the metric unit, but if the person wants to convert they can click on the number and use the Google conversion capability to do the conversion for them. I have done this in the mammal honor, and would like to possibly make this a standard for the AY honor books.

:::2) Scientific names- I have noticed that it is common practice to have the common name and then in parenthesis the scientific name. I think the scientific name is more useful, and what people do with things in parenthesis is ignore them.

In similar reasoning to the above, I'd like to try reversing this and have the scientific name and then in parenthesis the common name.

What do you think about these two issues

--[[User:Rodneyeast|Rodney]] 14:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks (I think) ==

You realize of course that this just means more work :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== Metric Units ==

I've written up some Javascript that should make the conversion between metric and english units very easy. I left a large note about it in the staff lounge. If you would like to test this script, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:14, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
:Ah... the sweet smell of progress!  I slapped the template in my [[User:Jomegat|user page]], and it does indeed give me Kg - but I don't see the &quot;convert units&quot; link in the toolbox.  Do I hafta to do something else to make that happen?  Also, the links in the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] are red, leading me to Template:User:Whiteknight/Convtest.  I took out the &quot;template&quot; and was able to find it OK, but you might wanna fix it in the SL. [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 03:33, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
::Good call on the templates, i did indeed get the links incorrect. I will fix that ASAP. As to the link, you actually need to monkey around with your personal javascript. Go to [[User:Jomegat/monobook.js]], and include the following line:
 document.write('&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;' 
             + 'http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Whiteknight/convert.js' 
             + '&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript&amp;dontcountme=s&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;');
Once you include this in your javascript, save it, and then use Ctrl+F5 to refresh the page with the templates. That should popup the link. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

== Remaining Adventist Youth templates ==

Jomegat, I came across many [[Special:Unusedtemplates|unused templates]] (or you may view them at [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Ay|here]]) associated with the Adventist Youth wikibook. They are all the redirects from when you moved them into main-namespace modules. If they are unnecessary, and while I don't expect you to tag them all, may I kindly ask that you request at WB:AN that they be deleted?

Also, would you be interested in Template:Ay music clefs? It looks like a module, but it has not been redirected. Thank you, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the heads up.  I left a message at WB:AN as requested.  I'll hafta look into the music clefs page.  I moved it to a place where I'll be able to find it later, so the template can go (it didn't belong there). [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 01:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

=== Cont'd ===

I know at [[WB:AN]] you mentioned that there exist other template redirects, and that you weren't &quot;quite ready for them to go the way of the dodo yet.&quot; When you are, would mind taking a look at [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Ay]] and [[Special:Prefixindex/Template:First aid]]. And, if you don't want them deleted yet, please just say, &quot;Stop!&quot; and I'll stop. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:The First Aid ones and the Ay ones (other than the three I mentioned) are ready to go.  I have ''other'' templates elsewhere that I still need to clean up.  I'll let you know when they're ready.

== Links... ==

We need a better help page on how to do chapter linking, but here's the basics:

*To link to a subpage of the page you're working on, use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/SUBPAGENAME/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*To link from one subpage to another, use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../SUBPAGENAME/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*If you're not using a &quot;flat structure&quot; (i.e., if your chapters have subchapters), it gets more complicated... that's why flat structures are generally preferred (Book/Chapter rather than Book/Chapter/Subchapter). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:40, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

Hi!  FYI with a thought. This template caught [[M:MP:TSP|my eye]] as being of possible interest on Wikispecies, so I added some [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ABird_id&amp;diff=794000&amp;oldid=782066 usage]. What would you think of fixing it up to take another two images, but to auto-scale the images to about 1/3rd width... if there are three (keeping this size if less) then someone could put up six panes or three and have a tighter presentation. If interested, let me know, I can probably do that fairly easily.

: Hi Frank!  Yes - PLEASE make those changes.  I had asked for something very similar in the [[WB:SLT|Wikibooks technical chat room]].  It is well beyond my current capabilities to do just as you have suggested.  Originally the images were named image_male, image_female, and image_juvenile, but then I started coming across photos of a male and a female together. So I decided to make them generic.  Do you think the range map should retain its name or should it be generic too?  I have used this template in few enough areas that I'm not concerned about backwards compatibility.  Another thought would be to have the description field take the place of an image if only one image were specified. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 14:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi Jim - hope you don't mind but IMO that is really a form of spam and I've binned it.  I would stress it doesn't make you wrong - it makes me hasty.

I needed [[C++ Programming/Win32]] deleted and its history logs pages merged with [[C++ Programming/API/Win32]] are you comfortable enough to attempt to do that?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
Humm the problem must have be a protection on the original page (it was protected after the books merge) probably to avoid tha same thing, the history log to be lost.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:34, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

== Recent vandal ==

Hi Jim - just looking at logs I noticed you blocked a vandal for a month.  Looking at the user page on wp ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tooj117]) I've changed the blo9ck to indef.  Equally the IP shows a previous vandal on there recently so I will block that for a while shortly.  Hope you don't mind and that all is well.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:26, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
: I don't mind at all.  BTW, I was going to leave a message on his talk page, but was unable to conjure up a template.  I tried subst:block and subst:blocked, but neither of those exist.  I wasn't feeling particularly creative, so I just didn't leave a message at all.  Is there a template for this? -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 17:35, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
::One of those &quot;I think I got bored looking&quot; ones!  These days I just pop something on the page about &quot;you are blocked - please play nicely when you come back&quot; type thing.  I guess a post to staff lounge (one of them) might produce a better answer.  For information the underlying IP is well blocked on Wikipedia and Commons so a good catch there - thanks and all the best --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:59, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

*reset
Well we both learnt something there - I think I was aware I'd seen something, just didn't expect it under the &quot;test&quot; section.  I also recall seeing Whiteknight's argument before too.  In practice most of the vandals we get have quite long histories on wikipedia (worth checking the page there when blocking) so are well aware of how to find when blocks expire.

To me the more important thing is to make it clear we do not have a &quot;vandalize anything you like but stop at the fourth warning or we will block you&quot; policy of Wikipedia.  So - depending on the extent and nature of the vandalism I will block immediately or certainly after one warning (they do know what they are doing after all).  Equally if there is a history on WP I will refer to that (&amp; so would not use a standard template) and will often block for quite a long time of what is a &quot;first offense&quot; here.  I ran this past Derbeth sometime ago and he also takes records on other Wikis into account (I often check Commons too as I spend some time there as well).  This, to me, sends a message that we are less tolerant of bad behavior on Books which seems correct.  Thanks for the way you have dived in Jim - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:21, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

==Anonymous IP blocking==
I noticed you forgot to put your signature in on this user page: [[User talk:70.73.216.199]], which is something minor.  What is major is that without warning, you blocked this IP address for a whole month, which is quite a lengthy period of time.  I would advise you to set an earlier expiration date for the block, if you please.  Best. [[User:Marcus2|Marcus2]] 17:34, 22 April 2007 (UTC)
: I went ahead and signed the block notice (I was in a hurry when I blocked that user), but I am not inclined to back off the block time.  The edits this user made were particularly distasteful, and edits of the same nature had been made from that IP the week before.  A month seems about right to me. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:58, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

::Sorry to intrude but for your discussion I think you should be made aware that a decission on the [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/Blocking policy]] is running and your input may be important, txs...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:27, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

: And on further consideration, I have reduced the block to two weeks instead of one month.  -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 02:50, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[User:72.83.216.10]] ==

I hope you dont mind, but i blocked this ip for 1 day after your warning. When people make very profane vandalism, i dont see a reason to give them a second chance. &quot;Suck my ****&quot; is just not acceptable, and i dont think we should be dealing with that stuff.

If you disagree, you can certainly unblock the IP. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:31, 27 April 2007 (UTC)
: I don't disagree at all.  And indeed, I will adopt the same practice myself.  BTW, thanks for supporting [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] as a Featured Book.  It is greatly appreciated.  I did hesitate to nominate it for the very reason it has one opposing vote.  I have not said anything to my other contributors (they don't come around too often, and they surely don't watch the nominations page) because like me, they would be biased, and I was looking for unbiased opinions. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:39, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

::Everybody has a different personal policy involving blocks. I tend not to give warnings, although i know many other admins who do. I find that if the vandalism is bad enough to deserve a warning, the vandal likely deserves a short block as well. If the mess isnt bad enough for a warning, i tend to send them a warm welcome instead. That's just me though, everybody has their own way and you need to figure out what you are most comfortable with.
::As to the pathfinder's book, I was a boy scout for many years (which i know isn't exactly the same thing) so I tend to know good instructional material for youth groups when i see it. I also know that it's more important to write manuals for the 50 most important &quot;honors&quot; then it is to write manuals for all the millions that exist (but that nobody ever earns). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:45, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

::: The funny thing is that I started this book because, although there are ''official'' resources, they only cover four of the nine categories.  People were always asking about the ones that did not exist on the forums, and someone asked again just after I stumbled across Wikibooks.  Thus, the project was born.  The original scope of the project was to write answers for the honor that had none - those millions nobody ever earns.  Other people encouraged me to make room for all of them, and I'm glad I listened.  One of them runs the outfit that sells the official books.  The book has an international following now, and I have heard from a lot of people for whom it is the ''only'' resource available (the official books are not cheap).  At first I just concentrated on the honors that had no answers, but after about a year of that, I was getting tapped out on expertise.  So I have now turned my attention to writing up the honors that do have official answers. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:54, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

I saw some of the work you were doing on [[Template:Goodbook2]], and it inspired me to modify the [[Template:Featured book]]. I updated it so it uses an #ifexist: statement to differentiate between books who have the proper goodbook template, and those that do not have one.

== IP blocking... ==

Hi Jim. Just to be safe, it's generally better to block problem IPs for a year (or shorter), rather than indefinite, since IP addresses can be transferred over time. Also, for IPs adding serial spam like that, I generally unselect &quot;anonymous users only&quot;, because otherwise accounts can still edit using the IP (sort of helps to have checkuser to be safe there, but if some unintentional collateral blocking happens, they can use the {{tl|unblock}} template and get our attention). --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:17, 18 June 2007 (UTC)
: OK.  Thanks for the education. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 16:38, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== Non-fiction versus textbooks ==

G'day Jomegat, please read the recent change made to [[WB:WIW]] in context. Before the anon edit, it said that &quot;''As a general rule, most non-fiction books are not suitable for inclusion as they are not instructional.''&quot; This is correct; whilst textbooks are (generally) non-fiction, not all non-fiction books are textbooks. For example, travel guides, dictionaries and encyclopaedia are usually non-fiction but are not suitable for Wikibooks as they are non textbooks. The next sentence says that &quot;''Fiction is not allowed on Wikibooks, although the use of allegory or fables as instructional tools can be permitted in some situations.''&quot; This covers the situation that I believe the anon editor was aiming for. 

Please revert your edit if you agree, or reply below (your talk page, not mine) and we can continue this discussion further. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:25, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

: Hi Webaware.  As you can see, I saw the brilliance of your logic and have reverted the edit. Thanks for pointing it out, and sorry for the confusion. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:21, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

::No worries, it was an easy mistake to make. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:25, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

== [[:Image:Boneset.jpg|Boneset]]! ==

Hey Jim! So nice to see a photo of that up now... someone had actually added an image of a different plant on the wikipedia page, which I had removed a few days ago. I used that image on [[v:BCP/Eupatorium perfoliatum|this page on Wikiversity]], and had a thought that you and the Youth Honors folks might be interested in participating on the bloom clock in general. It's a research project aimed in part at defining a global language for discussing bloom times, but also for creating illustrated keys by region and month (see [[v:Bloom Clock/White flowers seen in July in Southeastern Pennsylvania]]... the boneset picture actually appears on that page too now). Log entries from NH would be very nice (for me), since I go up there a couple times per year to visit my father-in-law on his farm near Charlestown.  There's [[v:Bloom_Clock/The_10_plants_per_month_pledge|one other page]] I worked on recently that might provide some ideas as well for how to contribute. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:00, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

: I didn't know about the bloom clock project, but yes, I am very interested in participating.  I have been involved in a similar project related to reptiles and amphibians http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/Wildlife/Nongame/reptiles_amphibians.htm - only the NH Fish and Game department's implementation is a little clunky.  This looks to be a better setup for the same sort of data.  As for involving other people involved in Pathfinders, I will mention it to the ones I know and post a message on our forum.  NHF&amp;G asks for (but does not demand) a photo of every sighting - I wonder if that would be a good idea for the bloom clock.  It would help weed out false data and perhaps bump up the number of photo contributions.
::False data could concievably be a problem, but I really sort of doubt it. My &quot;plan&quot; is to just ignore people who are adding things that look a bit funny, then just delete their logs a year or so after they get bored of playing silly. Eventually I'd like this to be peer-reviewed and come up with a global language of bloom time, but I'm thinking we'll need at least 10 years of data before we can get there, so there's plenty of time to set that up. Also, I'd rather people ''not'' upload image files unless they're an improvement over files already available on commons (fuzzy cell-phone-camera photos are better than no photos at all, but if there are already good ones, let's just stay conservative with the disk space). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:44, 29 July 2007 (UTC)
:The plant I uploaded last night is growing next to the kid's swing set in an un-mown section of my backyard.  There's also some Whorled Loosestrife out there and some Wild Sarsaparilla.  The Loosestrife is done blooming now for the most part - it's very difficult to find blossoms anymore - but I uploaded a pic of the sarsaparilla.  I have several more shots of some unknowns.  A personal goal I set for myself is to id every plant growing on my two acres of New Hampshire.  I am far from reaching that goal, but Boneset, Loosestrife, and Wild Sarsaparilla are plants that were previously unknown to me.  I've also got a plant in bloom right now and can't decide if it's catnip or downy wood mint.  I'll upload it to the unknown section as soon as I get a chance.
: Incidentally, I have had an REM song stuck in my head for the past several days because I ''perceive'' that it contains the word &quot;boneset&quot;.  Dunno if it really does, and I don't even know the name of the song. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 13:47, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Oh man... just lovin you right now :). I'd definitely '''&quot;Support&quot;''' a reptile clock as well... actually my first outreach project for Wikimedia Pennsylvania will be with a group that wants to start a butterfly clock/key using the same methods as the bloom clock. Given several years of contributions, these &quot;distributed research&quot; projects could really help us understand natural relationships in time and space (i.e., when Plant X is flowering, it's time to start looking for Turtle Y or Butterfly Z). Fun stuff... it took me almost a year to figure out the templating and logistical problems, but the Bloom Clock's structure should be easily adaptable to similar things. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

:::: Turns out the REM song is ''Swan, Swan, H'', and the lyric is 
:::::''Hey captain don't you want to buy&lt;br&gt;Some bone chains and toothpicks?''
::::But &quot;bone chains&quot; is close enough to &quot;boneset&quot; to get it stuck in my head. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:13, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

:: My unknown was the first one on the list of unknowns!  But I'm not sure it's really ''Prunella vulgaris'' - note that your specimen (and mine) has an entire edge, but the one on Wikipedia has a serrated edge.  Actually, all my books indicate that catnip should have a serrated edge too, and that's what has been holding me back on calling it that.  I had just about settled in my mind that I was looking at downy wood mint. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 14:04, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

::Nevermind.  Maybe it is ''Prunella vulgaris''.   went outside and found two specimens side-by-side - one with an entire, and another with a serrated margin. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:36, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Section 2.1 - Proofs==
'''Proofs''' are set up to let the user understand what steps were taken in order to receive a given output. There are three types of proofs depending on which is easiest to the student.
===Two-Column Proofs===
Two-column proofs (also known as formal proofs) are set up in a two-value table, one being &quot;Statement&quot; and the other being &quot;Reason&quot;.  To prove a simple problem using this method, set up a table like the following:

{| Style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot; rules=&quot;none&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;|Statement
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;| Reason 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot;|&lt;br&gt;
|}

Be sure to leave room for values to go in both columns. In geometry, the first row is the 'given' of the problem. This is the information that is given about a certain problem without using a picture. The last row should be the conclusion of what you are trying to prove.
====Example of a Two-Column Proof====
Now, suppose a problem tells you to solve &lt;math&gt;x + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, showing all steps made to get to the answer.  A proof shows how this is done:

{| Style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot; rules=&quot;none&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;|Statement
|align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f0f0&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px;&quot;| Reason 
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;x + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|Given
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|&lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black; padding:4px; margin: 0 auto;&quot;|Property of subtraction
|}

We use &quot;Given&quot; as the first reason, because it is &quot;given&quot; to us in the problem.

===Written Proof===
Written proofs (also known as informal proofs, paragraph proofs, or 'plans for proof') are written in paragraph form. Other than this formatting difference, they are similar to two-column proofs.

Sometimes it is helpful to start with a written proof, before formalizing the proof in two-column form.  If you're having trouble putting your proof into two column form, try &quot;talking it out&quot; in a written proof first.
====Example of a Written Proof====

We are given that x + 1 = 2, so if we subtract one from each side of the equation (x + 1 - 1 = 2 - 1), then we can see that x = 1 by the definition of subtraction.

===Flowchart Proof===
A flowchart proof or more simply a flow proof is a graphical representation of a two-column proof.  Each set of statement and reasons are recorded in a box and then arrows are drawn from one step to another.  This method shows how different ideas come together to formulate the proof.

==Section 2.2 - Reasons ==
Every concept in geometry flows in a logical progression.  One simply cannot go from A to B without explaining how and/or why.  For instance, the following is not a proof: 

5(x+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-x

x=4

Also, we cannot make up reasons why we made the next step so.  Therefore, we can only use certain information as our reasons.  These include:

'''1. Given:''' This is generally either the problem (equation) we are trying to solve, or some piece of important information given in the problem.  

'''2. Properties:''' These for the most part are the basic mathematical functions of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, such as the second reason in the example above (Property of Subtraction).

'''3. Definitions:''' Again, saying &quot;Because it is&quot; is not a reason.  This sort of reasoning is not seen as often as other reasons.  By using definitions, sometimes the answer or part of the working of a proof can be shortened.  For example, by using the reason &quot;definition of a bisector&quot; (and being ALREADY able to prove through either given information or earlier parts of the proof), you can prove that that two adjoining angles are congruent without having to go through a more lengthy proof.

'''4. Postulates:''' Postulates hold the same value as theorems (explained next), except that they cannot be proven.  However, these generalized rules have proven correct for a very long time and can be accepted with proof of their validity.  An example is &quot;Through any two points there is exactly one line&quot;.  While it cannot be proven through a proof (although the authors dare anyone to disprove it), it is accepted as a reason.  There are few of these, so as good as it may sound, if you make it up, someone will notice.

'''5. Theorems:''' Theorems are statements that have been proven true through proofs of their own.  They are especially helpful shortcuts in their own right as by stating a theorem, a great many things are proven and you do not have to do all the work of re-proving the theorem.  Theorems can be simple (&quot;If two lines intersect, then they intersect in exactly one point.&quot;) or very complex (&quot;The composite of two isometries is an isometry.&quot; [Don't panic if you don't understand; it will be explained later on]).  Sometimes, you will be given the proofs for theorems; othertimes, as part of the exercises, you will be asked to prove it yourself.

'''6. Axioms:''' For most purposes, the same as Postulates.  The difference is that Axioms are algebraic in nature, while Postulates come mainly from geometry.

'''7. Corollaries:''' These are statements that stem from what becomes proven in theorems and definitions and do not require (though usually have) separate proofs themselves.  

In many textbooks, the proofs are numbered for an index at the back of the book.  When doing correct geometric proofs, it is NOT OK to write down &quot;Theorem 15&quot;.  Write out the statement exactly as it was given to you (yes, you have to do some memorization for geometry). You have to make sure that the information in the box is related to the earlier box.

==Section 2.3 - Using Proofs in Geometry==
===Exercises===

Answers to each exercise can be found separately in the Appendix.

'''Given:'''
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{GH} || \overrightarrow{DK}&lt;/math&gt; Line GH is parallel to ray DK
* &lt;math&gt;\angle 6 = 75^\circ&lt;/math&gt; Angle 6 = 75 degrees.
* &lt;math&gt;\angle 2 = 30^\circ&lt;/math&gt; Angle 2 = 30 degrees.  

'''Prove:''' Find the measure of each numbered angle in the figure above.
== Section 2.4: Proof by Contradiction ==
Proof by contradiction, also known as indirect proofs, prove that a statement is true by showing that the proposition's being false would imply a contradiction.

===A Classic Example: Proving that the Square Root of 2 is Irrational===
# Assume that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number, meaning that there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and an integer &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in general such that &lt;math&gt;a/b = \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a simplified fraction &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are coprime integers, that is, their greatest common divisor being 1.
# It follows that &lt;math&gt;a^2 / b^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^2 = 2 b^2&lt;/math&gt;. &amp;emsp; (&amp;thinsp;&lt;math&gt;(a/b)^n = a^n/b^n&lt;/math&gt; &amp;thinsp;)
# Therefore &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; is even because it is equal to &lt;math&gt;2 b^2&lt;/math&gt;. (&lt;math&gt;2 b^2&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily even because it is 2 times another whole number and even numbers are multiples of 2.)
# It follows that ''a'' must be even (as squares of odd integers are never even).
# Because ''a'' is even, there exists an integer ''k'' that fulfills: &lt;math&gt;a = 2k&lt;/math&gt;.
# Substituting &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; from step 6 for ''a'' in the second equation of step 3: &lt;math&gt;2 b^2 = (2k)^2&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = 4k^2&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;b^2 = 2k^2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Because &lt;math&gt;2k^2&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by two and therefore even, and because &lt;math&gt;2k^2 = b^2&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; is also even which means that ''b'' is even.
# By steps 5 and 8 ''a'' and ''b'' are both even, which contradicts that &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible as stated in step 2.
::'''''[[w:Q.E.D.|Q.E.D.]]'''''

Because there is a contradiction, the assumption (1) that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number must be false. By the law of excluded middle, that is, that a proposition can only be true or false, the opposite is proven: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dude, Pico de Gallo can be compared to salsa, but it is certainly not what North Americans mean when they say salsa. Flavor and water content are way different. If anything, it's Mexicans who call it Salsa de Mexicana because of the colors.

== tomatoes ==

What kind of tomato is good to use? Should it be peeled? seeds removed? [[User:Dgrant|dave]] 07:09, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

Yeah, this is a big omission. Pico should have tomatoes. Honestly, Dave? Campari on the vine tomatoes, de seeeded and chopped, are amazing in this version of pico. They're sweet, and offset the spice nicely. Personally, though, I use red onion rather than yellow or white. Most traditional pico, speaking from living in the tex mex region for a good while, uses red onions.</text>

== THE INNOVAKIDS CONCEPT == 
 

The Innovakids.com concept integrates the requirements of classroom management with the overall Standardized Curriculum focus needed to move our students to Proficiency.   With the requirements of  NCLB (No Child Left Behind), schools are faced with the dilemma of finding innovative ways to teach our children differently.  The Innovakids site was created by teachers who saw a need for a tool to integrated the collaborative knowledge base of teachers across the nation into a centralized fully usable data-warehouse and interactive web based environment.  Not simple a system that allows teachers and parents to access grades online, or a system of computerizing tests with automated grading, but a fully integrated school system that centralizes all the content, lessons, quizzes, lesson plans, assessment, discipline, grade books, student management, curriculum, homework, progress reports and more into a system that individualizes the learning plans of each student and links these resource into the State Standards of Education. 

 
== INNOVAKIDS FEATURES  == 
 

Integrated Student Database  - The Innovakids database allows educators a web based interface to enter and access the basic student information needed in the course of a school year.  This database includes the student’s parent and home information, contact information as well as basic medical requirements.  Through this database the teacher can access phone numbers, addresses, and email accounts of the students parents and guardians. 
Grade book – The integrated grade book automatically is updated with grades as the students complete each lesson and assessment.  The teacher can add grades manually, edit grades or print progress and grade reports with the most current grade information.  Parents can access current grades online and well as receive emails of completed lessons and progress reports.  Teachers can print progress reports, charts and graphs and view real times reports and graphs as students are working. 
Student Schedules – Parents, teachers and students can view and print their entire school schedule through the web interface. 
Online Assessments – All lesson and class related assessments are available online for immediate grading or printable through the teacher interface.  These assessments are automatically graded and grades are immediately updated in the online grade book. 
Online Quizzes – Each lesson concept includes a question used for immediate evaluation of that concept. 
Online Lessons – In place of PowerPoint slides and Transparencies the Innovakids system allows teachers to build the concept slides directly into the site via web browser from any location.  Teacher may add video, sound, images, Concept information, and a question to each concept.  The slides are unlimited for each lesson although we recommend between 10 and 20 per lesson.  After the lessons are added on line they are available to any teacher using the system via the lesson library.  Each lesson is linked to a state standard and allows any teacher search by key word or by standard to see all the other lessons in the system associated to that standard.  
Automatic Emailing of Student Progress Reports – The most important feature is the email and mail function that allows students to receive lesson progress reports after each student completes their lesson.  This automatically send progress report list not only the name of lesson and associated standard but the questions and concepts that the student marked incorrectly and calculates and displays the students current grade for that class based on this completed lesson.  
Quizzes Integrated with online Lessons – Each concept in the lesson has an associated assessment question that is asked as the student reads the concept.  If the student marks the question incorrectly the system returns the student back to the concept page where that information was taught or can return the student back to the beginning of the lesson allowing for repetition of the lesson.  The grading for each lesson is determined via a calculated total of each concept question (even if the concept was repeated) divided by the number of questions answered correctly. (i.e. If the student answered 10 questions but had to re-answer  2 of the questions then the grade would be based on 12 total questions divided by the number that were answered correctly.) 
Administration Systems fully integrated – Graphs, Reports and Charts depicting overall teacher, standard, concept and student results from each lesson.  This system also reports on overall understanding and progress of each standard being taught by grade, ethnicity, teacher, team, or grouping. 
Lesson Plan sharing – Just like the online lessons the Lesson Plan Library is a central shareable library where teachers around the world can input lesson plans, link them to online lessons and standards.  These Lesson Plans will print in the Lesson Book at the end to assist the teacher in planning their class period activities. 
Import lessons and quizzes from other teachers  - The Online lesson library includes the ability to create new lessons and share them automatically with other teachers.  This allows teachers to search by keyword for related lessons or by standard for lessons that fit their particular pacing guide or curriculum.  Once these lessons and quizzes are imported the teacher may customize them to fit their needs. 
Progress Reports – Students, Parents and Teachers may print or view online a progress report for any class or a summary progress report for all classes.   These progress reports can also be automatically emailed to each student’s parents in a class with the pressing of one button or emailed to an individual’s parent.  The progress reports can also be printed for an entire class or individual student and includes a formatting that includes the parent’s name and address for mailing in windowed envelopes. 
Parent communication – The integration with parent communication tools is essential for the system.  This toolset includes: Online access for parents via the web; Mailed and automatically emailed progress reports; Automatically emailed lesson completion reports; Discipline reports (Referrals) automatically attached to progress reports (emailed, mailed, online or printed); Notification online of class and school events; Online communication with parents via email and discussion groups; Online chat rooms for parents to chat with administrators and teachers at set times. 
Teacher and Student Observations – Student observations are available for input by the teacher via the web.  
Student Team Management – Student teams in each class can be easily input into the system.  Teachers can quickly view what students are on what teams for assignments and assessment summarizing. 
Seating Charts – Student seating charts are online and easily accessible by teachers, subs and administrators. 
Curriculum Plan – District Pacing guides, Department Curriculum Plans and/or Teacher class curriculum plans are input online and easily available via the web. 
Classroom Management – The system is designed to give teachers a fully integrated classroom management system to centralize and share the resource used for each subject.  The Student management system allows for quick integrated access of addresses, phone numbers, discipline records, standardized test information, special ed information and academic information.  The concept is to allow teachers and administrators to enter information once and have it available to everyone who has permission and access rights. 
 
Student Information Management – All the basic information is placed online in the system and available to all those with access. 
Online Homework with ability for students to complete homework online  - Parent’s and students can access the web and view all the homework required for that class and all classes.  These assignments are automatically entered into the grade book when a teacher creates them and are available in the homework section of the automatic progress reports. 
Discipline - Online Referrals for Teachers with automatic printing on Progress Reports 
Individualize Learning Plans – The concept of Innovakids is to begin to manage many students with a system that treats each student as an individual learner.  This ILP approach presents a way for teachers to directly instruct the class according to the pacing guide and curriculum but allow students to move through the class at their own pace with immediate communication with the parent and teacher.  If a student requires a week to pass a lesson the system allows for that.  If a student needs to repeat a lesson 3 times before passing the system allows for that.  If a student can work ahead of a class the system allows for that. 
 

This section focuses on the use of websites in the classroom.  Classroom websites help facilitate the creation of a blended learning environment.  Teachers use classroom websites to post assignments, receive homework submissions, administer tests, and post grades and classroom policies.  Teachers also use classroom websites as the medium to link to blended learning sites such as external websites, videos, software, graphics, audio feeds, and virtual field trips.  In ''The Web-Enhanced Classroom'', Klaus Schmidt discusses four necessary components for successfully enhancing a course via the internet: Administration, Assessment, Content, and Community (Schmidt, 2002).  A classroom website is one way to implement these components into a web-enhanced course.  The classroom website acts as an extension to the teacher's administration toolkit.  Teachers can post links, assignments, grades, and communicate with students and parents all from their classroom website.

'''Teacher Resources''':

Teachers can incorporate blended learning into their classroom by linking resource sites and external websites to their classroom website.  The following is a list of useful links for teachers for blended learning activities:

*[http://www.marcopolo-education.org/home.aspx MarcoPolo: Internet Content for the Classroom] is a nonprofit consortium of education organizations dedicated to providing standards-based internet content and professional development for K-12 teachers and students.  Teachers can access lesson plans, student activities, and website reviews through seven content websites.  MarcoPolo also features a network of over 200,000 registered educators in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

{{NPOV}}



The use of a Course Management System (CMS) can assist a teacher when they are creating a blended learning environment in the K-12 classroom.  In addition to using a classroom website to communicate and administer classroom activities (as described in the previous section), a CMS can better assess student work, share course content and help develop a community among the teacher, students and parents.  

A CMS enables the administration of blended activities into the classroom through various tools included with the software. For example, a teacher is able to distribute handouts, set assignment deadlines, collect assignments and give quizzes from one location. This frees up time for the teacher.  As stated by Schmidt (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt; , “A well-developed administrative component allows a teacher to spend more time interacting creatively with students and addressing higher level thinking skills rather than on mundane activities.” 

Enhanced communication between the teacher and students is another administrative benefit gained from using a CMS. A teacher is able to post announcements to the entire class or send an individual email.  In addition, syllabus information, grading policies and deadlines can be clearly communicated. Communicating between teacher, students, and even parents, can also occur more frequently with the use of a CMS. Using a CMS means that “assignments and lecture notes can be posted in advance, and students can have continual access to them” (Zirke, 2003) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A teacher can distribute material to the class ahead of time, as well as archive previous material, allowing the flexibility for students to work at their own pace or refer back to previous content.  

Course Management Systems also assist teachers in assessing student learning.  “One great advantage of assessing student learning via the Internet is the ability to provide instant feedback to the student” (Schmidt, 2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Instant feedback can reinforce learning a lesson being taught and gives the teacher an opportunity to reach a student that may have missed a concept.  A useful feature of a CMS is the ability for teachers to easily create quizzes.  No programming or HTML knowledge is necessary because the CMS provides a quiz function.  An added advantage of the quiz function in a CMS is the ability to offer multiple quizzes and tests for the students to use for practice.  Schmidt (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  states, “a teacher can facilitate a random selection of test questions each time a student want to retake a quiz for practice purposes on the same subject matter.”   The CMS collects, grades, and records the score of the quizzes and tests, saving valuable time for a teacher.  With a password, each student can access his or her individual grades.  A parent could have a password, as well, to monitor the progress of his or her child by going online at any time of the day.

A CMS enables a teacher to implement blended learning activities into their K-12 classroom in a more organized and functional way.  Using a CMS for routine classroom administration tasks is an added bonus, providing the teacher with time for enhanced instruction.   

Website resources are available for teachers to compare a variety of Course Management Systems.  One website, [http://www.edutools.info/course/ EduTools], gives product information, product comparisons, and student feedback.  Although a variety of CMS exist, this section focuses on six main CMS examples (WebCT, Blackboard, Moodle, CCNet, ANGEL, and Desire2Learn).

==Desire2Learn==
K-12, Higher Ed, Corporations and Health Care Organizations have been using the [http://www.desire2learn.com/products Desire2Learn Learning Management System]  (LMS) since 1999 (www.desire2learn.com). 
The product, the [http://www.desire2learn.com/learningenvironment/ Desire2Learn® Learning Environment], is a web-based suite of teaching and learning tools for course development, delivery and management. Desire2Learn's Learning Environment provides ways to control the environment to match your approach to teaching and learning, and provides tools to help facilitate communication, collaboration and community building. Educators can customize courses by using a variety of multimedia files.  Desire2Learn has several tools that are useful to online educators including email, glossaries, [http://www.desire2learn.com/competencies/ competencies] , Rubrics, [http://www.desire2learn.com/liveroom/ LiveRoom®] and the [http://www.desire2learn.com/eportfolio/ ePortfolio].

==Blackboard==
&quot;Through a network of state, regional and local districts, Blackboard serves over 1,200 U.S. schools in 46 states&quot; (www.blackboard.com, 2005). Blackboard &quot;provides software solutions that help manage online academic environments. Blackboard's Course &amp; Portal Solutions for example, provides online course management, academic communities and administrative services&quot; (Schmidt, 2002). Teacher Vivian Evans, gives a personal account of Blackboard, stating that &quot;Blackboard has got some good features...It supports synchronous chat and discussion threads in a way that is very clear. Site administration is another strength. You can control who has access to your site. You can also look back at what happened previously by clicking on a past date to see what was discussed&quot; (Evans, 2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the [http://www.blackboard.com Blackboard webite], &quot;Whether a student is hospital or homebound, a traveling athlete or involved in extra-curricular activities, the Blackboard Learning System allows students to take courses online or supplement face-to-face learning&quot; (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation required. }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is done through the &quot;Virtual Classroom/Collaboration feature&quot; which offers synchronous chats and office hours. Blackboard also has an &quot;Assignments&quot; feature, allowing students to receive feedback from the teacher after submitting an assignment through Blackboard (www.blackboard.com, 2005).

==Moodle==
According to the [http://www.moodle.org Moodle Website], &quot;Moodle is a course management system (CMS) - a free, Open Source software package designed using sound pedagogical principles, to help educators create effective online learning communities&quot; (2005). Moodle is used in a variety of settings by a variety of institutions, such as universities, schools, companies, and teachers, throughout the world. Specifically, Moodle is used in universities, high schools, primary schools, non-profit organizations, private companies, by independent teachers and parents home schooling their children (Moodle Background, 2005). What makes Moodle truly unique is the price tag; Moodle is completely free to use (www.moodle.com, 2005).

Moodle does not require the installation of any particular software; it can be created, edited, and used solely online.  The creation and editing system is user-friendly and seems to have been designed with the novice user in mind.  Templates encourage clear organization of assignments and resources, and forums are also simple to create.  Likewise, the student user will quickly learn the simple navigation system with little frustration.

Moodle was created by Martin Dougiamas, a former university webmaster and system administrator of the university's WebCT installation. Dougiamas states that he &quot;encountered many frustrations with the WebCT beast and developed an itch that needed scratching - there had to be a better way (no, not Blackboard :-)&quot; (Moodle Background, 2005). In order to do this, Dougiamas believes that &quot;it is crucial...that this software be easy to use - in fact it should be as intuitive as possible&quot; (Moodle Background, 2005).

==CCNet == 


According to the [http://www.myccnet.com/ CCNet website], &quot;CCNet is a web-based course management and class communication tool. It provides a powerful teaching and study management solution for students, teachers, and administrative staff. CCNet is extremely user friendly and designed to meet the needs of all types of institutions. It has been used with great success by prominent schools and universities as well as individual teachers and professors since its unveiling in September, 2000.&quot;

 
==ANGEL Learning == 


According to the [http://www.angellearning.com/ ANGEL website] ANGEL LMS provides a set of teaching and learning features that are open to adaptation. ANGEL's openness allows faculty and information technology professionals to focus on delivering good teaching. It allows the enterprise to control the capabilities it delivers to its users and add the learning content, resources, and technologies that best fit its users' needs.  ANGEL Learning was acquired by Blackboard in May, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackboard.com/Company/Media-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1285265|title= Blackboard to Acquire ANGEL Learning, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==eChalk==
According to the [http://www.echalk.com/ eChalk website], eChalk provides K-12 schools and educational environments with the necessary tools for students, parents and teachers to obtain a thriving academic community.  

eChalk facilitates both cooperative and collaborative learning models.  A cooperative learning model is used more often in lower education because it is a simpler and more teacher-led style of learning.  Students obtain some necessary learning skills, but this learning style mainly serves to prepare students for collaborative learning.  Collaborative learning is a higher form of learning that usually occurs in late middle and upper school.  The students have much more independence and room to explore in their learning.  Collaborative learning helps students learn more than just the required subject material; the students also learn crucial learning tools and how to work independently.

eChalk allows the teachers to alter their class pages according to the learning style of the class.  The teacher can lead the students every step of the way by posting many assignments and communicating constantly (this is an example of cooperative learning) or simply posting a subject matter and leaving the students to learn and explore on their own (this is an example of collaborative learning).  These two learning styles are available to the students 24x7 because eChalk brings learning outside the classroom and into the homes of the students.

The company was co-founded by Daniel Watts and Torrance Robinson in 1999 in an initiative to bring computers and internet access to schools in New York.  However, the project has now spread across the U.S.

Blending online and face to face instructors and learners

As stated in the introduction to this chapter, one of the criticisms of Blended Learning is that the definition lacks specificity. (Oliver and Trigwell, 2005) As a result, many of the characteristics of Blended learning look so similar to one another that it is impossible to tell them apart. The characteristics seem to have different terms that describe the same set of criteria. Such is the case for the blending of online and face to face instructors and learners. 

After several rounds of disucssion, the contributors of this chapter were unable to elucidate the difference between &quot;Blending online and face to face instructors and learners&quot; from &quot;Blending synchronus and asynchronus learning&quot; and &quot;Online and offline Learning.&quot;

The only possible difference that we discussed is that in a Blended Learning environment, the line between instructor and learner might be blurred, so that the instructor is not just the person disseminating knowledge, but rather a member of the learning community, who contributes to the construction of knowledge, and takes away from the course re-imagined understandings of the content. In other words, as one Instructor who utilizes blended learning put it, the teacher should be &quot;the guide on the side, instead of the sage on the stage.&quot; (Scagnoli, 2005)</text>

The index shows there should be entries on the for loop and for the loop control variables break and redo.  I did not see them in this section.

== For... is missing, and much else ==

Is this by accident or is the content not complete yet? 

If not, would it make sense to add stubs for the sections to encourage people to write them? Now, no one knows they're missing unless they're looking specifically for them..</text>

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. You current naming convention is depreciated and has several disadvantages - like it has no navigational links. Also you worthy effort is neiter considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an exstensive book and section detector.

== Fortran 90/95 vs. Fortran 77 ==

I'll be helping developing this wikibook, as I'm currently doing a project in Fortran. However, I will concentrate on Fortran 90/95, and not Fortran 77. Right now they are intertwined with each other, so I will segregate the tutorials for Fortran 77 into a separate section, if there are no objections.
--[[User:Arthurv|Arthurv]] 11:49, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

Why would a 2006 Fortran book begin by discussing problems with Fortran 77? Just delete all the 77 stuff - its 30 years old.  And its already online if anyone wants it -- see
* {{cite book
  | first = Clive G.
  | last = Page

  | title = The Professional Programmer's Guide to FORTRAN 77

I've never looked at a Wiki book before, so there is a lot (everything?) that I don't know about them.  Unless all Wiki books have the same purpose, it would help if this book began with what its purpose is, what it will and will not do.  If readers don't know the purpose of the book, makes it hard to comment on (that's an argument for knowing the purpose, not for concealing it!).

: Fortran 77 is still alive and well. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 07:25, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

:: Despite its age F77 is still very commonly used in scientific computing. However, it would be very good idea to make separate wikibook for F77 and F90/95 standards. Even thought they are not very far different, they are different enought to do so. Now this is like making a same textbook for german and dutch... [[User:130.232.104.44|130.232.104.44]] 12:22, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

::: I would hardly compare German and Dutch. Perhaps Dutch and Flemish would be more apt. F90/95 is, moreover, (mostly?) backwards compatible with F77. [http://h21007.www2.hp.com/dspp/files/unprotected/Fortran/docs/lrm/dflrm.htm The Compaq Fortran Language Reference Manual] designates extensions to the F95 standard with a different colour text. A pretty neat solution in my mind. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:32, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
:::: F77 is forward compatible with f90 and not the other way around. [[User:128.220.23.214|128.220.23.214]] 01:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: Some of the deprecated features of Fortran 77 were removed from the Fortran 90 standard, (e.g. pause) but most compilers maintain backwards compatibility for the convenience of users with legacy code.  The biggest fields for the language are computational chemistry and meteorology and I have ''never'' seen any new code written in Fortran 77 in the 10 years I've been writing code for weather modeling.  It's not simply not practical to restrict yourself to 6 character variable and subroutine names in a program of any size.  While there are many fine libraries like LAPACK and BLAS still written in 77 there is absolutely no reason to write new code in anything but the newer standards.  GNU Fortran is free, Open64 free, Oracle gives away the old Sun Fortran for free, and they all support at least the 1990 standard and they're all fast.  Teaching anyone to code in 77 is a waste of time.

Fortran 77 should definitely neither be deleted from, nor ignored by this book. Right now I have to learn Fortran 77 to find my way round a (scientific) program, that was written in the late 80's and is to be extended by me. And I'm very thankful for those tutorials that still exist in the web. I suggest not to make seperate books, but different chapters of the different versions. Compare [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran] for inspiration. (You'll get the idea, even if you don't understand any German.) -- [[User:Macumba|Macumba]] ([[User talk:Macumba|talk]]) 13:41, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

I work in science and there is a lot of existing fortran code around, most that I have dealt with is fortran 77. It is common to need to read an modify this code. However most people have moved from g77 to gfortran compiler, so you could call it fortran90/95 that happens not to use the new features. For it would be most useful to have F90/95 book, with comments about what is new, and examples of old/obsolete features (that should maybe be avoided or removed).

== Fortran vs. FORTRAN ==

The current spelling of Fortran does not use all capital letters, so I have changed &quot;FORTRAN&quot; to &quot;Fortran&quot;, except when FORTRAN 77 or an earlier version of the language is being referenced.</text>

== Top ten active ==

The top ten active users and wikibooks list hasn't been changed for over three months now! If the features that updates these parts isn't available any more, they should be taken off the front page, as it makes it look out of date and neglected. If, however, there is a way availabe, why isn't it up to date? --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 18:42, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I totaly agree. I haven't been visiting wikibooks for long, but the fact that the first thing that a visitor sees is a list dating back from march, gives the feeling that &quot;This site is no longer updated.&quot;  [[User:Almogo|Almogo]] 21:00, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Agreed. If this section is not updated by an automated process, ''or'' some standards are put in place to define whose responsibility it is to update it and when, it should be removed from the front page. It is likely to confuse visitors otherwise. They may think that they are getting a (really old) cached page, or that the site it dead. Are there any standards in place already which cover these issues? [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:18, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: There are instructions on how to do it somewhere (i've lost the page), but it requires downloading a 200 meg SQL dump and the link to said dump is incorrect. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:52, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: This is hardly a solution. I don't believe I have the necessary permissions to change this page, but someone ought to. Still, the administrative system does not guarantee that any of the people who are able to sort this out are still active users of the system, nor even alive. This needs to be resolved. To keep this site ordered, meaningful and up-to-date, responsibilities must to taken on by, or assigned to specific users. If those users cease to become active users, the responsibilites must be transferred. Anarchy must not prevail, or else the site will eventually degrade into rubbish and meaninglessness.

:: This is not the only problem. The system for organising and catergorising books also needs an overhaul. The different means of indexing books and pages are out of sync, and confusing, especially for new users. Even the distinction betweeen what is a book, and what is merely a page of a book is poorly defined. I also noticed no indications regarding sensible use of namespaces. [[Appendix|This page]], for example, seems completely out of place. Perhaps the wiki software is to blame. I guess it works well for Wikipedia, since it is only a single book, and the namespace usage is fairly obvious, but I don't think it works here without more guidelines.

:: The fundamental problem here is with language. Everyone has their own interpretation of what different words actually mean. If people are to co-operate effectively, meanings of words within specific contexts must be well-defined. In a way, this is the whole point of Wikipedia, which is why it works much better than Wikibooks.

:: For an example, check out the work I've been doing on [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas/Meta|this page]] and its sub-pages. By keeping track of naming standards, pages, templates, and images, it's so much easier to create a comprehensive guide, whilst minimising namespace pollution, and simplifying the process of restructuring a book, without having to rename pages. Perhaps something akin to this on a global level might also prove successful. Certainly some reflexive system of rules ought to be very effective. I am reminded of the ''game theory'' game of [[w:Nomic|Nomic]]. If you ignore the scoring system, this is effectively what we have been doing with our own naming standards, by discussing and modifying the rules based on our discussions.

:: Any thoughts?

:: [[User:Aya|Aya]] 17:01, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Hm, it's now July. Nobody around who can remove that list from March? I think it looks much better if it is removed completely, than letting it be outdated by half a year. Allefant, 9 July 2005
: Completely agree. Can someone PLEASE remove this or update? It looks utterly tacky. Serge July 9, 2005 01:54 (UTC)
: '''Update''': I've discovered the problem with the DB dumps. There's an erroneous line:

 /* &lt;something here&gt; */;

: This needs to be removed from the file before you can import into MySQL. Now if someone can tell me where the scripts are to generate the stats, I can get this done. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 21:31, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I assume, this is the complete process to get the wiki code for it: {{bad link|Wikibooks:Top_active/SQL_query/March_2005}}. All done in SQL. And Do you have permission to update the list? If so - maybe you can temporarily remove the outdated list, until you (or the original author) manages to re-run the SQL? [[User:Allefant|Allefant]] 06:50, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

::: I've temporarily removed the out-of-date info from the page, and provided a link instead should someone eventually get this data sorted out. It's somewhat dependent on getting up-to-date DB dumps, and the last one there is too old to generate up-to-date statistics from. I'm also unconvinced that the data set is as up-to-date as it claims. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:55, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:::: Thanks, I really think it makes the front page look better for now. And I hope this gets sorted out, maybe whoever runs the server can install a script to produce a monthly activity report from the DB automatically.. [[User:Allefant|Allefant]] 20:12, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Remove of book listings on the front page? ==

* Just too many books to list here
* When you click on a topic, the list of books under that topic are most likely different then the books on the front page (either the author adds it to the topic listing or directly to the front page). 

Lets just simplify it and put all the books on topic pages and have one or two books per day/per topic as &quot;books of the day&quot; for the front page--[[User:RobKohr|RobKohr]] 17:17, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Book of the month ==

I would like to suggest a &quot;book of the month&quot;, similar to how it is working in the [[de:Hauptseite|German version of Wikibooks]], because it seems to work quite well there: Every month all registered Wikibook users can vote from a couple of nominated books for beeing next month's &quot;book of the month&quot;. I guess Wikibooks is maturing to allow for 12 excellent books to be displayed on the main page a year (similar to Wikipedia's &quot;Featured article&quot;). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 18:39, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: I would like to reserve at least a quarter of the main page for the [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|Book of the month]], to increase the value of this award. In the future this should preferably be a well-selected picture with some introductory text to the &quot;book of the month&quot;. In the last week of January, I would like to increase the interest in the vote by placing a '''picture of a big question mark''' '''&quot;?&quot;''' with the last call for voting. I will try to set something up during the next couple of days on my user subpages, and present it here first. If somebody could create a really cool kind of questionmark (maybe floating above a book, ...) that would be great! Otherwise, I would probably only contribute a very simple question mark. Also if you have other suggestions for this, let me know.

== Change Featured Wikibooks to Most Active Wikibooks ==

* Since the book of the month (see above) would take the role of the &quot;Featured Wikibooks&quot;, I would suggest to rename Featured Wikibooks to &quot;Most Active Wikibooks&quot; - and list the, say, '''Top 5 of currently active Wikibooks''' (that means highest number of contributors in the last month (can be checked e.g. by &quot;Related changes&quot; or by a still to be defined [[m:Requests_for_queries|SQL query]]). 
* &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; is fine, as books get rotated through, but..
* &quot;Struggling Wikibooks&quot; is quite undefined. It is not clear who can add books to this category and who will take them away again. Either it should be also organized in a kind of rotating manner (add books with a date and delete the first in list), or by some kind of voting system.
* &quot;Wikijunior&quot; is just promotional, but to be fair it should contain a link to the [[m:Wikijunior|Wikijunior background]], stating that it is a project started by the Beck Foundation approaching the Wikimedia Foundation.  --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 19:17, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Changing new books template ==

I would like to suggest moving Template:New to Template:Newbooks.  I already started Template:Newbooks.  I was going to go ahead with it myself, but I noticed the Main page is locked which would prevent this from happening without an Administrator stepping in.  I suggest this change because I noticed its being used elsewhere by accident from copying over help pages from Wikimedia.  Wikimedia uses Template:New for another perpose.  So far only two pages are effected by this cross over, [[Help:Editing#Edit summary|Help:Edit summary]] and [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|Help:Page history]]. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:06, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)

:Okay, but don't just fork off a new page (now removed). You should instead set up a redirect until the point where an administrator has changed the page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 20:06, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Removal of Wikibooks display from main page ==

It seems obvious that Wikibooks is growing a lot and taking up too much space on the [[Main Page]]. I've replaced the display of Wikibooks with a link to the [[Wikibooks:Departments|template]]. This way, there's an entire page devoted to all active Wikibooks.

The Main Page should be developed further so that it has more interesting and useful information such as &quot;[[Wikibooks:Book of the month/February 2005 voting|Book of the month]]&quot;. I hope this is acceptable to everyone. [[User:Mkn|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]-- [[User talk:Mkn|Mkn]] 12:44, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Mnk! Your changes are just in the spirit of presenting a clear and concise first page for both, first-time visitors and active Wikibook users. You should be careful though, that there are several versions of the homepage (standard, table-free, and text-only), and you adjusted only one of them. 
: I personally like to have the template of all Wikibooks on the first page, because it gives a richer view of what kind of books can be found, and your link (&quot;all ... can be found '''here'''&quot;) is not prominent enough that each first-time user will click on it. I hope you will accept that I revert this change, and put the template back in. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 13:25, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Follow-up: I think, in the future we should try by keeping the main page more clean not by removing the bookshelves template, but by carefully commenting out books that look like stubs (they will still stay fully prominent on the bookshelf itself - just not in the template - and as soon as there is reasonable activity, they can be put back again on the main page). What do you think about this? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 13:30, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::I agree with Andreas: The link wasn't at all prominent and it's doubtful that (1) a new user would even see the link; and (2) that a user would be likely to click on it. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:06, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::OK Andreas Ipp. I also thought about that but I'm not sure how else to make it more obvious to navigate to the active wikibooks. I just thought there's a need to seperate the books from the main page. Or maybe I'm following Wikipedia design too closely. [[User:Mkn|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]-- [[User talk:Mkn|Mkn]] 21:21, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::I just came back from a seminar by Edward Tufte: I think we need not be affraid of having links to many different books, people can figure out the scrolling part. I think the information is still navagatable because people can easily find the section they want. (For example, it's not hard even scanning just 5% of the words to find the computer science or biology or any other sections.) Perhaps to handle scalability we'll want maybe some icons next to the sections: your typical Sigmas for mathematics, Atoms and beakers for science, Computers for computer science... But even without icons listing the books is still ok. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:57, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Top 10 active ==

Shouldn't this be by the most edits in the past whatever (month week day, etc.) instead of number of users who've edited it.  1000 minor edits by different users doesn't make it more active than 20 major edits of around 1 page each (for instance, I know I'm exaggerating people).  Also, as of now, someone's replaced the arrow pics and it's really ugly with those HUGE green arrows, it looked better before.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:49, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)
: 1) Hi Naryathegreat. About the ranking: I wanted to make this list an indicator for the '''community effort''' on a book. In this sense, having 20 different people looking into a book and making a small edit each indicates more community interest and activity than 20 edits by one single user. This way, you get those books to the top that might interest most people (and not very specialized books that only 1 or 2 people really understand - they edit their books anyway...). That's the idea behind it. But I might take up your idea and publish a second list which ranks all books according to total number of contributions. It might be interesting what comes out there.
: 2) Someone (User Everlong at Commons) replaced 2 of the 3 arrows in use by smaller ones, without changing the pixel number in the template. I reduced it now from 20px to 12px. Let me know if it looks nicer now on your screen (on mine the arrows did not get enlarged and did not seem so huge).--[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:29, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

We're halfway through April.  Shouldn't the homepage show the top 10 active for March instead of February?  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 22:19, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: The March statistics are now on the main page. There has been a slight delay, because the statistics are based on the database dumps which have been released a few days after April started, and it then takes a couple of days until I find time to process the data by SQL scripts. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:36, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: There is an issue with how the main page refreshes within your browser.  I'm having problems myself (using Mozilla).  Normally it isn't a problem, but consider that if you have made changes, that it has taken effect.  If you close your browser down and restart it, you should see the new changes, for instance.  Ugly soultion, I know, but it does work.  Now if somebody could give a good explaination....  I think it has something to do with the expiration setting for the main page, as sent out by the MediaWiki software.  I don't seem to have any problems beyond the front page.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:52, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

== Blender description ==

Hi all,

I'd like to thank all those that voted for the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book for book of the month!  But also, I was wondering if somebody could change the description of what Blender is on the homepage with the book of the month listing.  Right now it says this:

&quot;Blender 3D/Noob to Pro is a book that explains how to use the 3D modeling program blender.&quot;

But the Blender is so much more than just a 3D modeling program.  Maybe something like this would be more accurate:

&quot;Blender 3D/Noob to Pro is a book that explains how to use the Blender, the open source 3D creation suite.&quot;

== Too many new wikibooks ==

I have taken it upon myself to try to keep books older than a month off &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; - can we get some consensus maybe to change this to two weeks? The box is getting far too big and cumbersome, like the rest of the Main Page. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 10:32, July 16, 2005 (UTC)

I'm in the process of working out a new proposed structure for the Wikibooks main page but as an interim measure I am removing all books written over two weeks ago from the &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; to save on screen clutter. If there is major objections the following books were removed.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:5%&quot;&gt;
Okay. But I wouldn't expect too many other people with enough passion to help to change your fork of the [[Main page]]. Have a look through the rest of this talk page, and some of the issues raised in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] to see what other users think should and shouldn't be on the main page. A few common suggestions:

* Removal of any ephemeral content not being kept up to date (i.e. Top Tens).
* Removal of complete book listings from the bottom. One of my other projects is to sort out the bookshelves, but it's a big job. I'm still deciding on a classification scheme (Dewey is the best I can think of right now).
* Some sort of obvious link for newbies to send them to a page to help get them up to speed if they are new to wiki-based systems. Preferably get them off the site completely, and on to a safe test site. (see: [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Newbies]]).

Once you get a main page you're happy with, post a note in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] to get the attention of an admin who can actually make the appropriate changes to the real main page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:28, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

== Trolling warning ==

We need to start trolling a bit. We need to look for dead, or completely stupid books and stop them from spreading. Neospeak and Excuses(?) are just two examples. People, we can do better than that.

:Potential contributors are reminded to take a good look at [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]] before starting any new book, this is to prevent any later ill feeling. Note, in particular, that every book is expected to act primarily as an instructional resource (e.g., a manual). Any books that fall outside these guidelines, unfortunately, risks being deleted.

== Personal Wikibooks? ==

'''Note''': For clarity, I have abandoned the wiki practice of each user replying at the same indent level throughout the post. I tend to split up large chunks of other posts, and reply to each part separately. Indent levels ought to represent temporal distictions (i.e. what chat came first) rather than user distinctions.

I'd like to express my concern that there's a section on the main page, under 'New Wikibooks', called 'Personal Projects'. I'm not sure whether this has been debated before, I couldn't find evidence of any discussion here or in the staff lounge, but surely this type of thing doesn't really belong on Wikibooks? I mention this here first as I don't know whether this is merely pseudo-vandalism of the main page, or wether a decision has been made by the community at large to allow this kind of thing. I point out that in the prologue of one of the books under that section actively discourages anything other than minor editing. [[User:Lor|Lor]] 18:05, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

: This is entirely my doing, so you may fairly point the 'finger of blame' squarely at me. See [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Unreliable administrative system]] for justifications. Note that the pages linked to in the &quot;Personal Projects&quot; are all subpages of user pages. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I'm in agreement with Aya. Maybe there is some way to make clear that &quot;personal projects&quot; should be subpages of user pages but otherwise we need somewhere to put NPOV books. -  [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:52, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

::: Considering the enormity of this project, trying to make anything 'clear' is nigh impossible. See [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Policy visibility]]. I did add a note to the top of the page [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]], but again, we're perhaps incorrectly assuming that users have even bothered to read it. I'm beginning to think that the only workable solution is to just exemplify good practise in your edits (especially on highly visible pages), and hope people copy your examples. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I think we are in denial if we think that books can really remain totally NPOV (when was the last time you read something that was completely NPOV) but we do need a way of seperating these type of books from strictly neutral instructional books. -  [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:52, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

::: 'NPOV' is a bad expression. Even [[w:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Wikipedia's version]] has reams of clarification to get around that fact that 'neutral point of view' is a bad choice of words, since every 'language lawyer' attempts to pick it to pieces. See also [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#NPOV (Neutral Point Of View)]]. Perhaps it's just sufficient to say &quot;anything you write in the main namespace can be edited by anyone, so if you write anything contentious, don't expect it to stay there&quot;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:::: That sounds like a good idea. One idea I have for the front page is a segment to inform newbies/actually any other editors - eg. with link to sandbox, syntax help. Maybe we could have a prominent link to a page explaining what you've written above. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 08:32, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

:: The other point I might add is that at the moment neither the breadth  nor the depth to deny space on the Main Page to projects that have content on them. Although I realize we need some sort of &quot;new book recognition&quot; as incentive I dislike the idea of huge slabs of page space being given to books that hardly have any content. Any ideas for new segments featuring books with substantial content, anyone? [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:52, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

:: I certainly don't want to point a finger of blame at anyone, and I must say Aya that your Critique looks extremely thorough, well researched, and relevant. My concern is that these 'personal wikibooks' are actively discouraging collaboration, and editing. It promotes the idea that a certain wikibook is &quot;my wikibook&quot;. Now, I completely agree that there are some NPOV topics, and books about non-NPOV subjects (and I ask any readers to humour me for the moment and accept the general definition of non-NPOV in its broadest and most accepted sense) that simply -can't- be collaborations between many people - can you imagine a collaborative &quot;Critique of Wikibooks&quot;? It would be an all out edit war, of course. I agree that these books must necessarily be personal. My point is that they perhaps need another forum for promotion. The main page of Wikibooks is a medium for the promotion of Wikibooks as an extension of Wikipedia, and as such for Wikibooks that encourage collaboration, and bold editing by many users. As a quick example, a Wikibook entitled &quot;Critique of Wikibooks by Aya&quot; would, to me, be against the philosophy of Wikibooks - but a Wikibook entitled &quot;Various Critiques of Wikibooks&quot;, as a collaborative effort showing various user's critiques of Wikibooks, would be very much acceptable.

:: I'm often very rambly; I realised that I can sum up my position very quickly. I don't think that sub-pages of user-pages should be promoted on the Wikibooks main page - especially as personal projects. [[User:Lor|Lor]] 20:51, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

::: Ah. Now I see what you mean. First of all, I've noticed that both of these 'Personal projects' have passed their two-week period, and have now been removed. Also note I have removed the 'Personal projects' section until this dispute is sorted out.

::: The reason I originally put the section in, is that some guy kept trying to advertise his somewhat less NPOV work on the main page (in various inappropriate templates thereof), and there's not a lot you can do to stop it, so I decided a good compromise might be to allow it, providing it was a link to one of the guy's user pages, and clearly separated from the communal books. In a way, the work was a set of the user's own personal philisophies, and I think adding these things to your user page shouldn't necessarily be discouraged, since it can only serve to help users to better understand each other. In hindsight, I perhaps should have made the distinction more clear, but the main page is protected, and thus awkward to edit.

::: I guess I have somewhat shamelessly exploited the main page to promote my own work, but I did want to get as many opinions on the subjects there before I start making any radical changes, and that seemed like a good place to advertise. The point is, I could've put my book in the main namespace, and made it a community work, but I was worried it might spiral out of control without consistent editorial control. In a way, all it is, is a summary of the various issues that have arisen in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] and other pages which serve a similar role as a forum of discussion. Sure, it's possibly not NPOV, or it's possibly 'primary/original research', but I figured it was ''useful'' (at least to me, but I've received several complimentary comments from other users), and ''usefulness'' seems to be the determining factor in [[WB:VFD]].

::: Editorial control is really the distinction between these two categories. I feel some books benefit from having a primary editor, whereas others may not. Would this be a better way of wording the main page? If not, what would you suggest?

::: Also note that some of the more regular users here are trying to re-assess the whole Wikibooks project, and its goals/policies/guidelines/procedures/practices/scope. There's currently some discussion going on in [[&lt;nowiki&gt;User talk:KelvSYC#Re: [Textbook-l] Proposal for major policy overhaul&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (one of our more active administrators). If you have something constructive to add, I'm certain it would be appreciated. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:41, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:Fixed, although be aware that the list of books is not part of the (uneditable) main page, but an editable template included on it, which anyone can edit by clicking the &quot;edit template&quot; link below each section. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

::This is a tricky issue, IMHO.  It is best if you can somehow set up a consistant manner to start a new Wikibook, so it can be put on a bookshelf or otherwise organized and found after it has been created.  I don't see any problem at all for somebody to &quot;create&quot; a new link on the front page as a new Wikibook and then afterward go and start entering content into that Wikibook.  It would be wise in a situation like this to create an initial stub and then save it just to let people know you are serious that you really do intend to start the book, but otherwise it should be no big deal.  If a link like the one above stays &quot;red&quot; for a day or two, I don't see any reason to keep it there, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:36, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

=General points=
* Video [[w:DVD|DVDs]] are made up of [[w:VOB|VOB]] files which are basically packaged [[w:MPEG-2|MPEG-2]] A/V streams.
* You cannot just burn an [[w:AVI|AVI]] or a [[w:QuickTime#QuickTime_file_format|MOV]] onto a [[w:DVD|DVD]] and hope that it'll play on a [[w:DVD|DVD]] player; you need to convert the [[w:AVI|AVI]] or [[w:QuickTime#QuickTime_file_format|MOV]] to video [[w:DVD|DVD]] format first.

=Making a DVD with Premiere Pro=

==Using the Export to DVD function==

# Enter a blank DVD into your DVD drive
# Select your timeline
# Go to File &gt;  Export &gt; Export to DVD
# Select the &quot;Encoding&quot; tab on the left
# Select the Preset that you need (e.g. in the UK select PAL DV High quality 4Mb VBR two pass)
# You can edit the exact settings if you desire (for example, if you need to set it to 16:9 aspect ratio)
# Go through the remainder of the settings and ensure they are set correctly (if you're unsure then just leave them)
# Hit &quot;Record&quot;!

==Using Adobe Media Encoder==

You need to make MPEG 2 for the DVD, so you should export it out of PPro with the Adobe Media Encoder. Select the MPEG2-DVD presets and start with the &quot;PAL DV 4x3 High Quality 7Mb VBR 2 Pass SurCode for Dolby Digital 5.1&quot; preset. You get three free encodes with the SurCode encoder, so before you render this, switch to MPEG or PCM audio or if you are doing surround, you probably need to purchase the 5.1 encoder. The encoder will make the .m2v and a corresponding .wav or .mpa depending on which you select. Note, the VBR will &quot;render&quot; the file one time then it does it again. The first time, it is just looking at the file to decide where to vary the bitrate (hence the name Variable Bit Rate). So this process takes longer. If you are not concerned with saving space, you can use the CBR preset which is above the VBR preset. 

If you render an .avi with DV compression out of PPro and import it into your DVD software to encode to MPEG2, you are double compressing and it will degrade quality. 

If you render uncompressed .avi or .mov and import into DVD software and encode to MPEG2, you have a huge intermediate file to deal with.

If you plan it out properly, encoding the MPEG 2 out of PPro is the most logical thing to do for most situations. 

For example: you have a majority of video that is DV25 and put some uncompressed graphics over the top, either supers or CG stuff or whatever. When you render to DV, you get nasty compression chunks and artifacts around the edges of the text or in gradients etc.. You could retain the quality and render out of PPRO as uncompressed .avi or .mov, but that again is a huge file and the DV content does not benefit AND you still have to compress it to MPEG2. The graphics do look good, but the file is hard to work with. If you render to MPEG2 as I specify above you don't render to DV then MPEG2 (no concatenation from dual compression) and you have a decent sized file.

Note there is a bug with Hyperthreading and the Adobe Media Encoder, there is a patch from MainConcept to fix it.

The Advanced Computer Honor, like all things more than five years old and related to computing, is showing its age.  This book provides answers to all the requirements - even those that have been archaic for some time.  It is recognized that this work will itself be quickly outdated, but an attempt to update the answers has been made in this work.  

One of the goals in writing this answer book is to provide low-cost or free solutions to the problems presented.  All of the requirements requiring computer software can be met using high quality software that can be downloaded for free from the Internet.  Procedures for common commercially available software are also provided if that is available to you.  If you are going to teach this honor, you are urged to try the free packages - some of your students may not have another option.  You might be surprised at what can be done with these packages - free does not always mean cheap, and the free packages listed here have been carefully selected with quality in mind.

== 1. Have the Computer Honor ==

The answer book for the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Computer|Computer]] honor can be found in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational|Vocational]] chapter of this book.

== 2. Define the following terms ==
=== Baud Rate ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Baud rate is a measure of the &quot;signaling rate&quot; which is the number of changes to the transmission media per second in a modulated signal. 

For Example: 250 baud means that 250 signals are transmitted in one second. If each signal carries 4 bits of information then in each second 1000 bits are transmitted. This is abbreviated as 1000 bit/s.

Baud rate should not be confused with data rate (also called &quot;bits per second&quot;). Each signaling event transmitted can carry one or more bits (as many as 256 in some cases) of information. When each signaling event transmitted carries one bit the baud rate and the data rate are equal. However, it is more common to make better use of bandwidth by encoding multiple bits in one event. This reduces the transmission time required for sending information.

=== DIP Switch ===
A DIP Switch is a component on a circuit board containing four or more switches.  Each switch can be independently closed (conducts electricity) or open (does not conduct electricity).  The &quot;DIP&quot; portion of the name is an acronym meaning &quot;Dual Inline Package&quot; and refers to the switch's packaging.  A DIP will have two rows of pins (connectors), one on each side of the device.  DIP Switches are sometimes used for configuring a circuit's mode of operation.  They were formerly in common use for setting a board's address range and selecting an interrupt line.  With the advent of newer technologies, the need for DIP switches has been greatly reduced.  It is now rare to find them on computer boards.

=== Database ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A database is a collection of records stored in a computer in a systematic way, such that a computer program can consult it to answer questions. For better retrieval and sorting, each record is usually organized as a set of data elements (facts). The items retrieved in answer to queries become information that can be used to make decisions that might otherwise be more difficult or impossible to make. The computer program used to manage and query a database is known as a database management system (DBMS). The properties and design of database systems are included in the study of information science.

=== Word Processing ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A word processor (also more formally known as a document preparation system) is a computer application used for the production (including composition, editing, formatting, and possibly printing) of any sort of viewable or printed material.

=== Nanosecond ===
A nanosecond is one billionth of a second.  In other words, there are a billion nanoseconds in a second.  Many computers are capable of performing billions of operations per second, and so this unit of measure is often used to describe the speed at which these operations take place.

=== DOS ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The acronym DOS stands for disk operating system, an operating system component for computers that provides the abstraction of a file system resident on hard disk or floppy disk secondary storage. In some cases, the disk operating system was called DOS, and on the PC compatible platform, an entire family of operating systems was called DOS.

=== Internal Modem ===
The word modem stands for &quot;'''MO'''dulator/'''DEM'''odulator&quot;.  It is a device used for transmitting and receiving digital information over an analog channel.  The most common type of modem is used for transmitting and receiving digital information over a regular telephone line.  An internal modem is one which is installed inside a computer as an add-on card, or built-in to the motherboard.

=== External Modem ===
For the meaning of the word &quot;modem&quot;, see the previous entry on &quot;Internal Modem.&quot;  An external modem is usually plugged into an external serial (RS-232) port on a computer.  It comes with its own housing and power supply.  They are easier to connect than an internal modem, and often contain processing elements which offload the burden of modulation from the computer's main processor.  Internal modems can also contain such circuitry, but that is becoming less and less common, as it is cheaper to let the main processor handle these calculations.

=== Peripheral ===
A computer peripheral is a device that connects to a computer to extend the computer's capabilities.  It can be thought of as a device that sits &quot;to the side&quot; of the computer, just as peripheral vision is &quot;to the side&quot; of the eye's main vision.  Examples of peripherals include printers, keyboards, mice, monitors, modems, etc.

=== Default Disk Drive ===
Before hard drives were common and affordable, computers were often equipped with two floppy drives.  One of these - the default drive - held the operating system, and the other was used for storing user data or applications.

=== A 'K' of Memory ===
A 'K' of memory is 1024 bytes.  'K' stands for kilo, and is a shortened form of the word kilobyte.  The number 1024 is used rather than the number 1000 because 1024 is the result of multiplying two by itself ten times (that is 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2=1024).  Another way to say that number is &quot;2 raised to the 10th power, or 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. Computers are based on binary arithmetic which is a numbering system using only two digits, one and zero.  There are 1024 different ways to combine ten binary digits (more commonly called bits), so a ten-bit number can address 1024 memory locations.  Thus, the &quot;strange&quot; number of 1024.

Other important memory milestones include the megabyte (1,048,576, or 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes), the gigabyte 1,073,741,824, or 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; bytes), and the terabyte (2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; bytes).

=== Screensaver ===
A common form of a computer monitor is the cathode ray tube, or CRT.  CRT's work by shooting electrons onto a glass screen which has been coated with a material that glows when excited by electrons.  This material can wear out if it is continually bombarded with electrons, and this in turn can cause an image to be &quot;burned in&quot; to a CRT.  A screensaver is a program that detects when the computer has been idle for a certain amount of time and then paints different images on the CRT to prevent one image from burning in.  Thus, the coating tends to wear out more evenly.  This is not unlike the concept of rotating the tires on an automobile.

Although  screensavers are not needed for newer types of monitors (such as LCD and plasma displays), they are still entertaining.  They can also be configured to put the monitor into a low-power state, saving electricity.

=== Byte ===
A byte is a collection of eight binary digits (more commonly called &quot;bits&quot;).  Although bits can only take on the values of 1 or 0 (on or off), eight of them can be combined in 256 different ways.  Thus, a byte can have one of 256 values.

=== Scanner ===
A scanner is a device that can digitize an image much as a photocopier does, except that the image is then transferred to a computer.

=== Email ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Electronic mail, abbreviated e-mail or email, is a method of composing, sending, and receiving messages over electronic communication systems. The term e-mail applies both to the Internet e-mail system based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and to workgroup collaboration systems allowing users within one company or organization to send messages to each other. Often workgroup collaboration systems natively use non-standard protocols but have some form of gateway to allow them to send and receive internet e-mail. Some organizations may use the internet protocols for internal e-mail service.

=== Font ===
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

A font consists of a set of images representing the characters from a particular character set in a particular typeface. Historically, fonts came in specific sizes (governing the actual height of the characters), and in sorts (governing the quantities of each letter provided).

== 3. What is the work of the following people associated with computers? ==
=== Operator ===
Computer Operators are responsible for maintaining a mainframe, server, or a network of computers.  They install software, manage user accounts, and trouble shoot the network.  They often select and install new computer equipment.  A Computer Operator generally holds an associates degree in computer science, or has related job experience.

=== Data Entry ===
Data Entry clerks are responsible for entering data into a computer and verifying that it has been entered accurately.  No job experience is necessary for a Data Entry position, but a high school diploma is often required.

=== Programmer ===
A programmer designs, writes, debugs and documents simple computer programs or small parts of large programs.  They are also often asked to debug or add functions to existing programs.  Programmers are usually required to have a bachelor's degree in computer science or previous related job experience.

=== Systems Analyst ===
Systems Analysts are responsible for designing large programs, and dividing a program into smaller programs that can be programmed by other team members, and then bringing all those pieces back together to work as a system.  In complex systems, they are also responsible for determining how much computing power is required, partitioning the problem across multiple computers, and selecting the computing components required to get the job done.  They usually need a bachelors degree in computer science plus three to five years of experience.

=== Consultant ===
A Consultant is a person who has a lot of experience, often in a specialized area of computing.  They are usually in business for themselves and work &quot;freelance&quot; for a company looking to solve a very specific problem requiring the services of an expert.  When the problem has been solved, the consultant begins working on a contract with another company.  Consultants often possess an advanced degree (Masters or PhD) and have several years of experience.

== 4. How can it be determined when a computer is reading or writing on a disk?  What precautions should be taken while the computer is performing this function? ==
Most disk drives are equipped with an indicator light that the computer will illuminate when it is accessing the drive. 
 
For a hard drive, this light is usually located on the front of the computer where it can easily be seen.  For a floppy drive, the light is located on the front of the drive itself.

A floppy disk should not be removed from a drive when it is being accessed.  The computer should not be turned off when it is accessing either a floppy drive or a hard drive.  Most modern operating systems have a &quot;shutdown&quot; function which will put the computer in a safe state before it is powered off.  When the computer is in this safe state, it will not access any of its disk drives.  Turning a computer off without running the &quot;shutdown&quot; function can result in the loss of data or corruption of the drives.

== 5. What is the difference between serial and parallel communications? ==
In serial communications, data is sent one bit at a time over a single pair of wires.  The pair of wires consists of a data line and a return line.  In parallel communications, more than one bit at a time is sent, with each bit being sent over its own wire.  Parallel bits can share a common return line or they can each have their own return line.

Examples of serial communications schemes include USB, Ethernet, and RS-232 ports.  Examples of parallel communications schemes include parallel printer ports and IDE (hard drive) interfaces.

Parallel interfaces have the obvious advantage of being much faster.  Serial interfaces have the advantage of requiring less bulky cabling and connectors.

== 6. What does it mean for a computer to be &quot;compatible?&quot; ==
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

IBM PC compatible refers to a class of computers which make up the vast majority of smaller computers on the market today. They are based (without IBM's participation) on the original IBM PC. They use the Intel x86 architecture (or an architecture made to emulate it) and are capable of using interchangeable commodity hardware. These computers also used to be referred to as PC clones, and nowadays, just PCs.

== 7. What legal responsibility applies to software with the following designation: public domain, shareware, copyright? ==
Any work that is in the public domain is free to use for any purpose whatsoever.  In the case of software, that means it can be copied freely, modified, and sold.  

Shareware is software that is distributed on a free trial basis.  After an evaluation period, the user is legally obligated to either pay for the software or uninstall it from any computer on which it was installed.

Copyright software is software that is used under an end user license agreement, or EULA.  Commercial EULAs protect the rights of the software vendor.  Other EULAs protect the rights of the user.  In general, commercial software cannot be redistributed, modified, or reverse engineered.  An example of copyright software whose EULA is designed to protect the user is &quot;open source.&quot;  Software licensed as &quot;open source&quot; can be modified, redistributed, and even sold, as long as the source code for the software and any modifications made to it are also distributed.  The right to have access to the source code is granted to the end user.  There are several open source licenses, and each is a little different.  The user of &quot;copyright&quot; software - whether commercial or open source - is legally obligated to follow whatever terms are outlined in the EULA, so it is important to read the EULA before accepting it.

== 8. Successfully using the operating system of a personal computer, do the following: ==
=== Clear the screen of the computer without turning off the power. ===
These requirements depend heavily on the operating system running on the computer being used to meet them.  This operation really only makes sense in a command-line environment (such as DOS) rather than in a graphical environment (such as Windows).  In a graphical environment, the screen could be cleared by minimizing all open windows. Instructions for a few command-line environments are given here.  At the DOS command prompt, type &quot;cls&quot; (without the quotes) and press the enter key (&quot;cls&quot; is short for &quot;clear screen&quot;).  At the Linux command prompt, enter the &quot;clear&quot; command.

=== Show the contents of a diskette on the computer screen. ===
Again, this depends on the operating system in use.  Step one is the same on all of them though - insert the diskette in the diskette drive.

: '''DOS'''
: Use the command &quot;DIR A:&quot;

: '''Linux'''
: Use a graphical file browser, or enter the following commands at the command prompt: 
 mount -t auto /dev/fd0 /media/floppy
 ls /media/floppy

: '''Macintosh'''
: Macintosh having the original GUI interface is quite simple: double click the icon for your disk at appears on the screen.  The most modern OS's from Apple are very windows like, once upon a time the icon for your disk truly appeared on the desk top when placed in the drive.

: '''Windows'''
: Open Windows Explorer (press the &quot;Windows&quot; key and the letter &quot;E&quot; at the same time).  Expand the &quot;My Computer&quot; line by clicking on the box with a + in it, then expand the &quot;Floppy (A:)&quot; line.  The contents of the disk will be displayed on the right.

=== Show how to check for bad sectors on a diskette or hard drive. ===
: '''Dos'''
: Use the following command at the DOS prompt.
 scandisk /surface

: '''Linux'''
: Use the following commands:
 umount /dev/hda1 
 fsck /dev/hda1

: '''Macintosh'''
: ???

: '''Windows XP'''
: Double click the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon.  Right click the drive you want to check and select &quot;Properties&quot;.  Then click the &quot;Tools&quot; tab followed by the &quot;Check Now&quot; button.

=== Rename a file on the disk to a different name. ===

: '''DOS'''
: Use the following command:
 ren oldname newname

: '''Linux'''
: Use the following command:
 mv oldname newname

: '''Macintosh'''
:

: '''Windows'''
: Open Windows Explorer (Windows Key + 'E') and navigate to the folder containing the file you wish to rename.  Click once on the filename.  It should become highlighted and a cursor should appear at the end of the filename.  Type the new name and press Enter.  You can also right click on the file name and select &quot;Rename&quot; from the menu.

=== Copy the contents of one disk to another in perfect &quot;mirror image.&quot; ===
This requirement seems to imply that the computer will have two floppy drives.  These days it is extremely rare to find a PC with two drives, and increasingly difficult to find one with even ''one'' floppy drive!  To meet the spirit of the requirement, you should instead be able to copy the contents of a folder onto a diskette or a flash drive. 

: '''DOS'''
: These instructions assume two floppy drives.  Insert the &quot;master&quot; diskette in the A: drive, and the destination  diskette in the B: drive.  Then use the following command:
 diskcopy [drive1:] [drive2:]
:where drive1 is the source drive and drive2 is the target.


: '''Linux'''
: These instructions assume copying a folder to a flash drive.  Insert the flash drive into the USB port and mount it to /media/usb.  Then use the following command:
  cp -ar folder/ /media/usb

: '''Macintosh'''

: '''Windows'''
: These instructions assume copying a folder to a flash drive.  Insert the flash drive into the USB port.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder containing the folder you wish to copy.  In the right panel, click on the folder you wish to copy using the mouse and drag it to the USB drive in the left panel.  Release the mouse button.

=== Show that you have completed the previous by having the computer &quot;compare&quot; the two disks and show no difference between them. ===
==== DOS ====
Use this command:
 diskcomp A: B:
Although this assumes that you have two floppy disks.  If you only have one floppy drive, try this instead:
 diskcomp A: A:
This will read the first disk and then prompt the user to insert the second disk.  The compare operation will then proceed.

==== Linux ====
To compare two directories, use the command line interface and enter this command:

 diff /path/to/source/directory /path/to/copy

Be sure to substitute the proper directories.

==== Macintosh ====
==== Windows ====
Open a DOS window and use the same procedure as described in the DOS section.

=== Show how to copy a file onto a disk. ===
: '''DOS'''
: Insert a diskette in a disk drive and use the following command:
 copy filename A:

: '''Linux'''
: Insert a diskette into the disk drive and mount it to /media/floppy.  Then use the following command:
  cp filename /media/floppy

: '''Macintosh'''
:

: '''Windows'''

== 10. Show proficiency in the use and operation of three of the following:==
=== Word Processing ===
The word processing requirement can be met with any number of word processing programs - all of which will have different (but similar) ways of accomplishing the same thing.  The answers to this requirement have been re-organized to detail the functions for three different word processing programs:

[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Vocational/Computer Advanced/WordPerfect|WordPerfect]]

=== Database &lt;br&gt;Make a list of at least 15 people, their addresses, phone number, birth date, and age.  Perform a sort function which will list the people alphabetically by last name, list by zip code, list by age, and list by birth date.  Make a printout of each list.===

=== Accounting Program ===
Do one of the following with an accounting program:
==== Perform invoice entry and bill printing of accounts receivable. ====
==== Perform invoicing and check printing of accounts payable. ====
==== Perform journal entry and financial reports of the general ledger. ====
=== Newsletter Program&lt;br&gt;Prepare three pages of double-column text with at least four different computer-generated graphics (such as graphs or clip art), two different fonts, and one headline.===

=== Spreadsheet&lt;br&gt;Show how to add columns, move columns, put a calculation in a field, save, reload, and print.  Also perform the function of adding column A and B, dividing by column C, and placing the result in column D.===

This can be accomplished with Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Scalc, or any other spreadsheet program that is available to you and your Pathfinders.  They all work about the same, with only minor differences between them.

First you will need to start the spreadsheet program and enter in two columns of numbers.  A spreadsheet is a grid of ''cells'' arranged in rows (horizontal) and columns (vertical).  The columns are labeled by letters (Column A, B, C, etc.), and the rows are labeled by numbers (Row 1, 2, 3, etc.).  An individual cell is identified by its column and row, for example, cell B14 is in column B, row 14.  

Begin by entering three columns of numbers in columns A, B, and C.  To enter a number into a cell, simply click on the cell with the mouse and type in a number.  Then press the down arrow on the keyboard or click on another cell.  For this exercises, enter 10 numbers in each column, starting at row 1 and proceeding to row 10.

Now you are ready to add columns A and B and divide them by column C.  The results will be computed in column D.  Go to cell D1, and enter in the following:

 =(A1+B1)/C1

Be sure to start with an equal sign.  This tells the program that this column will be computed rather than taken as a literal.  After you press ''Enter'', the spreadsheet should perform the calculation, and the result should appear in cell D1.  All that remains is to copy this formula into the other 9 cells in row D.  To do this, click on cell D1 and type &lt;ctrl&gt;-C on the keyboard.  This will copy the formula into the copy buffer.  You could also right click on cell D1 with the mouse and select &quot;Copy&quot;.  Once you have done this, click on cell D2.  Then hold down the shift key and click on cell D10.  Cells D2 through D10 should be highlighted.  Then type &lt;ctrl&gt;-V (or right click and select &quot;Paste&quot;).  The program should put a copy of cell D1 into cells D2 through D10.  However, it will not put an ''exact'' copy in these cells.  Cell D2 will contain

 =(A2+B2)/C2

Note how the row numbers have changed.  This is a great convenience that will prevent you from having to edit every single entry in the column.

=== Educational Program &lt;br&gt;Teach any student in grades 1 to 4 how to successfully do a solo operation of a program designed for their age level.===

A nice, free, educational program that works on many computer operating systems is [http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/ Tux Paint].  It is available for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and other operating systems as well.  The website has plenty of documentation to get you started.

Another great program is [http://gcompris.net/ GCompris] (pronounced &quot;Gee Com-pree&quot;) and it too is available for Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and more.  It offers a wide variety of activities for children of all ages, from &quot;computer discovery&quot; (how to use a mouse, etc.) to algebra.  It is available in several languages (12 as of this writing).

Alternatively, you may use one of many commercially available educational programs.

== 11. Visit the computer department of any business or have someone from a business computer department visit your classroom or club.  ==
Whether you visit company or the professional visits you, remember you are interrupting a somebody's busy schedule.  While they may genuinely happy to help you, they are doing you a favor by doing so.  Respond by showing appropriate gratitude, being polite, and being on time.
Be flexible when scheduling the visit as well.  You will need to fit your time into ''their'' schedule rather than asking them to fit their time into yours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">QBasic has two ways of making sounds.

* SOUND command
* PLAY command
==SOUND==
The SOUND command produces sound of a specific frequency for a specific duration from the PC Speaker. Only one sound can be played at a time. If multiple SOUND statements are issued sequentially, every statement after the first will not execute until after the previous one finishes.

===Syntax===
 SOUND f, d
*f - Frequency in Hertz
*d - Duration in ticks

===Example===
 SOUND 100 , 20

Plays a 1000 hertz wave for 20 ticks. One second is about 18.2 ticks, so 20 ticks are about 1.1 seconds.

The lowest frequency allowed by QBasic is 37 Hz, which is roughly a D in the 2nd octave.  
The highest frequency is 32 767 Hz, but this tone can not be heard, because the normal human hearing range ends at 20 000 Hz.

A secondary function of the SOUND command is to use it to control time in a program.

    For x% = 1 TO 10
     Print x%
     Sound 32000,18.2
    NEXT

This program will print the numbers 1 to 10, with a 1 second delay between each number.

==PLAY==
The PLAY command is for playing music.  It can only play one note at a time.

More than that the play command can play a complex stored &quot;song&quot;  This is accomplished through the use of a song string. For string command detail, see [[QBasic/Appendix#PLAY]].

There are no prospective randomized trials evaluating efficacy of adjuvant RT. Single institution retrospective studies seem to suggest some benefit to RT, particularly with higher doses (&gt;45 Gy) and with microscopically positive margins (R1). The role of brachytherapy is similarly unclear.


==RT==
===Intrahepatic (peripheral)===
*'''Chang Gung Taiwan 1977-2001''' PMID 15793863 -- ''Prognostic analysis of surgical treatment of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma: two decades of experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.'' ('''2005 Jan''' YY, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 Mar 28;11(12):1779-84.)
**Retrospective. 373 patients with peripheral CCA (second order or more intrahepatic branches), 50% hepatectomy (36% curative resection). Please see more detail in surgical section
**RT 63 patients vs. no RT 249 (not further discussed in text)
**Median survival, 3-year OS, 5-year OS: RT 11.7 mo (16.6%, 6.6%) vs. no RT 6.2 mo (9.6%, 7.2%) p=0.02
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Favorable overall survival of PCC patients undergoing surgical treatment depends on early tumor stage, presence of mucobilia, papillary tumor type, hepatic resection, and post-operative chemotherapy&quot;

*'''Paris VII France 1990-97''' PMID 10398898 -- ''Resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a Western experience.'' ('''1999 Valverde''' A, J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg. 1999;6(2):122-7.)
**Retrospective. 42 patients, 30 curative resection
**Median survival: 28 months, 3 survivors &gt; 5 years
**Adjuvant RT and/or CT had no impact on survival
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Complete surgical resection may offer a chance for long-term survival in selected patients and may improve the quality of life of patients with more advanced disease.&quot;

===Perihilar===
*'''UT MD Anderson 1984-2005''' PMID 18754070 -- ''[Extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma: patients at high-risk for local recurrence treated with surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation have an equivalent overall survival to patients with standard-risk treated with surgery alone]'' ('''2008 Borghero,Y'''. 2008 Ann Surg Oncol Jul 15(11):3147-56.)
**Retrospective. 65 patients. Two groups compared, Surgery only n=23(had R0 and N0) and Surgery + Adjuvant CRT n=42 (had R1 and/or R1)
**Median (5-year) OS-5: S vs S-CRT 36% vs 42% p=NS LRR-5: 38% vs. 37%, P = .13
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our finding of a lack of a survival difference between the S and S-CRT groups suggests that for patients with extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma at high risk for locoregional recurrence (i.e., R1 resection or pN1 disease), adjuvant chemoradiation provides an equivalent overall survival despite of these worse prognostic features.&quot;

*'''Shanghai China 1997-2002''' PMID 16083598 -- ''[Analysis of the relation between surgery and prognosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma] - [Article in Chinese]'' ('''2005 Yi''' B, Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Jul 1;43(13):842-5.)
**Retrospective. 198 patients treated, 61% resected, 30% radical resection. Some treated with post-op RT (unclear)
**Post-op RT significant predictor of post-op survival (no numbers in abstract)

*'''Jefferson 1983-97''' PMID 15685030 -- ''Positive microscopic margins alter outcome in lymph node-negative cholangiocarcinoma when resection is combined with adjuvant radiotherapy.'' ('''2005 Stein''' DE, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb;28(1):21-3.
**Retrospective. 16 patients treated post-op with RT (7 negative surgical margin, 9 positive surgical margin), average dose 53 Gy via both EBRT and BT; median follow-up 55 months
**Median (5-year) OS: margin (-) 21.5 months (18.4%) vs. margin (+) 26 months (15%), p=NS
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Positive microscopic margins in lymph node-negative, resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma may not represent a negative prognostic factor when resection is combined with postoperative radiotherapy in this cohort.&quot;

*'''Miami 1985-97''' PMID 11677948 -- ''Management of hilar bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''2001 Bathe''' OF, Hepatogastroenterology. 2001 Sep-Oct;48(41):1289-94.)
**Retrospective. 55 patients, 19 curative resection.
**2-year survival longer in resection 47% vs. 18% (p=0.03)
**No benefit to RT (either postoperative RT or in unresectable disease)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Locoregional extent of disease is the greatest problem in cases of proximal bile duct cancers. Resection provides the best hope for long-term survival, but new adjuvant strategies are needed.&quot;

*'''Tsukuba Japan''' PMID 10701737 -- ''Benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy after radical resection of locally advanced main hepatic duct carcinoma.'' ('''2000 Todoroki''' T, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Feb 1;46(3):581-7.)
**Retrospective. 63 pts with Klatskin IVA (T4, N0-1, M0) treated by radical resection.
**47 pts had microscopic + margins (R1). 28 of those received XRT (17 IORT + postop RT; 6 IORT only; 4 postop only)), 19 surgery only.
**5-year OS: surgery 13.5% vs. RT 33.9% (IORT + EBRT 39.2%). 
**Locoregional control: surgery 31.2% vs. RT 79.2%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our data clearly suggest the improved prognosis of patients with locally advanced Klatskin tumor by integrated adjuvant radiotherapy with IORT and PORT to complete gross tumor resection with acceptable treatment mortality and morbidity.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam Netherlands''' PMID 9841770 -- ''Long-term survival after resection of proximal bile duct carcinoma (Klatskin tumors).'' ('''1999 Gerhards''' MF, World J Surg. 1999 Jan;23(1):91-6.)
**Retrospective. 12/79 surgically treated patients with &gt;5 year survival evaluated
**No correlation with RT
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Preoperative Bismuth classification of the tumor, absence of multifocality, diploid-type tumors, and negative proximal bile duct margins at histopathologic examination were the only significant prognostic factors for long-term survival&quot;

*'''Hopkins 1988-93''' PMID 7794082 -- ''Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Postoperative radiotherapy does not improve survival.'' ('''1995 Pitt''' HA, Ann Surg. 1995 Jun;221(6):788-97; discussion 797-8.)
**Prospective. 50 Pts w/ perihillar CA. Stratified by surgery (31 radical vs. 19 palliative) and RT (23 RT vs. 27 no RT)
**Resection improved the length (24.2 vs. 11.3 months, p &lt; 0.05) and quality of survival. 
**Radiation had *no* effect on the length (18.4 vs. 20.1 months) or quality of survival or on late toxicity.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This analysis suggests that in patients with localized perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, resection prolongs survival whereas radiation has no effect on either survival or late toxicity.&quot;
**Study insufficient to rule out post-op RT benefit in patients with complete surgical resection

*'''Amsterdam''' PMID 1648329 -- ''Does additive radiotherapy after hilar resection improve survival of cholangiocarcinoma? An analysis in sixty-four patients.'' ('''1991 Verbeek''' PC, Ann Chir. 1991;45(4):350-4.)
**Retrospective. 64 pts with Klatskin tumors, all had surgery. 29 post-op XRT, 22 resection only, and 13 postoperative deaths. 
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Overall survival benefit for XRT (p&lt;0.001)

*'''Hopkins''' PMID 1688486 -- ''Management of proximal cholangiocarcinomas by surgical resection and radiotherapy.'' ('''1990 Cameron''' JL, Am J Surg 1990; 159:91-7; discussion 97-8.)
**Retrospective. 96 patients, 55% resected (41% curative resection), 45% palliative stenting. 
**5-year OS: resected 8% vs. stented 0%
**RT given as EBRT 50-60Gy + some patients BT 2Gy boost: Adjuvant RT 72% (38/53), 51% BT boost;, palliative RT 58% (25/43), 10% BT boost
***Adjuvant RT: 3-year OS 31% both groups (p=NS), but all long term survivors received RT
***Palliative RT: 1-year OS 38% RT vs 9% no RT (p&lt;0.05)
***RT significantly extended survival in patients undergoing palliative stenting, but not in those undergoing resection.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We conclude that surgical resection of proximal cholangiocarcinomas can be performed safely and that it significantly prolongs survival.&quot;

===Distal bile duct===
*'''Shanghai China 1996-2002''' PMID 15196364 -- ''[Prognostic analysis of patients suffering from distal bile duct cancer] - [Article in Chinese]'' ('''2004 Sun''' LC, Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2004 May 7;42(9):528-31.)
**Retrospective. 173 of distal bile duct CA. 
**Significant impact: surgical procedure, LN mets, and pathological grade
**No impact: transfusion, invasion of pancreas, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ERCP, diameter of tumour, serum level of CA-19-9, preoperative total serum bilirubin level (TBIL), ratio of albumin to globulin (A/G), sex and age
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Radical resection is only curative treatment modality. Aggressive treatment and prevention on postoperative liver metastasis is a important strategy to improve the survival for distal bile duct cancer.&quot;

*'''Tsukuba Japan''' PMID 11260100 -- ''Treatment strategy for patients with middle and lower third bile duct cancer.'' ('''2001 Todoroki''' T, Br J Surg. 2001 Mar;88(3):364-70.)
**67 patients with middle/lower BDCA
**5-year OS: 63% R0 vs. 16% R1 vs. 0% R2 vs. 0% no resection. R2 median survival longer (11.4 months) then no resection (3.5 months)
**RT improved 5-year OS in R1 patients (8% vs. 0%) but p=NS 
**R0 relapse: 1 locoregional, 6 distant mets, 5 both. Liver most frequent mets
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Curative (R0) resection is only one step in curing cancer, and radiotherapy may play a beneficial role in controlling locoregional residual tumour.&quot;

===Any location===
*'''Pittsburgh 1983-97''' PMID 12902899 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma: the impact of tumor location and treatment strategy on outcome.'' ('''2003 Heron''', Am J Clin Oncol. 2003 Aug;26(4):422-8.)
**Retrospective. 118 patients, treated with surgery, RT (EBRT or ILRT), surgery + RT, chemo, palliation, and combinations
**Mean survival: overall 22 months, proximal tumors 17 months vs. distal tumors 47 months
**Improved survival for surgery + RT vs surgery alone for proximal and distal lesions.
**Poor prognosis (3.5 months) for palliation only.

*'''Florida 1962-93''' PMID 9822171 -- ''Carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary tract: surgery and radiotherapy for curative and palliative intent.'' ('''1998 Zlotecki''' RA, Radiat Oncol Investig 1998; 6:240-7.)
**Retrospective. 47 patients, 17 surgery alone, 20 surgery + EBRT, 10 EBRT alone
**5-year OS: 15%, surgery alone 15% vs. surgery + EBRT or EBRT alone 14%
**5-year OS: gross total resection alone 19% vs. gross total resection + EBRT 35% (p=0.07)
**Median survival after EBRT alone: 6.4 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot; Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was well tolerated and may improve local-regional control after gross total resection.&quot;

*'''Hopkins 1971-94''' PMID 8857851 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma. A spectrum of intrahepatic, perihilar, and distal tumors.'' ('''1996 Nakeeb''' A, Ann Surg. 1996 Oct;224(4):463-73; discussion 473-5.)
**Retrospective. 294 patients, 6% intrahepatic, 67% perihilar, 27% distal tumors
**Resectability rate: 50% intrahepatic, 56% perihilar, 91% distal
**Median survival (5-year survival): intrahepatic 26 months (44%), perihilar 19 months (11%), and distal 22 months (28%)
**Post-op RT did not improve survival
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Cholangiocarcinoma is best classified into three broad categories. Resection remains the primary treatment, whereas postoperative adjuvant radiation has no influence on survival.&quot;

*'''Jefferson 1983-1992''' PMID 7480704 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma: clinical significance of tumor location along the extrahepatic bile duct.'' ('''1995 Alden''' ME, Radiology. 1995 Nov;197(2):511-6.)
**Retrospective. 81 pts, 56 proximal, 25 distal. Median follow-up 28 months
**5-year OS: proximal 13% vs. distal 53% (p&lt;0.01)
**Proximal CA (RT or resection + RT or palliation): median survival no RT 6 mo vs. RT 17 mo (p=0.01). No benefit for resection in presence of RT
**Distal CA (resection +/- RT): no benefit for RT after resection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with proximal cancer should undergo primary RT, and expectations should be limited. Patients with distal cancer should undergo resection, and RT may not be needed.&quot;

*'''UCSF 1977-1987''' PMID 8147607 -- ''Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts. The University of California at San Francisco experience.'' ('''1994 Schoenthaler''' R, Ann Surg 1994; 219:267-74.)
**Retrospective. 129 patients, min 5 year follow-up. 48% surgery alone, 35% surgery + RT, 17% charged particles (helium/neon)
**Median survival: entire group 6.5/11/14 months, curative intent 16/16/23 months
**Patients with microscopic residual disease had increased median survival times when they were treated with adjuvant RT, most markedly after CP (p = 0.0005) but also with conventional XRT (p = 0.0109). 
**Patients with gross residual disease had a less marked but still statistically significant extended survival (p = 0.05 for S + X and p = 0.0423 for S + CP) after RT
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The mainstay of bile duct carcinoma management was maximal surgical resection in these patients. Postoperative radiotherapy gave patients with positive microscopic margins a significant survival advantage and may be of value in selected patients with gross disease.&quot;

*'''Wash U''' PMID 8159005 -- ''Multidisciplinary treatment of biliary tract cancers.'' ('''1994 Kraybill''' WG, J Surg Oncol 1994; 55:239-45.)

**96 patients resection or stenting, 66% received RT (49.6-72.2Gy)
**7 patients developed gastric/duodenal obstruction, after evaluation presumed radiation fibrosis

**Retrospective. 552 cases treated at 55 centers. Extrahepatic BD only
**Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Bile_duct/Surgery]] for surgical details
**Adjuvant RT vs. surgery only no difference in survial
**However, total number of patients treated with RT in both adjuvant and palliative setting was 27

**Case report of EBRT + HDR BT for residual tumor. Alive for ~3 years
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;HDRIBT following external irradiation is recommended for the treatment of postoperative small residual tumors of the bile duct.&quot;

**Retrospective. 63 (55 EHBD, 8 GB) patients treated with RT. 12 liver transplant, 13 chemo, 3 BT alone, 9 EBRT + BT
**Median survival: 7 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Extrahepatic biliary duct cancers, the absence of metastases, increasing calendar year of treatment, and liver transplantation with postoperative radiation therapy were factors significantly associated with improved survival.&quot;

*'''Rotterdam''' PMID 2153649 -- ''The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''1990 Veeze-Kuijpers''' B, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1990 Jan;18(1):63-7)
**Retrospective. 42 patients (11 microscopic positive margins after surgery, 31 unresectable) given EBRT + ILRT
**Median survival 10 months

==Brachytherapy==
*'''Hokkaido Japan 1980-98''' PMID 15976951 -- ''Effectiveness of radiation therapy after surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2005 Sagawa''' N, Surg Today. 2005;35(7):548-52)
**Retrospective. 69 patients, 30 surgery alone vs. 39 surgery + adjuvant RT. Similar features in both groups.
**RT treatment: 31 EBRT (mean 37.2 Gy) + BT (mean 36.9 Gy) vs. 8 EBRT only (mean 37.5 Gy)
**3-year survival: surgery + RT 41% vs. surgery alone 33% (p=NS)
**Subgroup analysis (by surgical margin, stage) no benefit to RT, except adjuvant RT with pStage III/IVa (p=0.04)
**2 complications: stenosis of bile duct, venous bleeding from ostomy
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Radiation therapy after surgery did not show any clinical benefits for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. However, it may be effective as adjuvant therapy after curative resection in a small subgroup of patients with p-stage III or IVa disease.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam 1983-98''' PMID 12616432 -- ''Results of postoperative radiotherapy for resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2003 Gerhards''' MF, World J Surg. 2003 Feb;27(2):173-9.)
**Retrospective. 112 patients underwent resection, 91 survived post-op. No RT in 20 patients,  EBRT in 30 patients (median 46 Gy), 41 patients EBRT (median 42 Gy) + ILRT (median 10 Gy)
**88% late complications; significantly more with RT
**Median survival: surgery only 8 months vs. surgery + RT 24 months, but no add'l benefit to ILRT
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Additional radiotherapy after resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma significantly improved survival and is recommended by giving external beam irradiation but not intraluminal brachytherapy.&quot;

*'''Maryland''' PMID 11202795 -- ''Postoperative endoscopic retrograde high dose-rate brachytherapy for cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2000 Ove''' R, Am J Clin Oncol. 2000 Dec;23(6):559-61.)

**Retrospective. 109 patients received RT, 71 patients surgery + preop RT (19) or + post-op RT (52). Of these, 41 received 10 Gy ILRT boost. Median dose 50-55 Gy. 38 patients palliative RT, 19 received 22-25 ILRT Gy boost. Median dose 60-68 Gy.
**Median survival: surgery + RT 24 months vs. palliative 10.4 months
**Surgical patients: dose &gt; 55 Gy had *lower* survival, and no benefit to brachytherapy
**Palliative patients: no benefit to brachytherapy
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The role of radiotherapy either as adjuvant or as primary treatment remains to be demonstrated in prospective randomised studies. From our results, it seems that high radiation doses could be dangerous and could detriment prognosis. Brachytherapy boost was not superior to treatment with external beam irradiation alone.&quot;

**Prospective. 38 patients, various types of surgical treatment. Hyperfractionation schedule: 20 patients EBRT (6 patients 22.5 Gy 2.25 Gy/fx BID, 12 patients 45 Gy 2.25 Gy/fx BID, 1 patient EBRT 30 Gy conventional, 1 patient EBRT 50 Gy conventional). 14 patients EBRT (median 24 Gy) + BT (40 Gy). 4 patients BT alone (45 Gy @ 1cm)
**Toxicity: 1 patient acute Grade 3, 2 patients late GIB
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Accelerated external beam radiotherapy with or without intraluminal radiotherapy is feasible and associated with acceptable toxicity when used in the management of advance cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

**Retrospective. 62 patients, 77% treated post resection (62% XRT 54 Gy, 38% charged particles 60 Gy)
**Median survival (2-year OS): 12 months photons (18%) vs. 23 months particles (44%) p=0.048

== Overview ==

'''''Bane''''' is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] living in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is serving his detention in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], they are startled by the appearance of a centaur, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ronan|Ronan]], who makes some comments about astronomy (&quot;Mars is bright tonight&quot;). Shortly, Bane joins them, and makes similar comments about astronomy.

After leaving them, Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], and Hagrid's boar-hound Fang find the creature that has been killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]]. As the creature seems to be about ready to attack Harry, he is rescued by another Centaur, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]], who offers to carry Harry back to Hagrid. As he is doing so, he is met by Bane and Ronan, who accuse him of becoming a pack animal for humans, like a donkey, and interfering with the portents. Firenze leaves them behind, saying that he will fight the evil, even alongside humans if he must.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Firenze, now teaching Divination, explains that he cannot return to the Forbidden Forest, as he has been banished by his herd. Harry sees a hoof-shaped bruise on his chest, and wonders if it was Bane who put that there.

Bane, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Magorian|Magorian]], is in the group of centaurs who confront Hagrid as he is taking Harry and Hermione back to the school after introducing them to his half-brother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Grawp|Grawp]]. Bane makes no sign of having spoken to Harry earlier, but warns &quot;this human&quot; Hagrid what will happen to him if he returns to the Forest.

Bane is among the group of centaurs who come to investigate when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is leading Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] into the Forbidden Forest to try and entrap her there. After Umbridge has insulted the Centaurs by calling them &quot;inferior half-breeds&quot; and has magically bound Magorian, the centaurs swarm her, and the last we see of Umbridge is Bane bearing her off into the forest.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Hagrid is carrying an apparently-dead Harry out of the Forbidden Forest, apparently several centaurs are present and watching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s victory procession. Hagrid calls out to Bane, apparently believing that their inaction implicates them in Harry's death.

Whether or not Hagrid's accusations of Bane have effect is uncertain; Bane, however, is one of the centaurs who lead the counter attack on the Death Eaters, along with Ronan and Magorian.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

In his own way, Bane is as prejudiced as any Death Eater. He believes in the innate superiority of Centaurs over humans, and is affronted by any suggestion that humans and centaurs could work together. In this he is only echoing the beliefs of his herd, beliefs that are apparently shared to a greater or lesser degree by every centaur we meet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There appears to be an error in the example used in this page. One of the code listings is supposed to be an XSLT stylesheet but (I believe this is by error) the XML instance document (source of the transformation) is repeated instead. I'd like to see the XSLT document referenced in the discussion.

Also, Line numbers are referred to in the text but don't appear in the examples.

I tried to locate contact information to report these editing oversites, but couldn't locate any. Hopefully this submission will be forwarded to someone who can report the erros.

== Chapter Revision Suggestions ==

proposed by Christina Serrano 1/29/06

The following two suggestions are intended to focus the chapter on the many-to-many concept. These additional sections add confusion and inconsistency to the chapter. Moreover, these sections are not specific to the many-to-many relationship and can be applied to other XML chapters, so it would make sense to place these sections in separate resource chapters.
* Remove the section on xslt numeric functions--this information could be placed in a chapter about xslt.
* Remove the section on additional data types for xml schemas--this information could be placed in a chapter about xml schemas.

The following are suggestions to improve the many-to-many sections:
* After the intro, explain the problems inherent in representing many-to-many relationships in XML.
* Show examples of each proposed solution to remedy the many-to-many problem.
* Apply formatting changes outlined in the author guidelines.
* Edit for spelling, grammar, and sentence structure.

==Professor's comments==
The m:m example needs to be redone to give a more complete coverage of the problem. Refer to http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xdm2m.html.
We need to cover the first two cases and explain the ID and IDREF datataypes. Also, I think we just focus on a part of the data model. The suggested version follows.

[[Image:XML_Hotel_amenity.png]]

Also, to use a stylesheet with an m:m, the key function needs to be introduced.

==Post-revision Comments==

Christina Serrano 2/23/06

I'm still not too clear on how to explain the key function. I've added a short paragraph about it, but I wasn't sure how detailed I should go in this chapter. I used the following resource: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#key. This page contains more comprehensive information regarding the key function, so I can add more to this chapter--or would it be more appropriate to add this information to the XSLT chapter?</text>

= Open Sicilian =
Whites pawn is under attack from the knight on f6. He must defend it or forestall Blacks capture of it in some way. [[/5. Nc3/]] is almost universally played as it is the knight's natural square anyway. A knight on c3 increases Whites influence of the d5 square,  and forms a defensive bulwark against attacks on the c-file, to the extent that Black will often give up a rook to remove it. 

Also played is [[/5. f3/]]. At first glance White is attempting to reserve the option of moving the c-pawn to c4. However there is not usually time for this, because without a White knight on c3 Black is immediately threatening to play e5 and d5 and equalise in the centre. White is compelled to throw a spanner in the works, usually with Bb5+, and c4 gets forgotten in the ensuing complications. 

[[/5. Bb5/]]+ is plausible and may transpose into common lines, but if Whites plan is to simplify this way, why now and not two moves previously when White could have followed up by castling kingside with a useful defensive knight on f3? Bb5+ is a shade inconsistent.

[[/5. Bd3/]] commits the bishop to a square on which it will have no future after the obvious e5. It also fails to prevent a subsequent d5.

: The solution for &lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^{(- \alpha + \sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2} t)} + e^{(- \alpha - \sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2} t)} = e^{-\alpha}  e^{j(\sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2})} + e^{-j(\sqrt{\beta^2 - \alpha^2})}&lt;/math&gt; 
: The I - t curve would look like

=== Damping Factor ===

The damping factor is the amount by which the oscillations of a circuit gradually decrease over time. We define the damping ratio to be:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=50%
!Circuit Type!!Series RLC !! Parallel RLC
|-
|Damping Factor || &lt;math&gt;\zeta = {R \over 2L}&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\zeta = {1 \over 2RC}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Resonance Frequency || &lt;math&gt;\omega_o = {1 \over \sqrt{L C}}&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;\omega_o = {1 \over \sqrt{L C}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Compare The Damping factor with The Resonance Frequency give rise to different types of circuits: '''Overdamped''', '''Underdamped''', and '''Critically Damped'''.

=== Bandwidth ===

{{eqn|Bandwidth}}
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  =  2 \zeta &lt;/math&gt;

For series RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  =  2 \zeta   = { R \over L}&lt;/math&gt;

For Parallel RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  =  2 \zeta   = { 1 \over RC}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quality Factor ===
{{eqn|Quality Factor}}
:&lt;math&gt;Q =   {\omega_o \over \Delta \omega } = {\omega_o \over 2\zeta }&lt;/math&gt;

For Series RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt;Q =   {\omega_o \over \Delta \omega } = {\omega_o \over 2\zeta } = {L \over R \sqrt{LC}} = {1 \over R} \sqrt{L \over C}&lt;/math&gt;

For Parallel RLC circuit:

:&lt;math&gt;Q =   {\omega_o \over \Delta \omega } = {\omega_o \over 2\zeta } = {RC \over \sqrt{LC}} = {R} \sqrt{C \over L}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability ===

Because inductors and capacitors act differently to different inputs, there is some potential for the circuit response to approach infinity when subjected to certain types and amplitudes of inputs. When the output of a circuit approaches infinity, the circuit is said to be '''unstable'''. Unstable circuits can actually be dangerous, as unstable elements overheat, and potentially rupture.

A circuit is considered to be stable when a &quot;well-behaved&quot; input produces a &quot;well-behaved&quot; output response. We use the term &quot;Well-Behaved&quot; differently for each application, but generally, we mean &quot;Well-Behaved&quot; to mean a finite and controllable quantity.

==Resonance ==
===With R = 0===

When R = 0 , the circuit reduces to a series LC circuit. When the circuit is in resonance, the circuit will vibrate at the resonant frequency.

: &lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;  
: &lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

''The circuit vibrates and has the capability of producing a Standing Wave when R = 0 , L = C''

===With R ≠ 0===
When R ≠ 0 and the circuit operates in resonance . 
: The frequency dependent components L , C cancel out ie Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 so that the total impedance of the circuit is &lt;math&gt;Z_R + Z_L + Z_C = R + [ Z_L - Z_C ] = R + 0 = R&lt;/math&gt;
: The current of the circuit is &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
: The Operating Frequency is &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the current is halved by doubling the value of resistance then
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt;
: Circuit will be stable over the range of frquencies from &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 - \omega_2&lt;/math&gt;

''The circuit has the capability to select bandwidth where the circuit is stable '' . Therefore, it is best suited for Tuned Resonance Select Bandwidth Filter

Once using L or C to tune circuit into resonance at resonance frequency &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;'' The current is at its maximum value &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt; . Reduce current above &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; circuit will respond to narrower bandwidth than &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 - \omega_2&lt;/math&gt;. Reduce current below &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; circuit will respond to wider bandwidth than &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 - \omega_2&lt;/math&gt;.

This handbook is intended for educators who teach English (including written and oral language), or who teach subjects that require English language proficiency. Standards for teaching and learning [[w:English_language|English language]] can be organized from a variety of perspectives. Headings and subheadings in this Wiki book should represent that variety. Contributors are welcome to add samples of text and media along with their contributions. Because this Wiki is available worldwide, the standards can and should reflect the global uses of English. Click the &quot;Edit&quot; links below to work on this Wiki. General help on writing in Wiki, including 'how to' sheets, can be found at [[w:Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|Wikipedia]]. Specific information on how to make the wiki do what you want with codes is at [[m:Help:Editing|Meta]]. When headings and subheadings begin to become too bulky for a single page, new pages will be created.

== History ==
The ''Curriculum and Evaluation Standards'', published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) in 1989, set in motion a mandate for other content organizations to write standards. The Standards Project for the English Language Arts (SPELA) was funded by the federal government of the USA in 1992 to write the standards. In 1994, the United States Department of Education discontinued funding of the project, ostensibly because of the theoretical pluralism informing the work. The standards that were eventually [http://www.ncte.org/about/over/standards/110846.htm published] are general, typically avoiding clear performance benchmarks. Nevertheless, they offer an implicit view of the variety in theoretical perspectives that were brought to bear on the task. 

Standards for Language may be difficult to write because of the breadth of the subject. Language is considered to be a primary medium for human thinking ([[w:Vygotsky|Vygotsky]]). As such, to attempt to write standards for Language is similar to writing standards for how to think. Language is not necessarily one discipline or subject, but includes all the breadth of thinking, speaking, and writing in many disciplines which have written their own standards already ([http://standards.nctm.org/document/ Mathematics], [http://www.socialstudies.org/standards/ Social Studies], [http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses/html/ Sciences]). 

While all disciplines and content rely on language for thinking and communication, the primary school subject standards documents do not articulate standards for integrating the language necessary for their specific subjects: [http://www.nctm.org/standards/overview.htm Mathematics],  [[w:National_Science_Education_Standards|Science]],  [http://www.socialstudies.org/standards/ Social Studies]. Interestingly, although Literature is one of the main curricular incarnations of the English Language in schooling, only a few organizations are attempting to narrow the task of writing English Language standards by focusing their efforts on  [http://web.cocc.edu/humanities/standards/eng_lit.htm Literature]. (Also notable is the fact that many of the organizations that set standards offer access to them only for those who pay.)

A variety of organizations have worked on English Language standards, and a section is dedicated to these organizations at the bottom of this wiki page.

A short history of education standards has also been compiled by [http://www.mcrel.org/standards-benchmarks/docs/history.asp McREL].

== Standards and Accountability ==
Standards for curriculum and instruction may define the work of educators and students. 
In the United States of America, individual states have written standards, and have often passed legislation to enact these standards in public schools and institutions of higher education. State to state (and nation to nation) the standards can look very different. For example, a state's standards may have been written before the research on &quot;phonemic awareness&quot; had gained its prominence. What is the result of variety in standards based on political boundaries?

Among the major standards that have already been written for English, each major heading seems to be informed by a particular theoretical approach to language. In the Wiki Standards, we can allow these approaches to be named and elaborated on. As commonalities begin to appear across categories, internal and external links can be used to emphasize the commonalities among theoretical approaches. 

==Media-based Standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin from the types of performance we expect or hope to see around certain kinds of media, such as print and speech.

===Reading and Writing===
Reading in English is based on an understanding of the English alphabetic principle, which is different from other principles of print, and unique among languages that use alphabets. In order to master the English alphabetic principle, readers and writers need to: 
====Demonstrate awareness of spoken English phonology, including====

=====Word Awareness=====
This is the knowledge that individual words are represented in speech and print. In English print, word awareness involves knowledge of conventional visual spacing between words. In speech, word awareness involves a tacit knowledge of individual spoken words. In Linguistics, word awareness corresponds to the concept of the &quot;[lexeme].&quot; Without comparison to print, there has been some argument that people's concept of a 'word' is difficult to define. For example, [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/LORSIY.html Albert Lord] found that non-literate storytellers often considered the term 'verbatim' to refer to preservation of the main structure in an oral performance of a tale, not really a word-for-word match from performance to performance.

=====Word Awareness Performance=====
Demonstrate word awareness by 
*touching the head and arm joints in order toward the fingers to represent each word being spoken.
*pointing to individual words in print. 
*substituting one word for another in speech or writing.
*writing words with conventional spacing. 
*cutting or folding strips of written words into individual words.

=====Phonemic Awareness=====
Phonemic awareness is a demonstration that shows either tacit or explicit knowledge of the individual [[w:Phoneme|phonemes]] of the English language. Phonemes are sounds that can make a difference in meanings. In Linguistics, the concept of the phoneme is demonstrated by [[w:Minimal_pairs|minimal pairs]]. Research on reading success suggests that the demonstrations of phonemic awareness most likely to predict reading success are: a. segmenting words into individual phonemes (i.e., student is asked to segment the word &quot;skip&quot; and the response is, /s/ /k/ /i/ /p/), and b. blending strings of correctly sequenced phonemes into words (i.e., student is given the phonemes /b/ /l/ /o/ distinctly and in order, and student responds by saying &quot;blow&quot;). Phonemic awareness may be demonstrated and practiced with no printed language present, but research suggests that phonemic awareness instruction has a greater effect on reading success when practiced with written examples. A summary of the research can be found in the booklet [http://www.nifl.gov/partnershipforreading/publications/reading_first1.html#phonemic Put Reading First], published by the US federally sponsored [http://www.nifl.gov/partnershipforreading/ Partnership for Reading].

=====Phonemic Awareness Performance=====
Demonstrate phonemic awareness by: 
*segmenting individual words into distinct phonemes. 
*counting the phonemes in a word. 
*blending a sequence of individual phonemes into a whole word. 
*substituting phonemes into a word to make a different word or nonsense word. 
*identifying which phonemes come first or last in a word

=====Onset and Rime Awareness=====

==Power-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin by considering the ways language mediates power among those who use it. This approach is largely absent from state-sponsored standards. Power in language is often informed by students of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory Critical Theory] and [[w:Critical_pedagogy|Critical Pedagogy]].The standards movement itself may come under question through an examination of power, because standards imply agreement with those who hold influence. But we might consider 'standards' as being similar to the hopes and goals of people who think systematically about power in language education. Moreover, those who think about power in language education will usually put forward 'tools for thinking' that they hope other people will use.

==Content standards==
One approach to writing standards is to categorize them based on the unique ways language is involved with specific content. In particular, students in academic disciplines and school subjects have developed specific ways to use language for thinking about and organizing their content. Each discipline or content domain may wish to specify what is expected for language for that domain. So, while the NCTM articulated curriculum and evaluation standards for mathematics content, they did not articulate the ways language is conventionally used to mediate the content in English. 

==Thinking-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin from the kinds of thinking we expect or hope the language will mediate for the users of the language. 

===Bloom's Taxonomy===
[[w:Bloom's_taxonomy|Bloom's taxonomy]] of thinking is a way of classifying objectives for thinking. Because language can be described as a medium for thinking, language standards could emerge from different classes of thought.

==Genre-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to begin by differentiating genres, or types, of language use. This approach can be informed by the work of those working in [[w:Genre_studies|Genre Studies]].

==Structure-based standards==
One approach to writing standards is to work from knowledge of language structures and structural systems, such as phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. This approach is strongly informed by studies in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics Linguistics].

==ESL and TESOL approaches==
One approach to writing standards is to begin by considering that English may not be the student's primary language. This perspective can be informed by students of [[w:Language_acquisition|Language Acquisition]].

==Performance-based approaches==
One approach to writing standards is to outline specific performances or tasks (benchmarks) and to work toward larger categories as performances begin to show common characteristics.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Rdgmus. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Rdgmus~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Source Transformations ==

Independent current sources can be turned into independent voltage sources, and vice-versa, by methods called &quot;Source Transformations.&quot; These transformations are useful for solving circuits. We will explain the two most important source transformations, '''Thevenin's Source''', and '''Norton's Source''', and we will explain how to use these conceptual tools for solving circuits.

== Black Boxes ==

A circuit (or any system, for that matter) may be considered a '''black box''' if we don't know what is inside the system. For instance, most people treat their computers like a black box because they don't know what is inside the computer (most don't even care), all they know is what goes in to the system (keyboard and mouse input), and what comes out of the system (monitor and printer output).

Black boxes, by definition, are systems whose internals aren't known to an outside observer. The only methods that an outside observer has to examine a black box is to send input into the systems, and gauge the output.

== Thevenin's Theorem ==

Let's start by drawing a general circuit consisting of a source and a load, as a block diagram:

[[Image:General Source-Load Circuit.svg|center]]

Let's say that the source is a collection of voltage sources, current sources and resistances, while the load is a collection of resistances only. Both the source and the load can be arbitrarily complex, but we can conceptually say that the source is directly equivalent to a single voltage source and resistance (figure (a) below).

{| align=center
|[[Image:Thevenin Equivalent.svg|center]]
|[[Image:Thevenin Equivalent Under Test.svg|center]]
|-
|align=center|''(a)''
|align=center|''(b)''
|}

We can determine the value of the resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the voltage source, ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' by attaching an independent source to the output of the circuit, as in figure (b) above. In this case we are using a current source, but a voltage source could also be used. By varying ''i'' and measuring ''v'', both ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be found using the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;v=v_s+iR_s \,&lt;/math&gt;

There are two variables, so two values of ''i'' will be needed. See [[/Examples#Example1|Example 1]] for more details. We can easily see from this that if the current source is set to zero (equivalent to an open circuit), then ''v'' is equal to the voltage source, ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''. This is also called the open-circuit voltage, ''v&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;''.

This is an important concept, because it allows us to model what is inside a unknown (linear) circuit, just by knowing what is coming out of the circuit. This concept is known as '''Thévenin's Theorem''' after French telegraph engineer [[w:Léon Charles Thévenin|Léon Charles Thévenin]], and the circuit consisting of the voltage source and resistance is called the '''Thévenin Equivalent Circuit'''.

== Norton's Theorem==

Recall from above that the output voltage, ''v'', of a Thévenin equivalent circuit can be expressed as

::&lt;math&gt;v=v_s+iR_s \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let's rearrange it for the output current, ''i'':

::&lt;math&gt;i=-\frac{v_s}{R_s}+\frac{v}{R_s}&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to a KCL description of the following circuit. We can call the constant term ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' the source current, ''i&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''. 

[[Image:Norton Equivalent Under Test.svg|center]]

The equivalent current source and the equivalent resistance can be found with an independent source as before (see [[/Examples#Example 2|Example 2]]).

When the above circuit (the '''Norton Equivalent Circuit''', after Bell Labs engineer [[w:Edward_Lawry_Norton|E.L. Norton]]) is disconnected from the external load, the current from the source all flows through the resistor, producing the requisite voltage across the terminals, ''v&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;''. Also, if we were to short the two terminals of our circuit, the current would all flow through the wire, and none of it would flow through the resistor (current divider rule). In this way, the circuit would produce the short-circuit current ''i&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which is exactly the same as the source current ''i&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'').

== Circuit Transforms ==

We have just shown turns out that the Thévenin and Norton circuits are just different representations of the same black box circuit, with the same Ohm's Law/KCL equations. This means that we cannot distinguish between Thévenin source and a Norton source from outside the black box, and that we can directly equate the two as below:

{| align=center
|[[image:Thevenin Equivalent.svg|center]]
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;
|[[image:Norton Equivalent.svg|center]]
|}

We can draw up some rules to convert between the two:

*The values of the resistors in each circuit are conceptually identical, and can be called the equivalent resistance, ''R&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'':
::&lt;math&gt;R_{s_n}=R_{s_t}=R_s=R_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;
*The value of a Thévenin voltage source is the value of the Norton current source times the equivalent resistance (Ohm's law):
::&lt;math&gt;v_s=i_sr\,&lt;/math&gt; 

If these rules are followed, the circuits will behave identically. Using these few rules, we can transform a Norton circuit into a Thévenin circuit, and vice versa. This method is called '''source transformation'''. See [[/Examples#Example 3|Example 3]].

==Open Circuit Voltage and Short Circuit Current==

The open-circuit voltage, ''v&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a circuit is the voltage across the terminals when the current is zero, and the short-circuit current ''i&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current when the voltage across the terminals is zero:

{| align=center
|width=200|[[Image:Open Circuit Voltage.svg|center]]
|width=200|[[Image:Short Circuit Current.svg|center]]
|-
|align=center|''The open circuit voltage''
|align=center|''The short circuit current''
|}

We can also observe the following:

*The value of the Thévenin voltage source is the open-circuit voltage:
::&lt;math&gt;v_s=v_{oc}\,&lt;/math&gt;
*The value of the Norton current source is the short-circuit current:
::&lt;math&gt;i_s=i_{sc}\,&lt;/math&gt;

We can say that, generally,

::&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Why Transform Circuits? ==

How are Thevenin and Norton transforms useful? 
:Describe a black box characteristics in a way that can predict its reaction to any load.
:Find the current through and voltage across any device by removing the device from the circuit! This can instantly make a complex circuit much simpler to analyze. 
:Stepwise simplification of a circuit is possible if voltage sources have a series impedance and current sources have a parallel impedance.</text>

== Overview ==
{{Wikipedia|BusyBox}}

BusyBox is a very popular program on many embedded Linux systems. In fact, someone working on an embedded Linux system is very likely to encounter BusyBox. BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single relatively small executable. One of the included utilities is a vi clone.

The BusyBox vi clone is limited. Among the limits are:

* It does not support all common vi commands. 
* It supports the '!' command to execute a child process, but does not capture process output
* It also lacks the normal vi crash recovery feature.
* It always assumes a vt102 type terminal (emulator)
* Only very few settings are configurable via &lt;code&gt;:set&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;.exrc&lt;code&gt; configuration and configuration via environment variables are not supported
* Line marks are not correctly adjusted if lines are inserted or deleted before the mark.
* Only whole-line undo (uppercase 'U'), no last-change undo (lowercase 'u') is supported.
* Searches ignore case by default, but can be case sensitive using &lt;code&gt;:set noignorecase&lt;/code&gt;
* Command-counts need to prefix a command
* command counts for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and several other commands are not supported.
* A limited set of ex commands are supported.

In short, a lot of information in this vi tutorial is not applicable to BusyBox vi.

However, BusyBox vi also has some differences (considered by some to be enhancements) over classic vi:

* Cursor navigation in insert and command mode
* &lt;INSERT&gt; key changes to insert mode
* No wrapping of long lines. Long lines are displayed via side-scrolling.

= What are English Language standards? =

The Handbook of English Standards wikibook exists to provide distributed authorship of standards--compiling and categorizing them for teaching and learning English. This may be for English as a primary language or for English as an additional language. You are welcome to contribute to the [[EnglishStandards|English Standards wiki]] or to use this area to discuss the writing of the wiki. 

==Why wiki standards? ==
Wiki is completely open and distributed. The idea in creating this book is to encourage a plurality of approaches to standards and benchmarks. The word on the street is that the US government discontinued the standards project because of the plurality of viewpoints. A [[EnglishStandards|wikibook]] can allow for contribution without sponsorship beyond the [[Main_Page|wikibooks group]]. Can a wiki Handbook of English Language Standards succeed? What is success? 

==Who owns educational standards?==
What do you think? A number of professional organizations and states have published their standards. Many states accredit schools and higher education institutions based on standards. Most (if not all) of these documents were created in committees or by task forces. Do you know who wrote the standards being mandated in your area of the world? If you could have contributed, how would you have done things differently? 

==Why standards at all?==
The standards movement is critiqued from a variety of viewpoints. What help or hindrance are standards in the world of teaching and learning? 

==What viewpoints need to be represented?==
Rather than beginning from existing standards documents, this wikibook has been organized to allow for a variety of viewpoints on what it means to learn and know. If you want to discuss a particular viewpoint, use this talk page (or add a viewpoint to the [[EnglishStandards|wikibook]] itself).</text>

Have you considered voting for [[UK Constitution and Government]] again this month, as it has been renominated.  It relly is a very good book.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 15:52, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

Dear JMRyan,
I put the Trouble with Mandy up for speedy deletion.  It is a duplicate of an existing page.  I am new here and didn't realize it was still there.

== [[Social Postulates]] ==
Thanks for the information. I've expanded the book into a full project proposal so that the tasks can be automated. It is beneficial to see the information in book form for the next 3-5 months until the project is up and running. At that time, I plan to delete the book unless someone else wants to use it as a textbook to document the unique philosophical questions raised and answered during the formation of the project. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 15:39, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

== Muggle Vandalism ==

Thanks for the heads up. I watch the high-profile pages of the book but I wouldn't have caught one of those. The real problem with the book is that there are so many content pages that I can't keep track of all the new ones created in the book in order to enforce project standards. They were really just bad edits and so I removed them, but I wouldn't necessarily call them vandalism. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 19:26, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks a lot ==

Thanks for reverting that vandal in the Magician Guide in Maple Story. That was most definitly a vandal.

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:18, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] Change of text==

You voted for enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. The text of this policy has been changed by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] during the vote, I have further modified these changes to restore some of the original &quot;bite&quot;. This is highly unusual but without these changes [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] is unwilling to allow the policy to move to enforced. I am happy that the changes are not sufficiently substantial to undermine the policy, if you disagree then please make your views known. Changes to text during a vote could be construed as a delaying tactic so I have proposed a move to &quot;enforced&quot; status by 1st June. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:08, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

==Modal Logic==

Hello, I started writing the section on modal logic in the introduction to philosophy:logic wikibooks some time ago but, as you say, everything became a bit too messy. If you would like any help with modal logic or any help with extending, changing or clearing up the part I am responsible for, please feel free to leave me a message.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A lot of experiments just have two possible outcomes, generally referred to as &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;. If such an experiment is independently repeated we call them (a series of) '''Bernoulli trials'''. Usually the probability of success is called p. The repetition may be done in several ways:

*a fixed number of times (n); as a consequence the observed number of successes is stochastic;
*until a fixed number of successes (m) is observed; as a consequence the number of experiments is stochastic;

In the first case the number of successes is Binomial distributed with parameters n and p. For n=1 the distribution is also called the Bernoulli distribution.
In the second case the number of experiments is Negative Binomial distributed with parameters m and p. For m=1 the distribution is also called the Geometric distribution.

Suppose that we are given a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that is continuous on an interval {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and we want to calculate the length of the curve drawn out by the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; from {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} to {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=b&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  If the graph were a straight line this would be easy — the formula for the length of the line is given by Pythagoras' theorem.  And if the graph were a piecewise linear function we can calculate the length by adding up the length of each piece.

The problem is that most graphs are not linear.  Nevertheless we can estimate the length of the curve by approximating it with straight lines.  Suppose the curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is given by the formula {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} for {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  We divide the interval {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subintervals with equal width &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and endpoints {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  Now let {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y_i=f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} so {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;P_i=(x_i,y_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} is the point on the curve above &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.  The length of the straight line between &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; |P_iP_{i+1}| = \sqrt{ (y_{i+1} - y_{i})^2 + (x_{i+1}-{x_i})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So an estimate of the length of the curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the sum
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |P_iP_{i+1}| &lt;/math&gt;

As we divide the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; into more pieces this gives a better estimate for the length of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact we make that a definition.

{{Calculus/Def | title=Length of a Curve | text=The length of the curve &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be
:&lt;math&gt;L = \lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |P_{i+1}P_i|&lt;/math&gt;
}}
 
== The Arclength Formula ==

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  Then the length of the curve given by {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x))^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;
And in Leibniz notation
:&lt;math&gt; L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ 1+ \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' Consider {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} - y_i= f(x_{i+1}) -f(x_i).&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}  By the [[Calculus/Mean Value Theorem for Functions|Mean Value Theorem]] there is a point &lt;math&gt; z_i&lt;/math&gt; in {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;(x_{i+1},x_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} such that
:&lt;math&gt; y_{i+1} - y_i= f(x_{i+1}) -f(x_i)= f'(z_i) (x_{i+1}-x_i)\,&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}|P_iP_{i+1}|&amp;=\sqrt{ (y_{i+1} - y_{i})^2 + (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2}\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (f'(z_i))^2 (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 + (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (1+(f'(z_i))^2) (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (1+(f'(z_i))^2)} \Delta x\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this into the definition of the length of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;L=\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sqrt{ (1+(f'(z_i))^2)} \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

Now this is the definition of the integral of the function {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; (notice that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is continuous because we are assuming that &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is continuous).  Hence 

:&lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;

as claimed.

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example:  Length of the curve {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=2x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} from {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} to {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}}}
As a sanity check of our formula, let's calculate the length of the &quot;curve&quot; {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=2x&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} from {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} to {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.  First let's find the answer using the Pythagorean Theorem.
:&lt;math&gt;P_0=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;P_1=(1,2)&lt;/math&gt;
so the length of the curve, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, is
:&lt;math&gt;s=\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
Now let's use the formula
:&lt;math&gt;s=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{d(2x)}{dx}\right)^2}\ dx=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+2^2}\ dx=\sqrt{5}x\bigr|_0^1=\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;

== Arclength of a parametric curve ==

For a parametric curve, that is, a curve defined by {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x=f(t)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y=g(t)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, the formula is slightly different:
:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ (f'(t))^2 + (g'(t))^2 }\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:''' The proof is analogous to the previous one:
Consider {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} - y_i= g(t_{i+1}) -g(t_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} and 
{{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} - x_i= f(t_{i+1}) -f(t_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}.
By the Mean Value Theorem there are points &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; in {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;(t_{i+1},t_i)&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} such that
:&lt;math&gt; y_{i+1} - y_i= g(t_{i+1}) -g(t_i)= g'(c_i) (t_{i+1}-t_i)\,&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;  x_{i+1} - x_i= f(t_{i+1}) -f(t_i)= f'(d_i) (t_{i+1}-t_i)\,&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}|P_iP_{i+1}|&amp;=\sqrt{ (y_{i+1} - y_{i})^2 + (x_{i+1}-x_i)^2}\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (g'(c_i))^2 (t_{i+1}-t_i)^2 + (f'(d_i))^2 (t_{i+1}-t_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (f'(d_i))^2)+(g'(c_i))^2) (t_{i+1}-t_i)^2 }\\
&amp;=\sqrt{ (f'(d_i))^2 + (g'(c_i))^2} \Delta t\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this into the definition of the length of the curve gives
:&lt;math&gt;L=\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sqrt{ (f'(d_i))^2 + (g'(c_i))^2 } \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b \sqrt{ (f'(t))^2 + (g'(t))^2}\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

I think some examples would be helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Syllogism==
A syllogism is an inference, consisting of three statements in which a conclusion follows as a matter of necessity from two given premises.  A classic example of a syllogims is:

::: All humans are mortal (major premise)
::: All Greeks are human (minor premise)
::: therefore, All Greeks are mortal (conclusion)

===Qualities of Statements===
Each of these statements are said to have the quality of being universally affirmative (all humans are mortal), universally negative (no humans are mortal), particularly affirmative (some humans are mortal), or particularly negative (some humans are not mortal).  A statement which is universally affirmative may be designated by writing the letter, '''A'''.  A universal negative statement is designated by the letter, '''E'''.  A particular affirmative statement is designated by the letter, '''I''', and a particular negative statement, by the letter, '''O'''.  All of the above statements are universally affirmative.

====Exercises 1.1====
State whether each of the following statements are universally affirmative, universally negative, particularly affirmative, or particularly negative by designating them with an '''A''', '''E''', '''I''', or '''O'''.

Nice work at Wikibooks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:53, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called FurciferRNB. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name FurciferRNB~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== 1. Explain and illustrate an experiment by which the laws of electrical attraction and repulsion are shown.==
This simple experiment can be performed with nothing more exotic than a roll of plastic, transparent tape - the kind usually found on a desk.  Remove two 12&quot; strips of tape from the roll and hold them by the end, one in each hand.  Removing the tape from the roll will charge the strips with static electricity.

Now bring the two strips of together.  They will repel one another.  Next, fold the top of one strip over itself, creating a half-inch long &quot;non-sticky&quot; zone.  Then attach the two strips, with the folded strip's sticky side to the other strip's non-sticky side.  Pull them apart by holding onto the non-sticky zone.  Now the two strips will be attracted to one another.

== 2. Explain the difference between direct and alternating current, and demonstrate the uses to which each is adapted.  Give a method of determining which kind flows in a given circuit. ==

Electricity in a direct current (DC) circuit flows in only one direction.  In an alternating current (AC) circuit, the direction of current flow reverses at a regular rate.  Similarly, the voltage in a DC circuit remains constant, while it continuously varies in an AC circuit.  

Batteries are capable of storing DC voltage only - they cannot store AC voltage.  Most electronic circuitry runs on DC, and electronic appliances that run on AC power usually convert it to DC before it can be used.  The advantage AC has over DC is that it can be transmitted over long distances with less loss than a DC circuit providing an equivalent amount of power.

AC circuitry produces a constantly varying magnetic field, and a constantly varying magnetic field will induce a current in an adjacent conductor.  The induced current can be measured with a current meter.  DC circuitry will only induce a current when a sudden change in the circuit takes place, such as powering it on.  The induced current will &quot;spike&quot; briefly and then decay to zero.

== 3. Connect a buzzer, bell, or light with a battery using a switch in line. ==

[[Image:Lamp_circuit.png|Light, battery, and switch]]

The circuit above shows how to connect a battery, switch, and light.  The light can be replaced with the bell or buzzer.

== 4. Make and run a simple electric motor from a kit or take apart a motor and identify the parts, and explain how it works. ==
There are several low cost motor kits available on the market.  Here are links to a few:
* [http://www.simplemotor.com/rsmotor.htm ISP Corporation]

* [http://www.science-city.com/elmotkit.html MiniLabs]

* [http://www.sciplus.com/singleItem.cfm?terms=9460&amp;cartLogFrom=froogle American Science and Surplus]

It is far more economical to bring in a single motor rather than have each student buy a kit.  Small motors can be bought at most hobby stores, and each student can take turns disassembling it.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

The classic DC motor has a rotating armature in the form of an electromagnet with two poles.  
A rotary switch called a commutator reverses the direction of the electric current twice every cycle, to flow through the armature so that the poles of the electromagnet push and pull against the permanent magnets on the outside of the motor.  As the poles of the armature electromagnet pass the poles of the permanent magnets, the commutator reverses the polarity of the armature electromagnet. During that instant of switching polarity, inertia keeps the classical motor going in the proper direction. (See the diagrams below.)

&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Electric_motor_cycle_1.png|left|thumb|200px|A simple DC electric motor. When the coil is powered, a magnetic field is generated around the armature. The left side of the armature is pushed away from the left magnet and drawn toward the right, causing rotation.]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Electric_motor_cycle_2.png|left|thumb|200px|The armature continues to rotate.]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Electric_motor_cycle_3.png|left|thumb|200px|When the armature becomes horizontally aligned, the commutator reverses the direction of current through the coil, reversing the magnetic field. The process then repeats.]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

== 5. Make a simple battery cell. ==
A battery can be made by placing a galvanized (zinc-plated) nail and a copper wire in a small container filled with vinegar.  Do not let the zinc and copper terminals touch one another.  They can be held apart by punching small holes in the container's lid and inserting them through these holes.  A film canister works pretty well for this, but so will a paper or foam cup covered with plastic wrap (or just put the two conductors on opposite sides of the container).  As long as the two conductors can both be immersed in the vinegar without touching one another, a voltage should develop between them.

It might help to brighten the nail and the copper with sandpaper or emory cloth first.  A cell constructed like this will generate about 0.8 volts.  The copper wire will be the positive terminal (anode) and the zinc plated nail will be the negative terminal (cathode).  

Connect multiple cells in series to form a battery and boost the voltage.  When doing this, be sure to connect the positive terminal (copper) of one cell to the negative terminal (zinc) of the other.  

Connect multiple cells in parallel to boost the current capacity (necessary to light up a bulb).  To do this, connect all the nails together with one wire and connect all the copper terminals together with another wire.

== 6. Demonstrate the ability to replace fuses or reset breakers and demonstrate a National Electric Code (NEC) approved splice using insulated wires. ==
There are many types of fuses.  Some of them have threaded bases and can be removed by rotating them counter-clockwise.  Others have to be pried out of their holders.  Always remember that household current is dangerous, so it is best to cut the power first.  This requirement can also be met by changing the fuse in an automobile or appliance (unplug first!).

A breaker is a current-sensing switch.  Circuits can be turned off by flipping the switch away from the center of the breaker panel, and turned back on again by flipping the switch towards the center of the breaker panel.  When a breaker senses that the current flowing through it exceeds its rated threshold, the switch opens by itself, moving the toggle between the off position and the on position.  The breaker is said to have &quot;tripped&quot; when this happens.  Before a tripped breaker can be reset, it must first be turned fully to the off position, and ''then'' it can be returned to the on position.  If the breaker trips again, the circuit is still overloaded.  If this is the case, turn off some of the appliances in the circuit before attempting to reset the breaker again.

== 7. Show how you would rescue a person in contact with a live electric wire, and have a knowledge of the method of reviving a person insensible from shock. ==
First, '''do not touch the person! '''  Instead, turn off the power as quickly as possible.  If you cannot find the switch, use a non-conducting pole such as a wooden broom handle, a non-metallic chair, a shoe, or some similar object and move the wire off the person.  Be sure to move the wire far enough away so that it will not reconnect with the victim when released.  Be careful to ''not'' touch the wire with any part of your body.

Once the victim has been disconnected from the current, call 911.  If the victim is not breathing, start CPR.  If the victim is breathing, but unconscious, maneuver the body onto its side to prevent the victim's tongue from blocking the air passage.

== 8. Make a simple diagram of a lighting system of an automobile. ==

[[Image:Car_lights.png|thumb|650px|Simplified automobile lighting system diagram]]
{{clear}}

== 9. Make a diagram that properly shows the lights, switches, and convenience outlets controlled by each breaker in a house. ==

[[Image:House_circuit.png|600px|thumb|Typical House Circuit]]

The schematic above shows a typical circuit in a household.  The circuit as shown is protected by a fuse (although a breaker would be applicable as well), and has three loads:

# A light controlled by a single switch
# An unswitched outlet
# A light controlled by two switches

More outlets and switches can be added to the circuit, but note that they will all be connected in parallel.  All circuits will connect to the black &quot;'hot'&quot; wire and to the white &quot;'neutral'&quot; wire.  

A typical house will have about two dozen breakers, and it is rare for a circuit to have more than about eight outlets or lights.  Having too many lights or outlets on a single circuit will cause the breaker to trip or the fuse to blow, so several circuits are run in a house.

== 10. Read an electric meter correctly, and compute a residence bill at the rate charged in your community. ==
Electric meters measure electricity in ''kilowatt hours.'' One kilowatt hour (kWh) will provide 1000 watts for one hour.  Electric companies typically charge a flat rate per kilowatt hour, and this rate can be found on an electric bill.  Some electric companies charge varying rates depending on ''when'' the electricity is used, charging a lesser rate when electrical demand is lower (such as during the night).  For this requirement it is a lot easier to assume a flat rate, but even then utility companies do not always make it easy.  For example, they may break the rate down into several components and they may add flat fees as well.  If this is the case for you, simply add all the component rates together to get an aggregate rate.  The component rates can be very small values - fractions of a penny.

To calculate the rate, one must first read the meter.  The meter is not reset when it's read, so one must know what the meter read during the previous billing cycle.  The current reading is subtracted from the previous reading, and the difference is multiplied by the rate.

&lt;math&gt;bill = \left((current\ reading - previous\ reading)\times  aggregate\ rate \right)+flat\ fees&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Mechanical_electricity_meter_1965_(1).jpg|400px]]

The meter pictured above shows 60169.1 kilowatt hours (not 60279.1 - the dials have not yet reached the 2 or the 7 yet).  To calculate an electric bill assume the following:

Previous month's reading: 59023.6 kWh

Aggregate rate: 11.274 cents per kWh

Flat fees: $20

The bill would be calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}bill &amp; =&amp; \left( (60169.1 - 59023.6) \times 0.11274\right) \ +\ $20 \\ \ &amp; =&amp; (1146.5 \times 0.11274)\ +\ $20 \\ \ &amp; =&amp; $129.14\ +\ $20\\ \ &amp;=&amp; $149.14\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is rounded to the nearest cent.

[[File:Raphael School of Athens.jpg|thumb|right|School of Athens by Raphael (1505)]]

The Renaissance is a period in European history that covers the 15th century to the 17th century. The word renaissance means rebirth in Italian and describes the rediscovery of the knowledge and art of Classical Greece and Rome. The roots of the Renaissance can be found in the Crusades of the 11th century onwards. The Crusaders main aim was to liberate Jerusalem from Muslim control and one of the more positive effects of the Crusades was the rediscovery of ancient texts and art. News of books and artifacts that had been unavailable in Europe were brought back by Crusaders and this led to a renewed interest in Classical Greece and Rome. It must be noted that diplomatic contact and trade between Europe and the East continued throughout the Crusades and many texts were acquired by Europeans perfectly peacefully. One of the most quoted finds is &lt;i&gt;The Almagest&lt;/i&gt; by Ptomely; a work on astronomy. The Almagest was written in the 2nd century C.E and translated into Arabic in the 9th century. It was rediscovered in the 12th century by European scholars and translated into Spanish and Latin. This influx of texts and art from the East revitalised Classical studies in the West. Scholars in the West could now compare their Medieval texts (sometimes complete or fragments) against earlier copies or read works that had been known about in the West but had been presumed to have been permanently lost. These discoveries had a great affect on European culture and art. There was a determined effort by Renaissance composers to bring back to life the plays of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. Renaissance painters used the themes and mythology of the Classical period for inspiration. Renaissance sculpture absorbed the Classical aesthetic on form and many Renaissance statues show a sense of balance in portraying the human form that would be instantly recognisable to an Athenian of the 5th century BC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Now that you know how to use the Dock and Menu Bar (because you did read Chapter 1, right?), it's time to learn how to use the rest of your Mac's interface. In this chapter, you'll learn how to deal with windows, sheets, sliders, scrollbars, and all of the other elements of the Mac interface. From the next chapter onwards, you'll learn to apply what you've learned to real-world uses of your Mac.

A lot of this chapter should be a review for you, since in many ways the Mac interface is similar to the interfaces of competing operating systems such as Microsoft Windows. However, there will definitely be things in this chapter that you do not already know, so pay close attention.

=Windows=
[[Image:Tiger Interface Shot.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 1 - Three windows. Notice how they are stacked on top of one another.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Mac OS X, like most modern operating systems, uses a &quot;windowed&quot; interface.&lt;/font&gt; That means it displays information in a stack of overlapping rectangular boxes called &quot;windows&quot;. The window at the front of the stack is the only one you can interact with, and is called the &quot;active window&quot;. You can bring any ''in''active window to the front of the stack by clicking anywhere inside it.

==Title Bars==
[[Image:Tiger Title Bar.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 2 - A title bar. Note the tri-colored buttons in the left side.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Every window has a &quot;title bar&quot; at the top.&lt;/font&gt; This strip contains the window's name, or title, along with three little round buttons on the left side. These three buttons are colored red, yellow, and green from left to right.  Rolling over these buttons causes them to display (respectively) an ×, −, and +.

*Close - Clicking the red button (×) closes the window, but does not necessarily quit the application (program) the window belongs to. This is a common point of confusion in Mac OS X, because in Windows XP, if a program is left without any windows, it closes automatically. This is not so in the Mac OS; most applications will not quit unless explicitly told to do so through the appropriate command in the Menu Bar. If a dot appears in the red button, there is unsaved information in the window. If you close the window, you will be asked to acknowledge this and either save the information or lose it forever.

*Minimize - Click the yellow button (−), and the window &quot;minimizes&quot; (shrinks to the size of a postage stamp and flys into the right side of the Dock). These minimized windows can be &quot;Maximized&quot; (returned to their normal state) by simply clicking on their images in the Dock.

*Zoom - Click the green button (+), and the window attempts to resize itself so its contents fit exactly.  Click the green button again, and the window will resize to its previous dimensions.

==Toolbars==
[[Image:Tiger Mail Toolbar.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 3 - This toolbar is for the Mail application. Notice that it is directly below the title bar.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Toolbars are strips of controls that activate certain commands (for more on these controls, see below). Toolbars usually appear along the top of a window (directly below the title bar), but sometimes appear along the bottom or side.&lt;/font&gt;

Toolbars are usually customizable; that is, you can add or remove controls, change their order, and group them according to how you use them. To customize a toolbar, right-click it and choose &quot;Customize Toolbar...&quot;. A sheet (see below) appears, showing every control the application has to offer. You can drag controls from the sheet into the toolbar to add them, out of the toolbar to remove them, or horizontally to reorder them. You can drag in &quot;Space&quot;, &quot;Flexible Space&quot;, and &quot;Divider&quot; to organize controls into groups.

==Panes==
[[Image:Tiger Mail Panes.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 4 - This window is divided into three panes, outlined in red for illustrative purposes.]] 
In architecture, there are many styles of windows. Perhaps the style most commonly used today is the &quot;divided-light&quot; window. These windows consist of multiple panes of glass, held together by strips of wood called mullions.

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;As in architecture, it often makes sense to divide a computer &quot;window&quot; into multiple &quot;panes&quot;.&lt;/font&gt; Get the joke? The &quot;mullions&quot; that hold these virtual panes together are referred to simply as dividers. Quite often, dividers are adjustable. Dragging on the small dot in the middle of a divider lets you adjust the proportions of the panes on either side. For example, in Fig. 4, a divider with a dot separates the top and bottom panes. Dragging the dot upwards will make the bottom pane larger and the top pane smaller. Dragging the dot down will do the opposite: the top pane will become bigger and the bottom smaller.

Sometimes, applications forgo a divider and simply draw a thin line between panes. These are also adjustable, but you'll have to look around a bit to find the &quot;handle&quot; you can drag to resize the panes on either side. These handles are usually marked by three vertical lines. A line like this separates the left sidebar in Fig. 4 from the top and bottom panes to its right. To adjust the size of this particular sidebar pane, you must drag the three vertical lines in the lower-left of the window.

==Scrollbars==
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;You'll often find yourself working with a document larger than the window or pane that contains it. When this happens, Mac OS X busts out &quot;scrollbars&quot;.&lt;/font&gt; Named after the scrolls of medieval times, these strips appear along the edges of a pane. A scrollbar appears along the right side of the pane if the information within is ''taller'' than the pane itself. If the information is ''wider'', a scrollbar appears along the bottom.

Each scrollbar is divided into three parts:
*Scroll Track - This like a &quot;groove&quot; with a blue strip in it. The blue strip is the &quot;scroller&quot;, explained below. that the scroller sits in.
*Scroller - This blue pill-shaped strip represents the portion of the document which is visible. The larger the scroller is in relation to the scroll track, the more of the document is visible. The ''position' of the scroller in relation to the scroll track tells you ''which'' part of the document you are viewing. Dragging the scroller lets you view different parts of the document.
*Scroll Buttons - These little arrow buttons at the end of the scrollbar let you scroll one &quot;unit&quot; of space in a certain direction. The length of a unit depends on the application you are working in.

==Status Bars==
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Status Bars are strips that appear along the bottom of some (but not all) windows.&lt;/font&gt; They usually contain text pertaining to the window's status, but can also contain controls like a toolbar would.

==Resize Handles==
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;The bottom-right corner of most windows can be dragged with your cursor to give the window whatever dimensions you wish. These corners have three little tactile-looking ridges, providing a visual cue to their special sizing power.&lt;/font&gt;

=Palettes and HUDs=
[[Image:Tiger Pages Palette and HUD.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 5 - A HUD and a Palette. Notice that you can see the desktop through the HUD, since it's translucent.]]
&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Palettes, also refered to as &quot;Utility Windows&quot;, are miniature windows that contain information and controls designed to complement a larger window.&lt;/font&gt; They have skinny little title bars, and do not appear in the Window menu or in Exposé (see below).

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;There is a second flavor of palette called a HUD.&lt;/font&gt; No, you don't pronounce that &quot;hudd&quot; (a common mistake). H-U-D stands for &quot;heads-up-display&quot;. These are palettes that are black and translucent, just like a heads-up-display on say, a fighter jet. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Other than their looks, there is no difference between a HUD and a palette.&lt;/font&gt;

=Sheets=
[[Image:Tiger Pages 2 Print Sheet.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 6 - A sheet attached to a window. You can't interact with anything else in this window until you dismiss the sheet, but you ''can'' interact with other windows.]]
If you're familiar with computers, you're familiar with the concept of a dialog box. This computing mainstay has been offering warnings, options, and advice for years. But dialog boxes are often overkill; they take center stage and prevent you from doing anything until you acknowledge them. While there is certainly a place for this (for instance, warnings and alerts that you absolutely must see), quite often dialog boxes apply to only a single window. For this purpose, Apple has phased out dialog boxes in favor of a new invention of their own: the &quot;sheet&quot;.

&lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;A sheet looks like a sheet of paper that rolls out from the title bar of a window. Unlike the dialog boxes of old, which blocked access to everything on your computer until you closed them, sheets only prevent access to the ''single window that they are attached to'' until you close them.&lt;/font&gt; This lets individual applications get your attention without blocking access to others.

=Drawers=
A drawer works a lot like a drawer in a desk. It's a pane that slides in and out of the side of a window. It seems like they are being phased out by Apple, which is replacing them with sidebar panes, but there are still a few here and there in Mac OS X. You'll hear more about drawers when you read about the applications that use them.

=Exposé=
{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| [[Image:Tiger Exposé Before.png|thumb|375px|Fig. 7 - Before Exposé...]]
| [[Image:Tiger Exposé All Windows.png|thumb|375px|Fig. 8 - ... and after Exposé!]]
|}
Exposé is a neat little feature with big implications. It cuts through the clutter that results from having a large number of windows open at the same time. More specifically, it lets you visualize your open windows in two different ways, and can also temporarily hide all of them. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Each function of Exposé is activated by a different key on your keyboard.&lt;/font&gt;

#'''All Windows''' (the F9 key by default) - Pressing this key darkens your desktop and shrinks all of your windows into thumbnails. Exposé makes these thumbnails just small enough so that they don't overlap at all. Roll over a window with your cursor, and it will display its title. Clicking any window will return your Desktop to how it was before, but now with the window you clicked on in front of all others.
#'''Application Windows''' (the F10 key by default) - The second way to Exposé is a variation on &quot;All Windows&quot;. It tiles only the windows of the current, front-most application. If you have a bunch of websites in Safari and documents in Microsoft Word open, and you know you're looking for a Word document, then simply bring Word to the front and press F10.
#'''Desktop''' (the F11 key by default) - This key temporarily pushes all windows out of the way, giving you an unobstructed view of your desktop. To show your windows again, press the key again.

=Controls=
Apple uses a plethora of buttons, sliders, and other little gadgets throughout OS X and other applications. Use this list as a reference:

*'''Buttons''' - The most common control in the Mac OS, buttons are pill-shaped and made of glass. Their labels provide a clue as to what happens when you click on them.
*'''Button Menus''' - These oddball buttons sprout menus when you click on them. They are marked with a little triangle on their right side.
*'''Toolbar Buttons''' - Buttons in a window's toolbar (see above) can take on a variety of appearances. Sometimes they appear simply as icons. At other times, they will look more like standard buttons made of glass, plastic, or any other material the developer sees fit. As you use various applications, you will learn how toolbar buttons look in each one.
*'''Conjoined Buttons''' - Conjoined buttons are just that: two or more buttons joined together. Sometimes buttons are conjoined to show that they are related; at other times they are conjoined to show that only one button in the group can be activated at a time.
*'''Tabs''' - Tabs look like conjoined buttons at the top of a grey box. Clicking on different tabs will cause different things to appear in the grey box. The tab that you are currently viewing is highlighted in blue.
*'''Toolbar Tabs''' - Tabs inside a window's toolbar ''look'' just like toolbar buttons but ''act'' just like normal tabs. The tab you are currently viewing is highlighted in grey. 
*'''Checkboxes''' - These look like the checkboxes you might find in a tax form. You can check and uncheck them with one click. When a checkbox is checked, it lights up blue. 
*'''Radio Buttons''' - These special, round checkboxes always come in groups of two or more. Exactly one radio button in a group is always selected; you can't select more than one, and you can't select none at all.
*'''Sliders''' - These look like a slider you might find on a piece of machinery. They can be horizontal or vertical. You can drag them with your cursor to adjust a setting.
*'''Dials''' - A dial, also known as a knob, looks like a knob you might use to adjust the volume on your stereo. Drag one in a circular motion to adjust a setting.
*'''Pop-Up Menus''' - These are menus full of choices embedded ''inside a window'' as a control. Click on the blue triangle at the right side of a pop-up menu to view the options inside.
*'''Color Wells''' - These are used to select a color for something; perhaps part of a page layout you're working on or the title of your next hit movie. They look like clear, rectangular buttons with a colored square inside. Clicking them opens the application's color picker, letting you pick the color of your choice.
*'''Image Wells''' - Image wells are &quot;slots&quot; where you can insert an image. They resemble a well in a slide that one would look at under a microscope. Drag and drop an image into the well to use it.
*'''Progress Bars''' - When a task is being performed by your Mac, it often displays some sort of progress bar. These are glossy strips that gradually fill up with a blue color from left to right. When the blue reaches the right side of the bar, the task is complete. Sometimes your Mac can't tell how long a task is going to take. In this case, the progress bar displays bands of blue (like a barber pole) that move from left to right.
*'''Progress Spinners''' - When space is tight or the task being performed takes only a few seconds, Mac OS X will use a progress spinner to show that work is being done. The progress spinner is a tiny sunburst of grey lines which brighten and darken to give a spinning effect. It gives no indication as to how far along your Mac is with its task.
*'''Capacity Bar''' - This thick status bar displays the level of something - perhaps the battery life remaining in your wireless mouse. Sometimes it is split into sections, other times it's one long continous strip. The color can change according to how much the bar is filled.
*'''Rating Indicator''' - The rating indicator displays the rating of an item in &quot;stars&quot;. How these work vary from application to application, so please see each application's section of this wikibook for more information.
*'''Relevancy Bar''' - When searching for an item, sometimes relevancy bars appear next to their names, indicating how closely they match the terms for your search.
*'''Text Fields''' - Text fields are squarish white boxes that you can type text into.
*'''Steppers''' - Some text fields are designed to contain numbers. If you want to adjust the number in one of these fields, you can either manually type it in, or you can use the two vertical arrows you might find next door - steppers. These little arrow buttons let you &quot;step&quot; the number in the field up or down.
*'''Token Fields''' - Token fields look like a text field, but are designed to hold multiple items, separated by commas. As you type the items, they turn into blue rounded &quot;tokens&quot;. These can be dragged and dropped as an object. Some tokens also include built-in pop-up menus.
*'''Search Fields''' - Search fields are pill-shaped text fields that have a little magnifying glass symbol in the left side. You can search for items in a window or around your computer simply by typing your query into one of these guys. Sometimes you will have to press enter after typing to begin searching, but at other times searching happens automatically.
*'''Combo Boxes''' - Combo boxes ''combine'' a pop-up menu and a text field. You can choose an option either by selecting it as you would with a pop-up menu, or typing it in as you would with a text field.
*'''Disclosure Triangles''' - Also known as &quot;flippy triangles&quot;, these controls always appear next to a heading. If the triangle is pointing to the right, then the information under the heading is hidden. Click on the triangle and it flips down, showing the information. Click on the triangle again and it flips back up, hiding the information.
*'''Disclosure Buttons''' - These are disclosure triangles inside buttons. Clicking one causes the dialog box or sheet the button is in to show or hide some extra options and controls.
*'''Locks''' - Some windows contain settings that can only be modified by the administrator (owner) of your computer. These windows show little padlocks at the bottom. When the padlock is in the &quot;locked&quot; position, clicking the padlock asks you for your administrator password, which if entered correctly, will grant access to the administrator-only controls in the window. Clicking an ''un''locked padlock locks the controls again, so the next person who walks up to your Mac can't adjust any of the controls while you aren't looking.

We can prove ΔRPQ is congruent to ΔVST because both angle RQP and angle VTS are 100°. Segments PQ and ST are both 4 units, as well as RQ and VT are both 5 units. Therefore, both triangles are congruent by side-angle-side congruency.

| '''Hypotenuse Leg Congruency Theorem:''' If a right triangle has a leg and hypotenuse equal to the corresponding parts of the other triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

[[Image:ASA.gif]]

Angle BAP is a right angle and angle PDC is also a right angle.So they are equal. Angle APB of triangle BAP and angle CPD of triangle DPC are opposite angles and they are equal. Segments AP and PD are both 5 units.Since , the two angles and a side of the triangle BAP is equal to the two angles and a side of the triangle DPC , the both triangles are congruent.

=== AAS Congruency ===
:{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; text-align:left;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| '''Angle-Angle-Side Congruency Theorem:''' If one side and two angles of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
|}
[[Image:AAS.gif]]

We can prove ΔABC is congruent to ΔYXZ because angle CAB and angle ZYX are congruent (both 75°), angles ACB and YZX are congruent (both 65°), and AB is congruent to YX (nonincluded side). Therefore, both triangles are congruent by angle-angle-side.

=== AAA doesn't work ===
:{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; text-align:left;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| '''Three corresponding angles of a triangle doesn't prove two triangles are congruent.''' However, they do prove that two triangles are similar.

==Basic Principles of Congruent Triangles==
'''Conjecture 1:''' If two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding parts are equal.

==Chapter Review==

In order to prove that two [[Geometry/Triangle|triangles]] are congruent, three pieces of information are necessary.  The three pieces of information can be 
* the lengths of all three sides
* the lengths of 2 sides and the size of the included angle
* 2 angle measurements and the length of the enclosed side
* 2 angle measurements and the length of the following side

For right triangles, only two pieces of information are necessary.  If you can show that the hypotenuse and another side are congruent on each triangle, then you know that the triangles on the whole are congruent.

It is worth noting that you cannot prove that two triangles are congruent if you only know their angle measurements.  Even if you know every angle in each triangle, the lengths of the sides could be different.

==Vocabulary==

*'''Side-Side-Side Congruency Theorem''': If three sides of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
*'''Side-Angle-Side Congruency Theorem''': If two sides and the included angle of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent
*'''Angle-Side-Angle Congruency Theorem''': If two angles and the included side of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
*'''Angle-Angle-Side Congruency Theorem''': If one side and two angles of one triangle equal the corresponding parts of the other, then the triangles are congruent.
*'''Hypotenuse Leg Congruency Theorem''': If a right triangle has a leg and hypotenuse equal to the corresponding parts of the other triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

==Exercises==
Answers to each exercise can be found in the Appendix.

# In triangle RUN and triangle HID, angle R = angle D, angle U = angle I, and RU = DI. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?
# In triangle FRE and SLV, FR = LV, EF = SL, and angle F = angle S. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?
# In triangle MUS and CHR, angle S = angle H, US = HR, and angle U = angle R. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?
# In triangle QWE and RTY, QW = TY, WE = RY, and QE = RT. What triangles are congruent, if any, and why?

The character 'り' (ri) doesn't seem to match the brush stroke image very well.  Maybe the picture should be changed?  Or maybe a note could be added explaining why they don't look the same.  I am a learner here so I may be missing something...

: The printed form り is a bit different from the handwritten form. In the printed form, the two strokes of the handwritten form are being written without lifting pen from paper. I added a note to the page. Thanks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The proper way of removing hands is to use a hand remover.  These have jaws that fit under the hands, with a slot to go around the posts.  Most will pry against the dial.  

For most hand removers, it is best to put something between the hands and the dial--A slotted piece of watch tissue is best, but other similar materials will work.  (Watch tissue is pre-cut squares of thin paper, similar to wrapping tissue.  Smooth and not very absorbent, unlike facial tissue)

If you are using makeshift tools, make sure you lift on both sides evenly, rather than trying to pry one side until the hand comes off.  This is especially important on seconds hands, their pinion is fairly fragile, and the hands frequently have a tube.  You can either pry alternately on each side, or better pry on both sides at once with two tools. 

Especially with makeshift tools, it is likely that the hand will jump across the room when removed.  You may want to work inside a plastic bag, or place a blob of watch cleaning putty on the tip of the hand. 

On most (but not all) watches, it is not necessary to remove the hour hand, it's wheel will just lift off the dial.  Most Timex mechanicals only require removal of the seconds hand, the minute and hour hands can stay with the dial.  

It can be helpful to set the hands to 12:00 before removing them, especially on calendar watches.  

To align the hands on a calendar watch, set the time with no hands until the calendar is advanced to where it should be at midnight, then replace the hands. 

There are special tools to replace hands, but a pair of tweezers held open just enough to clear the post the hand fits on (for hour and minute hands) works well.  Make sure the hands are parallel with the dial, and that all hands can travel around without touching the dial, dial markers, other hands or the crystal.

The process of creating a &quot;green screen&quot; shot has two main parts: shooting and post production.

=Shooting Green-Screen=
==General tips==

* Light the green background evenly and brightly but don't overexpose it
** Your best bet to get the correct exposure is to run a few tests in a methodological fashion.
** If you can't afford to run tests then light the green screen at about 1 stop over key (i.e. light your greenscreen to reflect twice as much light as your foreground elements and then set your camera's exposure to comfortably capture the foreground elements).
* Try to avoid using filters on the lens.  Diffusion can make the key very hard to pull. (And make sure the lens is clean!)
* Avoid throwing shadows on the green screen
* Try to limit the amount of reflected green light bouncing from the screen onto the actors (this can be achieved by careful lighting; by moving the foreground elements as far away from the green screen as possible or by simply covering unused sections of the green screen in black)
* Avoid using the same colour in the actor's clothes as in the green screen.
* One way to check that your exposure is about correct is to place a bit of white card under the key light and then view the scene through a green filter.  The white card should &quot;disappear&quot; against the green screen.

==Really difficult things to key cleanly==

Try to avoid these things if at all possible:

* Hair, especially if it's moving (e.g. having an actor's/actress' long hair blowing in the wind against a green screen will be a nightmare to work with)

==Does it have to be a green screen?==
No, you can use any colour screen you wish.  Any compositing software worth its place in this world will be able to chroma-key any colour.  Blue and Green are often chosen because the human skin contains very little blue or green pigment. Green screens are often used for shoots outside as sunlight can register on a camera as &quot;blue&quot; causing problems when chroma keying.

==Shooting on video==
* Set the camera to a gain of 0db (this gives the best signal to noise ratio and the widest dynamic range)
* Use a video camera with the least [[w:chroma subsampling|chroma subsampling]] (i.e. 4:4:4 is best).  It is possible to get minimally acceptable results from DV (4:1:1) or HDV (4:2:0) but your life will be easier (and the resulting key considerably better) if you use a higher quality capture medium.  Since keying relies on color information that is disregarded as part of any color space reduction from 4:4:4, all lossy compression formats will result in decreased edge detail.

==Shooting on film==
* Choose a stock with the finest grain posible

=Post-production: pulling a key=

==Tools==
* Serious Magic has a program called Ultra that uses vector keying, rather than chroma keying. 
* Adobe Premiere Pro
* Adobe After Effects
* Autodesk Combustion
* Final Cut Pro/Express (Apple)
* FXhome CompositeLab (Lite and pro) and VisionLab software.
* Wax Invoker

==Introduction==

The [http://www.arri.com/prod/cam/d_20/tech_spec.htm D-20] is ARRI's concept of a practical digital movie camera. Like the [[w:Panavision|Panavision]] Genesis, it uses a single image sensor the same width as a standard 35mm film frame, but unlike the Genesis, this also has the same height as a 35mm frame.

The D-20 uses a custom-designed CMOS sensor rather than the older CCD technology of the Genesis. Instead of the Genesis's RGB stripe filter, the D-20 uses a Bayer Array, similar to that used on digital still cameras. The CMOS sensor's &quot;native resolution&quot; (before the color mask is applied) is 3018 x 2200 pixels, which allows a 1920 x 1080 standard HD output with a resolution similar to the Genesis. Recording can be either on HD Beta tape or a hard disk array.

The D-20 is actually based on a modified ARRIFLEX 435 film camera chassis. It can use any &quot;PL-Mount&quot; cinematography lens, and was specifically designed to be as familiar in operation to a film camera operator as possible. In particular, it retains the rotating mirror shutter/reflex viewfinder that is standard on all ARRI film cameras, which allows the incorporation of a standard optical viewfinder.

This has the advantages that:
* The optical viewfinder image can safely be used for critical focussing, whereas current model electronic viewfinders tend to have insufficent resolution for this.
* No power is needed while setting up a shot, nor is there any particular need for a &quot;video village&quot; of monitoring equipment.
* The camera operator can see outside the frame that is actually being recorded, so (s)he (and/or the focus puller)&quot;can see what's coming&quot;. (A major shortcoming of all-electronic viewfinder systems is the camera operator can only see what is actually being sent out to the recording system).

At present (Oct 2005) the D-20 is still undergoing refinement and to date no commercial projects have been shot with it. It has been observed that ARRI seem far less serious about the D-20 than Panavision do about the Genesis, since the CMOS sensor it is based on was principally designed for use in ARRI's anvanced film scanner, the Arriscan.

==History of the D-20==
Currently, as of during the Sundance Film Festival for 2006, there is only one ArriFlex D-20 located in the United States of America. In about a month from the festival, Arri Rental facilities should have the D-20 available for rent. However, rental prices are still unknown.

==Rental Facilities==
ARRI Rental Germany&lt;br&gt;
ARRI Media London&lt;br&gt;
ARRI-CSC New York&lt;br&gt;
Clairmont Camera, Los Angeles&lt;br&gt;

==Films made with the D-20==
* 1 day's usage on Tim Burton's [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121164/ Corpse Bride (2005)]
* 1 day's use on &quot;Caged&quot; - Short film (UK) [http://www.AEFilms.co.uk Official Site]

===Guiding Principles===

A definitive statement of what constitutes the best combination of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and face-to-face learning experiences is impossible. No such statement exists for the best combination of traditional practices much less for the newer world of blended learning. Singh &amp; Reed (2001) state &quot;Little formal research exists on how to construct the most effective blended program designs&quot; (p. 6). However, observers have begun to collate principles that, at least anecdotally, lead to greater success.

''One note before continuing. Most of the literature about blended learning design comes from work in business training and post-secondary education. The author makes the assumption that those principles are generally applicable to K-12 education as well.''

A theme that emerges is that the instruction methods, whether on-line or face-to-face, are the means, not the end. &quot;Students never learn from technology per se. They learn from the strategies teachers use to communicate effectively through the technologies&quot; (Cyrs, Cyrs, and Conway, 2003, General Guideline #1). It follows that the single most important consideration when designing a blended learning environment is the learning objective or purpose. It is tempting to assert that it is the &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; consideration. However, not only would that lead to this exposition being overly brief, as desirable as that might be for writer and reader alike, it would also mean ignoring the essential truth that all learning occurs in and is shaped by a context. Important dimensions of this context include (Singh &amp; Reed, 2001, p. 5):

:*'''Audience.''' What do the learners know and how varied is their level of knowledge? Are the learners geographicaly centralized or geographicaly dispersed? Are the learners here because they wish to be or because they have to be?
:*'''Content.''' Some content lends itself well to on-line situations. Other content, a complex and detailed procedure for assembling a valve train, for example, may work best in face-to-face setting.
:*'''Infrastructure.''' If physical space is limited, more of the instruction could be placed on-line. If students do not have access to high band width connections, on-line video streaming would be a poor choice.


With purpose and context in mind, the designer can select, combine, and organize different elements of on-line and traditional instruction. Carman (2002) identifies five such elements calling them key &quot;ingredients&quot; (p. 2):

#'''Live events.''' These are synchronous, instructor-led events. Traditional lectures, video conferences, and synchronous chat sessions such as elluminate are examples.
#'''Self-Paced Learning.''' Experiences the learner completes individually on her own time such as an internet or CD-ROM based tutorial.
#'''Collaboration.''' Learners communicate and create with others, e-mail, threaded discussions, and, come to think of it, this wiki are all examples.
#'''Assessment.''' Measurements of learners' mastery of the objectives. Assessment is not limited to conventional tests, quizzes, and grades. Narrative feedback, portfolio evaluations and, importantly, a designers reflection about a blended learning environments effectiveness or usefulness are all forms of assessment.
#'''Support Materials.''' These include reference material, both physical and virtual, FAQ forums, and summaries. Anything that aids learning retention and transfer.


It is useful, though ultimately reductive, to think of the interaction between context and ingredients for a given learning objective as a rectangular matrix. The intersections suggest the method the designer should use. The danger of this metaphor is the suggestion that each purpose, context, and ingredient combination deterministically lead to a matching method. Such is not the case. The point to the designer is to think in terms of those conditions, and others unique to her particular circumstance, as she orchestrates learning activities and creates her blended environment.

McCracken and Dobson (2004) provide an example of how learning purpose, context, and blended learning ingredients lead particular learning methods. They propose a process with &quot;five main design activities&quot; (p.491) as a framework for designing blended learning courses. The process is illustrated with a case study of the redesign of a class at The University of Alberta called Philosophy 101 (pp. 494 - 495):

*'''Identifying learning and teaching principles.''' The teaching and learning goals were described as requiring active participation, sustained discussion, and, most importantly, inquiry and critical analysis.
*'''Describing organizational contexts''' Team teaching with three professors and up to eleven graduate teaching assistants to engage a class of 250 students in dialogue around ethical and political philosophy.
*'''Describing discipline-specific factors''' The designers are described as being concerned about stereotypes of philosophy as &quot;bearded men professing absolute truths&quot; (p.495). The desire was to represent philosophy as an activity, not a set truths to be absorbed.
*'''Selecting and situating appropriate learning technologies''' Learning activities focused on the process of engagement: presenting and defending a thesis and responding to opposing views. For example, a face-to-face lecture would feature contemporary ethical dilemmas with newspaper headlines or a video clip. Or, the instructors would stage a debate in which they would assume the role of a philosopher under study and then argue from the philosopher's point of view. Online threaded discussion supplemented small group seminar sections.
*'''Articulating the complementary interaction between classroom and online learning activities''' In the Philosophy 101 example, it was noted how the face-to-face engagement was complemented by more deliberative, asynchronous discourse.


Even this simplified description illustrates the multilayered, multifaceted nature of blended learning environments. With such a large canvass, the most important design principle might be to start small. &quot;Creating a blended learning strategy is an evolutionary process.&quot; (Singh and Reed, 2001). A good place to begin is to supplement an existing conventional, environment with one or two on-line activities, a resource website or an asynchronous discussion for example. As experience and confidence are gained, new tools can be introduced and a greater effort put into redesigning the program. It is hoped that this chapter will help teachers reach that goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The template is shown without wiki formatting - so cut from below the line and paste it into your new page and you're ready to create a new guide! You can see how it looks [[../Template |here.]]

Remember the guide you're writing must have a title as &quot;Scienceshow/Guides/title&quot; by always first starting the new page as a link in the page [[Scienceshow/Guides]].

[[commons:scienceshow| Wikimedia Commons ScienceShow]] is where we upload the media files for this book to have an easy overview of available images etc.

__NOTOC__

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Purpose and Overview==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Make a brief statement about the purpose of this specific guide you're making in this section. Briefly describe what the experiment is about. Which scientific principles does it demonstrate?

Replace the guiding test in the template as your write, but keep the egneral structure and leave the text in empty sections so other contributors will know what it is intended for.

Remember that no copyrighted material can be added to this book without the authors explicit accept and please ackowledge sources of information and ideas with links to websites and references.

Media files should be uploaded on &lt;nowiki&gt;[[commons:scienceshow| Wikimedia Commons ScienceShow]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Status for this guide: Finished, Not yet finished, Check recipes...(leave the appropriate)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Subjects relating to this guide: add appropriate...[[../Nanotechnology/]], [[../Physics/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Safety==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Safety Class===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Choose a fitting safety class for this description

&lt;nowiki&gt;*'''Too dangerous!''' (We do not make this experiment because …)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Dangerous - Please be aware of this or the other thing... (Untrained people can do this experiment under supervision and guidance)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Harmless (The most dangerous thing is this insignificant little petitesse)&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Required Safety Equipment===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*The show performer: Glasses / Lab coat / Nothing / Fire extinguisher / Wet towel and a bucket of water / Eye flushing bottle &lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Audience/participants: Safety screens / Hearing protection (a finger in the ear is often a help).&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;==Materials==&lt;/nowiki&gt;


You'll need the following - make a list

&lt;nowiki&gt;* item 1: formula, CAS number, supplier [http://www.someshop.com], Safety issues (describe the most important ones), Storage, link to safety datasheet&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Procedure==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Preparation time&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Performance time&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Clean-up time.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Step by step===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#Start by…&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#…&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#End with explaining how to properly get rid of waste products&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Alternative methods===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Other ways to do the experiment


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Dangers===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Now the reader knows the experiment, give a closer description of possible dangers.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Important, be aware of…&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Consider the…&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;nowiki&gt;===Other Factors===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

What other things can sometimes affect the result of the experiment. Maybe the humidity or cleanliness of the glass ware is an issue.

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Show notes===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

What to consider when preparing. How to make it more spectacular. What can be difficult to achieve 'on stage' that normally is easy when practising.

What other experiments are good to that have in relation to this one?

What should you beware of that can make the experiment boring?

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Explanation==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===What's taking place===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Here you can give a more quantitative and mathematical description of what happens. What fundamental laws are involved or demonstrated by this experiment etc. Remember to explain jargon/expressions from the laboratory.

&lt;nowiki&gt;===In the real world===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Do you meet things like this in daily life - give examples!

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Unanswered Questions===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Things we do not yet know and should find an answer to - maybe how it actually works etc.


&lt;nowiki&gt;==More Information==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*[http://end.net Websites with more info] the end.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Acknowledgements===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;===References===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

See &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes Wikipedia:Footnotes]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; example reference &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Remember==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This is just a guide and it can contain both errors and omissions. Always make experiments in small versions before proceeding to larger quantities where things could become dangerous. Ask around if you have any doubts before starting and do not start on a procedure you do not feel you understand and is qualified to perform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This guide is for configuring your computer to enable reading and writing [[w:Malayalam language|Malayalam]] in Windows, and GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems.

== Microsoft Windows ==
=== Configuring for reading ===
#Delete any old version of [http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/fonts/AnjaliOldLipi.ttf AnjaliOldLipi] Font from Fonts directory which is often C:\WINDOWS\Fonts or C:\WINNT\Fonts.
#Download and copy [http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/fonts/AnjaliOldLipi.ttf AnjaliOldLipi.ttf] to Windows\Fonts folder.
#Click Start, Control Panel, Internet Options, Fonts. Select Language Script Malayalam. Then select Web page font as [http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/fonts/AnjaliOldLipi.ttf AnjaliOldLipi]. Press OK and OK.

=== Configuring for Writing ===

'''Varamozhi'''
[http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net Varamozhi] Editor is a transliteration based Malayalam text Editor that runs on both Windows and Unix. That is, you can type in Manglish and you will see in real Malayalam.
[[Image:Malayalam-Mozhi-Lipi.png|frame|left|Basic Mozhi Transliteration Scheme]]
Also, you can copy-paste any Malayalam article from some web site and that will be converted back to Manglish for correction, further editing or conversion to Unicode or another font.

=== Language packs ===
You can install the Malayalam language pack for your operating system to see the Microsoft Windows GUI in Malayalam.

== GNU/Linux and *BSD*s ==
* All latest GNU/Linux distributions support Malayalam well. You may need to follow specific installation guides  from  [http://smc.org.in Swathanthra malayalam Computing] to configure it well
* You can see a how to to enable malayalam in your computer @ the [http://malayalam.web4all.in Malayalam Computing Portal]

Here are the steps to enable support.
* pango enabled firefox does provide good indic fonts support.In [http://debian.org/ Debian GNU/Linux] Iceweasel provides the best indic rendition.You can enable Gnome browser epiphany for pango support via gconf2 tool as epiphany also is based on gecko.
 
* If your distribution does not come with any indic font(here,Malayalam), you will need to install one.

=== Installing Font in Gnome,Kde and X in general ===

* Download [http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/smc/fonts/malayalam-fonts-04/ Malayalam Unicode fonts]] and copy it to fonts:/// Directory

* All major distributions comes with malayalam fonts. Use apt-get install ttf-malayalam-fonts in Debian based distributions(Debian Ubuntu etc ) and yum install smc-fonts in fedora

===In Gnome===
'''[http://www.gnome.org GNOME]''' is a versatile Desktop Environment with native pango support which means better rendering in-built.
*In Gnome,drag n drop your font to nautilus window.before,nautilus should be in Fonts:/// directory(press CTRL+L,enter fonts:/// ).
Now press CTRL+ALT+BKSPACE to restart X and gdm.next time the font is available for local user and installed in ~/.fonts/ directory.

=== Installing TrueType fonts in X in general and also for Gnome ===

*there are other ways to make font available to all users of the system in Gnome or X itself.I am taking Debian/Ubuntu as example,but works for any distro too.for redhat/fedora and Suse or most distros this works.rpm based distros got a tool called [http://www.dinakaran.com/fonts/linux/ chkfontpath] which is very useful.
Now,you need to use CLI or terminal for implementing this.firstly:
 &quot;apt-get install ttmkfdir&quot; 
using apt package management  tool or use Synaptic Manager.
make a directory called malayalam and copy the Anjali font to there.
 :~#  mkdir /usr/share/fonts/truetype/malayalam/
 move the font here.
then go to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/malayalam/  -where font is installed.
You need to be root user for installing fonts globally.for that in a terminal,
su [press enter]
&lt;give your root password&gt;
or 
sudo  [press enter]
&lt;give your local password&gt;
sudo is used in Ubuntu Linux by default.

then as root(&quot;~#&quot; stands for root prompt,dont copy that),
 ~#ttmkfdir&gt; fonts.scale
 ~#mkfontscale
 ~#ttmkfdir &gt;fonts.dir
 ~#mkfontdir
 ~#xset fp+ /usr/share/fonts/truetype/malayalam/
 ~#xset fp rehash
now do a,
 ~#fc-cache -fv
restart Display(X) or reboot.As /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ directory is already mapped in Xorg for fonts.(see /etc/X11/fs/config).
Now the font can be used by every users.

=== Kde Desktop Environment ===
Kde is the most used Desktop Environment in GNU/Linux and *NIX's too:
* In KDE Control Center (kcontrol), select System Administration -&gt; Font Installer, and add the downloaded font
* You may need to logout and login back

*For Transliteration or manglish(type malayalam in English) in GNU/Linux and *BSDs,we can use a various inputs systems [http://smc.org.in Swanalekha] (Phonetic Keyboard using SCIM) or [http://smc.org.in mozhi]. otherwise you can compile from source the [http://varamozhi.wikia.com/wiki/Varamozhi Varamozhi] Transliteration tool for Malayalam.

=== Download Packages to Enable malayalam support in GNU/Linux ===
You can download the software required to enable Malayalam support in the latest version of Ubuntu(7.10) and Debian GNU/Linux (etch) from http://malayalam.kerala.gov.in

Use the repositories of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing to keep updated. Swathanthra Malayalam Computing manages repositories for Fedora 6, 7, 8, 9 , CentOS5 and Debain etch, lenny and sid
