See discussion for a tutorial on the passive voice and how to use it in Latin, including external links which explain future, imperfect, and present indicative passive verb forms.

I consider commercial textbooks to be inadequate, so I do not believe that this article can wait.


Here are the conjugations for the imperfect passive tenses. The basic rules for going to passive are:

In the first person, add -r if the active ending is a vowel, otherwise change the final constant to an -r. Examples:

paro (I prepare) -&gt; paror (I am being prepared)&lt;br&gt;
aperiebam (I was opening) -&gt; aperiebar (I was being opened)&lt;br&gt;
defendemus (we will defend) -&gt; defendemur (we will be defended)&lt;br&gt;
tenebimus (we will hold) -&gt; tenebimur (we will be held)&lt;br&gt;

In the third person, add -ur. Examples:

parat (he prepares) -&gt; paratur (he is being prepared)&lt;br&gt;
aperiebat (he was opening) -&gt; aperiebatur (he was being opened)&lt;br&gt;
defendent (they will defend) -&gt; defendentur (they will be defended)&lt;br&gt;
tenebunt (they will hold) -&gt; tenebuntur (they will be held)&lt;br&gt;

In the second person, things get more complicated. For the plural, replace &quot;tis&quot; with &quot;mini&quot;. Note the exception in &quot;ferre&quot;, where &quot;fertis&quot; becomes &quot;fer&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;mini&quot;. In the word &quot;ferre&quot;, the &quot;rm&quot; letter combination consistently gets separated (ferimus instead of fermus, ferimur instead of fermur and ferimini instead of fermini). For the singular present, take out the active ending, add the thematic vowel (a from -are, e from -ere, i from -ire and nothing from -re, as in ferre) of the verb's infinitive ending and add -ris. Examples:

paras (you prepare) -&gt; par&lt;b&gt;aris&lt;/b&gt; (you are being prepared)&lt;br&gt;
tenes (you are holding) -&gt; ten&lt;b&gt;eris&lt;/b&gt; (you are being held)&lt;br&gt;
defendis (you are defending) -&gt; defend&lt;b&gt;eris&lt;/b&gt; (you are being defended)&lt;br&gt;
audis (you are listening) -&gt; aud&lt;b&gt;iris&lt;/b&gt; (you are being listened to)&lt;br&gt;
defendetis (you will defend) -&gt; defend&lt;b&gt;emini&lt;/b&gt; (you are being defended)&lt;br&gt;
amabis (you will love) -&gt; amab&lt;b&gt;eris&lt;/b&gt; (you will be loved)&lt;br&gt;

Note the -eris ending in the future passive. The future active bo, bis, bit, bimus, bitis, bunt looks like the third conjugation so the passive bor, beris, bitur, bimur, bimini, buntur looks like the third conjugation. The imperfect passive is bar, baris, batur, bamur, bamini, bantur.

See [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/101/PassiveVoice.pdf] (external) for a table of the passive voice.

(Please feel free to use Google when this textbook doesn't cover something.)

See also: [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_Voice] (external--sister project) for usage of the passive voice.

Now let's discuss the Wikipedia entry:
&quot;When the subject is the agent or actor of the verb, the verb is said to be in the active voice. When the subject is patient, target or undergoer of the action, it is said to be in the passive voice. For example, &quot;The cat ate the mouse&quot; is active, but &quot;The mouse was eaten by the cat&quot; is passive.

In a passive voice sentence, the subject and the direct object switch places. The direct object is promoted to subject, and the subject is demoted to a complement (that may be left out).

In English, the passive voice is a periphrastic construction, i .e. it's modelled using an ad hoc phrase structure with a different word order, an auxiliary verb and a participle of the main verb. In other languages, such as Latin, the passive voice is simply marked on the verb as an inflection.&quot;


Always form words in the passive voice based on the [[wikipedia:present_stem]], and then inflect it using the personal ending. Memorize the infinitives first, starting with the 3rd conjugation.

==What is meant by the usage of &quot;inflect&quot; (I know it's a verb)?==
In a Slashdot article, it was commented that using Wikipedia, and by extension Wikibooks requires &quot;Wikipedia thinking&quot;--in other words, concepts may be introduced in several different ways, by several different people--some more trustworthy than others. 

In this instance, inflect is the generic verb for either conjugating a verb or declining a noun. In this chapter, we discuss conjugating verbs into the passive voice, because to conjugate is to work with infinitives. Conjugating into the passive voice uses a different set of infinitives.

Exercise # 1: Change active infinitives to passive infinitives.
&lt;BR&gt;
Exercise # 2: List personal endings 10 times for sureity.&lt;BR&gt;
Exercise # 3: See whether you can conjugate. Check your answers, and ask for help on the reference desk if you need it.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jose ignacio villar. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jose ignacio villar~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Camera Type ==
Camera type if important depending on what you are looking to get out of your camera.  Before buying a camera really think about what you want to accomplish with your camera as well as where you think you want to take your photography interest in the months to come.

== MegaPixel ==
How do the megapixels affect your image?

A megapixel represents one million independent points of color/brightness/hue/luminosity ect. The more pixels that are used to represent an image, the sharper and more distinct that image will become when printed. A digital camera usually captures 72 pixels per inch (which can be altered later to suit the requirements of the print) and in turn, its 'image size' is a factor of the 'megapixels' that camera is capable of recording. 

What size prints can I get from the many different range in megapixels?

Term:ppi=points/pixels per inch

My camera just made me an image whose dimensions are 3488x2616 or 9 124 608 pixels. Its a 9.1 megapixel camera, and 48.444 inches by 36.333 inches are the dimensions of the 72 ppi capture. What a photographer needs to know about digital images, is that while 72 ppi are fine for display on the computer screen, its absolute garbage for a print. A minimum of 200 ppi are required for any acceptability of quality, and 300 ppi the minimum required for photographic quality. 

You could print any image up to six feet across... but it wont be pretty. One must always consider how close the viewer will be to the final print when its on display... The farther the image, the less aparent points/pixels will become.

To figure out how big a quality print your camera can make, you need only convert the PPI to at least above 200, and higher if possible.

== Image Formats ==

* Jpeg (Joint Picture Experts Group) Format is the major format that is used buy Point &amp; Shoot(or Compact Digital) cameras and is an option on most [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dslr Digital SLR]] Cameras. It is a compressed form of bitmap image.
* Tiff (Tagged Image File Format) is available on some high end Point &amp; Shoot cameras as a replacement for Raw format.

* Raw (.RAW, .CRW(Canon), .CR2(Canon), .NEF(Nikon), .PEF(Pentax) .DNG(Adobe)) This format is the digital equivalent of a film negative, and is designed for high end cameras like Prosumer Point &amp; Shoot and Digital SLR Cameras, Raw format enables adjusts in more ways than conventional Tiff or Jpeg images and consists of data direct from the cameras sensor with little to no in-camera processing applied, available adjustments include Exposure, Color Temperature, Sharpness, Brightness, Contrast, Gamma and others.

== Digital Noise ==
[[Image:Noise Comparison.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Image on the left has exposure time of &gt;10 seconds in low light. The image on the right has adequate lighting and 0.1 second exposure.]]
'''What is digital noise?'''

Digital noise is created from heat generated by the cameras CCD(sensor). Digital noise or Image Noise (often shortened to just 'noise') can also be caused by a buildup of charge on the CCD.  It usually occurs when using long exposure times or high ISO settings. The amount of noise varies greatly with different models of camera but is not usually a problem at ISO 400 or lower, or when using shutter speeds of under 2.5 seconds.

'''How to avoid it?'''

There are a few ways to avoid buildup of noise:
* Use as low an ISO setting as practical
* Use as short an exposure time (shutter speed) as conditions permit
* Try not to underexpose dark areas of the image

'''How to fix it'''

The simplest way to fix noise is by avoiding it all together.  If your camera has a 'noise reduction' option in the menu, turn it on for long exposures.
Image manipulation software such as Adobe Photoshop and Jasc Paintshop Pro have noise reduction filters available, but these tend to introduce a degree of blurriness into the image.

== Digital Darkroom Applications ==
Photoshop

PaintShop Pro

ULead PhotoImpact (low cost, intuitive)

The Gimp (absolutly free, highly recommended)

[http://http://www.darktable.org/ Darktable] is an open source photography workflow application and RAW developer. A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Ada programs are usually easier to build than programs written in other languages like C or C++, which frequently require a makefile. This is because an Ada source file already specifies the dependencies of its source unit. See the [[Ada Programming/Keywords/with|'''with''' keyword]] for further details.

Building an Ada program is not defined by the Reference Manual, so this process is absolutely dependent on the compiler. Usually the compiler kit includes a make tool which compiles a main program and all its dependencies, and links an executable file.

==Building with various compilers==

:''This list is incomplete. You can help Wikibooks by [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Ada_Programming/Building&amp;action=edit adding the build information] for other compilers.''

=== GNAT ===

With [[Wikipedia:GNAT|GNAT]], you can run this command:

 gnat make ''&lt;your_unit_file&gt;''

If the file contains a procedure, gnatmake will generate an executable file with the procedure as main program. Otherwise, e.g. a package, gnatmake will compile the unit and all its dependencies.

==== GNAT command line ====

gnatmake can be written as one word &lt;code&gt;gnatmake&lt;/code&gt; or two words &lt;code&gt;gnat make&lt;/code&gt;. For a full list of gnat commands just type &lt;code&gt;gnat&lt;/code&gt; without any command options. The output will look something like this:

 GNAT 3.4.3 Copyright 1996-2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 
 List of available commands
 
 GNAT BIND               gnatbind
 GNAT CHOP               gnatchop
 GNAT CLEAN              gnatclean
 GNAT COMPILE            gnatmake -c -f -u

 Commands FIND, LIST, PRETTY, STUB and XREF accept project file switches -vPx, -Pprj and -Xnam=val

For further help on the option just type the command (one word or two words &amp;mdash; as you like) without any command options.

==== GNAT IDE ====

The GNAT toolchain comes with an [[Wikipedia:Integrated development environment|IDE]] called [[Wikipedia:GNAT Programming Studio|GPS]], included with recent releases of the [[Wikipedia:GNAT#License|GPL version of GNAT]]. GPS features a [[Wikipedia:Graphical user interface|graphical user interface]].

[[Wikipedia:Emacs|Emacs]] includes ([http://stephe-leake.org/emacs/ada-mode/emacs-ada-mode.html Ada Mode]), and GNAT plugins for [[Wikipedia:KDevelop|KDevelop]] and [[Wikipedia:Vim (text editor)|Vim]] ([http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1609 Ada Mode]) are available.

Vim Ada Mode is maintained by [http://gnuada.sourceforge.net The GNU Ada project].

==== GNAT with Xcode ====

Apple's free (gratis) IDE, [[Wikipedia:Apple_Xcode|Xcode]], uses the [[Wikipedia:LLVM|LLVM]] compiler with the [[Wikipedia:Clang|Clang]] front-end, and does not support Ada: however, in Xcode 4.3 for [[Wikipedia:OS_X_Lion|OS X Lion]] and later versions, the command line tools (assembler, linker etc) which are required to use GNAT are an optional component of Xcode and must be [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html specially installed].

=== Rational APEX ===

Rational APEX is a complete development environment comprising a language sensitive editor, compiler, debugger, coverage analyser, configuration management and much more. You normally work with APEX running a GUI.

APEX has been built for the development of big programs. Therefore the basic entity of APEX is a ''subsystem'', a directory with certain traits recognized by APEX. All Ada compilation units have to reside in subsystems.

You can define an ''export set'', i.e. the set of Ada units visible to other subsystems. However for a subsystem A to gain visibility to another subsystem B, A has to ''import'' B. After importing, A sees all units in B's export set. (This is much like the with-clauses, but here visibility means only potential visibility for Ada: units to be actually visible must be mentioned in a with-clause of course; units not in the export set cannot be used in with-clauses of Ada units in external subsystems.)

Normally subsystems should be hierarchically ordered, i.e. form a directed graph. But for special uses, subsystems can also mutually import one another.

For configuration management, a subsystem is decomposed in ''views'', subdirectories of the subsystem. Views hold different development versions of the Ada units. So actually it's not subsystems which import other subsystems, rather subsystem views import views of other subsystems. (Of course, the closure of all imports must be consistent &amp;mdash; it cannot be the case that e.g. subsystem (A, view A1) imports subsystems (B, B1) and (C, C1), whereas (B, B1) imports (C, C2)).

A view can be defined to be the development view. Other views then hold releases at different stages.

Each Ada compilation unit has to reside in a file of its own. When compiling an Ada unit, the compiler follows the with-clauses. If a unit is not found within the subsystem holding the compile, the compiler searches the import list (only the direct imports are considered, not the closure).

Units can be taken under version control. In each subsystem, a set of ''histories'' can be defined. An Ada unit can be taken under control in a history. If you want to edit it, you first have to check it out &amp;mdash; it gets a new version number. After the changes, you can check it in again, i.e. make the changes permanent (or you abandon your changes, i.e. go back to the previous version). You normally check out units in the development view only; check-outs in release views can be forbidden.

You can select which version shall be the active one; normally it is the one latest checked in. You can even switch histories to get different development paths. e.g. different bodies of the same specification for different targets.

=== ObjectAda ===

ObjectAda is a set of tools for editing, compiling, navigating and debugging programs written in Ada. There are various editions of ObjectAda. With some editions you compile programs for the same platform and operating systems on which you run the tools. These are called native. With others, you can produce programs for different operating systems and platforms. One possible platform is the Java virtual machine.

These remarks apply to the native Microsoft Windows edition. You can run the translation tools either from the IDE or from the command line.

Whether you prefer to work from the IDE, or from the command line, a little bookkeeping is required. This is done by creating a project. Each project consists of a number of source files, and a number of settings like search paths for additional Ada libraries and other dependences.  Each project also has at least one target. Typically, there is a debug target, and a release target. The names of the targets indicate their purpose. At one time you compile for debugging, typically during development, at other times you compile with different settings, for example when the program is ready for release. Some (all commercial?) editions of ObjectAda permit a Java (VM) target.

=== DEC Ada for VMS ===

DEC Ada is an Ada 83 compiler for [[w:OpenVMS|VMS]]. While “DEC Ada” is probably the name most users know, the compiler is now called “[http://h71000.www7.hp.com/commercial/ada/ada_index.html HP Ada]”. It had  previously been known also by names of &quot;VAX Ada&quot; and &quot;Compaq Ada&quot;.

DEC Ada uses a true library management system &amp;mdash; so the first thing you need to do is create and activate a library:

 ACS Library Create [MyLibrary]
 ACS Set Library [MyLibrary]

When creating a library you already set some constraints like support for Long_Float or the available memory size. So carefully read 

 HELP ACS Library Create *

Then next step is to load your Ada sources into the library:

 ACS Load [Source]*.ada

The sources don't need to be perfect at this stage but syntactically correct enough for the compiler to determine the packages declared and analyze the {{Ada/kw|with}} statements. Dec Ada allows you to have more than one package in one source file and you have any filename convention you like. The purpose of &lt;code&gt;ACS Load&lt;/code&gt; is the creation of the dependency tree between the source files.

Next you compile them:

 ACS Compile *

Note that compile take the package name and not the filename. The wildcard &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; means ''all packages loaded''. The compiler automatically determines the right order for the compilation so a [[w:make (software)|make]] tool is not strictly needed.

Last but not least you link your file into an

 ACS Link /Executable=[Executables]Main.exe Main

On large systems you might want to break sources down into several libraries &amp;mdash; in which case you also need

 ACS Merge /Keep *

to merge the content of the current library with the library higher up the hierarchy. The larger libraries should then be created with:

 ACS Library Create /Large

This uses a different directory layout more suitable for large libraries.

==== DEC Ada IDE ====

Dec Ada comes without an IDE, however the DEC [[Wikipedia:Language-Sensitive_Editor|LSE]] as well as the [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1609 Ada Mode] of the [[Wikipedia:Vim (text editor)|Vim text editor]] support DEC Ada.

== Compiling our Demo Source ==

Once you have [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=124904 downloaded] our example programs you might wonder how to compile them.

First you need to extract the sources. Use your favorite [[Wikipedia:ZIP (file format)|zip tool]] to achieve that. On extraction a directory with the same name as the filename is created. Beware: WinZip might also create a directory equaling the filename so Windows users need to be careful using the right option otherwise they end up with &lt;var style=&quot;color:OliveDrab4&quot;&gt;wikibook-ada-1_2_0.src\wikibook-ada-1_2_0&lt;/var&gt;.

Once you extracted the files you will find all sources in &lt;var style=&quot;color:OliveDrab4&quot;&gt;wikibook-ada-1_2_0/Source&lt;/var&gt;. You could compile them right there. For your convenience we also provide ready made project files for the following IDEs (If you find a directory for an IDEs not named it might be in the making and not actually work).

=== GNAT ===

You will find multi-target GNAT Project files and a multi-make Makefile file in &lt;var style=&quot;color:OliveDrab4&quot;&gt;wikibook-ada-2_0_0/GNAT&lt;/var&gt;. For i686 Linux and Windows you can compile any demo using:

 gnat make -P ''project_file''

You can also open them inside the GPS with

 gps -P ''project_file''

For other target platform it is a bit more difficult since you need to tell the project files which target you want to create. The following options can be used:

; style (&quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;Release&quot;): you can define if you like a debug or release version so you can compare how the options affect size and speed.
; os (&quot;Linux&quot;, &quot;OS2&quot;, &quot;Windows_NT&quot;, &quot;VMS&quot;) : choose your operating system. Since there is no Ada 2005 available for OS/2 don't expect all examples to compile.
; target (&quot;i686&quot;, &quot;x86_64&quot;, &quot;AXP&quot;): choose your CPU &amp;mdash; &quot;[[w:x86|i686]]&quot; is any form of 32bit Intel or AMD CPU, &quot;[[w:x86-64|x86_64]]&quot; is an 64 bit Intel or AMD CPU and if you have an &quot;[[w:DEC Alpha|AXP]]&quot; then you know it.

Remember to type all options as they are shown. To compile a debug version on x86-64 Linux you type:

 gnat make -P ''project_file'' -Xstyle=Debug -Xos=Linux -Xtarget=x86_64

As said in the beginning there is also a '''makefile''' available that will automatically determine the target used. So if you have a GNU make you can save yourself a lot of typing by using:

 make ''project''

or even use

 make ''all''

to make all examples in debug and release in one go.

Each compile is stored inside its own directory which is created in the form of &lt;var style=&quot;color:OliveDrab4&quot;&gt;wikibook-ada-2_0_0/GNAT/'''OS'''-'''Target'''-'''Style'''&lt;/var&gt;. Empty directories are provided inside the archive.

=== Rational APEX ===

APEX uses the subsystem and view directory structure, so you will have to create those first and copy the source files into the view.  After creating a view using the architecture model of your choice, use the menu option &quot;Compile -&gt; Maintenance -&gt; Import Text Files&quot;.  In the Import Text Files dialog, add &quot;wikibook-ada-2_0_0/Source/*.ad?&quot; to select the Ada source files from the directory you originally extracted to.  Apex uses the file extensions .1.ada for specs and .2.ada for bodies &amp;mdash; don't worry, the import text files command will change these automatically.

To link an example, select its main subprogram in the directory viewer and click the link button in the toolbar, or &quot;Compile -&gt; Link&quot; from the menu.  Double-click the executable to run it.  You can use the shift-key modifier to bypass the link or run dialog.

=== ObjectAda ===

==== ObjectAda command-line ====

The following describes using the ObjectAda tools for Windows in a console window.

Before you can use the ObjectAda tools from the command line, make sure the &lt;tt&gt;PATH&lt;/tt&gt; environment variable lists the directory containing the ObjectAda tools. Something like

 set path=%path%;P:\Programs\Aonix\ObjectAda\bin

A minimal ObjectAda project can have just one source file. like the Hello World program provided in {{Ada/Sourceforge|hello_world_1.adb}}

To build an executable from this source file, follow these steps (assuming the current directory is a fresh one and contains the above mentioned source file):

* Register your source files:

 X:\some\directory&gt; adareg hello_world_1.adb

This makes your sources known to the ObjectAda tools. Have a look at the file UNIT.MAP created by adareg in the current directory if you like seeing what is happening under the hood.

* Compile the source file:

 X:\some\directory&gt; adacomp hello_world_1.adb
 Front end of hello_world_1.adb succeeded with no errors.

* Build the executable program:

 X:\some\directory&gt; adabuild hello_world_1
 ObjectAda Professional Edition Version 7.2.2: adabuild
    Copyright (c) 1997-2002 Aonix.  All rights reserved.
 Linking...
 Link of hello completed successfully

Notice that you specify the name of the main unit as argument to &lt;tt&gt;adabuild&lt;/tt&gt;, not the name of the source file. In this case, it is ''Hello_World_1'' as in

 {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Hello_World_1 {{Ada/keyword|is}}

More information about the tools can be found in the user guide ''Using the command line interface'', installed with the ObjectAda tools.

'''Double angle formulae for cos and sine:'''

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = 2\cos^2(a) - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(2a) = 2\cos(a)\sin(a) &lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}


==What Are the Double-Angle Formulas?==

The Double-Angle formulas express the cosine and sine of twice an angle in terms of the cosine and sine of the original angle.  We are going to derive them from the addition formulas for sine and cosine.  The formulas are:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = 2\cos^2(a) - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(2a) = 2\cos(a)\sin(a) &lt;/math&gt;

It is well worth practising the derivation so that you can do it quickly and easily.  Then you will not need to remember the formulas, since you can get them quickly from the addition formulas for sine and cosine.  It is also good to practice the derivation because being more fluent with the algebra will make you better at other algebra used with trigonometry.

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Check these Make Sense}}
Did we make a typo in these formulas?  Check they at least make sense.
* We know that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos 0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Try those values out.  Do the formulas work?
* &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -1 \leq cos \theta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -1 \leq sin \theta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Are the formulas consistent with that?  
* Make up your own additional 'spot check' to check the formulas 

{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Half Angle formula for Cosine}}
If we put &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \alpha = 2a&lt;/math&gt; we immediately get

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(\alpha) = 2\cos^2(\frac{\alpha}{2}) - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Check it.  Do you agree?  Or rearranging:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \cos(\frac{\alpha}{2}) = \sqrt\frac{\cos(\alpha)+1}{2}  &lt;/math&gt;

So, if we know the cosine of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; (we do, it is zero), we can compute the cosine of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 45^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 22.5^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 11.25^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and so on.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \cos(45^\circ) = \sqrt\frac{\cos(90^\circ)+1}{2} = \sqrt\frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \cos(22.5^\circ) = \sqrt\frac{\cos(45^\circ)+1}{2} = \sqrt\frac{\sqrt\frac{1}{2}+1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \cos(11.25^\circ) = \sqrt\frac{\cos(22.5^\circ)+1}{2} = \sqrt\frac{\sqrt\frac{\sqrt\frac{1}{2}+1}{2}+1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

{{Robox/Close}}


==Proofs for Double Angle Formulas==

We'll prove the double angle formulas from the addition formulas.  Recall that:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(a + b) = \cos(a)\cos(b) - \sin(a)\sin(b)&lt;/math&gt;

Putting b = a in the above formula yields:
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = \cos(a + a) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle=\cos(a)\cos(a) - \sin(a)\sin(a) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle=\cos^2(a) - \sin^2(a) &lt;/math&gt;

So:
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = \cos^2(a) - \sin^2(a) &lt;/math&gt;

Compare this with the &quot;Pythagorean Theorem&quot; expressed in terms of sine and cosine.  Notice the double angle formula above has a minus not a plus, otherwise it would be saying &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, which would mean cos was 1 for all values of t, which we know is not true.  


===In terms of just cosine or just sine===

The formula 
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = \cos^2(a) - \sin^2(a) &lt;/math&gt;

isn't yet quite where we want it.  We want to get rid of the sine term and express it all in terms of cosine.  To do that we use the disguised &quot;Pythagorean Theorem&quot;.

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle \cos^2(a) + \sin^2(a) = 1&lt;/math&gt;   

which is the same as:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle -\sin^2(a) = \cos^2(a) -1&lt;/math&gt;   

so 

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = \cos^2(a) - \sin^2(a) = \cos^2(a) + \cos^2(a) -1 = 2\cos^2(a) -1&lt;/math&gt;

so 

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a) = 2\cos^2(a) -1&lt;/math&gt;

which is what we wanted.  

We could, if we had preferred, have used the disguised Pythagorean theorem to replace the &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle \cos^2(a)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle \sin^2(a) &lt;/math&gt;


{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Double angle cosine formula in terms of sine.}}
Do that now, in other words express:
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\cos(2a)&lt;/math&gt;
in terms of &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\sin(a)&lt;/math&gt;
* Check your answer, particularly to make sure that you have all the minus signs right.
{{Robox/Close}}


== Double angle formula for sine==

Now we will get the double angle formula for sine, this time using the addition formula for sine.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(a + b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \sin(b)\cos(a)&lt;/math&gt; 

Check that we've quoted the addition formula correctly, and then put b=a in the above

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(2a) = \sin(a + a) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle=\sin(a)\cos(a) + \sin(a)\cos(a) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle=2\cos(a)\sin(a) &lt;/math&gt;

So:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(2a) = 2\sin(a)\cos(a) &lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the formula for cosine the substitutions to get &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(2a)&lt;/math&gt; just in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(a)&lt;/math&gt; would involve square roots, so we're not going to do that.  The above formula is usually the nicest form to work with.

== Treble and Higher Angles ==
Using the above procedures twice, and the Pythagorean theorem where appropriate, we find

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(3a) = 3\sin a - 4 \sin^3 a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(3a) = 4 \cos^3 a - 3\cos a&lt;/math&gt;

By repeating the procedure, we can find formulae for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(na)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(na)&lt;/math&gt; for any integer n.  The formulas do however get rather long.

It is not really worthwhile remembering these formulas.  They are not used often, and can either be looked up in tables of formulas or calculated when you need them.  It is quite good for practising algebra to derive them yourself, so....


{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Treble angle formulas for sine and cosine}}
Derive the formulas for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(3\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(3\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; yourself.

{{Robox/Close}}


== Double and Treble Angles for Tangents ==
By using &lt;math&gt;\tan a = \frac {\sin a}{\cos a}&lt;/math&gt;, it can be worked out that:


: &lt;math&gt;\tan(2a) = \frac {2\tan a}{1-\tan^2 a}&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\tan(3a) = \frac {3\tan a - \tan^3 a}{1-3\tan^2 a}&lt;/math&gt;


Like the formulas for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(3\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(3\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, these formulas aren't often useful, but again it is good to be able to work them out yourself.


{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Multiple angle formulas for tan}}
Derive the formulas for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tan(2x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tan(3x)&lt;/math&gt; yourself.

* If you don't get 'the right answer', don't panic.  It takes time and practice to become fluent at algebraic manipulations.  Here, where you know the right answer, you can work through your steps and try and find for yourself where you went wrong.  Very often it is a sign error somewhere, adding a value instead of subtracting, and then everything from that point on is wrong.  You can use the trick of putting in actual values for x (and calculating with a calculator) to check for the place where the first error creeps in.

&lt;big&gt;'''Contraindications to Radiation Therapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Collagen vascular diseases==
It is a commonly held notion that collagen vascular diseases--such as lupus, scleroderma, Sjogren's, etc.--are an absolute contraindication to radiotherapy since the effects on normal tissue would be greater, and even severe.

Collagen vascular diseases include: rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Raynaud's, lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's, polymyositis.

Several studies, however, claim that it is safe to give high dose radiation in these patients:
*'''Review; 2007''' PMID 18035210 -- &quot;Radiotherapy in setting of collagen vascular disease.&quot; (Wo J, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Dec 1;69(5):1347-53.)
**Published results remain controversial
**Close involvement of rheumatologists. Consider initiating NSAID prior to treatment

*'''Yale; 2001''' PMID 11769860 &amp;mdash; &quot;Breast-conserving therapy in the setting of collagen vascular disease.&quot; (Chen AM, Cancer J. 2001 Nov-Dec;7(6):480-91.)
**36 pts (17-RA, 4-SD, 4-Raynaud, 5-Lupus, 2-Sjogren, 4-polymyositis). Median total dose 64 Gy. 
**Matched to control patients. Median f/u 12.5 yrs. No significant difference in acute complications (14% vs 8%). A significant difference was noted for late complications (17% vs 3%). When analyzed by specific disease, the difference disappeared in all but the scleroderma group.
**Conclusion:Higher incidence of complications for scleroderma but not other collagen vascular diseases.

*'''U.Pittsburgh; 1998''' PMID 9499258 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiotherapy for malignancies associated with lupus: case reports of acute and late reactions.&quot; (Rakfal SM, Am J Clin Oncol. 1998 Feb;21(1):54-7.)
**6 pts with Lupus (5-SLE, 1-discoid) treated with RT (4-breast, 1-Hodgkin's, 1-thymoma). With f/u of 7-121 months, none of the patients had severe acute or late skin or subcutaneous complications.
**Conclusion: No severe acute or late reactions in patients with Lupus after radiotherapy

*'''Iowa; 1993''' PMID 8490925 -- &quot;Acute and late reactions to radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular diseases.&quot; (Ross JG, Cancer. 1993 Jun 1;71(11):3744-52.)
**61 pts with CVD (39-RA, 13-Lupus, 4-scleroderma, 4-dermatomyositis, 1-polymyositis). Matched to control patients. 
**No significant difference in acute (11% vs 7%) or late (10% vs 7%) complications. 3 pts with CVD had fatal complications vs none in the control group. RA was associated with a slight increase in late complications; SLE was associated with a slight increase in acute reactions. No significant acute or late reactions were noted in patients with scleroderma, dermato- or poly-myositis.
**Conclusion: there was no increase in complications for patients with CVD

==Inherited Hypersensitivity Syndromes==
*Some patients with these syndromes may exhibit abnormally severe normal tissue reactions
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Ataxia-Telangiectasia|Ataxia-Telangiectasia]] is the most striking example
*RT doses may need to be adjusted accordingly


*[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Ataxia-Telangiectasia|Ataxia-Telangiectasia]]: profound sensitivity
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Ataxia-Telangiectasia-Like_Disorder|Ataxia-Telangiectasia-Like Disorder]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Nijmegen_Breakage_Syndrome|Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Fanconi_Anemia|Fanconi Anemia]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/NBCCS|Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome / Gorlin Syndrome]]: marked skin sensitivity
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Cockayne_Syndrome|Cockayne Syndrome]]: slight hypersensitivity

==Overview==
The term '''phyllodes tumor''', which was previously known as cystosarcoma phyllodes, refers to a group of lesions with varying metastatic potential.  These tumors are quite rare.  The word &quot;phyllodes&quot; derives from the [[wiktionary:%CF%86%CF%8D%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%BF|Greek word]] for &quot;leaf&quot; and is used because the tumor has a leaf-like, lobulated appearance when sectioned.

These tumors are often very large and grow rapidly.  Median age of presentation is 45 yrs, which is 20 yrs later than fibroadenomas.

Pathologically, has both epithelial and stromal components.  Both must be present.  It's the stromal component that has the metastatic potential.

Can be classified as benign, borderline, or malignant.  This classification is based on the tumor margins (pushing=benign, infiltrative=malignant), mitotic activity, and overgrowth of stroma (which is probably the most important feature).  

Lymph node metastases are rare.

Distant metastases are usually to the lung, as is the pattern seen in sarcomas.

Prognostic factors:
*'''local recurrence''' - 15% overall. low LR rates with tumors &lt; 2cm, but there is no correlation between size and LR.  
*'''distant mets''' - large size predicts metastatic spread. histologic type is prognostic. 10% DM rate overall, 20% in malignant lesions. LR does not predict DM. 
*'''regional spread''' - lymph node involvement in 10% overall

Disease free survival:
*96%, 74%, and 66% for benign, borderline, malignant tumors (Reinfuss et al)

Surgery:
*Local recurrence is high with positive margins.  Require wide local excision.  For benign lesions that were suspected to be fibroadenomas and excised without wide margins, a watch and wait approach is feasible.  Borderline/malignant tumors should be re-excised if there are positive margins. Mastectomy has no benefit over breast conserving surgery, but mastectomy can be done when the cosmetic outcome of a lumpectomy would be poor due to a large tumor in a small breast.  No need for axillary dissection. 

Local recurrence can be treated with additional surgery. 

For metastatic disease, chemotherapy is palliative. 

Chemotherapy may be used in malignant types, using similar agents to those used for sarcomas.

The role of radiotherapy is unclear.

**26 pts. Evaluated pathologic factors for correlation with outcome
**Described '''&quot;stromal overgrowth&quot;''' associated with metastatic disease and cancer-related death.


==Literature==
*'''Rare Cancer Network; 2008''' (1971-2003) PMID 17931796 &amp;mdash; &quot;Phyllodes tumor of the breast.&quot; (Belkacemi Y,  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Feb 1;70(2):492-500.)
**Retrospective. 443 pts, international. 85% breast conservation, 15% mastectomy. 64% benign, 18% borderline, 18% malignant. Adjuvant RT in 9%. Median F/F 8.8 yrs. 
**Outcome: LR in 19%, DM in 3.4%. If benign 11%, borderline 29%, malignant 28%. Good prognostic factors include younger age, small size, benign vs borderline/malignant histology, &amp;le; 5 mitoses, no atypia, no stromal overgrowth, no necrosis
**For pts with borderline or malignant tumor: RT associated with decreased LR, and TM associated with improved results. Benign tumors have excellent outcome with surgery alone. Recurences salvaged 92% with total mastectomy.
**Conclusion: for borderline/malignant tumors, TM better than BCS. Consider adjuvant RT based on histologic criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The generation of '''random numbers''' is essential to cryptography. One of the most difficult aspect of cryptographic algorithms is in depending on or generating, true random information. This is problematic, since there is no known way to produce true random data, and most especially no way to do so on a finite state machine such as a computer.

There are generally two kinds of random number generators:
non-deterministic random number generators, sometimes called &quot;true random number generators&quot; (HRNG), and
deterministic random number generators, also called pseudorandom number generators (PRNG).&lt;ref&gt;
NIST.
[http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/random_number.html &quot;Random number generation&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many high-quality cryptosystems use both -- a hardware random-number generator to periodically re-seed a deterministic random number generator.

Quantum mechanical theory suggests that some physical processes are inherently random (though collecting and using such data presents problems), but deterministic mechanisms, such as computers, cannot be. Any [[Wikipedia:stochastic process|stochastic process]] (generation of random numbers) simulated on a computer, however, is not truly random, but only pseudorandom.

Within the limitations of pseudorandom generators, any quality pseudorandom number generator must:

*have a [[Wikipedia:uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] of values, in all dimensions
*have no detectable pattern, ie generate numbers with no correlations between successive numbers
*have a very long cycle length
*have no, or easily avoidable, weak initial conditions which produce patterns or short cycles

==Methods of Pseudorandom Number Generation==
Keeping in mind that we are dealing with pseudorandom number generation (i.e. numbers generated from a finite state machine, as a computer), there are various ways to randomly generate numbers.

In C and C++ the function [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/rand|rand]]() returns a pseudo-random integer between zero and RAND_MAX (internally defined constant), defined with the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/srand|srand]]() function; otherwise it will use the default seed and consistently return the same numbers when the program is restarted. Most such libraries have short cycle lengths and are not usable for cryptographic purposes. 

&quot;Numerical Recipes in C&quot; reviews several random number generators and recommends a modified version of the DES cypher as their highest quality recommended random number generator. &quot;Practical Cryptography&quot; (Ferguson and Schneier) recommend a design they have named Fortuna; it supersedes their earlier design called Yarrow.

== Methods of nondeterministic number generation ==

As of 2004, the best random number generators have 3 parts:
an unpredictable nondeterministic mechanism, entropy assessment, and conditioner.
The nondeterministic mechanism (also called the entropy source) generates blocks of raw biased bits.
The entropy assessment part produces a conservative estimate of the min-entropy of some block of raw biased bits.
The conditioner (also called a whitener, an unbiasing algorithm, or a randomness extractor) distills the block of raw bits into a much smaller block of conditioned output bits -- an output block of bits half the size of the estimated entropy (in bits) of the raw biased bits -- eliminating any systematic bias.
If the estimate is good, the the conditioned output bits are unbiased full-entropy bits even if the nondeterministic mechanism degrades over time.
In practice, the entropy assessment is the difficult part.&lt;ref&gt;
John Kelsey.

&quot;Are you measuring what you think you're measuring?&quot;
&quot;How much of sample variability is entropy, how much is just complexity?&quot;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why==
This page should open with an explanation of ''why'' encryption specifically depends on the use of random numbers.  And not ''how'' it depends on them.

A counterexample could be explored, such as use of an an OTP whereby a certain key is chosen (or calculated) for a plaintext that is designed to yield the ciphertext of &lt;code&gt;11111111.....''(length of plaintext)''&lt;/code&gt;.  No random numbers are used here, and the OTP still provides perfect encryption.  Even though an obvious reason this might not work is that the key cannot be preexchanged (if that is necessary), that does not explain why random numbers are necessitated by cryptography.  [[User:Poppafuze|Poppafuze]] 05:59, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

==Request for graphs==
If anyone with access to Maple, Mathematica, etc. could make graphs of all the functions used in the article -- that is, arctan(x), (1/2) + (1/&amp;pi;) * arctan(x), f(x)=x^(3/2), and f(x)=x^2+c -- and place them in logically, I would really appreciate it.  It's late now, so I'm stopping for the night, but I would like to add (or like someone to add) a section on using modular groups to generate random numbers.  Unforunately, those two methods of random number generation are the only two that I'm familiar with, but if anyone is familiar with more, please feel free to add them.

==Newton's method==
&lt;small&gt;Moved from [[Cryptography/Random number generation]]&lt;/small&gt;

Why don't the [[Wikipedia:Pseudorandom number generator]] and http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PseudoRandomNumberGenerator articles mention this &quot;Newton's method on a non-converging function&quot; pseudo-random number generator?

I moved the following &quot;Newton's Method&quot; method of generating &quot;random&quot; numbers to the talk page,
because I suspect it is *not* a good method of generating pseudorandom numbers.
I would be fascinated to know why anyone thinks it is a good method.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 06:44, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

===Using Newton's Method and Arctangent===
First, remember that the [[Wikipedia:arctangent|arctangent]] function is defined for all ''x'' in the reals, and is mapped for all f(''x'') less than π/2 but greater than the -π/2.

&lt;center&gt;{arctan(''x'') ∈ R: -π/2 &lt; ''x'' &lt; π/2} (1)&lt;/center&gt;

One common trait of random number generators is a domain mapped to all reals greater than or equal to 0 but less than or equal to 1.  To do so, we take the arctangent function, and modify it:

&lt;center&gt;0 &lt; 1/2 + (1/π)*arctan(''x'') &lt; 1 (2)&lt;/center&gt;

Now, the graph of this particular function reveals a smooth, continuous function defined for all reals.  This function does ''not'' generate pseudorandom numbers by itself.  It merely scales them to any number mapped greater than or equal to 0 but less than or equal to 1.  (Note: although it is beyond the scope of this text, [[Wikipedia:Probability_theory|probability theory]] shows that this function, with well-formed input, indeed [[Wikipedia:convergence|converges]] to a set with a standard distribution.)

The most used input for this modified arctangent function such that it is a useful stochastic process is, surprisingly, [[Wikipedia:Newton's method|Newton's method]] for any function that does not converge.

{|align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
|width=&quot;135&quot;| &lt;math&gt;\left |\frac{f(x)f'(x)}{\left[f'(x)\right]^2}\right| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
| (3)
|-
| Condition for ''convergence'' for Newton's method
| 
|-
|}


For any value of a function that the condition for convergence for Newton's method fails, the value x resultant from each successive iteration of Newton's method is completely independent (logistically speaking) from the number previously!  And when that number is fed into our modified arctangent function, it is mapped to any real greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1!

====Note====
Some functions are more suitable choices for our purposes than others.  For example, |f(''x&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'')|&gt;|f(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')| for each iteration of the function f(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;.  One choice often used is the function f(''x'')= ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''c'' where ''c''&amp;gt;0.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Our '''solar system''' is part of an entity called our '''universe'''.
There were many attempts made in the past to explain how our solar system and universe came into existence as we observe it today.
Most scientists use the ''' Big Bang Theory''', though some people have other theories.

== Big Bang Theory ==

This theory is based around the idea that an enormous explosion occurred about 13.7 billion years ago. That is 13,700,000,000 years ago. This is three times the age of Earth! The Big Bang was not a usual explosion in space because space and time themselves were made in the explosion. This explosion caused the formation of the matter and energy in the universe. At first, the universe was very hot. The planets, stars and all other heavenly bodies formed starting some time after the Big Bang after the universe had cooled down.

The universe had been expanding and cooling since the Big Bang. Most galaxies are moving further away from our Milky Way galaxy. The exceptions are the few galaxies that are close enough to the Milky Way for gravity to overcome the universe's expansion.

Scientists can still see the faint light from when the universe was hot. Over time, the universe's expansion stretched out the light, turning it into weak microwave light. Scientists can detect this microwave light.

== Milky Way Galaxy Formation ==

== Solar System Formation ==

The solar system formed out of a big cloud of gas and dust about 4.6 billion years ago.  

[[en:Image:Eagle_nebula_pillars.jpg|thumb|250px|Eagle Nebula (M16) - Birth of New Stars]]

Stars and solar systems that are very similar to the Sun are now forming in the Eagle Nebula (also known as M16).  While this is not a picture of our own sun, it can give you an idea of what our solar system looked like billions of years ago.  These gas clouds that you see in this image were formed from earlier stars that exploded and left stuff behind.

Small finger-like parts of these clouds, especially at the &quot;top&quot; of the first column on the left, are the new stars that are forming.  Astronomers who have been watching these stars form have seen changes happen in just a few years, which is a very rapid change for the life of a star.  Over many millions and billions of years, these stars and any planets formed with them will look like our Solar System today.

What astronomers think happened after this initial period when the Sun was created from these huge gas clouds, there were many small and large rocks that gradually came together because of gravity and formed the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets that we know about today.  Many of the craters which can be found on the Moon were made when these rocks came crashing on to the surface.

&lt;!-- [[Image:KT Impact2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Even large rocks sometimes hit the Earth]] --&gt;
While the number of small rocks and other stuff from the early history of the solar system is now less than what it was like right after the Sun formed, the space between the planets still has many of these rocks, and they continue to form craters and even come into the Earth's atmosphere.  When you see these rocks at night, they are known as either '''Shooting Stars''' or '''Meteorites'''.  By watching these items come to the Earth, you are directly witnessing the process that created the Earth in the first place.

==Codepedia==
I, [[User:Bilderbikkel|Bilderbikkel]], would like to contribute with the CodePedia pages, www.codepedia.com/1/Prolog, that I've created. Can I assume other are able to distinguish Visual Prolog from other dialects (and perhaps label these)? What I really miss is File I/O, which I discuss (to the best of my humble knowledge) at www.codepedia.com/1/PrologFileIo. I hope I can add this section to the WikiPedia.
:Unfortunately, CodePedia, doesn't seem to allow reproduction of its materials (even if you wrote them), so they can't be copied to wikibooks or wikipedia. You could check the two links above. They have pretty comprehensive sections on file I/O that can be copied. I wouldn't worry to much about things belonging to a dialect. The book is still in its infancy. Details can be smoothed out later. [[User:Risk|risk]] 01:10, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. You current naming convention is depreciated and has several disadvantages - like it has no navigational links. Also you worthy effort is neiter considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an exstensive book and section detector.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:15, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
: Thanks for the note, it's been a while since I looked at this. I've been meaning to convert to the subpage naming system. I figure it should analogous to the Ada book; ditch the programming prefix and use slashes for subpages. I'd prefer the name Prolog, over Prolog Programming, though (especially since it's not unthinkable that non-programming topics will be discussed). If anybody has some time to kill, feel free to make this happen. [[User:Risk|risk]] 00:25, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== Adding Contents ==

These are topics to discuss (they may be covered already?).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most robots need a framework of some sort to which the builder attaches the various components and subsystems that make the robot function. This framework is known as the '''platform'''.

A good platform has a few requirements:
*It has to be light. Don't use steel unless you really need the extra strength. Plexiglass (or any other hard plastic) with an aluminum framework for strength can be sufficiently strong for most purposes. Don't forget about wood. Wood is strong, flexible and light.
*It has to be easy to add new parts to it. By using one size of PCB you can  drill holes ahead of time. And you'll be able to stack PCBs. If you're familiar with Meccano sets you know the advantage of using one standard hole size and spacing. Picking one for your robot can make adding parts very easy and fast, of course this is less efficient with space.
*It has to be easy to remove parts of it: Make sure you can access any of its parts without having to take most of the robot apart. Especially batteries should be accessible.
*It has to be in balance. The weight of the robot should be mostly within the figure formed by connecting the wheels of the robot (A triangle for 3 wheeled robots, a rectangle for 4 wheeled robots). Placing significant weight outside this figure makes it more easy for the robot to tip over. The center of gravity should also be as low as possible, otherwise the robot could tip over when turning too fast.
*It has to have a size that's practical: Don't make it too small or you end up with insufficient space for all the features you had in mind. Don't make it too large either or you end up with a robot that can't maneuver without bumping in furniture and people. Or worse: can't get through a door post.
*Avoid putting the wheels directly on the motors' axles. Use an axle and connect the motor to it with gears. For small robots this isn't important, but larger would displace the axle inside the motor and damage it.

''[[Cryptography]] affects us every day through a variety of subtle means. Cryptography protects our credit card number when it is sent over the phone lines, it protects your bank card pin from unauthorized access, and it keeps passwords safe from unauthorized access. As a society, we have become more dependant upon computers for our everyday lives. Right now, your health history, driving record, and financial information are probably computerized. The Internet is a fairly uncontrolled media, everything that is given access to the Internet is vulnerable to unauthorized access by hackers or other ne'er-do-wells, and therefore must be protected. 
You are probably already familiar with one form of protection, a password. It is a secret phrase that only you and the trusted party know. To authenticate yourself to the trusted party (the site with your information in the case of a bank or a doctors office), you give the password. It would not be very secure to have a list of passwords written on a sheet of paper by the counter (or just laying around in plaintext on a computer) in order to authenticate every client. The solution comes in the form of a cryptographic hash, typically [[Cryptography/MD5|MD5]]. The trusted party stores a hash of your password instead of the plaintext version. If someone were to steal the hashed version of your password (assuming the office in question used salting and a secure hash algorithm) it would be nearly useless to them. When you give your password, the office would compute the hash of it and compare that hash to the hash they have on record. Since one of the properties of a hash is that it does not collide (that is for any given input there is one unique output which is not equal to any other input. Of course there is no fixed length hash which can completely comply with that requirement over an infinite length input; most passwords are between 8 and 14 characters therefore for our purposes MD5 will suffice) if the two hashes are identical, then the ciphertexts were identical, so the user is authenticated. This process goes on almost every time you enter a password on a computer (Which is why most of the time you are given the option to reset your password not retrieve it because MD5 is a one-way hash. There are two-way cryptographic &quot;hashes,&quot; but I will not discuss them here.).

'''Gelatine''' (also '''gelatin''') is a clear, flavourless substance used as a stabiliser or thickener in many foods. It is derived from the breakdown of collagen from the skin, bones and connective tissues of animals after simmering for an extended period.

Recipes that are likely to use gelatine - especially commercially - are [[Cookbook:Trifle Pudding|Trifles]], Jelly (or Jello), [[Cookbook:Aspic|Aspic]], [[Cookbook:Marshmallow|Marshmallows]], Peeps, and Gummy, or Jelly, bears.

Although there is no vegetarian method of producing gelatin, several popular substitutes exist, such as [[Cookbook:Agar|agar]].

The study of '''Political Economy''' is the study of how individuals relate to the state, and in turn, how the states in the world relate to each other.

==Introduction==
Political economists are concerned with the allocation of scarce resources in a world of infinite wants and needs. In order to allocate these resources, politics are used within a state to provide for the people. Political economy is the study of the relationships between individuals and society, and more specifically, the relationships between citizens and states. [[Wikipedia:Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] can be considered one of the first political economists as his works provided a link between a ruler and the state along with the use of power in this relationship. Likewise, Thomas [[Wikipedia:Hobbes|Hobbes]] argued for the power of a sovereign leader because of his assumption that human beings are naturally bad. In the Enlightenment, the view of the role of individuals changed. Individuals were seen as virtuous and rational, able to find a natural Truth within the world. John [[Wikipedia:Locke|Locke]] and [[Wikipedia:Adam Smith|Adam Smith]] helped to provide the fundamental beliefs of liberalism, which is the belief that the state which governs least is the one which governs best. As capitalism flourished in industrial countries in Europe, problems began to emerge from the economic system. As a result, political economists such as Malthus, Hegel, and Marx critiqued capitalism in their works as they presented alternatives to liberalism.

In the 20th century, modern political economists have continued to write about the relationships between individual and the state. [[Wikipedia:Keynes|Keynes]], for example, introduced the alternative liberal idea of the welfare state (which helps to guide and protect the interests of those who have been damaged by the inequalities of the free market).

In all of these examples, these writers have presented new ideas about the allocation of resources within a society in the context of the relationships between individuals and states.



===What Political Economy Is===
Political economy is a study of philosophy and ideology that studies the evolution of political and economic ideas. Political economy profits from the interdisciplinary application of approaches and concepts that originated in the study of politics, economics, sociology, philosophy, and history. It ultimately concerns itself with the relationship between individuals and the state, and what influences this relationship. Political economists concern themselves not only with mechanics of economics but also with the ideology that supports its translation into policy.

The study of political economy can be split into two different historical periods. The first is known as [[Political Economy/Classical Political Economy]] and the other which is [[Political Economy/Modern Political Economy]].

==Definitions==
* [[Wikipedia:Sovereign state|State]]: A state is a sovereign political institution which governs over civil society, which is made up of individuals. The political institution combined with its civil society can also be referred to as the state.
* [[Wikipedia:Civil society|Civil society]]: This is an organized collection of individuals who participate in various groups which make up the society. The civil society is governed by the state, but is not a part of the political institution.
* [[Wikipedia:Power (sociology)|Power]]: Power, by the classical sociological definition, is the use or threat of force in order to influence other people's actions.
* [[Wikipedia:Sovereignty|Sovereignty]]: This is the legitimate use of power in order to govern a body of individuals. An institution that is sovereign answers to no higher power and is therefore autonomous.
* [[Wikipedia:Individual|Individual]]: Individuals are people who live and function within civil society and are governed by the state. However, throughout history, who is regarded as an individual has been debated since different groups of people (and animals) have gained or lost rights that have been attributed to legitimate individuals.
* [[Wikipedia:Virtue|Virtue]]: Virtue is the moral excellence of an individual. In other words, virtue is the measure of &quot;goodness&quot; in a person.
* [[Wikipedia:Property (ownership right)|Private property]]: Private property has been defined in different ways across the theories, but it can be generalized; private property is property that individuals can appropriate for themselves, and which society and the state have sanctioned the individual's right to use it in whatever way he or she sees fit.
* [[Wikipedia:Capital (economics)|Capital]]: Capital is wealth used to make more wealth. It can be accumulated, spent, and exchanged. Its second definition is the money which is used as an input along with the means of production and labor for the goal of making profit.
* [[Wikipedia:Means of production|Means of production]]: The means of production are those inputs that are not capital or labor. In other words, these are the technical tools used to produce commodities.
* [[Wikipedia:Labour (economics)|Labor]]: Labor is work produced by humans in order to change raw materials into commodities.
* [[Wikipedia:Commodity|Commodity]]: A commodity is an end product, with the inputs of capital, labor, and means of production. Commodities are sold to consumers in order to satisfy their demands and to provide the producer with revenue (and hopefully profit).
* [[Wikipedia:Nation|Nation]]: A nation is a collection of individuals based on some sort of commonality, whether that be a common language, ethnicity, culture, or all of the above. A nation is different from a state because it does not necessarily have a formal political institution that governs the people that belong in it.
* [[Wikipedia:Mercantilism|Mercantilism]]: Mercantilism is a political economic system based on the central belief that there is only a fixed amount of wealth in the world and that the state should take precedence over the individual in order to effectively maximize its wealth. The power of the state increases its wealth and vice versa.
* [[Wikipedia:Liberalism|Liberalism]]: Liberalism is a political economic system based on the central belief that wealth comes from labor and that there is a flexible amount of wealth in the world. The individual is virtuous and can govern himself even with a limited government.
* [[Wikipedia:Marxism|Marxism]]: Marxism is a political economic system based on the central belief that wealth and private property is detrimental and at times dangerous for individuals. Marxists strive to control the factors of production in a socialist system in order to gain enough infrastructure to support a communist utopia, where private property and a government do not exist. Marxism is divided into two polar camps of thought; one which does not believe in the possibility of a Communist Utopia (as Marx never did) and another which believes that a classless society can be created not only in relation to the means of production but in inter-class relations as well. This divide is labeled as a schism between Marxists and Communists.
* [[Wikipedia:Monarchy|Monarchy]]: A system of government with a king or queen as the leader.
* [[Wikipedia:Democracy|Democracy]]: A system of government wherein each individual of the society has a direct influence over the development of both domestic and foreign policy. Such a society has never been achieved as of yet; and in its place has existed a bureaucratic representative system of governing.
* [[Wikipedia:Socialism|Socialism]]: A system of government where the state controls the factors of production with the goal that institutions will one day be able to support the communist utopia (and the elimination of both state and private property).
* [[Wikipedia:Polyarchy|Polyarchy]]: The most widely embraced system of government in contemporary society, Polyarchy is a system in which a vast majority of citizens are ruled over by a small cadre of the obscenely wealthy in a system of representative democracy.

==Classical Political Economics==
{{main|Political Economy/Classical Political Economy}}
Classical theories of political economics come from theorists ranging from philosophers of antiquity to Keynes.

===Before The Enlightenment===
----
====History====
{{main|Wikipedia:Middle Ages}}
{{main|Wikipedia:Feudalism}}
During the middle ages, Europe mainly contained feudal social systems. During this time, there were no strong centralized powers and therefore, the large states that exist in modern Europe did not exist at this time.

Many places in Europe generally relied on the agrarian form of production. Serfs were bound to the land in order to work it to produce resources which would be exchanged with the lords for protection. Lords served kings and were loosely united under them in a feudal hierarchy.

Manufacturing and trade did occur, but in a very limited scale compared to later times. In some places, profit seeking was considered a sin. (Compare this with Asian societies in the 1700s or so when merchants were considered to be within the lowest social group based on the fact that they did not labor for their income.) The notions of wealth at the time was very different compared to more modern ideas of wealth such as the labor theory of value.

{{main|Wikipedia:Mercantilism}}
Soon after the middle ages from the 16th century onwards to around the 18th century, many European states adopted mercantilist economic systems. During this time, the society of the town grew into the emergence of civil society within states dominated by monarchy. Mercantilists generally believed that the distribution of wealth is a zero-sum game meaning that one economic actor must lose wealth if another gained because mercantilists believed that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world that cannot be created or destroyed, but only exchanged. Because of this, states believed in the favorable balance of trade. Mercantilist states strived to have a higher rate of exports than imports in order to gain more wealth.

These mercantilists believed that value and wealth come ultimately from gold, that gold is pure liquid (the only form of exchange that can be used without converting to some other form of wealth), and that gold was the only form of exchange into which all other forms of exchange could be converted to. In other words, gold is what defines value itself. Therefore, in the struggle for more wealth, states attempted to export as much as possible and to mine the earth as much as possible to accumulate the greatest amount of gold.

Individuals worked for the interests and the wealth of the state since the state's wealth was considered to be the ultimate goal of economics. States sanctioned monopolies and tightly controlled the market by means of licenses and guilds. Individual companies were licensed by the state and smaller artisans worked under state-controlled guilds which controlled the apprenticeship and employment of workers as well as the quality and quantity of the resulting commodities.

====Theory====
{{main|Wikipedia:Niccolò Machiavelli}}
{{main|Wikipedia:Thomas Hobbes}}
Before the Enlightenment, most political economists vouched for a strong state, advocating the security of the state over the individual. Niccolò Machiavelli is one of the first of these writers with his work ''The Prince'', which is a treatise telling the prince of a state what he or she should do in order to gain political power. One important passage in the book is as follows: &quot;The prince must none the less make himself feared in such a way that, if he is not loved, at least he escapes being hated. For fear is quite compatible with an absence of hatred; and the prince can avoid hatred if he abstains from the property of his subjects and citizens and from their women.&quot; This is telling the prince to control the people either by having his subjects fear or love him, and can do so by avoiding hatred of him. To do this, he must not deal with other people's private property. This is a very important idea in the study of political economy because it is an early example of the assumption that private property can be accumulated and that the intervention into the accumulation of private property by individuals is very offensive.

Thomas Hobbes was another writer who believed in the strong state. He assumed that humans were naturally like animals, prone to hurting each other if there were no controls put into place. Therefore, he believed that a strong state with the power being granted to one Sovereign would be the best way to rule a group of people. The Sovereign should be the ultimate authority on matters of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong,&quot; and individuals could be sacrificed as necessary in order to keep the state (which protects the large part of the population) from falling. Hobbes stressed the importance of the state over individuals, since it was the individuals who grant the state power to rule over them. In other words, individuals create a state in order to limit the amount of violence that they have for each other by granting the state a monopoly on power and violence. Because the individuals give up their rights to kill, people are generally safer since people with violent tendencies give up their legal rights to kill, and can be killed by the state in order to protect the interests of the people.

===Liberalism===
----

====History====
{{main|Wikipedia:Age of Enlightenment}}

====Theory====
{{main|Wikipedia:Liberalism}}
Classical liberalism came from the philosophy of the Enlightenment of the 18th century. Liberals generally believe that individuals are virtuous people who can more or less govern themselves by a mixture of this virtue and by rationality (which also draws from the Enlightenment idea that there is a definite Truth in the world, and that Truth may be found by actively searching for it and by applying logic to facts). Since liberals believe that individuals are naturally virtuous, they can and should be able to govern themselves and to decide the paths of their own lives with as little government intervention as possible. Liberals are not anarchists because they do recognize that a state is important in order to control the people as a whole, but they do believe that the state which governs least is the one which governs best.

John Locke was an Enlightenment thinker who believed that people in a state of nature are generally virtuous. However, in order to protect property rights from those few deviants, a social contract devised by the public sanctioning rights and responsibilities to a governing state must be introduced to society. Locke's idea of &quot;life, liberty, and property&quot; directly influenced the thinkers who introduced independence in the United States, namely Thomas Jefferson who advocated &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;

Adam Smith was a Scottish philosopher who also believed that people are rational and virtuous enough to govern themselves. Also, he believed that individuals should have free control over their economic situation. Adam Smith wrote against mercantilism (state-sponsored monopoly system) and advocated a type of economic system known as capitalism. He believed that value did not come from gold, as was the belief at the time, but rather, that value came from labor. He argued that since individuals should have control over their economic lives and that value came from labor, that people should divide labor into different parts (specialization) in order to be more efficient in the free market, to open up a dynamic interaction between producers and consumers from competition that would regulate prices naturally (invisible hand).

Jeremy Bentham introduced the idea of utilitarianism. He believed that any action can be defined in two parts (cost and benefit). These two parts produce pain and pleasure in individuals. He thought that the cost and benefit of any action could be measured mathematically and the resulting measurement of utility could be used as a way to make economic or political decisions. He believed that the action which produced the greatest good for the greatest amount of individuals is the best action to be taken in any decision.

===Alternatives To Liberalism===
----

====History====

====Theory====
Not everyone believed that liberalism was an answer to the problems of the world. Some thinkers believed that liberalism could never exist because of the lack of resources to support a liberal world while some thinkers believed that liberalism could never exist because of the lack of human virtue.

Thomas Malthus believed that the world's population and resources grew at different rates. He believed that the population growth rate was much faster than the resource growth rate which would cause a scarcity of resources for the given amount of people. Therefore, with no active controls on population growth, the world would eventually destroy itself. Malthus' idea is a criticism of liberal ideas because his theory contradicted the idea of the virtuous individual. Left alone, individuals would overpopulate the earth, and the state needed to regulate unchecked human wants.

Thorstein Veblen was a thinker who challenged the idea of capitalism. He believed that in capitalist society, people accumulate property for the sole purpose of pecuniary emulation (the copying of spending patterns of the upper class) and conspicuous consumption (the buying of unnecessary goods in order to show off wealth to other people). He believed that liberalism encourages capitalism, which in turn encourages this sort of spending behavior, which is destructive to the society as a whole and to individuals in particular. He believed that allowing individuals too much economic freedom would cause them to act this way because of their inherent greed and desire to compete.

===Marxism===
----
{{main|Wikipedia:Marxism}}

====History====

====Theory====
Karl Marx believed that the world consisted of a set pattern of history. He believed that history had a few important eras highlighting the different relationships between different sets of people. Inequality has been common to all these relationships. In ancient times, there were slaves and masters, where masters directly had control over slaves. This progressed to the feudal ages which supported the peasants and aristocrats. Eventually, this changed as well, with people from the peasant class and the aristocracy forming town dwellers who eventually became factory owners in the modern capitalist era. These factory owners employed factory workers who labored for the owners' profit. He called these modern factory owners capitalists and the class of capitalists the bourgeoisie. He called the workers proletarians and referred to their class as the proletariat.

In short, Marx believed that the world needed to complete a particular stage of history before moving on to the next stage. Therefore, feudalism was necessary for capitalism, and capitalism is necessary for the proposed next stage. Marx believed that inequality would become so widespread due to capitalism that the world would have to undergo a chaotic revolution due to his belief that the capitalist system could not support itself. He believed that there was a fixed amount of wealth in the world and that the capitalist system made capitalists accumulate private property to no end. He argued that the division of labor which is an important component of capitalism divides people into workers of different jobs; this categorization naturally led to inequality. After capitalism set up the necessary infrastructure, the world would move to socialism where the state would control individuals, destroying the division of labor to end inequality. After the world had stabilized, it would move to communism, where people no longer had a need to accumulate private property since everyone would in a sense become Renaissance men and women who would be bound by no one occupation. Anyone could work as they saw fit and provide for the rest of society. This is Marx's idea of the communist utopia.

===Role Of Individuals===
----
The idea of the individual and how the individual should be treated has changed throughout history. In the middle ages, the individual was servant to both lord as well as God. Individuals labored on the land in order to produce resources for the lords, who would then forward it to the kings, who were supposedly leaders chosen by God. The Catholic church ran in a rather hierarchical system with Jesus as the head and individuals making up the body.

Machiavelli wrote very little about the role of the individual, except that the prince should try by the use of power to get all the people within his principality to follow him. Individuals to Machiavelli were either servants or obstacles to the prince. Hobbes believed that humans are naturally violent and not virtuous. Therefore, in order to protect individuals and to limit violence, the rights to violence were given to the state in order for the state to mediate and control using this concentrated power. In other words, all individuals gave up their rights to kill for the state so that individuals would not have the power to do so, thus preventing violence and protecting a large amount of people. However, Hobbes also believed that the state could use violence as necessary in order to prevent challenges to its authority or to prevent damages to society. Therefore, individuals should serve the state which would then protect them because individuals could not protect themselves in the state of nature.

Liberals such as Locke believed that individuals are generally virtuous. Therefore, they should be able to govern themselves because people can ultimately come to some sort of consensus. Locke was an Enlightenment philosopher and one important idea of the Enlightenment is that idea that there is an ultimate Truth, and that this Truth could be found using rationality. Therefore, with people's virtue and their ability to reason, they would be able to control and organize their lives largely independent from the intervention of the state. Smith believed that humans have the innate ability to truck, barter, and exchange, which are necessary skills required to participate in a free market. He argued that since people have these natural skills and are virtuous, they can engage in economic trade within the free market system with minimal limitations set up by the state.

Marxists believe that the ultimate goal is to free the individual from the state. All throughout history, people have been split into different classes due to inequality. These inequalities cause conflicts between individuals of different classes. He argued that under capitalism, this is no exception because the division of labor divides people into different jobs, continuing this inequality. The accumulation of private property and state intervention exacerbates this problem even further. He believed that the state needs to strictly control individuals until the society comes out of the capitalist system, and then it can move towards the communist utopia where individuals rule themselves without a state that caters to the interests of the wealthy specifically, but rather a vehicle that caters to the interests of the majority under strict Democratic control. Contrary to popular assumption Marx does not promote the dissolution of governing entities but rather to change them into entities of protection rather then exploitation. With this achieved that which was previously recognized as the State apparatus has been replaced with what is commonly referred to as a Workers State. Hence, it would be a misnomer for the new apparatus to be called a &quot;State&quot;.

===Role Of The State===
----
The state is the institution that regulates the distribution of wealth and private property. Therefore, the role of the state was an important topic for those who were interested in how this distribution was to be handled. Also, throughout the history of the world, there had always been the question of how to protect and mediate the actions of individuals. It makes no sense for individuals to come together in a society unless there is some sort of coherence between the wants, needs, and abilities of those individuals. The state is the power that regulates these things.

The classical view of the state is the idea of an institution with sovereign power over its citizens. In other words, a state has power (which is the monopoly over force and violence) to make sure its citizens act within the bounds of the law. An institution is sovereign if it answers to no higher power.

In feudal times, Europe was split into kingdoms, which governed themselves by the word of the king (or what Machiavelli called the prince). Princes ruled their principalities based on inheritance or force and many claimed that they gained the right to rule by God's sanction. Kings gave power to their vassals (lords) to protect the kingdom in return for resources. The resources came from the lords' vassals (serfs) who worked the land and provided food for the kingdom in exchange for protection. Machiavelli believed that a prince should gain as much power as possible in order to control the population within the principality. He assumed that princes should win over their people by love if possible and force if necessary. Hobbes believed in the absolute power of a sovereign because he believed Athenian democracy was bound to fail. He argued that power should be spread out as little as possible because conflicts in power and sovereignty would bring conflicts among the population as well. He did not believe that a sovereign had to win over people if absolute power was taken for granted. In other words, if a sovereign has total power, then he does not need to use any other methods other than force to rule over the people. Since Hobbes believed that a state was the most important part of society (because it protected the individuals from eliminating each other and therefore preventing the destruction of society itself) he believed that individuals should give up their power in order for the state to regulate all aspects of personal lives if needs be in order to protect the majority of the people.

The liberals believed that the state which governs the least is the one which governs best. Since they believed that individuals have a good amount of virtue, they believed that states should exist to protect only the most fundamental rights since humans have the capacity to govern themselves in a fair manner. Locke believed that the state should be created to serve humans by protecting them from harm and to protect the private property they want to accumulate. Smith also argued for a limited state; he argued that the free market in a capitalist system would be enough to regulate most of the distribution of wealth within a population (though he did believe that a state was necessary to maintain infrastructure such as schools and certain forms of transportation).

Marx believed that the the different structures of the state systems throughout history have allowed for inequality and class conflict. Therefore, he believed that the state would not be necessary after capitalism had been overthrown. He believed that the current state supports the capitalist system which perpetuates the exploitation of workers by their employers. He believed that a revolution by the proletariat was required in order to set up a new socialist government which would organize the necessary social and technical infrastructure built by capitalism to advance to the communist utopia. Therefore, even though he argued against the capitalist system, he believed that the capitalist state is a necessary institution before the creation of the socialist state and eventually the communist utopia can begin.

===Private Property===
----
The idea of private property is regarded differently by the various political economists. Private property had not been an important part of the law of the state before the time of Machiavelli. Machiavelli's writings was important because it acknowledged private property rights in a time when Europe's society was based on the agrarian form of production. Thomas Hobbes advocated a need for a sovereign with total power in order to create a society where people's lives would be protected so they could be allowed to accumulate property.

In the European mercantilist society, the idea of the accumulation of private property developed further. As people started to dwell in towns and cities, the protection of property within a space of denser population was needed, so the state intervened in the market as well as in the distribution of wealth. States sanctioned their own monopolies and granted licenses to guilds in order to control the means of production as well as the flow of capital. In feudal society, people did not accumulate private property because the resources that came out of the land by the labor of the serfs went to lords and kings, who provided protection. Now, the state sanctioned limited markets and controlled the means of production to provide a limited supply of commodities for individuals. Now, people could buy products that had been provided with the control of the government.

Liberals wanted even more for the individual. Locke argued that &quot;life, liberty, and property&quot; should be protected by the formation of states. He saw the individual as the most important actor within a society, and he believed that the state should serve the interests of the individual, which are &quot;life, liberty, and property.&quot; Therefore, these three parts to life are the most important, worthy of the state's protection. Smith also believed that the accumulation of property is essentially good. Due to the desires of the people to accumulate certain commodities, they would regulate the free market with the invisible hand, thereby controlling production and consumption by just following their human desires.

Marxists see private ownership of the Means of Production as unnecessary once inequality has been destroyed. The accumulation of private property and capital is what drives capitalism. Since capitalists need to compete in order to keep making profits, they must choose to accumulate capital in order to live as capitalists (otherwise, they will end up as workers themselves). It is the desire for private property itself that drives the capitalist system, and therefore must be abolished in the communist utopia. Marx did not necessarily advocate the state to actively intervene in order to remove the private property, but he believed that individuals would naturally see private property as unnecessary once the division of labor (and therefore inequality) has been eliminated.

== Continent? ==

America is a continent, South America is just part of it.  At least that's how we learn it in Brazil.  Is it taught differntly in other countries?  [[User:200.158.46.13|200.158.46.13]] 00:53, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:most of the world says that there are seven continents; Europe, Asia, Australia, Antarctica, Africa, South America, and North America. HOWEVER almost everyone in south and north america, says that there are only six continents. And since the name of this wikijuniour book is South America, i guess we have litle choice but to use the seven continents. Geologicaly, they are very different, and in a few bajillion years wont be touching each other. But really the whole continent idea is pretty stupid, since its a mashing together of geological boundries and political boundries (europe and asia are a good example) [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 01:08, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)
::I put the following info box about continents into the article (after the first paragraph), but it was screwing up the contents, anyone who thinks they know how to put it in with out breaking everyting have a go. remember if you screw up, we can always revert.

==== Continents ====
A continent is a large mass of land, sorounded by water. Some people think that there are seven continents, while others think there are only six, or even five. The seven basic continents are; '''Africa''', '''Antarctica''', '''Asia''', '''Australia''', '''Europe''', '''North America''', and '''South America'''. However many people belive that North and South America are parts of one bigger continent called ''The Americas'' while others believe that Europe and Asia are actually just part of a bigger continent call ''Eurasia''.
&lt;/div&gt;

::: I'm in North America- I was always taught they were seperate continents. Didn't realize anyone else thought they weren't. [[User:68.85.91.55|68.85.91.55]] 02:45, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC) and that would be me [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 02:46, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:::: do you live in Canada or the US? I'm preety sure the US teaches it as the americas, but canada because its part of the commonwealth might teach it as north and south. I dunno. Does anyone have any objections to it being written as two continents, with a clarification in the info box (if anyone manages to work out how to put the damn thing in with out fucking up the contents)? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 00:20, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)
::::: I'm in the US, always taught them as being seperate. Clarification is fine, even good. You learn new things, good to teach the kids ;) [[User:68.85.91.55|68.85.91.55]] 04:42, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== translations ==

What do people think of the translations box? add in more english words if you think they are necessary, and ill try and fill in the translations. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 01:11, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:Yo y'all, i was just wondering if we should include french and dutch into the translation box. I know  nothing of those languages, so someone else would have to do the translations. what do others think? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 23:56, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I have only studied Quechua 1 year, but I have learned different ways to say most of those things... I'm learning Qusqu dialect.  These phrases must be from another, I don't doubt that they're correct.  I'll add my versions, feel free to to remove if it is too confusing...but really my teacher never says several of these (she is a native speaker of course).

== Europeans ==


The &quot;Europeans&quot; section states that Iberians were the first colonizers.  This is not entirely true; the French first colonized French Guyana as early as 1604.  Guyana was first colonized by the Dutch in 1616 (Essequibo), and then later the British; indeed it is one of the few pockets of non-iberian heritage, still speaking English.  The French and Dutch both set up early colonies in Brazil, in 1555 and 1630 respectively, but failed.  Suriname was first colonized by English, and then the Dutch.  I think that covers about all of the non-Iberian early settlement.  What do you think?     --[[User:Dmcdevit|Dmcdevit]] 03:23, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== The Incas are dead ==

In the part where we talk about the indigenous people, the Incas are mentioned as the most famous ones.  In fact, &quot;Inca&quot; was the name given only to the rulers of the empire.  This means that someone &quot;plebeian&quot; was not an Inca.  Furthermore, the Incas are considered long dead, regardless of who you are referring to, royalty or not.  I think we should either change the paragraph to be in the past tense or talk about the descendants of the Incas, but the latter I think would be too confusing for the kids.  --[[User:Arca|Arca]] 23:01, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Control flow statements ==
Usually a program is not a linear sequence of instructions. It may repeat code or take decisions for a given path-goal relation. Most programming languages have '''control flow''' statements (constructs) which provide some sort of control structures that serve to specify order to what has to be done to perform our program that allow variations in this sequential order:
* statements may only be obeyed under certain conditions (conditionals),
* statements may be obeyed repeatedly under certain conditions (loops),
* a group of remote statements may be obeyed (subroutines).

;Logical Expressions as conditions : Logical expressions can use logical operators in loops and conditional statements as part of the conditions to be met.

===Exceptional and unstructured control flow===
Some instructions have no particular structure but will have an exceptional usefulness in shaping how other control flow statements are structured, a special care must be taken to prevent unstructured and confusing programming.

====break====
A '''break''' will force the exiting of the present loop iteration into the next statement outside of the loop. It has no usefulness outside of a loop structure except for the '''switch''' control statement.

====continue====
The '''continue''' instruction is used inside loops where it will stop the current loop iteration, initiating the next one.

==== {{C++ Programming/kw|goto}} ====
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/goto}}

====abort(), exit() and atexit()====
As we will see later the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library|Standard C Library]] that is included in C++ also supplies some useful functions that can alter the flow control. Some will permit you to terminate the execution of a program, enabling you to set up a return value or initiate special tasks upon the termination request. You will have to jump ahead into the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/abort|abort()]] - [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/exit|exit()]] - [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/atexit|atexit()]] sections for more information.

=== Conditionals ===
There is likely no meaningful program written in which a computer does not demonstrate basic decision-making skills based upon certain set conditions. It can actually be argued that there is no meaningful human activity in which no decision-making, instinctual or otherwise, takes place. For example, when driving a car and approaching a traffic light, one does not think, &quot;I will continue driving through the intersection.&quot; Rather, one thinks, &quot;I will stop if the light is red, go if the light is green, and if yellow go only if I am traveling at a certain speed a certain distance from the intersection.&quot; These kinds of processes can be simulated using conditionals.

A conditional is a statement that instructs the computer to execute a certain block of code or alter certain data only if a specific condition has been met.

The most common conditional is the if-else statement, with conditional expressions and switch-case statements typically used as more shorthanded methods.

==== if (Fork branching) ====
The if-statement allows one possible path choice depending on the specified conditions.

'''Syntax'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (condition)
{
  statement;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Semantic'''

First, the condition is evaluated:
*if ''condition'' is true, ''statement'' is executed before continuing with the body.
*if ''condition'' is false, the program skips ''statement'' and continues with the rest of the program.

{{NOTE|The condition in an '''if''' statement can be any code that resolves in any expression that will evaluate to either a boolean, or a null/non-null value; you can declare variables, nest statements, etc. This is true to other flow control conditionals (ie: while), but is generally regarded as bad style, since it only benefit is ease of typing by making the code less readable.

This characteristic can easily lead simple errors, like tipping &lt;nowiki&gt;a=b&lt;/nowiki&gt; (assign a value) in place of a &lt;nowiki&gt;a==b&lt;/nowiki&gt; (condition). This has resulted in the adoption of a coding practice that would automatically put the errors in evidence, by inverting the expression (or using constant variables) the compiler will generate an error.

Recent compilers support the detection of such events and generate compilation warnings.}}

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if(condition)
{
  int x; // Valid code
  for(x = 0; x &lt; 10; ++x) // Also valid.
    {
      statement;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Ficondforless10.svg|center|flowchart from the example]]

{{NOTE|If you wish to avoid typing std::cout, std::cin, or std::endl; all the time, you may include
'''using''' '''namespace''' std at the beginning of your program since cout, cin, and endl are members of the ''std'' namespace.}}

Sometimes the program needs to choose one of two possible paths depending on a condition. For this we can use the if-else statement.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (user_age &lt; 18)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;People under the age of 18 are not allowed.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
else
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Welcome to Caesar's Casino!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we display a message if the user is under 18. Otherwise, we let the user in. The if part is executed only if 'user_age' is less than 18. In other cases (when 'user_age' is greater than or equal to 18), the else part is executed.

if conditional statements may be chained together to make for more complex condition branching. In this example we expand the previous example by also checking if the user is above 64 and display another message if so.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (user_age &lt; 18)
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;People under the age of 18 are not allowed.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
else if (user_age &gt; 64)
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Welcome to Caesar's Casino! Senior Citizens get 50% off.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
else
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Welcome to Caesar's Casino!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Elseifage.svg|center|flowchart from the example]]

{{NOTE|
*'''break''' and '''continue''' do not have any relevance to an '''if''' or '''else'''.
*Although you can use multiple '''else if''' statements, when handling many related conditions it is recommended that you use the '''switch''' statement, which we will be discussing next.}}

==== switch (Multiple branching) ====
The switch statement branches based on specific integer values. 

 '''switch''' (''integer expression'') {
     '''case''' ''label1'':
          ''statement(s)''
          '''break''';
     '''case''' ''label2'':
          ''statement(s)''
          '''break''';
     /* ... */
     '''default''':
          ''statement(s)''
 }

As you can see in the above scheme the case and default have a &quot;break;&quot; statement at the end of block.
This expression will cause the program to exit from the switch, if break is not added the program will continue 
execute the code in other cases even when the integer expression is not equal to that case. This can
be exploited in some cases as seen in the next example.

We want to separate an input from digit to other characters.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 char ch = cin.get(); //get the character
 switch (ch) {
     case '0': 
          // do nothing fall into case 1
     case '1': 
         // do nothing fall into case 2
     case '2': 
        // do nothing fall into case 3
     /* ... */
     case '8': 
        // do nothing fall into case 9
     case '9':  
          std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Digit&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; //print into stream out
          break;
     default:
          std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Non digit&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; //print into stream out
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In this small piece of code for each digit below '9' it will propagate through the cases until it will reach case '9'
and print &quot;digit&quot;.

If not it will go straight to the default case there it will print &quot;Non digit&quot;

{{NOTE|note=
* Be sure to use '''break''' commands unless you want multiple conditions to have the same action. Otherwise, it will &quot;fall through&quot; to the next set of commands.
* '''break''' can only break out of the innermost level. If for example you are inside a '''switch''' and need to break out of a enclosing {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} loop you might well consider adding a boolean as a flag, and check the flag after the '''switch''' block instead of the alternatives available. (Though even then, refactoring the code into a separate function and returning from that function might be cleaner depending on the situation, and with inline functions and/or smart compilers there need not be any runtime overhead from doing so.)
* '''continue''' is not relevant to '''switch''' block. Calling '''continue''' within a '''switch''' block will lead to the &quot;continue&quot; of the loop which wraps the '''switch''' block.
}}

=== Loops (iterations) ===
A loop (also referred to as an iteration or repetition) is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be carried out several times in succession. The code &quot;inside&quot; the loop (the ''body'' of the loop) is obeyed a specified number of times, or once for each of a collection of items, or until some condition is met.

[[w:iteration|Iteration]] is the repetition of a process, typically within a computer program. Confusingly, it can be used both as a general term, synonymous with repetition, and to describe a specific form of repetition with a [[w:Mutable object|mutable]] state.

When used in the first sense, [[w:Recursion|recursion]] is an example of iteration.

However, when used in the second (more restricted) sense, iteration describes the style of programming used in imperative programming languages. This contrasts with recursion, which has a more declarative approach.

Due to the nature of C++ there may lead to an even bigger problems when differentiating the use of the word, so to simplify things use &quot;'''loops'''&quot; to refer to simple recursions as described in this section and use ''iteration'' or [[w:iterator|''iterator'']] (the &quot;one&quot; that performs an ''iteration'') to class ''iterator'' (or in relation to objects/classes) as used in the STL.    

;'''Infinite Loops'''
Sometimes it is desirable for a program to loop forever, or until an exceptional condition such as an error arises. For instance, an event-driven program may be intended to loop forever handling events as they occur, only stopping when the process is killed by the operator.

More often, an infinite loop is due to a programming error in a condition-controlled loop, wherein the loop condition is never changed within the loop. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// as we will see, these are infinite loops...
while (1) { }

// or

for (;;) { }
&lt;/source&gt;


{{NOTE|When the compiler optimizes the source code, all statement after the detected infinite loop (that will never run), will be ignored. A compiler warning is generally given on detecting such cases.}}

;'''Condition-controlled loops'''
Most programming languages have constructions for repeating a loop until some condition changes.

Condition-controlled loops are divided into two categories Preconditional or Entry-Condition that place the test at the start of the loop, and Postconditional or Exit-Condition iteration that have the test at the end of the loop.  In the former case the body may be skipped completely, while in the latter case the body is always executed at least once.

In the condition controlled loops, the keywords ''break'' and ''continue'' take significance.  The break keyword causes an exit from the loop, proceeding with the rest of the program.  The ''continue'' keyword terminates the current iteration of the loop, the loop proceeds to the next iteration.

==== while (Preconditional loop) ====

'''Syntax'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
while (''condition'') ''statement''; ''statement2'';
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Semantic'''
First, the condition is evaluated:&lt;br/&gt;
#if ''condition'' is true, ''statement'' is executed and ''condition'' is evaluated again.
#if ''condition'' is false continues with ''statement2'' 
'''Remark''': ''statement''  can be a block of code { ... } with several instructions.

What makes 'while' statements different from the 'if' is the fact that once the body (referred to as ''statement'' above) is executed, it will go back to 'while' and check the condition again. If it is true, it is executed again. In fact, it will execute as many times as it has to until the expression is false.

'''Example 1'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int main() 
{
  int i=0;
  while (i&lt;10) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The value of i is &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
    i++;
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The final value of i is : &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Execution'''
  The value of i is 0
  The value of i is 1
  The value of i is 2
  The value of i is 3
  The value of i is 4
  The value of i is 5
  The value of i is 6
  The value of i is 7
  The value of i is 8
  The value of i is 9
  The final value of i is 10

'''Example 2'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// validation of an input
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int main() 
{
  int a;
  bool ok=false;
  while (!ok) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Type an integer from 0 to 20 : &quot;;
    cin &gt;&gt; a;
    ok = ((a&gt;=0) &amp;&amp; (a&lt;=20));
    if (!ok) cout &lt;&lt; &quot;ERROR - &quot;;
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Execution'''
  Type an integer from 0 to 20 : 30
  ERROR - Type an integer from 0 to 20 : 40
  ERROR - Type an integer from 0 to 20 : -6
  ERROR - Type an integer from 0 to 20 : 14

==== do-while (Postconditional loop) ====
'''Syntax'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
do {
  statement(s)
} while (condition);
 
statement2;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Semantic'''
#''statement(s)'' are executed.
#''condition'' is evaluated.
#if ''condition'' is true goes to 1).
#if ''condition'' is false continues with ''statement2''

The do - while loop is similar in syntax and purpose to the while loop. The construct moves the test that continues condition of the loop to the end of the code block so that the code block is executed at least once before any evaluation.

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;
 
int main() 
{
  int i=0;

  do {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The value of i is &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
    i++;
  } while (i&lt;10);

  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The final value of i is : &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Execution'''
 The value of i is 0
 The value of i is 1
 The value of i is 2
 The value of i is 3
 The value of i is 4
 The value of i is 5
 The value of i is 6
 The value of i is 7
 The value of i is 8
 The value of i is 9
 The final value of i is 10

=== gzip ===

'''gzip''' compresses files. Each single file is compressed into a single file. The compressed file consists of a GNU zip header and deflated data.

If given a file as an argument, gzip compresses the file, adds a &quot;.gz&quot; suffix, and deletes the original file. With no arguments, gzip compresses the standard input and writes the compressed file to standard output.

Some useful options are:

 -c  Write compressed file to stdout. Do not delete original file.
 -d  Act like [[#gunzip|gunzip]].
 -1  Performance: Use fast compression (somewhat bigger result)
 -9  Performance: Use best compression (somewhat slower)

''Examples:''

Compress the file named &lt;tt&gt;README&lt;/tt&gt;. Creates &lt;tt&gt;README.gz&lt;/tt&gt; and deletes &lt;tt&gt;README&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ '''gzip README'''

Compress the file called &lt;tt&gt;README&lt;/tt&gt;. The standard output (which is the compressed file) is redirected by the shell to &lt;tt&gt;gzips/README.gz&lt;/tt&gt;. Keeps &lt;tt&gt;README&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ '''gzip -c README &gt; gzips/README.gz'''

Use gzip without arguments to compress &lt;tt&gt;README&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ '''&lt; README gzip &gt; gzips/README.gz'''

===gunzip===
'''gunzip''' uncompresses a file that was compressed with &quot;gzip&quot; or &quot;compress&quot;. It tries to handle both the GNU zip format of gzip and the older Unix compress format. It does this by recognizing the extension (&quot;.gz&quot; or &quot;.Z&quot; or several others) of a file.

Some useful options are:

 -c  Write uncompressed data to stdout. Do not delete original file.

Undo the effect of &lt;tt&gt;'''gzip README.gz'''&lt;/tt&gt; by replacing the compressed version of the file with the original, uncompressed version. Creates &lt;tt&gt;README&lt;/tt&gt; and deletes &lt;tt&gt;README.gz&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ '''gunzip README.gz'''

Write the uncompressed contents of &lt;tt&gt;README.gz&lt;/tt&gt; to standard output. Pipe it into a pager for easy reading of a compressed file.
 $ '''gunzip -c README.gz | more'''

Another way to do that is:
 $ '''gunzip &lt; README.gz | more'''

Some people name files &lt;tt&gt;package.tgz&lt;/tt&gt; as short for &lt;tt&gt;package.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt;.

===zcat===
'''zcat''' is same thing as &lt;tt&gt;'''uncompress -c'''&lt;/tt&gt;, though on many systems it is actually same as &quot;gzcat&quot; and &lt;tt&gt;'''gunzip -c'''&lt;/tt&gt;.

===gzcat===
'''gzcat''' is same as &lt;tt&gt;'''gunzip -c'''&lt;/tt&gt; which is &lt;tt&gt;'''gzip -dc'''&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== tar ===
'''tar''' archives without compression.

An archive contains one or more files or directories. (If archiving multiple files, it might be better to put them in one directory, so extracting will put the files into their own directory.)

{{Warning|Options to '''tar''' are confusing. Specify a mode every time.}}

Modes:
 -c  create an archive (files to archive, archive from files)
 -x  extract an archive (archive to files, files from archive)

Options:
 -f FILE  name of archive - ''must specify unless using tape drive for archive''
 -v       be verbose, list all files being archived/extracted
 -z       create/extract archive with [[#gzip|gzip]]/[[#gunzip|gunzip]]
 -j       create/extract archive with [[#bzip2|bzip2]]/[[#bunzip2|bunzip2]]
 -J       create/extract archive with XZ


''Examples:''

Compress (gzip) and package (tar) the directory &lt;tt&gt;myfiles&lt;/tt&gt; to create &lt;tt&gt;myfiles.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''tar -czvf myfiles.tar.gz myfiles'''

Uncompress (gzip) and unpack compressed package, extracting contents from &lt;tt&gt;myfiles&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''tar -xzvf myfiles.tar.gz'''

There are two different conventions concerning gzipped tarballs. One often encounters .tar.gz. The other popular choice is .tgz. Slackware packages use the latter convention.

If you have access to a tape device or other backup medium, then you can use it instead of an archive file. If the material to be archived exceeds the capacity of the backup medium, the program will prompt the user to insert a new tape or diskette.

Use the following command to back up the &lt;tt&gt;myfiles&lt;/tt&gt; directory to floppies:
 $ '''tar -cvf /dev/fd0 myfiles'''

Restore that backup with:
 $ '''tar -xvf /dev/fd0'''

You can also specify standard input or output &lt;tt&gt;'''-f -'''&lt;/tt&gt; instead of an archive file or device. It is possible to use copy between directories by piping two &quot;tar&quot; commands together. For example, suppose we have two directories, &lt;tt&gt;from-stuff&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;to-stuff&lt;/tt&gt;

 $ '''ls -F'''
 from-stuff/
 to-stuff/

As described in ''Running Linux'', one can mirror everything from &lt;tt&gt;from-stuff&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;to-stuff&lt;/tt&gt; this way:
 $ '''tar cf - . | (cd ../to-stuff; tar xvf -)'''

===cpio===
'''cpio''' is used for creating archives.  When creating an archive, a list of files is fed to its standard-input (rather than specifying the files on the commandline).  This file-list is typically created by '''ls''', '''find''' or '''locate''' and then piped directly to '''cpio'''; but it can also first be filtered/edited with commands like '''*grep''', '''sed''', '''sort''' and others.  A (pre-edited) list stored as a file can also be used, by using '''cat''' to feed the pipeline or simply by redirecting the shell's standard-input (&lt;).

'''cpio''' works in one of three modes:
* '''cpio -o''' - ''Copy-Out mode'': Files are copied '''out''' from the filesystem to ''create'' an archive.  Usually the archive is created by simply using the shell to redirect cpio's output to a file (with '''&gt;''').
* '''cpio -i''' - ''Copy-In mode'': Files from an existing archive are ''restored/extracted'', and copied back '''in''' to the filesystem.
* '''cpio -p''' - ''Pass-Through mode'': '''cpio''' is used to copy files from one location in the directory-tree to another, without an actual archiving being made.

In addition comes:
* '''cpio -t''' - ''List archive'': The content of an archive is listed without extracting it.
* '''cpio -tv''' - Here the verbose-option ('''-v''') will cause a &quot;long listing&quot;, with permissions, size and ownership.

Adding the verbose-option ('''-v''') in Copy-In, Copy-Out and Pass-Through mode, will cause '''cpio''' to list the files as they're extracted/archived/copied.

Using '''ls''' to create an archive (verbosely) with all doc-files in the current directory:
 $ '''ls *.doc | cpio -ov &gt; word-docs.cpio'''

Using '''find''' to create an archive with all txt-files in and below the current directory:
 $ '''find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot; | cpio -ov &gt; text-files.cpio'''

Using '''find''' and '''fgrep''' to create an archive of just the txt-files containing the word ''wiki'' (any case):
 $ '''find . -name &quot;*.txt&quot; -exec fgrep -l -i &quot;wiki&quot; {} \; | cpio -ov &gt; wiki.cpio'''
For '''fgrep''' the option '''-i''' means &quot;ignore case&quot;, and the option '''-l''' cause it to just list the filenames of files matching the pattern.

Using an existing list of files:
 $ '''cpio -ov &lt; file-list.txt &gt; archive.cpio'''

Using several list of files, but first after '''sort'''-ing and '''uniq'''-ing them:
 $ '''cat files1 files2 files3 | sort | uniq | cpio -ov &gt; myfiles.cpio'''

To add more files, use the append-option ('''-A''').  Specify the file with the file-option ('''-F'''):
 $ '''cat files4 | cpio -ovA -F myfiles.cpio'''

To extract files (being verbose):
 $ '''cpio -iv &lt; myfiles.cpio'''

'''cpio''' doesn't create directories by default, so use the option '''-d''' to make it.

To extract files, while creating directories as needed:
 $ '''cpio -ivd &lt; myfiles.cpio'''

To list the content of an archive, short listing:
 $ '''cpio -t &lt; myfiles.cpio'''

To list the content of an archive, long listing:
 $ '''cpio -tv &lt; myfiles.cpio'''

===pax===
'''pax''' is like &quot;tar&quot; but with different command-line syntax. Because &quot;pax&quot; does not assume the tape device, some prefer it to &quot;tar&quot;.

{{Guide to Unix:stub}}

=== bzip2 ===
'''bzip2''' and '''bunzip2''' are similar to &quot;gzip&quot;/&quot;gunzip&quot; but with a different compression method. Compression is generally better but slower than &quot;gzip&quot;. Decompression is somewhat fast.

An option of ''-1'' through ''-9'' can be used to specify how good '''bzip2''' should compress.  The number tells how large &quot;chunks&quot; in steps of 100kB should compress at a time, so using '''&lt;tt&gt;bzip2 -5 foo.bar&lt;/tt&gt;''' will compress foo.bar in chunks of 500kB each.  Generally, larger chunks means better compression (but probably slower).  Only ''undamged'' &quot;chunks&quot; can be recovered with '''&lt;tt&gt;bzip2recover&lt;/tt&gt;''' from a damaged bzip2-file, so if you've compressed 900kB chunks, you'll loose 900kB of your file if one chunk is damaged - but only 100kB if you used 100kB chunks (&lt;tt&gt;bzip2 -1&lt;/tt&gt;).  By default '''bzip2''' uses 900kB chunks for best possible compression.

'''bzcat''' is same as '''&lt;tt&gt;bunzip2 -c&lt;/tt&gt;''' which is '''&lt;tt&gt;bzip2 -dc&lt;/tt&gt;'''.

=== zip ===
'''zip''' is an archive which compresses the members individually. (Imagine gzip of every file before tar-ing them, but with a different format.) The &quot;zip&quot; format is a common archiving file format used on Microsoft Windows PCs.

Like for ''gzip'' the quality of the compression can be specified by giving a number between 1 and 9 as an option (e.g. '''&lt;tt&gt;zip -5&lt;/tt&gt;''').  1 is quickest, but gives a low-quality compression.  9 gives the highest quality of compression, but is slow.  In addition 0 can be used (i.e. '''&lt;tt&gt;zip -0&lt;/tt&gt;''') to specify that the files should just be &quot;stored&quot; and ''not'' compressed (a compression of 0%), thus making it possible to use '''zip''' to make uncompressed archives.

Note that a '''zip'''-archive contains ''individualy compressed'' files collected into a single file.  This is the opposite of how it's done for most other compressed ''Unix''-archives (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tar.bz2&lt;/tt&gt;), where the files/directories are ''first'' collected into a single file -- an archive (e.g. '''cpio''' or '''tar'''), and ''then'' this ''single file'' is compressed (e.g. using '''gzip''' or '''bzip2''').

=== compress ===
'''compress''' is a compressed file format that is popular on UNIX systems.  Files compressed with '''compress''' will have a &quot;.Z&quot; extension appended to its name.

== FAQ Section ==
Another good idea might be to start adding an FAQ section to the book for commonly encountered issues, possibly structured in a fashion reflecting the books original structure - --[[Special:Contributions/82.83.125.250|82.83.125.250]] ([[User talk:82.83.125.250|talk]]) 23:08, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

== Other discussion pages ==

These are open discussion pages about specific chapters:
{{Special:Prefixindex/Talk:Ada Programming/}}

== Language Features ==

Before you introduce control structures, maybe we should learn how to declare and use variables and do some basic math. Then we can understand more interesting examples for the control structures section. --[[Special:Contributions/139.19.14.55|139.19.14.55]] ([[User talk:139.19.14.55|discuss]])

== move or rename 'Other Language Libraries' ==

Before I added Ada Programming/Libraries/SAL, I looked thru the Ada Programming main page, looking for &quot;External Libraries&quot;. I didn't see it; later I learned it was &quot;Other Language Libraries&quot;. 

I think the name &quot;Other Language Libraries&quot; is confusing; I took it to mean &quot;libraries defined in the Ada standard that are not been discussed above&quot;.

I suggest moving that section to External Resources or External Links (another source of confusion!). Or at least renaming it to External Libraries.
[[User:Stephen leake|Stephen leake]] ([[User talk:Stephen leake|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stephen leake|contribs]]) 07:42, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

:I agree entirely about the rename and so I have already edited the text in that way; but I'm not sure about the move, because it would unmatch the subpage structure since all these libraries (predefined and external) hang from [[Ada Programming/Libraries]]. Let's wait for a third opinion. -- [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ManuelGR|contribs]]) 21:23, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

::I Strongly agree. I suggest just dropping the word &quot;Language&quot;, so that have we &quot;Predefined Libraries&quot; and &quot;Other Libraries&quot; in [[Ada_Programming/Libraries]]. What's a &quot;language library&quot;, anyway? Dropping one noun also rids us of two of them in a row, and removes ambiguity of the adjectives' references. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] ([[User talk:GeorgBauhaus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GeorgBauhaus|contribs]]) 11:50, 17 August 2013 (UTC)

== Broken external links in the book ==

In order to maintain the book with current external links, I have used the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikipediabot/weblinkchecker.py pywikipediaboot] for finding broken links. This is the current list. If you know or can find a new working link for the information, please contribute by editing the page and then remove the line from this list so others know what work has been done and what is still pending.

== Readability: Law of Least Astonishment ==

Personally I think the reference to the [[w:Law of Least Astonishment]] is irrelevant, and that that so called &quot;law&quot; is stupid nonsense, so the reference is not necessary. The section explains that the Ada is designed so that the code should be self-explained, while the ridiculous &quot;law&quot; refers to a polity of &quot;best to follow common assumptions of how things gonna work&quot;, which, if followed here, means that Ada would be a gullwing language of typeless anarchy and no clue. Luckily this isn't the case, so Ada is not a language of &quot;least astonishment&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Key Length ==

Key length is directly proportional to security.  In modern cryptosystems, key length is measured in bits (i.e., AES uses 256 bit keys), and each bit of a key increases the difficulty of a [[../Brute force attack|brute-force]] attack exponentially.  It is important to note that in addition to adding more security, each bit slows down the cryptosystem as well.  Because of this, key length -- like all things security -- is a tradeoff.  In this case between practicality and security.  

Furthermore, different types of cryptosystems require vastly different key lengths to maintain security.  For instance, [[w:modulo|modulo]]-based public key systems such as [[../Diffie-Hellman/]] and [[../RSA/]] require rather long keys (generally around 1,024 bits), whereas symmetric systems, both block and stream, are able to use shorter keys (generally around 256 bits).  Furthermore, elliptic curve public key systems are capable of maintaining security at key lengths similar to those of symmetric systems.  While most block ciphers will only use one key length, most public key systems can use any number of key lengths.

As an illustration of relying on different key lengths for the same level of security, modern implementations of public key systems (see [[../GPG/]] and [[../PGP/]]) give the user a choice of keylengths.  Usually ranging between 768 and 4,096 bits.  These implementations use the public key system (generally either [[../RSA/]] or [[../ElGamal/]]) to encrypt a randomly generated block-cipher key (128 to 256 bits) which was used to encrypt the actual message.

== Entropy ==

Equal to the importance of key length, is information entropy.  Entropy, defined generally as &quot;a measure of the disorder of a system&quot; has a similar meaning in this sense: if all of the bits of a key are not securely generated and equally random (whether truly random or the result of a cryptographically secure PRNG operation), then the system is much more vulnerable to attack.  For example, if a 128 bit key only has 64 bits of entropy, then the effective length of the key is 64 bits.  This can be seen in the [[../DES/]] algorithm.  DES actually has a key length of 64 bits, however 8 bits are used for parity, therefore the effective key length is 56 bits.

== Common Mistakes ==

&lt;s&gt;
{{confusing}}
The fundamental deficiency in advantages of long block cipher keys when compare it to short cipher keys could be in difficulties to screening physical random entropy in short digits. Perhaps we can't store screening mechanism of randomness in secret, so we can't get randomness of entropy 2^256 without energy, which will be liner to appropriate entropy. For example, typical mistake of random generator implementation is simple addiction of individual digits with probability 0.5. This generator could be easy broken by bruteforce by neighbor bits wave functions. In this point of view, using block ciphers with large amount of digits, for ex. 10^1024 and more have a practical sense.
{{Citation needed|reason=this entire paragraph seems misleading or incorrect.}}
&lt;/s&gt;

Other typical mistake is using public key infrastructure to encrypt session keys, because in this key more preferable to use Diffie-Hellman  algorithm.
Using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to create session keys gives &quot;forward secrecy&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Game Theory might be better described as Strategy Theory, or Theory of Interactive Decision Making. A ''strategic situation'' involves two or more interacting players who make decisions while trying to anticipate the actions and reactions by others. Game theory studies the ''general principles'' that explain how people and organizations act in strategic situations. 

Game theory studies strategy mainly through the analysis of different &quot;games&quot;. A &quot;game&quot; in game theory is a fully explicit structure within which players (agents) act strategically to maximize personal Utility. Games provide a simplified world within which to study strategy (as opposed to the real world where complexities get in the way of developing general principles).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this game the players want to cooperate with each other, but they disagree about the best outcome for the game.

Two friends want to meet but disagree on the venue.  One prefers to watching boxing while the other prefers ballet.  However, if they show up at different sites, they will be unhappy without the other.  We can model this game as a two player strategic game:
{{bimatrix| s1=Boxing | s2=Ballet | u11=(2,1) | u12=(0,0) | u21=(0,0) | u22=(1,2)}}

The table clearly shows that the best choice for the two friends is to both play the same game since neither of them will be happy without the other. The only question left is which game to play.

This game is also known as ''Bach or Stravinsky''. For a modern-day equivalent, let the two choices be the online multi-player game sites ''EverQuest'' and ''Starcraft''.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]

'''Cottage pie''', also known as '''shepherd's pie''', is a British meat pie with a mashed potato top. It is traditionally made with leftover roast meat, but today it is more often made with fresh minced or ground meat, most commonly lamb. When made with beef, it is more commonly known as cottage pie (see below).

==Ingredients==
*30g (1 oz) [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] (optional)
*1[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (450[[Cookbook:g|g]]) [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] or ground [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] or [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*3 lb (1.3[[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) powdery old [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], such as King Edwards
*1 large or 2 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2 tbsp flour
*2 cups / 300ml [[Cookbook:Stock|beef stock]] (alternatively, [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon cubes]] can be used, or gravy powder, if the flour is omitted)
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], grated (optional)
*a handful of mixed [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Cookbook:Corn|sweetcorn]] or [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Mixed Herbs|mixed herbs]]
*[[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
#Brown the mince in a frying pan. Depending on the fat content of the minced meat, there may be no need to add oil, as the meat is often fatty enough. 
#Finely chop the onion and lightly fry in a little butter until clear.
#Add the onions to the mince along with the mixed herbs and some pepper.
#Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir and cook for 3 - 4 minutes (if using gravy powder, omit this step).
#Cover with beef stock (or add water and beef bouillon/gravy powder) and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for 30 minutes.
#Meanwhile:
##Peel, chop and boil the potatoes for 20 minutes until cooked.
##Once the meat is cooked, skim off the excess fat, then boil rapidly to reduce the liquid until it just covers the mince and onions.
##Drain the potatoes very well until completely dry. Mash until smooth and free of any lumps.
##Add butter to the mashed potato, taste and adjust the seasoning. 
##Add enough milk to make the mash very soft (heavy mash will not float properly on top of the mince).
#Put mince mixture in a shallow oven proof dish.
#Spread the mash on top of the meat and brush the tops of the potatoes with melted butter.
#If desired, sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the mash.
#If cooking without cheese, spike the top with a fork – that is, rough up the surface of the mash by dragging a fork across it, as if ploughing a field.
#Cook in a hot oven for about 30-50 minutes until the top is golden brown.
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Legumes|peas or beans]], or other green vegetables.

== Notes ==
&lt;!-- References on naming are left to Wikipedia --&gt;
The dish was originally called &quot;cottage pie&quot;, dating to the 18th century, with &quot;shepherd's pie&quot; being introduced as a synonym in the late 19th century. The terms are often used interchangeably, regardless of meat, though some specify &quot;shepherd's pie&quot; if made with lamb, and &quot;cottage pie&quot; if made with beef.

== Tips and variations ==
* Adding the butter and milk to the potatoes before they are properly mashed is the best way to make ''lumpy'' mash.
* Roughing up the surface of the mash makes the top crispier, by increasing the surface area and providing thin sections which dry out and crisp faster; compare [[Cookbook:Roast Potatoes|roast potatoes]].
* Frying the meat in lard can improve the texture and consistency of the finished product, although this also has the effect of increasing drastically the saturated fat content.
* As with many dishes based on minced meat, the mince can be cooked for much longer in the stock than specified, up to two hours. Some cooks prefer this as it gives longer for the flavour to develop. People often comment that shepherd's pie tastes better when reheated the day after for this reason! A quicker alternative is to add a splash of [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce]] or [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce]], both of which act as flavour enhancers.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat_Recipes|Meat recipes]]

A '''hamburger''' is a variant on a [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]] involving a patty of ground [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], usually [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] (known in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] as a '''beefburger'''), or a [[Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine#Vegan_Patties|vegetarian patty]]. A slice of cheese on the patty makes it a cheeseburger, a common variation in the United States.

==Ingredients==
*500[[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*[[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|Herbs and spices]] (optional - see suggestions)
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] (optional - see suggestions)
*Salad ([[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]], [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], [[Cookbook:Alfalfa|alfalfa sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] etc. - optional)
*1 hamburger bun for each burger

==Procedure==
#Remove the ground beef from the package and shape by hand into burgers. You should get between 4-6 burgers from 500g (1.1 lb) of beef.
#If adding optional ingredients, either season the outside or mix into the beef before forming the patties. Overworking the beef will result in mushy meat that won't stick together, so only mix the minimum necessary and do so by hand.
#The burgers can be [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] or [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] for about 4-5 mins on each side for burgers which aren't too thick.
#Let the burger rest for several minutes before serving to let the juices cool down and not burst out at first bite.
#Ensure your burgers are fully cooked through before serving. If your burgers are quite thick or if you are unsure, you can cut one open to ensure the insides are browned. If the insides are red, there is a chance that the meat is not fully cooked. Alternately, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the burger, if the temperature reads less than 71°C (160°F), your burger is undercooked.
#Serve each burger on a bun ([[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seed]] usually), optionally with [[Cookbook:Relish|relish]], sliced [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]], [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]], [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Ranch Dressing|ranch dressing]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], lettuce, tomatoes and/or onions.

Some suggestions of what to add to the meat include: [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], onion flakes or a small onion, [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]], [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|worcestershire sauce]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], butter and/or 2 tsp of your favorite [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]] for some kick. The amounts of herbs and/or spices are up to your local taste and meat quality. Depending on the quality of your local beef, for example, you may wish to add some [[Cookbook:Stock|beef stock]] to improve the flavour. If you add any liquids, mix the ground beef well then squeeze out the extra juice when forming patties.

For further serving suggestions, see the [[w:Hamburger#Serving style|Wikipedia article on hamburgers]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Make sure to let the meat get to room temperature before putting on the grill or in the pan. This will help the burgers cook evenly and fully.
*You can use almost any type of minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat]] to make hamburgers, including [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Bison|bison]], [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]], [[Cookbook:Ostrich|ostrich]], or even a meat substitute such as [[Cookbook:Quorn|Quorn]].  Some variations of hamburgers call for mixing different types of meat (e.g. ground beef and ground pork).
*Do not add salt until right before you put the patty to cook. 
*Mixing ingredients in with the meat is purely optional. You can make a delicious burger by simply shaping patties and seasoning with kosher salt, ground pepper, and if you wish, some garlic powder and/or cayenne.
*If your burgers fall apart, adding an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] yolk will help keep it together. Buying lean ground beef will also help, although if the meat is too lean the burger may be excessively dry. Not mixing the ground meat in the first place will also ensure the patty's integrity.
*Try adding a pat of butter in the center of each burger for an excellent hamburger.
*You may wish to experiment with including cheese in the centre of your burger before cooking.
*Spices which can work well in hamburgers include [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]] (either fresh or powder), [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire Sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]. Experiment to find good combinations.
*Almost any herb can work, including [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] and [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].
*Some other things which are also sometimes added to hamburgers include: diced onions, bread crumbs, crushed saltine crackers.
*Burgers can also be [[Cookbook:Smoking|smoked]] on a grill. Smoked burgers will appear red and glazed on the outside, but browned on the inside. Smoking a burger before grilling it is an excellent way to seal in the flavorful juices.
*Adding meat and spices together in a bowl and mixing by hand until the spices are distributed may produce better results. This will also help to stop your burgers from falling apart.
*Some [[Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine#Vegan_Patties|vegan patties]] make excellent meat substitutes, especially for Hamburgers, where strong spices make the difference close to indistinguishable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like most sciences, Game theory is an attempt to model the world in a useful and objective way. The simplest model, the strategic game, is often a suitable analog for an analysis. Strategic games have three components: a [[Wikipedia:set|set]] of players, for each player a set of strategies, and additionally a payoff function indicating how desirable each game outcome is for the player.&lt;ref&gt;If a player has &quot;rational&quot; preferences as defined earlier and there are a finite number of possible game outcomes then we can always represent the preferences using a function.&lt;/ref&gt; The players in the game are the same as the players in the strategic model.  Each player plays the game based on the strategic preference of that particular player.  By giving each player a strategy, we get the outcome of the game.  In mathematical notation:

*Players: &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, \dots N\}&lt;/math&gt;

*Strategy sets: &lt;math&gt;\{S_1, S_2, \dots S_N\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible strategies for player ''i'' and we could denote a specific strategy in the set by &lt;math&gt;s_i \in S_i&lt;/math&gt;

*Payoffs: &lt;math&gt;\{u_1(\cdot), u_2(\cdot), \dots u_n(\cdot)\}&lt;/math&gt; where each function is defined over the whole outcome of the game (i.e. the chosen strategies for each player) &lt;math&gt;u_i(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N)&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition of Music==

In order to properly study music, we must have a working definition of what music is. Defining music is more difficult than it sounds. One has to distinguish between the well-known music of Mozart, the random noise of traffic, and the bizarre styles of contemporary music that might combine traffic and Mozart! 

A particularly good example of music that pushes the traditionally accepted boundary of music is ''4’33&quot;'' by John Cage. This piece consists of complete silence for four minutes and thirty-three seconds. The music of the piece is created by the audience in their shuffling, coughing, wondering what happened to the music, etc. 

A definition of music is an individual definition, but it must discern between random street noise and contemporary music, or between the ordered music of Haydn and the ordered sound of a speech. One good definition that might serve as a starting point for the reader is:
----
&lt;center&gt;'''Music is organized sound with musical intention.'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
First and foremost, music must have some sort of sound. Even in bizarre examples such as ''4'33&quot;'', there still is sound- it’s just not produced by the performer. This sound needs to have some sort of musical intention as well. A street corner produces noise, but there is no musical intention, so it is not music. The sound must also be organized in some manner. Otherwise, a composer could pronounce a street corner to be “music.” The composer must intervene at some point to control the sound. Though ''4’33”'' is comprised of randomly produced sounds by the audience, Cage exerts his control over the sound by limiting it to four minutes and thirty-three seconds. Also, as obvious as it might seem, the intention needs to have a 'musical' intention, not just an intention. Otherwise, a speech, which is organized sound with intention, would be considered music as well. Sound can only be music if someone wants it to be music.

==Elements of Sound==

The reason we can have music is because sounds can be different. There are three characteristics of sound that differentiate one sound from the next. These are:

*Pitch
*Timbre
*Dynamic

===Pitch===

Formally defined, '''pitch''' is the frequency of a sound wave. More loosely, it is the &quot;highness&quot; or &quot;lowness&quot; of a sound. This is what distinguishes an A from a B.

===Timbre===

'''Timbre''' is also called the “tone quality” or “tone color.” This is the characteristic of a sound that makes a piano sound different from a trumpet or violin, even when they all are playing at the same pitch. 

===Dynamic===

The formal definition of a '''dynamic''' is the amplitude of a sound wave. Loosely, this is how loud the sound is. 

==Elements of Music==

IB analyzes a piece of music using seven characteristics. These are:

*Melody
*Harmony
*Rhythm
*Form
*Texture
*Medium
*Context

===Melody===

'''Melody''' is the most difficult of the characteristics to define. While there is no good formal definition of &quot;melody,&quot; it is loosely, the “song of the song,” or the “hummable” part of a piece. A melody is comprised of multiple musical “sentences,” called '''phrases'''. These phrases are then made up of steps and leaps. '''Steps''' are short risings or fallings of the melody (e.g. an A to a B or an F to an E). '''Leaps''' are longer risings or fallings of the melody (e.g. an A to a C or an F to a D). 

[[image:Mary Had a Little Lamb.png|frame|center|The melody of Mary Had a Little Lamb]]

===Harmony===

'''Harmony''' is the chord structure of a piece that supports a melody. While a melody can stand on its own, harmonies cannot stand on their own- they are only support. At any given point, a harmony has varying degrees of consonance and dissonance. '''Dissonance''' is a stressful sound that feels a need to find resolution. '''Consonance''' is the resolution of the dissonance and therefore the release of stress. 

[[Image:Mary Had a Little Lamb Harmony.png|frame|center|A melody and harmony of Mary Had a Little Lamb]]

===Form===

The '''form''' of a piece is the overall structure it takes. For example, a piece might take the most common, ternary, form (ABA). In this form, a section of music will be played and a different section will follow it. After the second section is played, the piece returns to the original section of music and plays it over again. 

[[image:Bach Form Minuet.JPG|frame|center|This Bach Minuet is in ABA Form. One plays the A section, plays the B section, and in a traditional minuet, starts back at the beginning and plays the A section over again.]]

===Texture===

The texture of a piece refers to the layers of sound that are heard. There are three possible textures of a piece of music:

*Monophonic
*Homophonic
*Polyphonic

====Monophonic Texture====

'''Monophonic''' texture is a single, unaccompanied melodic line. 

[[image:Mary Melody.JPG|frame|center|This is Mary Had a Little Lamb with a monophonic texture]]

====Homophonic Texture====

'''Homophonic''' texture is a single melodic line that is accompanied by a harmony.

[[image:Mary Harmony.JPG|frame|center|This is Mary Had a Little Lamb with a homophonic texture]]

====Polyphonic Texture====

'''Polyphonic''' texture is a multiple melodic lines playing at the same time.

Some useful sites with short listening examples of the different types of textures http://gmajormusictheory.org/Listening/textures/textures.html
http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/music/musicalelements/texturerev1.shtml

===Medium===

'''Medium''' refers to the instruments that play a piece of music. If the piece being analyzed is a symphony, then the medium will be an orchestra. If the piece being analyzed is a violin sonata, then the medium will be a violin and a piano. To analyze the medium of a piece, one needs to have a strong understanding of the various commonly used instruments. Instruments to know are as follows: 

'''''Orchestral Instruments'''''

====Strings====
*Violin
*Viola
*Violoncello (abbr. Cello)
*Double Bass

====Woodwind====
*Piccolo
*Flute
*Oboe
*English Horn
*Bb(most common)Clarinet
*Bass Clarinet
*Bassoon

====Other, perhaps less used Woodwinds====
*(Contra) Bass Flute
*Oboe d'Amore
*Bass Oboe
*Contrabassoon
*Contrabass Clarinet
* Several Different Keys of Clarinet

====Brass====
*Cornet
*Bugle
*Trumpet
*French Horn
*Baritone
*Euphonium
*Trombone
*Tuba
*Sousaphone

====Percussion====
*Snare Drum
*Tympani
*Bass Drum
*Triangle
*Chimes
*Xylophone
*Marimba
*Glockenspiel

====Other Commonly Used Instruments====

'''Strings'''
*Harp
*Guitar
*Lute
*Harpsichord (Found in Baroque Music, predecessor to Piano)
*Piano (sometimes considered percussion)

'''Woodwind'''
*Saxophone (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Baritone, Bass, Double Bass, Contra Bass, Sub-Contra Bass)
*Recorder

===Context===

The '''context''' of a piece of music refers to the general time period of the work and external influences on the piece of music. E.g. the composer’s life, musical styles of the time, instruments of the period, political happenings, etc. There are six major musical periods we will study. In chronological order, these are:

*Medieval
*Renaissance
*Baroque
*Classical
*Romantic
*20th Century
&lt;br&gt;
----
These elements will be used throughout our study of music to analyze specific pieces. A good understanding of these elements aids one in writing the analysis essay because it provides a starting point for writing your essay.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;&lt;Back to [[Introduction to Game Theory]]

To model games in which the players take turns the extensive form can be used.  


We can define an extensive game as a tuple with four elements (P, S, F, U) where 
* P is a set of players.
* S is a set of sequences (terminal histories) with the property that no sequence is the proper subhistory of any other sequence
* F is a function (player function) that assigns a player to every move in a terminal history.
* U is a set of preferences over the set of terminal histories for each player.


Example (''The Entry game'')  An incumbent faces the possibility of entry by a challenger.  This can be an animal competing for the right to mate, a firm entering a new market currently controled by a monopoly, or a politician competing for party backing.  The challenger may choose enter or not.  If he enters, the incumbent may either acquiesce or fight.  For the challenger, he prefers to enter and have the incombent back down, and doesn't like to get into a fight.  The incumbent prefers the challenger to stay out, and also doesn't like to fight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter's purpose is to demonstrate hands-on spoken latin using dialogues, word lists, colloquial expressions and all that is needed to grasp spoken latin.

It is recommended that you cover all verb, adjective and noun endings and have read through the rest of the [[Latin]] book, or at least the [[Latin/Lesson 1-Revision|revision pages]], before you embark on this. Subjunctive, infinitive and indicative all need to be well understood in order to complete this course.

At the end of every exercise there will be a show-hide exercise and sometimes an English-Latin translation. There will often be referenced footnotes showing where there have been quotes from original Latin authors and tips to usage of sentences.

==Introduction==
Latin as a language was spoken from its earliest origins all through the middle ages to the renaissance and beyond by numerous students, scholars and the educated nobility. Like all spoken languages, Latin evolved in vocabulary and form. Often the vernacular languages influenced how Latin was spoken. While there were many attempts to stay true to Ciceronian form in speech and writing by scholars, most when they spoke the Latin tongue used forms and vocabulary often derived from their mother tongue which would have been incomprehensible to Classical speakers. Latin grammar has remained fixed and unchanged for centuries. 

The two most controversial issues about the living use of Latin ([[w:Living Latin|living Latin]]) are pronunciation and the introduction of new words. Regarding modern vocabulary, many schools exist, and there is no consensus as yet. The Roman Catholic Church publishes a lexicon ([[w:Lexicon Recentis Latinitatis|''Lexicon Recentis Latinitatis'']]) with an exhaustive number of modern words translated into Latin; often this is done through cumbersome periphrases (e.g. a hippie is ‘osor conformitatis’) and other times by arbitrary coinage of new words.

===Pronunciation===
When speaking Latin, the choice is usually between '''‘ecclesiastical’ pronunciation''' and '''‘classical’ pronunciation'''.

The '''‘ecclesiastical’ pronunciation''' nowadays usually refers to the Italian pronunciation of ecclesiastical or ‘Church’ Latin, which is still the official liturgical language of the Catholic Church. Desiring uniformity, this Italian pronunciation is often encouraged as the standard for Masses celebrated in the Latin language. It is however only one of many regional systems of pronunciation. An example of the Italian pronunciation can be found in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkN7NIyzpkg this video].

'''‘Classical’ pronunciation''', like the Italian pronunciation, offers consistency of sound across national borders. It also aims to be a scholarly reconstruction of how ancient Romans spoke, or at least educated speakers of the late Republican/early imperial period. It is described in books such as the paradigmatic Allen's Vox Latina. An example of classical Latin pronunciation can be found in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFWpo905yAU this video].

The sound of the classical pronunciation, in particular the replacement of the ‘v’ sound with the ‘w’ sound, has been the subject of controversy. It is, however, the clear favorite of the ‘Living Latin’ movement, which has the fastest growing number of new speakers of the language.

Notes on contributing to the [[Calculus]] textbook.
This is the [[Wikibooks:Local manuals of style]] for the [[Calculus]] textbook.

==Note to new contributors==
The guidelines given below are intended to keep the organization and style of the book consistent, to reduce the need to rework edits, and to communicate best practices. It is not intended to be a barrier to contributions by would-be contributors. If you have something to contribute but don't have time to read up on all the guidelines given below, go ahead and make your contribution. Other experienced contributors can touch up your edits afterwards so that they conform to the guidelines.

==Structure==

The structure currently being implemented is as follows:
*The book is divided into chapters and sections, with related sections grouped into supersections (e.g. [[Calculus/Integration techniques|Integration Techniques]] within the [[Calculus/Integration|Integration]] chapter). These sections are listed on the [[Calculus|main page]].
*Each section is assigned a section number.
*&quot;==&quot; should be the highest level header used in any section. &quot;=&quot; is reserved for major divisions within the print version of the book.
*Each page including exercises links to a corresponding page of solutions.
*Pages of solutions are organized based on their corresponding page of exercises (exercises set one has a corresponding set one of solutions, etc.).

==Conventions==

*Use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Newpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; templates to separate chapters and sections in the print version.
*Section titles should use [[wikt:title case|title casing]] while sub-section headers should use [[wikt:sentence case|sentence casing]]. Named theorems should be capitalized (e.g. Mean Value Theorem).
*All content pages and section pages should include the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Top Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template at the top and bottom of the page. This template links to the previous and next section or content page. The order of pages defined by the links in the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Top Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template should agree with all tables of contents.
*All content pages and section pages should include &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; just below the bottom &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Top Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template.
*Whenever you want to refer to a section by its section number, use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/map page|[Section-Name]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Then any changes in the ordering of sections can be done easily by changing the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/map page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template.
*Exercises are sequentially numbered within each section. 
*Solutions should be complete and logical. Particularly important steps should be noted and described in words as well as being shown symbolically. ''Naming Convention: Calculus/[Section-Name]/Solutions'' (ex. Calculus/Differentiation/Solutions)
*Give each figure a figure number. Figure numbering restarts with each new section.
*Use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{nowrap begin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{nowrap end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for inline math text that shouldn't be broken up across lines.
*Link figure references in the text to the figure's file using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{nowrap begin}}[[:File:Name-of_File|Figure ''k'']]{{nowrap end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
*Use &quot;\left(&quot; and &quot;\right)&quot; for parenthesis, &quot;\left|&quot; and &quot;\right|&quot; for absolute values, etc. This makes the LaTeX render better in many cases.
*Use and invisible delimiter (i.e. &quot;\.&quot;) with &quot;\|_a^b&quot; for evaluating the antiderivative of an definite integral. The invisible delimiter causes the size of the vertical bar to be sized according to the size of the expression being evaluated.
*Use question-answer templates for exercises like this:
:'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{question-answer|question=1. Question-goes-here|answer={{noprint|Answer-goes-here}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
:The noprint template prevents the answer from appearing with the exercise in the print version.
*Solutions (as opposed to answers) go on the solutions page like this:
:'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{question-answer|question=1. Question-goes-here|answer=Answer-goes-here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
:Bold the answer using either &lt;nowiki&gt;'''Answer'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Answer}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; so that people using the print version can quickly find the answer.
*Prefer \frac{a}{b} to {a\over b}. Using consistent markup reduces the need to do multiple searches on different search terms if looking for a particular fraction.
*Use a single space between sentences unless there is a specific reason to do otherwise. Extra whitespace is ignored anyway, so adding extra whitespace only adds to the size of the page without changing its appearance. If you need to add extra whitespace for layout, use &quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&quot; (the html code for a space) within text or &quot;\,&quot;, &quot;\quad&quot;, or &quot;\qquad&quot; within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags for small, medium, and large spaces, respectively.

==Templates==

See [[:Category:Calculus (book)/Templates]] for a list of all [[Calculus]] textbook templates.

===&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Top Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;===

{{tlx|Calculus/Top Nav|Limits|Infinite Limits}} produces this navigation box:

{{Calculus/Top Nav|Limits|Infinite Limits}}

All [[Calculus]] content pages should include this at the top of the page and at the bottom just above the {{nowrap begin}}&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{nowrap end}} template.

===&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;===

{{tlx|Calculus/TOC}} produces this navigation box:

{{Calculus/TOC}}

All [[Calculus]] content pages should include this at the bottom of the page. This also adds the page to [[:Category:Calculus (book)]].

===&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/map page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;===
{{tlx|Calculus/map page|Algebra}} returns the section number for the [[Calculus/Algebra|Algebra]] section, i.e. {{Calculus/map page|Algebra}}. Use this template when you want to refer to a section by its section number. If you re-order the sections, edit the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/map page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template to reflect the new ordering. That way all references in the book will be updated to return the correct section number.

===&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Def}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;===

{{tlx|Calculus/Def|text{{=}}My definition here.}} produces a box for important text:

{{Calculus/Def|text=My definition here.}}

Use this to introduce significant new definitions and concepts. See [[Calculus/Limits#Informal definition of a limit]], where the informal definition of a limit is inside such a box.

===&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;===

{{tlx|Calculus/Stub}} produces a stub notice, signifying that the given page or section is too short.

==On inclusiveness vs. exclusiveness==

An Extensions section is included for further topics. Any study beyond fairly basic calculus should be in this section. We should aim to include more than is necessary and ensure that our readers are aware of this. The book should be structured so that J. Random Student can find a rigorous course in the essentials of calculus but also include further study of the topic that readers can pick and choose topics from, as their interests warrant.

==TODO==
*ADD MORE, ORGANIZE MORE.
*Provide a more in-depth Precalculus section.
*Create problem sets (preferably original, rigorous and realistic).
*Create answer sets.

== Structure of chapter and the book ==

Hi Krischik: I've noticed the change from integer indexes to any type of indexes. While it's correct that &quot;arrays&quot; can have different index types in high-level languages, I think the point here is to first begin with the absolute lowest-levels first.

In particular, I think the most elementary concepts are the node (e.g. the pair in Lisp, and a two element struct in C) and the integer indexed array. The concept of the node is really the idea of pointers with elements attached to them, and the concept of the array is a simple block of memory you access via offsets. The story I'd like to see this book tell is how, from these two ideas, you can build all other data structures. Thus, when we cover ballanced binary trees, we can mention that's how C++ implements associative arrays.

As for languages, I propose we stick to the pseudo code language and only in the node an array chapters do we show how the code would translate to equivalent C, Java, Scheme, and Python code. (Perhaps another chapter on structs could be covered, showing how to get the equivalent in Scheme.) The abstract ideas should be presented first, and then made concrete by presenting the different languages. (Note: asides and footnotes could still mention other languages, but I would want to resrict that only to widely used or historically important languages.)

So, the idea is that most of the book would be language independent except for the first two or three chapters, and then you'll see everything built up from what was presented before. This includes self-resizing arrays, associative arrays, hashtables, et cetera...

I'm eager to make the book structure changes as discussed on the main talk page as well, and I would like to know what you think.

=== more abstract ===

I do aggree with you on most points. Only I see the &quot;low level&quot; and &quot;language independent&quot; more abstract: The array consist of an index which is used to access elements. 

Only actual languages restrict the kind of types which can be used as index type or element type - depending on the actual balance between flexibilty, savety and speed which is needed. Like most compiling languages need a discreed type as index type and an definite type as element type so that all elements kann be layed in one large area of memory. 

As for languages: I am in favor of broadening the readers mind. Show that here is a live beyond C (no bound checks only int as index type) and Java (only primitives and pointers as element type, only int as index type).

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 11:07, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)

=== beyond C and Java ===

To me, the life beyond C and Java is Scheme! It's probably the most important language that is radically different from the current fads. While I'd love to use, say, Smalltalk, instead of Python, that could lead the book to lose it's razor sharp focus. We can completely cover other array types, but I think we should wait until we've shown the user how to build them, first.

That is, we tell the story of the node and the array as if they &quot;came from the heavens&quot; as virtually all languages provide support for them. We then can discuss the concrete instantiations of these two items in the different langauges, and from then on, nothing will be from the heavens, but built-up from these simple concepts.

(So as not to get too much of a distracted reading style, we could include links at the end of chapters where we'd like to elaborate more, either links to the Ada programming book, or the wikipedia, or special end-note pages. Because this is a tutorial hitting only the main points, we should keep the side notes and distractions down. Otherwise, I'd probably go into a full-blown explaination of data structures in the Lambda Calculus, which is more suitable for the programming languages book.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:41, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)

=== Maybe without implementation languages ===

Choosing the right implementation languages is diffcult indeed. Especialy here because the mainstream langugages have particulary bad array implementations (did you have a little peek at the Ada implementation). Maybe we should just explain the various features of arrays, give an overview which language implements which feature and the just link to Programming:C and Programming:Ada and so on for further reading.

The overview could be layed out as a table, then we can add as many languages as we like without causing distraction and no language advocate would feel left behind.

Of corse, you would have to first write Programming:Scheme:arrays ;-).

: I don't think the Ada example is bad in this section (as long as it compiles). I think SMALL examples add some interest for more experienced readers. And small being 15 or fewer lines. [[User:Christopher.Reilly|Christopher.Reilly]] ([[User talk:Christopher.Reilly|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Christopher.Reilly|contribs]]) 11:36, 17 June 2015 (UTC)

===  the data structure concepts are our foremost ===

Perhaps we differ on what we think this chapter should cover. I do ''not'' want to make an encyclopedic treatise on all of the usages of the word &quot;array&quot; and how this programming language or that programming language implements them differently.

To me, the purpose of the array chapter is to cover the concept of a single buffer of memory that is a table of homogenous entries, indexed with integer offsets. This is the most fundamental building block, next to the concept of the node. We need to cover the fundamentals well before we can speak of the even more advanced data-structures. (We can mention that some languages do bounds checks and others don't; and we can even mention slicing: but as an operation, not a programming language feature.)

I'm not opposed to the idea of linking to different articles, but that can lead to a very poor reading experience. I'd rather that links go only one level deep (as in the [[Computer science:Algorithms]] book), so that a student could print out each chapter and be sure they have everything they need (printing is still very common in the States).

I would like to cover that set of languages (C, Scheme, Java, and Python) in this chapter and the Node chapter in order to show how the pseudo-code language can be translated. Also, a secondary purpose is to convince the reader that isues like implementation language is not very signifigant when discussing data structures. If we present the concepts well enough they will see the forest instead of the trees.

-- [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:29, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Sticking with the traditional integer-indexed (from 0) notion of array as a address-accessible contiguous block of storage is hugely important if students will be able to use this section as part of their education about data structures (and algorithms). Languages that allow other data types as array indexes are (in my experience, at least) really implementing a dictionary/hash table lookup, putting a somewhat complicated layer of abstraction underneath the familiar syntax. (I should look into the implementation details some day, but I strongly suspect that PHP does not have classic arrays at all, just dictionaries.)

Including relevant information about the special &quot;array&quot; tricks and variations of real-life programming languages readers will be using is important, but I believe it is confusing to place those in the main body of what should properly be a description of the fundamental/classic array.

As an instructor, I would prefer to see a clear description of a traditional array first, with the implementation details for specific popular languages moved to a second section. Having encountered this discussion about a decade later, perhaps that will be my job ;-)

--[[User:Davidhbrown|Davidhbrown]] ([[User talk:Davidhbrown|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Davidhbrown|contribs]]) 13:29, 16 July 2014 (UTC)

=== set of languages ===

If you fix a set of languages then there will allways be advocates for other languages - like me - knocking on your door. For example: as soon as you need any of the following in C &quot;*&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, malloc (), free () I show you that Ada can do without ;-) . 

Yes, Implementation language are not very signifigant when discussing data structures but they are when it comes down to actualy implementing them. So again: maybe we should live without and use only pseudo-code. [[Computer science:Algorithms]] certanly does - the Appendix is empty. Actualy there pseudo-code looks quite nice and understandable without a syntax guide. I am all in favor of using that and there way of using arrays (fixed bound &lt;code&gt;array a [1..n]&lt;/code&gt; and variable bounds &lt;code&gt;array a&lt;/code&gt;).

BTW: I know 3 of the suggested languages and I have 15 years experience in programming C and C++. I don't want the reader to belive that the criple C offers as an array is realy '''it'''.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 17:51, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:OK, how about we this: We'll use only the pseduo-code as in the Algorithms book, and only for the Array and Node chapters will be include &quot;deeper&quot; links to cover the fundamental data structures in other languages (including Ada, if you'd like). We can speak of the &quot;get-element&quot; and &quot;set-element&quot; operations as being fundamental, and that the subscript &quot;[]&quot; notation is just a short-hand. (Which reminds me, perhaps getting the length of the array should be considered an operation.)

:The reader won't be lead to believe that the too basic C arrays are it (i.e., you can't resize, and no bounds checks), because the rest of the book will fully cover the better data-structures.

:BTW, now that you're active, take a look at my section proposal. If you're OK with it, I'll start making the changes, including chapter navigation and a &quot;Why a Wikibook on Data Structures&quot; message as in the Algorithms book. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:41, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:: well do go ahead.

== pseduo-code ==

You where asking about an operation for the lenght of an array. I have a proposal based on Ada's operatations on arrays:

; 'First  : index of first element
; 'Last   : index on last element
; 'Lenght : shorthand for ('Last - 'First + 1)
; 'Range  : shorthand for ['First .. 'Last]

For the pseduo-code we might drop the esoteric tic ' and use the well known dot . instead.

Example:

 A : array [1 .. 10]
 
 for I := A.First to A.Last:
 
 repeat

or if you like functional syntax more then object.operation syntax:

 A : array [1 .. 10]
 
 for I := First (A) to Last (A):
 
 repeat

Actualy: functional syntax reads more like natural english.

As a side note, the Ada equivalent is

 for I in A'Range loop;
 
 end loop;

But I don't think this is very suitable for pseduo-code and therefore we could drop the 'Range operation alltogether.

Saying all that, Algorithms use a ISO-Pascal like syntax:

 array a[1..n]

Which works perfectly well as well.

another side note: actualy in ISO-Pascal it would be something like this:

 procedure X (A : array [n .. m : integer] of character)

:I prefer the functional syntax because that will be the only choice we have for, say, queues and hashtables. I.e., we can have lookup() and insert() methods, so if our most fundamental data-structures are similar (except for using the subscript operator) then things would seem to mesh better.

:I do like saying simply &quot;array a&quot; and &quot;value&quot; (with no type) when the types of the elements don't really matter. That way, the code could translate just as well to an untyped language, to a language with generics, or to a language where you have to commit to the type. (Generics would only clutter the code, however important they are to use in the real-world.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 17:24, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

__TOC__
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

An [[w:array|array]] is a collection of elements which can be accessed by one or more index values. In Ada any definite type is allowed as element and any discrete type, i.e. [[Ada Programming/Types/range|Range]], [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|Modular]] or [[Ada Programming/Types/Enumeration|Enumeration]], can be used as an index.

== Declaring arrays ==

Ada's arrays are quite powerful and so there are quite a few syntax variations, which are presented below.

=== Basic syntax ===

The basic form of an Ada array is:

 {{Ada/kw|array}} (Index_Range) {{Ada/kw|of}} Element_Type

where Index_Range is a range of values within a discrete index type, and Element_Type is a definite subtype. The array consists of one element of &quot;Element_Type&quot; for each possible value in the given range. If you for example want to count how often a specific letter appears inside a text, you could use:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Character_Counter {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Character) {{Ada/kw|of}} Natural;

As a general advice, do not use Integer as the index range, since most of the time negative indices do not make sense. It is also a good style when using numeric indices, to define them starting in 1 instead of 0, since it is more intuitive for humans and avoids [[w:off-by-one error|off-by-one error]]s.

=== With known subrange ===

Often you don't need an array of all possible values of the index type. In this case you can {{Ada/kw|subtype}} your index type to the actually needed range.

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Index_Sub_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} Index_Type {{Ada/kw|range}} First .. Last
 
 {{Ada/kw|array}} (Index_Sub_Type) {{Ada/kw|of}} Element_Type

Since this may involve a lot of typing and you may also run out of useful names for new [[ada Programming/Subtypes|subtypes]], the array declaration allows for a shortcut:

 {{Ada/kw|array}} (Index_Type {{Ada/kw|range}} First .. Last) {{Ada/kw|of}} Element_Type

Since &lt;tt&gt;First&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Last&lt;/tt&gt; are expressions of &lt;tt&gt;Index_Type&lt;/tt&gt;, a simpler form of the above is:

 {{Ada/kw|array}} (First .. Last) {{Ada/kw|of}} Element_Type

Note that if &lt;tt&gt;First&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Last&lt;/tt&gt; are numeric literals, this implies the index type &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;.

If in the example above the character counter should only count upper case characters and discard all other characters, you can use the following array type:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Character_Counter {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Character {{Ada/kw|range}} 'A' .. 'Z') {{Ada/kw|of}} Natural;

=== With unknown subrange ===

Sometimes the range actually needed is not known until runtime or you need objects of different lengths. In some languages you would resort to pointers to element types. Not with Ada. Here we have the box '&lt;&gt;', which allows us to declare indefinite arrays:

 {{Ada/kw|array}} (Index_Type {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Element_Type;

When you declare objects of such a type, the bounds must of course be given and the object is constrained to them.

The predefined type [[Ada Programming/Strings|String]] is such a type. It is defined as

  {{Ada/kw|type}} String {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Character;

You define objects of such an unconstrained type in several ways (the extrapolation to other arrays than String should be obvious):

  Text : String (10 .. 20);
  Input: String := Read_from_some_file;

(These declarations additionally define anonymous subtypes of String.) In the first example, the range of indices is explicitly given. In the second example, the range is implicitly defined from the initial expression, which here could be via a function reading data from some file.
Both objects are constrained to their ranges, i.e. they cannot grow nor shrink.

=== With aliased elements ===

If you come from [[Programming:C|C]]/[[Programming:C_plus_plus|C++]], you are probably used to the fact that every element of an array has an address. The [[Programming:C|C]]/[[Programming:C_plus_plus|C++]] standards actually demand that.

In Ada, this is not true. Consider the following array:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Has_Appointment {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
  {{Ada/pragma|Pack}} (Day_Has_Appointment); 

Since we have packed the array, the compiler will use as little storage as possible. And in most cases this will mean that 8 boolean values will fit into one byte.

So Ada knows about arrays where more than one element shares one address. So what if you need to address each single element. Just not using '''[[Ada Programming/Keywords/pragma|pragma]]''' ''[[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Pack|Pack]]'' is not enough. If the [[w:CPU|CPU]] has very fast bit access, the compiler might pack the array without being told. You need to tell the compiler that you need to address each element via an access.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Has_Appointment {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Boolean;

=== Arrays with more than one dimension ===

Arrays can have more than one index. Consider the following 2-dimensional array:

   {{Ada/kw|type}} Character_Display {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|array}} {{Ada/dl|(}}Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} {{Ada/dl|&lt;&gt;}}{{Ada/dl|,}} Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} {{Ada/dl|&lt;&gt;}}{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/kw|of}} Character{{Ada/dl|;}}

This type permits declaring rectangular arrays of characters.
Example:

   Magic_Square{{Ada/dl|:}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Character_Display {{Ada/dl|1=:=}}
      {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}S{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}P{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}N{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}P{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}S{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}

Or, stating some index values explicitly,

   Magic_Square{{Ada/dl|:}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Character_Display{{Ada/dl|(}}1 {{Ada/dl|..}} 5{{Ada/dl|,}} 1 {{Ada/dl|..}} 5{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/dl|1=:=}}
      {{Ada/dl|(}}1 {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}S{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       2 {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}P{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       3 {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}N{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       4 {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}P{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}E{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
       5 {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}S{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}

The index values of the second dimension, those indexing the characters in each row,
are in 1 {{Ada/dl|..}} 5 here. By choosing a different second range, we could
change these to be in 11 {{Ada/dl|..}} 15:

   Magic_Square{{Ada/dl|:}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Character_Display{{Ada/dl|(}}1 {{Ada/dl|..}} 5{{Ada/dl|,}} 11 {{Ada/dl|..}} 15{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/dl|1=:=}}
      {{Ada/dl|(}}1 {{Ada/dl|1==&gt;}} {{Ada/dl|(}}{{Ada/dl|'}}S{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}A{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}O{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|,}} {{Ada/dl|'}}R{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|,}}
        ...

By adding more dimensions to an array type, we could have squares, cubes (or « bricks »), etc., of homogenous data items.

Finally, an array of characters is a string (see [[Ada Programming/Strings]]). Therefore, &lt;tt&gt;Magic_Square&lt;/tt&gt; may simply be declared like this:

   Magic_Square{{Ada/dl|:}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Character_Display {{Ada/dl|1=:=}}
      {{Ada/dl|(}}&quot;SATOR&quot;{{Ada/dl|,}}
       &quot;AREPO&quot;{{Ada/dl|,}}
       &quot;TENET&quot;{{Ada/dl|,}}
       &quot;OPERA&quot;{{Ada/dl|,}}
       &quot;ROTAS&quot;{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}

== Using arrays ==

=== Assignment ===

When accessing elements, the index is specified in parentheses. It is also possible to access slices in this way:

 Vector_A (1 .. 3) := Vector_B (3 .. 5);

Note that the index range slides in this example: After the assignment, Vector_A (1) = Vector_B (3) and similarly for the other indices.

Also note that the ranges overlap, nevertheless Vector_A (3) /= Vector_B (3); a compiler delivering such a result would be severely broken.

=== Concatenate ===

The operator &quot;&amp;&quot; can be used to concatenate arrays:

 Name := First_Name &amp; ' ' &amp; Last_Name;

In both cases, if the resulting array does not fit in the destination array, Constraint_Error is raised.

If you try to access an existing element by indexing outside the array bounds, Constraint_Error is raised (unless checks are suppressed).

=== Array Attributes ===

There are four Attributes which are important for arrays: '{{Ada/attribute|First}}, '{{Ada/attribute|Last}}, '{{Ada/attribute|Length}} and '{{Ada/attribute|Range}}. Lets look at them with an example. Say we have the following three strings:

 Hello_World  : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
 World        : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := Hello_World (7 .. 11);
 Empty_String : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := &quot;&quot;;

Then the four attributes will have the following values:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Array !! '{{Ada/attribute|First}} !! '{{Ada/attribute|Last}} !! '{{Ada/attribute|Length}} !! '{{Ada/attribute|Range}}
|-
|Hello_World  || 1 || 12 || 12 || 1 .. 12
|-
|World        || 7 || 11 || 5  || 7 .. 11
|-
|Empty_String || 1 || 0 || 0  || 1 .. 0
|}

The example was chosen to show a few common beginner's mistakes:

# The assumption that strings begin with the index value 1 is wrong (cf. World'First = 7 on the second line).
# The assumption (which follows from the first one) that X'Length = X'Last is wrong.
# The assumption that X'Last &gt;= X'First; this is not true for empty strings.

The index subtype of predefined type String is Positive, therefore excluding 0 or -17 etc. from the set of possible index values, by subtype constraint (of Positive).  Also, 'A' or 2.17e+4 are excluded, since they are not of type Positive.

The attribute '{{Ada/attribute|Range}} is a little special as it does not return a discrete value but an abstract description of the array. One might wonder what it is good for. The most common use is in the [[Ada Programming/Control#for_loop_on_arrays|for loop on arrays]] but '{{Ada/attribute|Range}} can also be used in declaring a name for the index subtype:

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Hello_World_Index {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} Hello_World'Range;

The {{Ada/attribute|Range}} attribute can be convenient when programming
index checks:

 {{Ada/kw|if}} K {{Ada/kw|in}} World{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|then}}
    {{Ada/kw|return}} World{{Ada/dl|(}}K{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
 {{Ada/kw|else}}
    {{Ada/kw|return}} Substitute{{Ada/dl|;}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}}{{Ada/dl|;}}

=== Empty or Null Arrays ===

As you have seen in the section above, Ada allows for empty arrays. And &amp;mdash; of course &amp;mdash; you can have empty arrays of all sorts, not just String:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Some_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Positive range &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 
 Empty_Some_Array : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Some_Array (1 .. 0) := ({{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; False);

Note: If you give an initial expression to an empty array (which is a must for a constant), the expression in the aggregate will of course not be evaluated since there are no elements actually stored.

# Audio output can not be connected to Event input and vice versa. You can change Audio signal to Event with [[../A to E|A to E module]]
# [[Reaktor/Polyphony|Polyphonic]] outputs cannot be connected to monophonic inputs. You can use [[../Audio Voice Combiner/]]
# Polyphonic signals cannot be send between instruments. You can use [[../Send/]] and [[../Receive/]] instead, but it will cause 30 msec [[Reaktor/Latency|latency]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What you should know==
Algebra is by far the most important form of mathematics needed when it comes to working with Reaktor. Ideally one should have an understanding of high school algebra, along with at least some peripheral knowledge of trigonometry. One generally does not encounter circumstances in Reaktor where things such as the quadratic equation are needed, but generally speaking you should be comfortable with solving single variable linear equations (i.e. solving for x if: &lt;math&gt;2x + 10 = 4x&lt;/math&gt;) and double variable linear equations (i.e. solving for y if: &lt;math&gt;3y = 2x + 6y + 20&lt;/math&gt;). Polynomials with terms to powers greater than one are not encountered too often (i.e. &lt;math&gt;y = x^{2} + 3x + 4&lt;/math&gt;), but you may encounter them when doing such things as shaping linear controller data into a curve.

==Resources==

==Useful formulas==

===Scaling data from one range to another===
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{M' - m'}{M - m}\cdot (x - m)+m'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* x = input&lt;br&gt;
* f(x) = output&lt;br&gt;
* m = min value of input&lt;br&gt;
* M = max value of input&lt;br&gt;
* m' = min value of output&lt;br&gt;
* M' = max value of output

As an example, say you have an LFO which is outputting in a range from -1 to 1. However, you want the LFO to be outputting in a range from 30 to 50. We can use the above formula to construct a function which transforms our input from the old range to the new range: We simply plug in our values and then simplify.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{(50) - (30)}{(1) - (-1)}\cdot (x - (-1))+(30)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{20}{1 + 1}\cdot (x + 1) + 30&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 10\cdot (x+1) + 30&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''''NOTE:''''' The dot ( &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; ) signifies multiplication. Subtracting a negative is the same as adding.

Taking into account order of operations (from highest priority to lowest: parenthesis, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction), we see that we can transform our input via three easy steps:
# Add 1 to the input -- This shifts the range (-1..1) to (0..2).
# Multiply the result of that by 10 -- This scales the range of (0..2) to (0..20).
# Add 30 to the result of the multiplication -- This shifts the range of (0..20) to (30..50), our goal.

Here is one more example, where we transform our input with a range of -300 to 24 into data with a range of 100 to 10000.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{(10000) - (100)}{(24) - (-300)}\cdot (x - (-300))+(100)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{9900}{324}\cdot (x + 300)+(100)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''''NOTE:''''' We do not reduce the fraction because 9900 ÷ 324 produces a repeating decimal (30.55555...). 

Hence we get the following steps:
# Divide 9900 by 324 -- This gives us 30.555555...
# Add 300 to the input -- This shifts the range (-300..24) to (0..324).
# Multiply the result of step 1 by the result of step 2 -- This scales the range (0..324) to (0..9900).
# Add 100 to the result of step 3 -- This shifts the range of (0..9900) to (100..10000), our goal.

As you can see, linearly scaling data is as simple as shift, scale, shift.

===MIDI Pitch =&gt; Frequency (Hz)===
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 440\cdot 2^{\frac{x-69}{12}}\approx440\cdot e^{0.057762265\cdot(x - 69)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = pitch&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; = frequency&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;e\approx2.71828183&lt;/math&gt;

===Frequency (Hz) =&gt; MIDI Pitch===
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 69+12\cdot\frac{\log\left(\frac{x}{440}\right)}{\log(2)}\approx\frac{\ln\left(\frac{x}{8.175798}\right)}{\ln1.0594633}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = frequency&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; = pitch&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; = the natural log

===How many times MIDI pitch A is slower than MIDI pitch B (A &lt; B)===
&lt;math&gt;f(A,B)=2^{\frac{B-A}{12}}\approx e^{0.057762265\cdot(B-A)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* A = MIDI pitch A&lt;br&gt;
* B = MIDI pitch B&lt;br&gt;
* f(x) = output&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;e\approx 2.71828183&lt;/math&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Herw. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Herw~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Rice''' is the seed of a monocot plant ''Oryza sativa''. As a [[cookbook:Cereal Grain|cereal grain]], it's the most important staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and the West Indies. It's one of world's three most produced grains along with wheat and [[cookbook:corn|maize]] (corn). &lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/world_production_of_wheat_corn_and_rice Info on global production of rice, wheat and corn on the UNEP/Grid-Ardenal website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice is consumed both with its bran coating and without. White rice, of which there are many types, is the generic name for bran-free rice. There are three types of rice with intact bran (whole-grain rice): wild rice, brown rice and the far less popular black rice. While biologist don't consider wild rice to be a true rice, it's a member of the same taxonomic family: ''poaceae''; but a different genus: ''zizania''.

Brown rice has a nutty taste and chewy texture. It's healthier than white rice because of its higher fiber content. White rice, however, has a much longer shelf life, cooks faster, and produces fluffier grains. Wild rice has a hard, almost woody texture along with a nutty taste and has similar health benefits as brown rice. Also, wild rice has the lowest calorie content of all rices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/688951/nutrition_comparison_brown_rice_vs.html?cat=51 Health benefits of wild rice and brown rice on the Associated Content website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw rice may be ground into [[cookbook:flour|flour]] for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages such as amazake, horchata, rice milk, and [[cookbook:sake|sake]]. Rice flour does not contain gluten and is suitable for people on a gluten-free diet. Rice may also be made into various types of [[cookbook:pasta|noodles]]. Raw, wild or brown rice may also be consumed by raw-foodist or fruitarians if soaked and sprouted (usually one week to 30 days).

==Types of rice==
There are several types of rice:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricegourmet.com/About_RiceTypes.htm Info on rice on the Rice Gourmet website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Period
450 - 1450

Music of the Medieval Period was categorized into sacred and secular music. '''Sacred music''' was music that was used by the Roman Catholic Church and '''secular music''' was music that had no relation to the Church.


==Sacred Music==

===Gregorian Chant===
Sacred music evolved from a form called the '''Gregorian chant'''. Gregorian chants were named after Pope Gregory I and they are the official pieces of the Catholic Church.

====Characteristics of Gregorian chants====
*'''Melody''' - The melody of a Gregorian chant is very free-flowing. The chant moves up and down by steps and small leaps within a narrow range. Melodies are often '''melismatic'''- syllables are held out over multiple notes.
*'''Harmony''' - Gregorian chants are monophonic in texture, so have no harmony. However, the use of drone (singing of the same note for an extended period of time usually in at least whole notes) was common.
*'''Rhythm''' - There is no precise rhythm for a Gregorian chant. Notes may be held for a duration of “short” or “long,” but no complex rhythms are used.
*'''Form''' - Some Gregorian chants tend to be in ternary (ABA) form. A cantor begins the piece with an introductory solo, called an incipit. The choir then sings the piece and at the end the cantor concludes with his solo, which was often in a reduced dynamic level and featured a narrower range of pitches.
*'''Timbre''' - Sung by all male choirs. However, sometimes they were written for women who were nuns of convents  as a teaching device.
*'''Texture''' - Gregorian chants are one of the few pieces of music that are entirely monophonic. There is only one melodic line in a Gregorian chant.
*'''Context''' - Gregorian chants were used by the Church to aid prayers. Monks (and occasionally nuns in convents) would sing them. As well, as it was the official music of the Roman Catholic Church, all gregorian chants had only vocals as instrumentation was considered to be Pagan. This also caused all text to be written in Latin. All gregorian chant was passed down orally, as the use of sheet music was very uncommon. They were performed at the &quot;office&quot; and &quot;mass&quot; of religious ceremony.
*'''Church Modes''' - These were the scales in which gregorian chants were sung. They were used in the middle ages until the Renaissance. Most folk music uses them, this can be seen in the example &quot;What can we do with a drunken sailor.&quot; Church modes use 7 tones and the eighth tone duplicates the tonic an octave higher. 

====Significant Composers====
*'''Hildegard of Bingen''' - The first woman composer with a significant output of works.
**''Important works''
**O Successores 
*Most other composers are unknown since works were given to the Church. 
**''Other works''
**Alleluia: Vidimus Stellam

===Organum===
The Gregorian chant began to evolve around 700. From 700 - 900, composers would write a line in parallel motion to the chant at a fixed interval of a fifth or a fourth above the original line. This technique evolved further from 900 - 1200. During this period, the upper line moved independently of the original chant. After 1100, upper lines even began gaining rhythmic independence. 

A Gregorian chant to which additional lines were added is called '''organum'''. The original Gregorian chant on which the upper lines are based is called the '''cantus firmus'''. Between the lines they are intervals of fourths and fifths that move in contrary motion. 

Two composers, Leonin and Perotin, were instrumental to the development of organum. Leonin was the director of music at the Notre Dame Cathedral and Perotin, his pupil, succeeded him. These two composers and their students are thus appropriately referred to as the '''School of Notre Dame'''.

====Significant Composers====
*'''Leonin'''- He is the first known composer to use measured rhythm in his compositions.
*'''Perotin'''- He is the first known composer to write three simultaneous, distinct lines. 
**''Important works''
**Alleluia: Nativitas 

Sacred music was primarily vocal. This was mostly due to the connection of instruments to pagan rituals. Nevertheless, instruments did become more important over the span of the Medieval Period. The most important instrument of sacred music in the Medieval Period is the organ. Early organs are not like modern organs; though they were loud, they were much more difficult to operate and required a great deal of physical strength.

==Secular Music==

Unlike sacred music, secular music had a more clearly defined beat and its texture was closer to homophony or polyphony. (It was not true homophony since chords were only implied). Like sacred music, the texture was primarily vocal, though it didn’t regard instruments with as much suspicion as the Church.

===Troubadours &amp; Trouvères===

Much secular music during the Medieval Period was written by '''troubadours''' and '''troubavères'''. These were French nobles and they often wrote music to gain prestige.

====Significant Composers====
*'''Guillaume IX''', duke of Aquitaine
*'''Chastelain di Couci'''
*'''Beatriz de Dia''' (a woman troubadour)

===Jongleurs===

'''Jongleurs''' also composed and performed secular music. Jongleurs were wandering minstrels that would entertain towns with music, juggling, and drama. They had no civil rights but were important parts of society since they spread news from town to town. One form of music they played is the estampie. An '''estampie''' is a fast dance in triple meter.

==Ars Nova==

Around 1350, a new style of music called '''Ars Nova''' (New Art) emerged. Ars Nova includes both sacred and secular music, though secular music gained importance during this period. 

Important characteristics of Ars Nova are:
*Development of polyphony
*Use of duple meter
*Syncopation

===Sacred Music===

Ars Nova saw the appearance of a grand form for sacred music- the '''mass ordinary'''. The mass ordinary consists of five prayers set to music as five different movements. The prayers are:

*Kyrie
*Gloria
*Credo
*Sanctos
*Agnus Dei

===Secular Music===

Because of diminishing influence of the Church, secular music became more prominent in the Ars Nova Period. Instruments were used more often, though the music was still primarily vocal. A new secular form of the Ars Nova period is the ballata. The '''ballata''' is a dance in the form of A BB AA. A ballata is also known as a falala for its use of this line throughout its pieces.

====Significant Composers====
*'''Guillaume de Machaut'''
**''Important works'' 
**Notre Dame Mass - This is the first known polyphonic mass.
*'''Francesco Landini'''
**''Important works''
**Ecco la Primavera - This is an example of an Ars Nova ballata.

===Instruments of the Period===
*Organ
*Pipe
*Rebec
*Psaltery
*Fiddle
*Lute
*Sackbut
*Shawm

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the real knowledge should be filtered out of the whole topic on User Forum. Sometimes it's just three sentences, not need to go thought the whole discussion and analyse it to find the essence. Tha't the whole point of Wiki stuff, that somebody is doing this work for others... [[User:Artur Nowak|Artur Nowak]]

== OK, this is very good idea anyway! ==

After few thoughts I agree, this is a good way for picking the valuable threads from user forum. At least we know where it is and can quickly find it. Maybe in the future somebody (one of the discussion participants) will make a nice article based on the discussion and summarize it in few sentences. Anyway, I think the idea of linkin threads for user forum is very good! [[User:Artur Nowak|Artur Nowak]]

==links==
BTW the link to 'mathematics and music' is great or cool or whatever  [[User:herw|Herwig Kraß (herw)]]

Yes Herw, I was amazed by this book too. The beauty of wiki is, that anybody an add links, like this one, I just found it someday, bookmarked it, and now others can make use of it. Add your favourite resources too, for you they are obvious, but others may not know it! [[User:Artur Nowak|Artur Nowak]] 15:41, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)~

==Rationalisation==

Some of the stuff is very peripheral to the whole reaktor thing, if we can sideline some of the stuff that's just general audio, or move it somewhere else and focus on things that are directly releated to Reaktor I'm up for writing a fair bit to get this going ... thoughts?  

I'm not sure that soundcards is directly relevant :) It's going to be a bit epic if tghat kind of thing needs covering !

== [[Reaktor:Basics]] ==

someone seems to have misplaced this article, but it belongs here. Please add a link on the main page of this wikibook. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 20:59, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== Missing introduction in using Reaktor ==

Hello,

It is a very good idea to write this book. Thank you! But it is not understandable for beginners. Please could anybody add basic informations for people who never used such a software? Further for a book it is very scattered and devided into too many pages. You never know, when you have read the whole book and you loose very easy the correct succession. Therefor it should contain a page navigator with things as &quot;next page&quot; and &quot;previous page&quot;. -- [[User:84.132.112.97|84.132.112.97]] 15:05, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

This is a reference guide for the Blades of Avernum Avernumscript language.  Blades of Avernum is a role playing game made by Spiderweb Software, more information can be found at the [http://www.avernum.com Avernum Web Site].  This document is basically the calls section of the Blades of Avernum Editor Appendices put in an online, easily browsable form.  

All credit goes to Jeff Vogel, creator of the software and writer of the original documentation.  This is just the documentation he wrote in a different format.

==General notes about scripting==

'''which_char''' - Many calls expect to be given a value for which_char. This expects the number of a character, which will be from 0 to 119. 
	(Note that you are not entering the character’s Character ID or the personality. To find the number of a character, in the editor, select the character and look at the number in the first description line.)
	If you use such a call in a creature script, if you enter a value of -1 for which_char, the function will act on the creature whose script is running. In such a case, you can also enter ME for which_char. This does the same thing.

'''which_char_or_group''' - When a call expects a value for which_char_or_group, it wants the number of a character or group. This is exactly like which_char, except for one difference: the call can also act on every member of a group. If you want to have the call act on group x, give which_char_or_group a value of 1000 + x. (And remember that group 0 is always the party.)

===The Most Important Calls===

	You should pay special attention to these calls. They are the calls you will use the most frequently to write your special encounters.

	This call is the way to begin a conversation.

'''void begin_talk_mode(short start_node)'''

	This call lets you block containers and spaces from the party.

'''void block_entry(short do_blockage)'''

These two calls let you easily reward the party.

'''void change_coins(short coin_amount)
short reward_give(short which_item)'''

	These two calls let you see if a character exists and instantly make a new one.

'''short char_ok(short which_char)
short spawn_creature(short which_char)'''

	Every scenario must use this call. Otherwise, the party can never escape.

'''void end_scenario(short party_won)'''

	The best call to display some simple text to the player is:

'''void message_dialog(char text1,char text2)'''

	This call enables you to customize your outdoor encounters.

'''void outdoor_enc_result(short which_result)'''

	These are the two primary calls for setting and checking Stuff Done flags.

'''void set_flag(short a,short b,short new_value)
short get_flag(short a,short b)'''

	These two calls enable you to instantly customize creatures in your towns:

'''void set_name(short which_char_or_group,char new_name)
void set_level(short which_char_or_group,short what_level)'''

	This call lets you jump around special scripts easily.

'''void set_state_continue(short new_state)'''

==Basic Script and IO Calls==
===print_big_str(string str,short num_to_print,string str2)=== 
Like print_str, but prints a more customized piece of text. Prints, on one line, the text str, followed by the number num_to_print, followed by the text str2.

Example: print_big_str(“You are hit for “, 10000, “ damage.”); prints “You are hit for 10000 damage.” to the text window.

===print_big_str_num(string str,short num,string str2,short color)===
Like print_big_str, but gives the text a different color. Colors are listed in the description of print_str_color.

===void block_entry(short do_blockage)===
This very important call prevents the character from accessing the terrain spot/area that called the script. If called from a special encounter triggered by walking, this call prevents the party/character from entering the space. If called when searching a container, blocks the party from being able to get the item inside. If do_blockage is 1, the call blocks entry. If it is 0, allows entry, and undoes any earlier uses of this call with do_blockage equal to 1.

===void end()=== 
If called in a script, immediately stops running the script. If called in the code of a dialogue node, also ends the conversation.

===short get_ran(short num_dice,short min,short max)=== 
Returns a random number. The game generates num_dice random numbers, each is from min to max. It then adds them up and returns the sum.

Example: get_ran(3,1,4) returns a random number from 3-12 (or 1-4 + 1-4 + 1-4).

===short get_selected_char()=== 
Returns the number of the character currently selected in the party roster area (which will be from 0 to 3).

===short is_combat()=== 
Returns 1 if party is in combat mode, 0 otherwise.

===short is_outdoor()=== 
Returns 1 if party is in outdoor mode, 0 otherwise. (Being in a combat outdoors is NOT outdoor mode.)

===short is_town()=== 
Returns 1 if party is in town mode, 0 otherwise.

===void play_sound(short which_sound)=== 
Plays the sound which_sound. Sounds are listed in the appendices. If the number of the sound is positive, it stops the action while the sound plays. If negative, the sound plays while the game continues.

===void print_str(string to_print)=== 
Displays the given text in the game’s text area. The maximum allowable length of text is 70 characters.

===void print_str_color(string to_print,short color)=== 
Like print_str, but also gives the text a different color. Values for color are:

{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Black
|-
| 1
| Red (Usually used for errors.)
|-
| 2
| Blue
|-
| 3
| Magenta
|-
| 4
| Green
|}

===void run_scenario_script(short which_node)=== 
Immediately runs the scenario script at state which_node. Once the scenario script stops running, the script that made this call continues running normally.

===void run_town_script(short which_node)=== 
Immediately runs the current town script at state which_node. Once the scenario script stops running, the script that made this call continues running normally. You can only make this call from dialogue, creature, or terrain scripts.

===void set_incidental_sound(short on_or_off)=== 
Sets whether incidental sounds (birds chirping, etc.) are played in the background. If on_or_off is 1, turns them off. If 0, turns them back on. If turned off, they stay off until this call turns them on again.

===void set_state(short new_state)=== 
Changes the state of the script to new_state and immediately stops running the script. Has no effect in a dialogue script or in the states INIT_STATE,  DEAD_STATE, or other predefined state types (except START_STATE).

===void set_state_continue(short new_state)=== 
Exactly like set_state, except that it doesn’t stop running the script.

'''Note:''' set_state_continue ''does'' work in some other predefined states, possibly all of them.

==Campaign and Scenario Calls==
These are the functions for manipulating the scenario variables and the Stuff Done flags. For information on Stuff Done flags and the meaning of SDF(a,b), read the chapter on scripting basics (in original documentation).

===void clear_quest(short which_quest)=== Resets the quest which_quest (which can be from 0 to 99). It is as if it was never given. No text message is displayed.

===void end_scenario(short party_won)=== Immediately terminates the scenario and returns the party to the title screen. If party_won is 1, the party’s won scenarios value is incremented. If 0, not. 
If party_won is 2, the party is taken out of the scenario and the number of scenarios the party is recorded as having played is not incremented. (You probably usually won’t want to use this.)

===short get_flag(short a,short b)=== Identical to get_sdf.

===short get_sdf(short a,short b)=== Returns SDF(a,b).

===void inc_flag(short a,short b,short how_much)=== Changes SDF(a,b) by how_much (which can be negative). Note the legal range of values for a flag is 0..255.

===void set_flag(short a,short b,short new_value)=== Sets SDF(a,b) to be new_value.

===void toggle_quest(short which_quest,short start_or_finish)=== Toggles whether the party is doing quest number which_quest (which can be from 0 to 99) or not. If start_or_finish is 1, and the party has not completed this quest, the quest is started and appears on the party’s quest list. If start_or_finish is 0 and the party is currently on the quest, the quest is marked as finished and removed from the quest list.

==Basic Character Calls==
===void alert_char(short which_char_or_group)=== Alerts the Creature/Group. This means that, if it is hostile, it will actively hunt the party down when they are nearby.

===void award_char_xp(short which_char,short amount,short source_level)=== Gives character which_char amount experience, adjusted as if it was gained by killing a creature of level source_level. You can’t give more than 1000 experience at any one time.

===void award_party_xp(short amount,short source_level)=== Gives each party member amount skill points, adjusted as if they were gained by killing a creature of level source_level. Source_level is relative level of party/monster giving experience. (1-10 for Beginner, 10-20 for Medium, 20-30 for High) 

Note that a character can’t get more than 1000 experience in one lump.

===short can_see_char(short which_char_or_group)=== This can only be called in a creature or terrain script. Returns 1 if the creature/terrain spot whose script it is can see the given character or member of the given group, or 0 otherwise.

===void change_char_xp(short which_char,short amt_to_change)=== Changes experience character which_char by amount. Amt_to_change can be negative.

===void change_pc_skill_pts(short which_char,short amt_to_change)===  Changes the character which_char skill points by amt_to_change. Amt_to_change can be negative.

===void change_spell_level(short which_char,short mage_or_priest,short which_spell,short amt_to_change)=== Changes the skill character which_char knows spell which_spell by amt_to_change (which can be negative). If mage_or_priest is 0, changes mage spell. If 1, changes priest spell.

	If the character is a party member, he or she can only learn the spell if his or her mage or priest spells skill is high enough. If the skill isn’t high enough, this call has no effect.

===short char_attitude_to_char(short which_char,short char_to_evaluate)=== Evaluates how character which_char feels about character char_to_evaluate. Returns 0 if the character likes the other character, 1 if the character is neutral about the other character, and 2 if the character hates the other character.

===short char_has_trait(short which_char,short which_trait)=== Returns 1 if character which_char has trait which_trait, 0 if it doesn’t. 
Traits are listed in the appendices. (in the original manual)

===short char_ok(short which_char)=== Returns 1 if this character is existing and alive, 0 otherwise.

===short char_on_spot(short loc_x,short loc_y)=== Checks if there is an NPC (a character not controlled by the player, numbers 6 or higher) on space {loc_x,loc_y}. Returns –1 if no character there. Otherwise, returns the number of the character there.
	If you also want to check for the presence of the player’s characters, use the call char_on_loc.

===short char_status(short which_char)===  Returns the current status of this character:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Doesn’t exist
|-
| 1
| Alive and OK
|-
| 2
| Dead
|-

| Party split up, character stoned but not present
|}

===short creature_type(short which_char)=== Returns the creature type of which_char.

===void deduct_ap(short num_ap)=== This can only be called in a creature script and only has effect in combat. Removes num_ap action points from the character whose script is running.

===void end_combat_turn()=== This can only be called in a creature script and only has effect in combat. Removes all action points from the character. Note that this does NOT end the state. You need to call end() right after this if you want to stop running script.

===short enemies_nearby(short range)=== This can only be called in a creature’s script. Returns the number of characters within range spaces that the character can see and which are hostile.

===void erase_char(short which_char_or_group)=== Makes the character/group stop existing. No treasure is dropped. The character’s killed flag is not set (so it can reappear when the party returns).

===short friends_nearby(short range)=== This can only be called in a creature’s script. Returns the number of characters within range spaces that the character can see and which are friendly.

===short get_attitude(short which_char)=== Returns the attitude of the character.

|}

===short get_char_skill_pts(short which_char)=== Returns the character’s skill points.

===short get_energy (short which_char)=== Returns the character’s current spell energy.
This call was added for Scenario Format Version 2, only use it with Mac version 1.1 or later or Windows version 1.0 or later.

===short get_health(short which_char)=== Returns the character’s current health.

===short get_level(short which_char)=== Returns the character’s level.
'''Note:''' The ME paramater doesn't work with get_level.  Use the my_number call instead.

===short get_max_health(short which_char)=== Returns the character’s maximum health.

===short get_species(short which_char)=== Returns the character’s species.

===short get_spell_level(short which_char,short mage_or_priest,short which_spell)===  Returns the skill level that character which_char knows spell which_spell. If mage_or_priest is 0, checks mage spell. If 1, checks priest spell.

===short get_summon_level(short which_char)=== Returns the summoning level of the current character (which can reveal whether it is summoned or not). The results are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Not summoned. Real creature.
|-
| 1
| Summoned, but will not disappear over time.
|-
| 100-199
| Summoned. Subtract 100 from amount to get number of turns until it disappears.
|-
| 200-299
| Illusion. Subtract 200 from amount to get number of turns until it disappears.
|}

===void give_recipe(short which_recipe)=== Teaches the party recipe which_recipe. Recipes are listed in the appendices. (in original manual)

===short has_recipe(short which_recipe)=== Returns 1 if party knows alchemy recipe which_recipe, 0 if it doesn’t. Recipes are listed in the appendices.

===void kill_char(short which_char_or_group, short death_type, short luck_helps)===  Kills the character or every member of the group. Death_type determines the sort of death:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 2
| Dead
|-
| 3
| Dust
|-
| 4
| Stoned
|}
If luck_helps is 1, the character’s luck can save it. If 0, there is no escape.

===short my_ap()=== This can only be called in a creature script and only has effect in combat. Returns the character’s current number of action points.

===short my_number()=== Can only be called in a creature script or terrain script. Returns this creature’s number (0 - 119) if in a creature script or the terrain script’s number (0 - 99) in a terrain script.

===short party_can_see_loc(short loc_x,short loc_y)=== This call only works correctly inside a town. Returns 1 if a party member can see location {loc_x,loc_y}, 0 otherwise.

===short party_has_trait(short which_trait)=== Returns 1 if some party member has trait which_trait, 0 if it doesn’t. Traits are listed in the appendices.

===short party_size()=== Returns the number of living, present characters in the party.

===void print_named_str(short which_char,char print_text)=== Prints in the text area the name of character which_char, immediately followed by print_text.

Example: If character 17 is a Cute Puppy, the command
	print_named_str(17,” fires ray of doom.”); 

puts the text “Cute Puppy fires ray of doom.” in the text area.

===short random_party_member()=== Returns the number of a random character in the party (will be a number from 0 to 5).

===void revive_party()=== Completely heals the party’s damage and restores all spell energy.

===void set_attitude(short which_char_or_group,short which_attitude)===  Sets the attitude of the character/group:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 3
| Friendly to party
|-
| 4
| Neutral
|-
| 10
| Hostile A
|-
| 11
| Hostile B
|}

===void set_char_alert(short which_char_or_group,short alert_level)=== Sets the alert level of the Creature/Group which_char_or_group to value alert_level. If alert_level is 1, the characters are alerted and will, if hostile to the party, hunt the party down. If 0, they will no longer be alerted.

===short set_char_script_mode(short which_char_or_group,short what_setting)=== Adjusts when the scripts for the Creature/Group will be run by the game when the party is not nearby. (By default, the game does not call all the scripts all the time, to keep the game from slowing down.) Values for what_setting are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| call every 8 moves, but not if party is far away
|-
| 1
| Call every 8 moves, even if party is far away
|-
| 2
| Call every move, but not if party is far away
|-
| 3
| Call every move, even if party is far away
|}
The default is always 0.

===void set_char_trait(short which_char,short which_trait,short set_to)=== For character which_char, changes whether the character has trait which_trait. If set_to is 0, takes the trait away. If set_to is 1, gives the trait. Traits are listed in the appendices.

	Note that you should probably only use this ability to teach the character Ritual of Sanctification (trait 22). You really shouldn't mess with a character's other traits. This call only has a real effect on party members.

===void set_creature_memory_cell(short which_char_or_group,short which_cell,short new_value)=== For the character or each member of the group, sets the value of memory cell which_cell to new_value.

===void set_level(short which_char_or_group,short what_level)=== Changes the level of the Creature/Group to what_level. Automatically adjusts the character’s statistics and health to reflect the new level. This call also completely heals and restores the character, so it should probably only be called when the party enters the area (i.e. in the town script’s state INIT_STATE).

	You shouldn’t use this call on party members.

===void set_mobility(short which_char_or_group,short mobile)=== Sets whether the Creature/Group can move or not. 1 is yes, 0 is no.

===void set_name(short which_char_or_group,char new_name)=== Sets the name of the character/group to new_name. Maximum name length is 19 characters.

===void set_special_ability(short which_char_or_group,short what_ability)=== Changes the special ability of the Creature/Group to what_ability. The different special abilities are listed in the section on scripting creature types. If what_ability is 0, the creature gets no special ability.

===void set_summon_level(short which_char_or_group,short new_level)=== Sets the summoning level of Creature/Group to new_level. Summoned creatures and illusions do not give experience or treasure when killed. The legal values are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Not summoned. Real creature.
|-
| 1
| Summoned, but will not disappear over time.
|-
| 100-199
| Summoned. Subtract 100 from amount to get number of turns until it disappears.
|-
| 200-299
| Illusion. Subtract 200 from amount to get number of turns until it disappears.
|}

===short species_in_party(short which_species)=== which_species is the number of a species (most often, 2 for nephil or 3 for slith). This call returns 1 if one of the characters in the party is alive and that species, 0 otherwise. 
This call does check any extra characters that are traveling with the party.

==Item, Special Item and Gold Calls==
===void change_coins(short coin_amount)=== Changes the number of coins the party has by coin_amount (which can be negative). 

	If the number is negative, then coins are taken away. If the party doesn't have enough coins, no coins are taken.

===void change_spec_item(short which_item,short how_many)=== Changes the amount of special item which_item the party has by how_many (which can be negative if you want to take some of an item away). If you try to take away more of the item than the party has, the party is left with 0 of the item.

===void char_give_item(short which_char_or_group,short which_item)=== Tries to give to the Creature/Group an item of type which_item. If you call char_give_item for a group, gives one of the item to each group member.

	The item will not automatically be identified. If the character doesn’t have enough space to take the item, nothing happens and the game gives a “can’t take the item” message.

This call was added for Scenario Format Version 2, only use it with Mac version 1.1 or later or Windows version 1.0 or later.

===short char_has_item(short which_char,short which_item)=== Returns 1 if character which_char has an item of type which_item, 0 otherwise.

===short char_has_item_of_class_equip(chart char_num,short which_class,short take_item) === Returns 1 if a party member has an item with special class which_class and the item is equipped, 0 otherwise. If take_item is 1, one of the items is taken. If 0, it isn’t.
This call was added for Scenario Format Version 2, only use it with Mac version 1.1 or later or Windows version 1.0 or later.

===void char_take_item(short which_char_or_group,short which_item)===  Takes from the Creature/Group one item of type which_item (or, if it has charges, 1 charge). If a group is given, takes one of the item from each member of the group.

===short coins_amount()=== Returns the number of coins the party has.

===short has_item(short which_item)===  Returns 1 if a party member has an item of type which_item, 0 otherwise.

===short has_item_of_class(short which_class,short take_item)=== Returns 1 if a party member has an item with special class which_class (this is set in the scenario item script), 0 otherwise. If take_item is 1, one of the items is taken. If 0, it isn’t. 

===short has_num_of_item(short which_item)===  Returns how many items which_item the party has, 0 otherwise.

	If the items in question have charges, this call returns the total number of charges.

===short has_special_item(short which_item)===  Returns the number of the special item which_item the party has, 0 if they don’t have any. 

===short item_of_class_on_spot(short loc_x,short loc_y,short what_class)=== Returns 1 if there is an item of special class what_class on town space {loc_x,loc_y}, 0 otherwise. If what_class is -1, returns 1 if any item is on the space, 0 otherwise. 

===void move_item_on_spot(short loc_x,short loc_y,short dest_x,short dest_y)=== Takes all items sitting on town spot {loc_x,loc_y} and moves them to {dest_x,dest_y}. If dest_x is a negative value, the items on the space are simply destroyed.

===short pay_coins(short coin_amount)=== Tries to take coin_amount coins from the party. Returns 0 if party doesn’t have enough, 1 if they do.

===void put_item_on_spot(short loc_x,short loc_y,short what_item)===  Places an item of type what_item on town space {loc_x,loc_y}. If that spot is a container, the item won’t be contained inside it.

===short reward_give(short which_item)===  Tries to give item of number which_item to party. If the party can’t hold it, tries to put it at their feet (which only works indoors). If this fails, returns 0. Otherwise, returns 1.

===short take_all_of_item(short which_item)=== Takes all of item which_item from party, and returns the number of items taken. If the item given has charges, returns the total number of charges taken.

===short take_all_of_item_class(short which_class,short gold_to_pay)=== Takes from the party all items of special class which_class and, for each item taken, gives the party gold_to_pay gold. Returns 1 if the party had some items of that type, 0 otherwise. If the item taken has charges, gives the amount of gold for each charge taken.

===void take_item(short which_item)===  Searches through the party’s inventory until it finds an item of type which_item and takes it (or, if it has charges, takes one of them). 

===short take_item_of_class_on_spot(short loc_x,short loc_y,short what_class)=== Returns 1 if there is an item of special class what_class on town space {loc_x,loc_y}, 0 otherwise. If there was an item of that type on the spot, destroys one of it (or, if item has charges, takes 1 charge). If what_class is -1, destroys all items on the spot and returns TRUE if an item destroyed.

===void take_num_of_item(short which_item,short num_to_take)===  Takes num_to_take items of type which_type from the party. If the item has charges, takes that many charges. If the party has less than num_to_take items of that type, all are taken. 

===void take_special_item(short which_item)===  Takes 1 of special item which_item from party. If party has none of that special item, does nothing.

==Location and Distance Calls==
Note that none of these functions are meant to be used in outdoors mode. They will not return proper values.

	Also, if you are writing a creature or terrain script, be sure to look up the calls my_loc_x and my_loc_y.

===short char_loc_x(short which_char)=== Returns the x coordinate of the character which_char.

===short char_loc_y(short which_char)=== Returns the y coordinate of the character which_char. 

===short char_dist_to_loc(short which_char,short x, short y)=== Returns the distance of character which_char from location {x,y}. Note that which_char can't be a group.

(Editor's note: Using &quot;ME&quot; here, or -1, from a creature script doesn't seem to work right.  It gave me a distance number, but didn't give me the distance from the creature whose script was running.  I had to use the creature's number. Further note: the way to do this is using my_number.)

===short char_on_loc(short x, short y)=== Returns the number of the character on space {x,y}. If there is no character there, returns -1. Unlike char_on_spot, this call also checks if one of the player’s characters is there.

===short dist_to_waypoint(short which_char,short which_point)=== Returns the distance of character which_char from waypoint which_point. Note that which_char can't be a group.

===short group_dist_to_loc(short which_group,short x, short y)=== Returns the distance of closest character in group which_group to the location {x,y}. Remember that group 0 is the party (in case you want to see who in the party is closest to a point). If the group is empty, the distance returned is 10000.

===short my_dist_from_start()=== This call can only be made from a creature script. Returns the character’s distance, in spaces, from where it started.

==Statistic and Damage Functions==
===void alter_stat(short which_char_or_group,short which_stat,short how_much)=== For character which_char, changes statistic which_stat by how_much. You can’t increase a statistic above 100.

	How_much can be negative. Skills 0-3 can’t be taken below 1 by this call, and no skill can be taken below 0.

===void change_char_energy(short which_char_or_group,short energy_amount)=== Changes spell energy for the Creature/Group by energy_amount. This can’t raise a character over its normal energy maximum.

===void change_char_health(short which_char_or_group,short heal_amount)=== Changes the health of the Creature/Group by heal_amount. This can’t raise a character over its normal health maximum.

===short char_with_highest_skill(short which_skill)===  Returns the number of the party member with the highest level of the skill which_skill. Returns -1 if no character has any of the skill.

===void damage_char(short which_char_or_group,short damage_amount,short damage_type)===  Does damage_amount damage of type damage_type to the Creature/Group.

Damage types - 0 - weapon, 1 - fire, 2 - poison, 3 - general magic, 4 - unblockable, 5 - cold, 6 – acid

===void damage_near_loc(short loc_x,short loc_y,short damage_amount,short radius,short damage_type)=== Does damage_amount damage of type damage_type to all characters visible to and within radius spaces of location {loc_x,loc_y}. This does not work outdoors.

Damage types - 0 - weapon, 1 - fire, 2 - poison, 3 - general magic, 4 - unblockable, 5 - cold, 6 - acid

===short get_char_status(short which_char,short which_status)=== Returns the current value of status which_status for character which_char.

===short get_highest_skill(short which_skill)===  Returns value of the skill which_skill for the party member who has the most for that skill.

===short get_skill_total(short which_skill)===  Returns the sum of all the party members' values of skill which_skill.

===short get_stat(short which_char,short which_stat)=== Returns the current value of statistic which_stat for character which_char. This takes into account all bonuses for items, etc.

===short get_stat_levels_bought(short char_num,short which_stat)=== Returns the number of levels of statistic which_stat for character which_char that the character has actually bought at a trainer. This will be less than the current value of the statistic. For non-player characters, this will always end up being 0.

===void heal_char(short which_char_or_group,short heal_amount)===  Heals heal_amount damage for the Creature/Group.

===short party_has_status(short which_status)===  Returns 1 if one party member has a positive value for status which_status, 0 otherwise.

	This is most useful when checking for Featherfall (status 24) or Flying (status 25);

===short party_member_has_skill(short which_skill)=== Returns 1 if a party member has at least 1 level of skill which_skill, 0 otherwise.

===void restore_energy_char(short which_char_or_group,short energy_amount)===  Restores energy_amount spell energy for the Creature/Group.

===void restore_pc(short which_char)=== Completely heals the character of all bad effects (including death or dust). If called in town, places the character next to the party. Removes the curse from all equipped cursed items. 

===void set_char_status(short which_char_or_group,short which_status,short how_much,short is_forced,short give_update)=== Changes status which_status for character/group which_char_or_group by amount how_much. If is_forced is 1, the status is always changed by the full amount. If is_forced is 0 then, for negative statuses, the character’s resistances apply. 

	If is_forced is 0 and give_update is 0, no text message about status change is given. Otherwise, it is. If the status change is forced, however, no text update is given and give_update is ignored.

===void set_party_status(short which_status,short how_much,short give_update)===  Changes status which_status for every character in the party by amount how_much. For negative statuses, character resistances apply (to force a change, use the set_char_status call). If give_update is 0, no text message about status change is given. Otherwise, it is.

===void status_near_loc(short loc_x,short loc_y,short status_amount,short radius,short status_type)===  Change status status_type by amount status_amount to all characters visible to and within radius spaces of location {loc_x,loc_y}. This does not work outdoors. All appropriate resistances apply ... if you try to change the amount of poison for the nearby characters, their poison resistance will help them.

===void waypoint_damage_party(short which_waypoint,short in_range,short out_range,short damage_amount,short damage_type)===  Does damage_amount damage of damage_type type to all characters near a visible waypoint which_waypoint. Only affects creatures which are at least in_range spaces and at most out_range spaces from the waypoint.

Damage types - 0 - weapon, 1 - fire, 2 - poison, 3 - general magic, 4 - unblockable, 5 - cold, 6 - acid

==Animation and SFX Functions==
There are a variety of special effects that can be put on characters and terrain spots. Once the effects are placed, to actually display the animation, call run_animation or run_animation_sound. All of the available effects, explosions, and sparkles are listed in the appendices.

	None of these calls have any effect outdoors.

===void put_boom_on_char(short which_char,short which_sfx,short random_shift)===  Places explosion which_sfx on character which_char. If random_shift is 0, effect appears directly on character. If 1, the explosion is shifted slightly in a random direction.

===void put_boom_on_space(short loc_x,short loc_y,short which_sfx,short random_shift)=== Exactly like put_boom_on_char, but makes the effect appear in terrain spot {loc_x,loc_y}.

===void put_effect_on_char(short which_char,short which_sfx,short num_effects,short float_mode)=== Places effect which_sfx on character which_char. num_effects is the number of effect graphics that appear, and float_mode determines how they behave:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Appear above character and fall.
|-
| 1
| Appear below character and rise.
|-
| 2
| Hang in midair.
|}

===void put_effect_on_space(short loc_x,short loc_y,short which_sfx,short num_effects,short float_mode)=== Exactly like put_effect_on_char, but makes the effect appear in terrain spot {loc_x,loc_y}.

===void put_jagged_zap(short source_x,short source_y,short dest_x,short dest_y,short color_scheme)=== Exactly like put_straight_zap, but the bolt is jagged. Values for color_scheme are in listed in put_straight_zap.

===void put_sparkles_on_char(short which_char,short which_sfx,short num_sparkles)===  Places sparkle which_sfx on character which_char. num_sparkles is the number of effect graphics that appear.

===void put_sparkles_on_space(short loc_x,short loc_y,short which_sfx,short num_sparkles)=== Exactly like put_effect_on_char, but makes the effect appear in terrain spot {loc_x,loc_y}.

===void put_straight_zap(short source_x,short source_y,short dest_x,short dest_y,short color_scheme)=== Places a straight bolt of lightning running from {source_x,source_y} to {dest_x,dest_y}. Values for color_scheme are
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Fire ray
|-
| 1
| Ice ray
|-
| 2
| Death ray
|-
| 3
| Green ray
|-
| 4
| White ray
|-
| 5
| Black ray
|-
| 6
| Blue ray
|}
the bolt does not appear until one of the run_animation calls is used.

===void run_animation()===  Pauses the game and plays all animations you have created. Note that none of the above calls will draw anything on its own. You need to use this call to run any animations.

===void run_animation_sound(short which_sound)===  Like run animation, but also plays sound which_sound. Sounds are listed in the appendices. The sound plays while the animation runs.

==Scenario Initialization Calls==
These calls are all meant to be made in the scenario script, either in the state LOAD_SCEN_STATE or START_SCEN_STATE. They can, however, be made anywhere.

===void add_item_to_shop(short which_shop,short which_item,short how_many)===  This call should be made in the state START_SCEN_STATE. This places 1 or more of an item in store which_shop (which can be from 0 to 129). Normally, the item placed is which_item (which is numbered 0  - 499, and how_many copies of the item are put in the store. If there are more than 500 of an item put in the store, the store has an infinite number.

	Any given shop can only have 25 items in stock.

	However, if you pick certain high values of which_item, you can put into the store things besides items (like spells).

	Not only objects can be in stores. You can also have spells, alchemy recipes, and skills. The meanings of the values of which_item are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0 - 499
| Item
|-
| 2000 + x
| Mage spell x (x is from 0 to 19). how_many is the highest level of the spell that can be bought in the store.
|-
| 3000 + x
| Priest spell x (x is from 0 to 19). how_many is the highest level of the spell that can be bought in the store.
|-
| 4000 + x
| Alchemy recipe x (x is from 0 to 19). how_many should be 1.
|-
| 5000 + x
| Skill x. Each purchase gives the character 1 level of the skill. how_many is the maximum number of levels of the skill that can be bought.
|}

	Note that, in all cases, you will want to put a number above 0 for how_many. If you don't, the item will disappear from the store.

===void create_boat(short which_boat,short which_town,short loc_x,short loc_y,short others_property)=== This call should be made in the state START_SCEN_STATE. Initializes boat which_boat (which can be from 0 to 29). Places the boat in town which_town in space {loc_x,loc_y}. If others_property is 0, the party can enter the boat. If 1, the boat must be set as party property by a script before the party can use it.

===void create_horse(short which_horse,short which_town,short loc_x,short loc_y,short others_property)=== This call should be made in the state START_SCEN_STATE. Initializes horse which_horse (which can be from 0 to 29). Places the horse in town which_town in space {loc_x,loc_y}. If others_property is 0, the party can mount the horse. If 1, the horse must be set as party property by a script before the party can use it.

===void init_quest(short which_quest,string quest_name,string quest_desc)=== This call should be made in the state LOAD_SCEN_STATE. It sets the name of quest which_quest to quest_name and the description text to quest_desc. The name can be at most 29 characters long and the description can be at most 199 characters long. The quests are numbered from 0 to 99.

===void init_special_item(short which_item,string item_name,string item_desc)=== This call should be made in the state LOAD_SCEN_STATE. It sets the name of special item which_item to item_name and the description text to item_desc. The name can be at most 29 characters long and the description can be at most 199 characters long. The special items are numbered from 0 to 59.

===void set_creature_type_level(short which_type,short what_level)=== Sets the level of creature type which_type to level what_level. This is the only call that changes creature types (normally these changes are made in a different script). It is provided because, to balance a scenario, you will probably want to adjust the levels of some creature types.

==Boats and Horses==
The values which_horse and which_boat are always from 0 to 29.

===short in_boat()=== Returns -1 if party is not in a boat. Otherwise, returns the number of the boat they’re in (from 0 to 29).

===short in_horse()=== Returns -1 if party is not on a horse. Otherwise, returns the number of the horse they’re on (from 0 to 29).

===void set_boat_property(short which_boat,short party_property)=== Changes property status of boat which_boat

===short set_boat_range_property(short first_boat,short last_boat)=== Finds one boat in the range from first_boat to last_boat that isn’t the party’s property and make’s it the party’s property. Returns the number of the boat that was made the party’s property, or -1 if there was no existing boat in the range that the party didn’t own.

===void set_horse_property(short which_horse,short party_property)=== Changes property status of horse which_horse. If party_property is 0, party can’t use the horses. If party_property is 1, they can.

===short set_horse_range_property(short first_horse,short last_horse)=== Sets one horse in range from first_horse to last_horse that isn’t the party’s property to be the party’s property. Returns the number of the horse that was made the party’s property, or -1 if there was no existing horse in the range that the party didn’t own.

==Event Calls==
===short day_event_happened(short which_event)=== Returns -1 if the event which_event (which is from 0 to 9) has not happened, or the day it happened if it has happened.

===void set_event_happened(short which_event,short what_day)===  Records that event which_event (a number from 0 to 9) happened on day what_day (you’ll probably pass what_day_of_scenario()) to this. 

==Town Calls==
These calls have to do with towns and their status (whether they have been visited, are visible, etc.). Any calls that refer to the current town will do nothing if the party is not in town mode. To learn more about visibility, crime levels, etc., read the chapters on editing and scripting towns.

	For calls that expect a value for which_town, if you pass the value ME (or -1), the town the party is currently in is used.

===void activate_hidden_group(short which_group)===  When town is entered, characters with a hidden group value do not appear. This call makes all characters with the hidden group value of which_group appear. If the spot where the creature would appear is blocked, the game finds a clear nearby spot.

===void change_crime_level(short how_much)===  Changes the level of crimes committed in the current town by how_much (which can be negative).

===void change_outdoor_location(short what_section_x,short what_section_y,short loc_in_sector_x, short loc_in_sector_y)===  Changes the party's location in the outdoors. It moves them to location {loc_in_sector_x,loc_in_sector_y} in section X = what_section_x, Y = what_section_y. It can only be used in a town script. It is used, for example, when the party enters a portal in a town that is meant to carry them to a town a long distance away.

===void clear_town()=== Sets the current town to be destroyed. When next entered, the only creatures that will be present are ones set to only be there when town destroyed.

===short current_town()=== Returns the town the party is currently in. This call should not be used in outdoor mode.

===short current_town_size()=== Returns the size of the town the party is in (0 - 64x64, 1 - 48x48, 2 - 32x32).

===void enable_add_chars(short can_add)=== Sets whether the player can add new characters to his or her party in this town. Defaults behavior is that the player is not able to add characters when a new town is entered. This call needs to be used to enable adding characters every time the town is entered (probably in the state INIT_STATE).

	If can_add is 1, the player can add new characters. If 0, player can no longer add new characters.

	You should probably enable the player to add characters in at least the starting town.
	
===short get_crime_level()=== Returns the level of crimes that have been committed by the party in the current town.

===void make_town_hostile()=== Sets the town permanently to hostile (this can be undone with the call set_town_status). Sets all friendly characters to hostile.

===void move_to_new_town (short new_town,short loc_x,short loc_y)=== Immediately takes the party out of combat mode and moves them to town new_town, starting at {loc_x,loc_y}.

	This call only works when called indoors. It will only function if called in a special encounter triggered by walking on a space. It won’t work in creature, terrain, or dialogue scripts.

===short num_killed_in_town(short which_town)===  Returns the number of hostile creatures that have been killed in town which_town.

===void place_monster(short loc_x,short loc_y,short monst_type,short not_worth_xp)===  Makes a monster of type monst_type appear at {loc_x,loc_y}. It is hostile to the party. The game has 34 slots reserved for wandering monsters and creatures made using the place_monster function. 

	If not_worth_xp is 0, than the creature is a normal creature. If not_worth_xp is 1, the creature drops no items and awards no experience when killed. If not_worth_xp is 2, the creature is considered to be summoned. It drops no items, isn't worth xp, and disappears a few turns later.

	The summoned creature uses its default script.

===void set_crime_tolerance(short tolerance)=== Sets the crime level the town will endure before it goes hostile. This call needs to be made each time the party enters the town.

===void set_items_not_property()=== Sets all items in the current town to not be someone else’s property (so the party can now get them without penalty).

===void set_town_status(short which_town,short new_status)=== Manually sets town which_town to status new_status. For values of new_status, see description of function town_status.

===void set_town_visibility(short which_town,short town_visible)=== Sets whether town which_town is visible and can be entered when party is outdoors. If town_visible is 1, party can see. Otherwise, is not visible. When the scenario is started, all towns default to being visible.

===short spawn_creature(short which_char)=== Makes one of the town’s creatures appear. which_char is the number the creature would have in the game that is not a party member (so it is between 6 and 119). If that creature is not currently alive, it becomes alive, at that creature’s spawning point. Returns 1 if a creature appears, 0 otherwise.

Example: The first creature you place in a town would be creature 6 in the game. If you use the call spawn_creature(6), this creature would appear in the game, unless it is already alive.

===short teleport_party(short new_loc_x,short new_loc_y,short fade_type)===
mode - 
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Full teleport flash
|-
| 1
| No teleport flash
|-
| 2
| Only fade flash
|}

===short town_status(short which_town)=== Returns the status of which_town. Status values are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Never been entered.
|-
| 1
| Party has entered.
|-
| 2
| Party has entered, town hates.
|-
| 3
| Town has been destroyed.
|}

'''Note:''' the call town_status only works when passed the valus -1 (for the current town). So town_status(-1) will return the status of the current town, but town_status([any other number]) won't work correctly.

===void turn_off_training(short turn_off)===  Every town defaults to let the party train in it. If you don’t want the party to be able to train in the current town, use this call. If turn_off is 1, the party can’t train in this town. If it is 0, they can.

==Outdoor Calls==
These calls are all only useful when outdoors. For more information (and to learn how outdoor sections are numbered) )read the chapter on the outdoors.

===void create_out_spec_enc(short which_enc)=== Creates a copy of the special encounter which_enc (which is from 0 to 3) next to the party.

===short current_out_section()=== Returns the number of the outdoor section the party is currently in. 

===void eliminate_outdoor_enc(short stuff_done_1, short stuff_done_2)=== Used to destroy groups of creatures outdoors. Each outdoor encounter can have a Stuff Done flag set which eliminates the encounter (makes it not appear). This call is given {stuff_done_1, stuff_done_2}, which are the two coordinates of a Stuff Done flag. This call eliminates all outdoor encounters whose elimination Stuff Done flag is {stuff_done_1, stuff_done_2}.

===void out_move_party(short loc_x,short loc_y)=== Relocates the party to space {loc_x,loc_y} in the current outdoor section.

===short outdoor_enc_exists(short stuff_done_1, short stuff_done_2)=== Used to check if a particular group of creatures wandering outdoors exists. Each outdoor encounter can have a Stuff Done flag set which eliminates the encounter (makes it not appear). This call is given stuff_done_1, stuff_done_2, which are the two coordinates of a Stuff Done flag. This call returns 1 if there is currently an existing group of outdoor creatures with a matching Stuff Done flag which eliminates it.

===void outdoor_enc_result(short which_result)=== This call only has an effect when it is called as a result of the party encountering a group of creatures outdoors. It determines whether the party will have to fight the encounter or not. The meanings of which_result are as follows:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Fight as normal
|-
| 1
| Don’t have to fight
|-
| 2
| Don’t have to fight, encounter disappears, but can reappear later
|-
| 3
| Don’t have to fight, encounter disappears, sets the encounter’s defeat Stuff Done flag (if it has one) to 1. (So it disappears forever.)
|}

===void place_out_spec_enc(short which_enc,short where_x,short where_y)=== Creates a copy of the special encounter which_enc (which is from 0 to 3) at the location {where_x,where_y} in the current outdoor section.

===void set_out_fight_town_loaded(short which_town)=== This call only has an effect when it is called as a result of the party encountering a group of creatures outdoors. It sets the town terrain that is loaded for the fight to take place in. which_town is the town that is loaded when party fights an outdoor combat on this terrain type. If which_town 0-999, loads the town in the current scenario. If 1000 + x, loads town x in the file Blades of Avernum Out Fight

==The Passage of Time==
Time in Blades of Avernum is measured in “ticks”. At the beginning of a scenario, the number of ticks that have elapsed is 0. Every turn that passes in town or every round of combat that ends increases the number of ticks by 1. Every turn that passes outdoors increases the number of ticks by 10 (5 if on a horse).

	There are 5000 ticks in a day. The first eighth and last eighth of every 5000 tick period are nighttime.

	There are 280 days in each year (numbered 0 to 279). There are eight months in the year, each of which have 35 days.

===void force_start_day(short which_day)=== lets you manually set the day of the year the scenario starts. Which_day is normally 0 to 279. If which_day is –1, the scenario has no dates.

===short get_current_tick()=== Gets the number of ticks (i.e. turns/combat rounds) that have elapsed since the scenario began. This will be a number from 0 to 29999, and wraps around to 0 when past 29999. 

===void set_ticks_forward(short num_ticks)=== Manually changes the number of ticks that have happened since the scenario started (because the party sleeps, for example). num_ticks can be negative.

===short tick_difference(short time1,short time2)=== Returns the number of turns difference between time1 (the earlier time) and time2 (the later time).

===short what_day_of_scenario()=== Returns how many days have passed since the current scenario began.

===short what_day_of_year()=== Returns what day of the year it is (a number from 0 to 279).

==Miscellaneous Special Calls==
===void create_text_bubble(string bubble_text)=== This call only has an effect when called from a creature [or terrain] (doesn't work from terrain script) script. Creates a text bubble with text bubble_text above the creature/terrain spot for a short time. The text can be at most 38 characters long. This call has no effect if called in combat.

	If you pass empty text (i.e. create_text bubble(&quot;&quot;)), the current text bubble is removed. Also, if there is already a text bubble on the creature/terrain spot, this call is ignored.

===void drop_item(short which_item)===  This call only has an effect when called from a creature or terrain script. Creates an item of type which_item and puts it on the ground on the creature location or terrain spot. Even if the space has a container, the item will not be marked as contained.

===short get_char_who_stepped_on()=== This call is only used for custom terrain and floor types which call a state in the scenario script when stepped on (when the floor/terrain type’s special property is set to 8).

	If in town mode, returns –1 (the whole party is considered to have stepped on the space). If in combat mode, returns the number of the character who stepped on the space. 

===void make_wandering_monst()=== Immediately spawns a group of wandering monsters. You can use this function in town or outside.

===void put_object_on_waypoint(short which_object,short which_point)===  Creates an item of type which_item and puts it on the ground on waypoint which_point. Even if the space has a container, the item will not be marked as contained.

===short run_bash_door(short difficulty)=== This call only has an effect when called from a  terrain script. Has the party member with the highest strength bash the object, and requires a strength of at least difficulty to succeed. Returns 1 if success, 0 otherwise.

===short run_pick_lock(short difficulty)===  This call only has an effect when called from a  terrain script. Has the party member with a lockpick and the highest Tool Use attempt to manipulate the object, and requires a Tool Use (plus bonuses from items) of at least difficulty to succeed. Returns 1 if success, 0 otherwise.

===short set_ter_script_mode(short which_script,short what_setting)=== For terrain script which_script, sets how often it is run. Values for what_setting are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| call every 8 moves, but not if party is far away
|-
| 1
| Call every 8 moves, even if party is far away
|-
| 2
| Call every move, but not if party is far away
|-
| 3
| Call every move, even if party is far away
|}

===void set_terrain_memory_cell(short which_ter_script,short which_cell,short new_value)=== For terrain script which_ter_script, sets cell memory which_cell to new_value.

===void text_bubble_on_char(short which_char, string bubble_text)=== Creates a text bubble with text bubble_text above creature which_char. The text can be at most 38 characters long. This call will create a text bubble if called in combat. However, you shouldn't make a text bubble in combat unless a cutscene is happening.

	If you pass empty text, the current text bubble is removed. Also, if there is already a text bubble on the creature/terrain spot, this call is ignored.

==Terrain Checking and Modification==
Only a few of these calls can be used outdoors. In this case, {x,y} is a location in the current outdoor section. The rest of the calls only work in town mode. It is specifically noted if a call can be used outdoors.

	Note that outdoor terrain is reloaded every time a save file outdoors is loaded. Changes made by set_terrain will then be erased. Bear this in mind when altering outdoor terrain.

===void change_blocked(short x, short y,short blocked)===  Change whether a space in town is blocked. If blocked, NPCs will not step on it and the party will not be placed onto it when the party enters a level or ends combat. If blocked is 0, the space becomes not blocked. If 1, the space becomes blocked.

	Note that this does not affect if the floor or terrain in that space is set to be blocked.

	This call does not work outdoors.

===short get_floor(short x,short y)===  Returns the floor type at {x,y}. This call can be used outdoors.

===short get_height(short x,short y)===  Returns the height at {x,y}. This call can be used outdoors.

===short get_terrain(short x,short y)=== Returns the terrain type at {x,y}. This call can be used outdoors.

===void flip_terrain(short x,short y)===  Change the terrain at spot {x,y} to its te_swap_terrain value (set in the object definition script). For example, sets a closed gate at {x,y} to be an open gate. If no te_swap_terrain value has been set for the terrain type at {x,y}, does nothing. This function will not work properly outdoors.

===short is_blocked(short x,short y)=== Returns 1 if the given space is designated as blocked, and 0 otherwise. Note this doesn’t check if the floor or terrain type in that space is blocked, just if the space was made blocked in the editor. This call doesn’t work outdoors.

===short is_field_on_space(short x,short y,short field_type)=== Returns 1 if a field of type field_type is on space {x,y}, 0 otherwise. The field types are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Sleep cloud
|-
| 1
| Fire wall
|-
| 2
| Antimagic
|-
| 3
| Stinking cloud
|-
| 4
| Ice wall
|-
| 5
| Blade wall
|-
| 6
| Quickfire
|}

===short is_object_on_space(short x,short y,short object_type)=== Returns 1 if an item of type object_type is sitting on space {x,y}, 0 otherwise. The object types are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Web
|-
| 1
| Barrel
|-
| 2
| Crate
|-
| 3
| Fire barrier
|-
| 4
| Force barrier
|-
| 5
| NE/SW Mirror
|-
| 6
| NW/SE Mirror
|}

===short is_stain_on_space(short x,short y,short stain_type)=== Returns 1 if a stain of type stain_type is on space {x,y}, 0 otherwise. Stain types are as follows:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Small blood
|-
| 1
| Medium blood
|-
| 2
| Large blood
|-
| 3
| Small slime
|-
| 4
| Large slime
|-
| 5
| Dried blood
|-
| 6
| Bones
|-
| 7
| Rocks
|}

===void put_field_on_space(short x,short y,short field_type)===  Places a field of type field_type on space {x,y}. Field types are listed above. If field_type is -1, removes all fields from the space.

===void put_object_on_space(short x,short y,short object_type)=== Places an object of type object_type on space {x,y}, 0 otherwise. Object types are listed above. If object_type is -1, removes all objects from the space.

===void put_stain_on_space(short x,short y,short stain_type)===  Places a stain of type stain_type on space {x,y}. Stain types are listed above. If stain_type is -1, removes all stains from the space.

===void set_floor(short x,short y,short floor_type)=== Sets the floor type at {x,y} to floor_type. This call can be used outdoors.

===void set_height(short x,short y,short height)=== Sets the height type at {x,y} to new_height. This call can be used outdoors.

===void set_terrain(short x,short y,short ter_type)=== Sets the terrain type at {x,y} to ter_type. This call can be used outdoors.

===void swap_floor(short x,short y,short floor_1,short floor_2)=== If the terrain at spot {x,y} is floor_1, turns it to floor_2. otherwise, if it is terrain_2, turns it to floor_1. This function will not work properly outdoors.

===void swap_terrain(short x,short y,short terrain_1,short terrain_2)=== If the terrain at spot {x,y} is terrain_1, changes it to terrain_2. otherwise, if it is terrain_2, turns it to terrain_1. This function will not work properly outdoors.

==Dialog Calls==
===void add_string(short which_string)=== This call only works when called inside the code portion of a dialogue node. Sets the string which_string (which is from 1 to 8) to be displayed. This only has an effect if the string was already hidden by the remove_string or clear_strings calls.

===void begin_shop_mode(char shop_name,char shop_desc,short which_shop,short price_adjust,short sell_adjustment)=== Immediately puts the party in shopping mode, buying from which_shop, which has name shop_name and description shop_desc. price_adjust is a number from 0 to 6 determining how expensive the shop items are (0 - cheaper, 6 - more expensive). sell_adjustment is either -1 (which means the shop doesn’t buy items) or 0 to 6, a number which determines how much the shop pays for items (0 means the store pays more, 6 means pays less).

===void begin_talk_mode(short start_node)=== Begins talking mode, starting at node start_node. This should not be called while outdoors, or while entering or leaving town.

(Advanced detail: If a conversation is started from a creature or terrain script, there is a Done button in the Dialogue area (so the player can leave the conversation at any time). Otherwise, there will be no Done button, and the conversation can only end when the player reaches the end of a talking thread.)

===short character_talking_to()=== This call only functions when called while in talk mode. Returns the number of the character the party is currently talking to.

===void clear_strings()=== This call only works when called inside the code portion of a dialogue node. Hides all strings, so none of them are displayed. After this call is used, you should use the add_string call at least once, so the player doesn’t see an empty screen.

===short current_personality()=== This call only functions when called while in talk mode. Returns the number of the personality the player is talking to.

===void remove_string(short which_string)=== Hides string which_string (which is from 1 to 8), so it is not shown to the party when the dialogue node is displayed.

===void set_char_dialogue_pic(short which_char_or_group,short which_sheet,short which_icon)=== Gives the Creature/Group a dialogue picture, which will appear in the talk corner when they are talked to. This should probably be called when the town is entered. Dialogue pictures are placed in a sheet by themselves with no frame, and it is recommended that they are no larger than 64 x 64. The number of the graphic resource is which_sheet. which_icon is not used and should be left at 0. For more information, read Chapter 4.5.

==Basic Dialog Box Calls==
All of these calls are used to set up and display dialog boxes, where the player is given a host of options to select from. The dialog box you will build can have up to 6 chunks of text and 3 choices (each with text you provide).

To display a dialog box more complicated than just a chunk of text and an OK button (for this, use the message_dialog call), follow these steps:

#Call reset_dialog. This cleans up all the text and choices, and sets the first of the three choices to OK.
#Fill in the text you want to appear. Use the call add_dialog_str once for each line of text in the dialog.
#Set the text for up to three choices, using the call add_dialog_choice.
#Use the call run_dialog to make your dialog box appear and wait for the player’s choice. The call will return which of the three choices the player made (1 for 1st choice, 2 for 2nd, and 3 for 3rd). Call run_dialog(1) if you want there to be a Record button, and run_dialog(0) otherwise.

===reset_dialog()=== Erases all previous dialog box settings. Clears all text and all buttons, and then sets first button to say “OK”.

===void add_dialog_choice(short which_option,char choice_text)=== Adds a choice to the bottom of the dialog. which_option is the choice to add (0 to 2) and choice_text is the text for the choice (which can be up to 255 characters).

===reset_dialog_preset_options(short dialog_options)=== Resets dialog box, and then sets buttons and dialog text to one of a list of presets. The meanings of dialog_options are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Empty text, button 1 - ok
|-
| 1
| Empty text, button 1 - leave it, button 2 - take it
|-
| 2
| Text for a lever, button 1 - leave, button 2 - pull
|-
| 3
| Text for a portal, button 1 - leave, button 2 - enter
|-
| 4
| Text for a button, button 1 - leave it, button 2 - push
|-
| 5
| Text for stairs, button 1 - leave, button 2 - climb
|-
| 6
| Text for scrolls, button 1 - leave, button 2 - read
|-
| 7
| Text for a book, button 1 - leave, button 2 - read
|-
| 8
| Text for a wheel, button 1 - leave, button 2 - turn it
|-
| 9
| Text for a trapdoor, button 1 - leave, button 2 - climb
|-
| 10
| Text for a trap, button 1 - leave, button 2 - disarm
|}

===void add_dialog_str(short which_str,char new_text,short indent)=== Sets a line of text for the dialog you are about to display. which_str is the line of text to set (from 0 to 5), new_text is the text string (which can be up to 255 characters), and indent is the number of pixels to indent the line (usually 0).

===void message_dialog(char text1,char text2)=== This call does two different things depending on whether it is used in or out of dialogue mode.

	If not called from dialogue mode, simply displays a dialog box with the text text1 and text2, and the option to select OK. This dialog box will have a Record button.

	If called from a dialogue node (or from a town or scenario script called by that dialogue node), this call forces the next text the character says to be text1, followed by text2. Each of these pieces of text can be at most 255 characters long. (This option is provided mainly to provide backward compatibility with Blades of Exile. This sort of call was how custom dialogue text was set in Blades of Exile, but Blades of Avernum has far superior ways to do it.)

===short run_dialog(short record_button)=== Actually displays the dialog box you have created using the previous functions. Expects the player to choose an option and then returns what was chosen (which will be 1, 2, or 3). If record_button is 1, there will be a button in the dialog box which records the displayed text in the journal. If record_button is 0, the text can’t be recorded.

==Advanced Dialog Box Calls==
===void check_text_response_match(char match_text)=== Checks to see if the last text entered by the player (when you called get_text_response) matches the text match_text. If so, the next time you call got_text_match, it will return 1. Otherwise, it will return 0. Note that the checking is not case sensitive, so “FRED”, “Fred”, and “fred” are considered to all match each other.

===short get_selected_pc()=== Returns the number of the last character selected by run_select_a_pc, or -1 if no character has been selected.

	Note that, whenever a script is called and starts to run, the last character selected is reset to -1. So, for example, if the party stepped on a space and triggered a town script and the very first call was get_selected_pc, the call would return -1, no matter what scripts had done earlier.

===void get_text_response(char top_text)=== Brings up a dialog box asking the player to enter a chunk of text. The text top_text will appear on the dialog box above the text entry field. To then check to see if the player entered a certain word or phrase, use the calls check_text_response_match and got_text_match.

===short got_text_match()=== Returns 1 if the text entered by the player when you last called get_text_response matches the text checked for last time you called check_text_response_match, 0 otherwise.

===void large_draw_pic_dialog(short what_pic,char label_text)=== Brings up a dialog box that displays a large graphic (up to 400x400 pixels) you provide. The graphic will be labeled by the text label_text, which will be at the top. This text can be, at most, 100 characters long. The graphic that is displayed is sheet what_pic.

===short run_select_a_pc(short select_mode)=== Displays to the player a dialog box showing all of his or her party members. The player can either select a party member or the cancel button. The call returns 1 if the party selected a character, and 0 if the player hit Cancel. The character the player selected can be recovered using the call get_selected_pc.

	The select_mode field determines what characters are made available for selection:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Only living, present party members
|-
| 1
| Any party member, even a dead one
|}
If select_mode is 2, no dialog box is displayed. Instead, the choice the player made in any previous calls to run_select_a_pc is set to -1 (no character selected).

===void small_draw_pic_dialog(short what_pic,char label_text)=== Brings up a dialog box that displays a small graphic (up to 200x200 pixels) you provide. The graphic will be labeled by the text label_text, which will be at the top. This text can be, at most, 50 characters long. The graphic that is displayed is sheet what_pic.

==Terrain Script and Creature Script Calls==
These calls can only be made from a creature or terrain script. Note that none of these functions should ever be called outdoors.

===short can_see_loc(short loc_x, short loc_y)=== Returns 1 if there is a clear line of sight from the creature/terrain spot to space {loc_x,loc_y}, and 0 otherwise.

===void damage_nearby(short damage_amount,short radius,short damage_type,short good_evil_or_all)=== Does damage_amount damage of type damage_type to all characters visible to and within radius spaces of creature/terrain spot. If good_evil_or_all is 0, only party-friendly creatures are damaged. If good_evil_or_all is 1, only hostile characters are damaged. If good_evil_or_all is 2, everyone nearby is damaged.

Damage types - 0 - weapon, 1 - fire, 2 - poison, 3 - general magic, 4 - unblockable, 5 - cold, 6 – acid

===short dist_to_char(short which_char)=== Returns the distance of the creature/terrain spot from character which_char.

===short dist_to_loc(short x,short y)===  Returns the distance from the creature/terrain spot to location {x,y}.

===short dist_to_party()=== Returns the distance of the creature/terrain spot from the nearest party member.
Note: NPC's that have joined the party WILL NOT be considered as actually part of the party with respect to this call. This is probably a bug and not a feature, since another side effect of this quirk is that joined NPC's cannot open and close doors or search containers.

===short floor_in_this_spot()=== Returns the floor type the creature or terrain script is located on. This does not work outdoors.

===void force_status_nearby(short status_amount,short radius,short what_status,short good_evil_or_all)=== For all characters visible to and within radius spaces of creature/terrain spot, changes what_status by an amount equal to status_amount. This change cannot be resisted. If good_evil_or_all is 0, only party-friendly creatures are affected. If good_evil_or_all is 1, only hostile characters are affected. If good_evil_or_all is 2, everyone nearby is affected.

===short get_memory_cell(short which_cell)=== It returns the value of that creature or terrain script’s memory cell which_cell.

===short get_nearest_char(short radius)=== Returns the number of the character nearest to the creature/terrain spot which the creature/terrain spot has a clear sight line to. Returns -1 if no such character.

===short get_nearest_evil_char(short radius)=== Returns the number of the character nearest to the creature/terrain spot which the creature/terrain spot has a clear sight line to and which is hostile to the party. Returns -1 if no such character.

===short get_nearest_good_char(short radius)=== Returns the number of the character nearest to the creature/terrain spot which the creature/terrain spot has a clear sight line to and which is friendly to the party. Returns -1 if no such character.

===void heal_nearby(short heal_amount,short radius,short good_evil_or_all)=== Heals heal_amount damage to all characters visible to and within radius spaces of creature/terrain spot. If good_evil_or_all is 0, only party-friendly creatures are healed. If good_evil_or_all is 1, only hostile characters are healed. If good_evil_or_all is 2, everyone nearby is healed.

===short my_loc_x()=== Returns the x coordinate of the creature or terrain spot’s location. This does not work outdoors.

===short my_loc_y()=== Returns the y coordinate of the creature or terrain spot’s location. This does not work outdoors.

===void restore_energy_nearby(short energy_amount,short range,short good_evil_or_all)=== Restores energy_amount spell energy to all characters visible to and within radius spaces of creature/terrain spot. If good_evil_or_all is 0, only party-friendly creatures are energized. If good_evil_or_all is 1, only hostile characters are energized. If good_evil_or_all is 2, everyone nearby is energized.

===void set_memory_cell(short which_cell,short new_value)=== It sets the value of that creature or terrain script’s memory cell which_cell to new_value.

===short set_script_mode(short what_setting)=== For the currently running script (terrain or creature), sets how often it is run. Values for what_setting are
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| call every 8 moves, but not if party is far away
|-
| 1
| Call every 8 moves, even if party is far away
|-
| 2
| Call every move, but not if party is far away
|-
| 3
| Call every move, even if party is far away
|}

===void status_nearby(short status_amount,short radius,short what_status,short good_evil_or_all,short penalty)=== For all characters visible to and within radius spaces of creature/terrain spot, changes what_status by an amount equal to status_amount. For hostile effects, resistances apply. The higher penalty is, the harder the effect is to resist. If good_evil_or_all is 0, only party-friendly creatures are affected. If good_evil_or_all is 1, only hostile characters are affected. If good_evil_or_all is 2, everyone nearby is affected.

===short terrain_in_this_spot()=== Returns the terrain type the creature or terrain script is located on. This does not work outdoors.

==Terrain Script Calls==
These calls can only be made from a terrain script. Note that none of these functions should ever be called outdoors.

===short char_on_me()=== Returns the number of the character standing on the terrain spot, or -1 if there is none.

===short char_who_activated_script()=== terrain scripts are called when a character steps on or searches them. This returns the number of the character that activated the script.

===short get_mechanism_difficulty()=== Gets the current complexity of the terrain script’s mechanism. See the chapter on terrain scripts for more information.

===short get_physical_strength()=== Gets the current physical strength of the terrain script. See the chapter on terrain scripts for more information.

===void set_mechanism_difficulty(short new_difficulty)=== Sets the current complexity of the terrain script’s mechanism  to new_difficulty. See the chapter on terrain scripts for more information.

===void set_physical_strength(short new_strength)=== Sets the current physical strength of the terrain script to new_strength. See the chapter on terrain scripts for more information.

==Movement, AI Functions==
These calls are used to move around and otherwise manipulate creatures. Some of them can only ever be used inside a creature script. In general, you will probably only ever use any of these in a creature script.

===short am_i_doing_action()=== This function can only be called in a character script. Returns 1 if the character currently has a movement path set or a hostile target, 0 otherwise.

===short approach_char(short which_char_or_group,short char_to_approach,short within_dist)=== Has the character move closer to character char_to_approach. If the character is within within_dist, does not move any closer. Returns 1 if the character doesn’t start moving (because the target character is close, dead, or can’t be reached, or because the character is already moving somewhere), 0 otherwise. If this function is called while the character is already moving, nothing happens and 0 is returned.

===void approach_ter_script(short which_char,short which_ter_script, short distance)=== Has the character move closer to the terrain spot with script which_ter_script. If the character is within within_dist, does not move any closer. Returns 1 if the character doesn’t start moving (because the target script doesn’t exist or can’t be reached, or because the character is already moving somewhere), 0 otherwise.

===short approach_waypoint(short which_char_or_group,short waypoint_to_approach,short within_dist)=== Has the Creature/Group start to approach waypoint_to_approach until they are within within_dist spaces of it. Returns 1 if the character doesn’t move (because it is close already or can’t find a path there), 0 otherwise.

===void fidget(short which_char_or_group,short fidget_chance)=== If character is moving, nothing happens. If not, there is a percentage chance equal to fidget_chance that the character will select a visible nearby spot randomly and move to it.

===short flee_char(short which_char,short target_char,short new_dist)=== Has the Creature/Group move away from target_char until it is at least new_dist spaces away. Returns 1 if the character doesn’t move (because it is the right distance already or can’t find a good point), 0 otherwise.

===short maintain_dist_to_char(short which_char_or_group,short target_char,short new_dist)=== Has the Creature/Group move to a random point a distance close to new_dist from character target_char. Returns 1 if the character doesn’t move (because it is the right distance already or can’t find a good point), 0 otherwise.

===short move_to_loc_x_y(short which_char_or_group,short x,short y)=== Has the character move as close a possible to location {x,y}. If the character is already moving, the old destination is forgotten. Returns 1 if the character doesn’t move (because it is close already or can’t find a path there), 0 otherwise.

This call was added for Scenario Format Version 2, only use it with Mac version 1.1 or later or Windows version 1.0 or later.

===short return_to_start(short which_char_or_group,short what_dist)=== Has the character return to the point it started at. Returns 0 if the character is not there and can move closer, returns 1 if it is there or if the path there is completely blocked.

	If the character is currently moving, this call will leave the current destination unchanged and the call returns 0. If you want the character to return to start no matter what, use the stop_moving call first.

===void stop_moving(short which_char_or_group)=== Immediately makes the Creature/Group stop moving and forget the path it was traveling along.

==Combat and Targeting Calls==
These calls are used to control creatures. Some of them can only ever be used inside a creature script. In general, you will probably only ever use any of these in a creature script.

===void do_attack()===  This call can only be used inside a creature script, and only has an effect if the creature in question has a legitimate hostile target. In this case, the creature will select an attack and use it against the enemy. The attack might be a spell, a hostile ability, or a melee attack. If the target is far away and a melee attack is selected, the creature will move closer to its target. Action points for the creature’s actions are deducted automatically. This call can be used even when not in combat.

===void do_attack_tactic(short which_tactic)=== This call is exactly like do_attack, except that you have the option to force the character to strongly prefer a certain sort of attack. The options for which_tactic are:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Act normally. (As if do_attack was used.)
|-
| 1
| Strongly prefer firing missiles or using innate special ability.
|-
| 2
| Strongly prefer to cast a spell.
|-
| 3
| Strongly prefer to use an item in its inventory.
|}

===short get_aggression(short which_char)=== Returns the current aggression of which_char.

===short get_courage(short which_char)=== Returns the current courage of which_char.

===short get_strategy(short which_char, short dummy)=== Returns the current strategy of which_char. See set_strategy for the meanings of the different strategy values. The value of dummy is ignored.

===short get_target()=== This call can only be used inside a creature script. Returns the current hostile target of the creature, or -1 if there is no target.

===short select_target(short which_char_or_group,short within_range,short other_criterion)=== Has the Creature/Group search for and set its hostile target to the best enemy within within_range spaces. This only sets the hostile target. It does not actually make the character do anything. If an appropriate target is found, the call returns 1, 0 otherwise.

If this character has been alerted (by seeing a foe or use of the alert_char function), the character is hostile to the party, and no foes are visible within within_range spaces, the character picks a random member of the party to be its target. It will then hunt the party down (possibly from a long way away).

The field other_criterion allows you to give special criterion for when selecting the target:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Takes any target available.
|-
| 1
| The target must be wounded.
|-
| 2
| The target must be heavily wounded. (i.e. Has lost over half its health.)
|}
Advanced: The character’s aggression (which always defaults to 100) affects whether the character can get a target. When the call tries to get a target, the aggression is the percentage chance that the character will be able to get a target (so if aggression is 75, has a 75% chance of getting a target and within_range is reduced by a quarter). Also, the range is reduced to the aggression percentage (so if aggression is 75 and within_range is 8, it is changed to 6).

===void set_aggression(short which_char_or_group,short new_value)=== Sets the aggression value of the Creature/Group to new_value, which should be from 0 to 100.

	A note about aggression. If a character tries to get a target and its aggression level prevents it, the creature’s turn ends immediately.

===void set_courage(short which_char_or_group,short new_value)=== Sets the courage value of the Creature/Group to new_value, which should be from 0 to 100. A character whose courage is 0 always flees.

===void set_strategy(short which_char_or_group,short new_value)=== Sets the strategy value of the Creature/Group to new_value, which has meanings as follows:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Regular creature.
|-
| 1
| Archer/caster. Always seeks to maintain a safe distance from its target.
|-
| 10
| Regular creature, game never changes its target. (Normally, the game will switch a creature’s target to someone much closer.)
|-
| 11
| Archer/caster, game never changes its target.
|}

===void set_target(short which_char_or_group,short what_target_or_group)=== Manually sets the hostile target for the Creature/Group to what_target. If the value what_target_or_group is the number of a character (i.e. less than 120), sets the target to that character. If the value is for a group (i.e. 1000 + x, for group x), sets the target to be a random member of that group. If the target given is not legitimate (because the given creature is dead, doesn’t exist, or is not hostile), the hostile target is set to -1.

===short target_ok()=== This call can only be used inside a creature script. Returns 1 if the creature has a hostile target and it is alive, 0 otherwise.

===short who_hit_me()=== This call can only be used inside a creature script. It is used by a creature script to determine if the creature has been attacked. The call returns -1 if the character has been attacked, and otherwise returns the number of the creature who last attacked it. This value is remembered by the creature but it is set back to -1 at the end of every turn/combat round (so your script gets one chance to check this, and then it is set back to -1).

==Grouping Calls==
These calls are all used to manage groups: to make them, destroy them, and see who is in them. Remember that group 0 is reserved for the party, and that the other groups are numbered 1 to 7.

	To use a call like set_name or set_level on a group, add 1000 to the number of the group and give that for the value of which_char_or_group. (So to change the level of everyone in group 3 to 45, use the call “set_level(1003,45)”.)

===void add_char_to_group(short which_char,short which_group)=== Places character which_char in group which_group.

===void add_range_to_group(short first_char,short last_char,short which_group)=== Places the range of characters from first_char to last_char into group which_group.

===short char_in_group(short which_char,short which_group)=== Returns 1 if character which_char is in group which_group, 0 otherwise.

===void clear_all_groups()=== Removes all characters from all groups (except group 0).

===short first_group_member(short which_group)=== Returns the first character in the group (the first character added to it), or -1 if the group is empty.

===short num_chars_in_group(short which_group)=== Returns the number of characters in group which_group.

===short random_group_member(short which_group)=== Returns a randomly selected member of group which_group, or -1 if the group is empty. Remember that group 0 is the party.

===void remove_char_from_group(short which_char,short which_group)=== Takes character which_char out of group which_group.

===short what_group_in(short which_char)=== Returns the group the character is in, or -1 if the character is in no group. If the character is in multiple groups, returns the first one. 

	If this call is used in a creature's script, which_char(ME) returns the group the creature is in.

==Messaging Calls==
These calls are all used to pass messages to characters and terrain scripts, and for those scripts to check for and handle the messages. Remember that, right after a character’s or terrain’s script is run, its message is set back to -1, so if you don’t check for a message once, the creature/terrain will miss it.

	These calls have no effect outdoors.

===void broadcast_char_message(short message_range,short what_message,short must_match_attitude)=== This call only has an effect when called from a creature or terrain script. This call broadcasts to every visible creature within message_range spaces of the creature/terrain spot the message what_message. If the message is being broadcast from a creature script and must_match_attitude is 1, the message is only given to creatures with the same attitude as the one sending the message. If the message is being broadcast from a terrain script, must_match_attitude is ignored.

===void broadcast_message_from_x_y(short x,short y,short what_message,short message_range)=== This call gives message what_message to every creature and terrain script that is within message_range spaces of {x,y}, and can be seen from {x,y}.

===void broadcast_terrain_message(short message_range,short what_message)=== This call only has an effect when called from a creature or terrain script. This call broadcasts to every visible terrain script within message_range spaces of the creature/terrain spot the message what_message.

===void give_char_message(short which_char,short what_message)=== This gives message what_message to character which_char.

===void give_ter_script_message(short which_ter_script,short what_message)=== This gives message what_message to terrain script which_ter_script. You can find out the number of a terrain script by selecting it in the editor.

===short my_current_message()=== This call only has an effect when called from a creature or terrain script. Returns the character/terrain spot’s current message, or -1 if there is no message.

==Advanced Item Management Calls==
	These calls have to do with getting information on items in the party's inventory. You can search through a character's items, see what he or she has, and destroy or take them away. Please be very careful with these calls! People work very hard to assemble their gear, and it should not be taken away arbitrarily.

	Each character has 40 item slots, numbered 0 to 39. The first 13 (numbered 0 .. 12) are equipped items. The rest are items in the pack.

	The equipped item slots are numbered as follows:
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| 0
| Armor
|-
| 1
| Weapon
|-
| 2
| Missile
|-
| 3
| Boots
|-
| 4
| Helmet
|-
| 5
| Shield
|-
| 6
| Necklace
|-
| 7
| Bracelet
|-
| 8
| Ring
|-
| 9
| Gloves
|-
| 10
| Cloak
|-
| 11
| Pants
|-
| 12
| Ammunition
|}
	Important note: You can not use ME for which_char for these calls. You must give the actual number for the creature. Inside a creature script, this can be gotten with the my_number() call.

===void destroy_char_item(short which_char,short which_slot)=== Destroys the item held by character which_char in slot which_slot. Be very, very careful when using this call.

	If you destroy an item in a pack (i.e. not equipped), all items in higher slots shift down.

===short get_item_variety(short item_type)=== Returns the variety of item type item_type (which is from 1 to 499). For the list of what the different item varieties are, consult the section on scripting item types.

===short item_type_in_slot(short which_char,short which_slot)=== Returns the type of item held by character which_char in slot which_slot. The item type will be from 1 to 499, or -1 if there is no item in that slot.

===void take_item_char_item(short which_char,short which_slot,short loc_x,short loc_y)=== Takes the item held by character which_char in slot which_slot and moves it to space {loc_x,loc_y} in the current town. Do not use this call outdoors.

==NPCs Joining Party Calls==
	These calls are used to assign characters to travel with the party. When not in combat, these characters will just follow the party around. 

A character who joins the party must have its own script. When in combat mode, they will act according to its script. When do_attack is called, the character will look for targets and attack them. It will not, however, move too far from the party when hunting targets.

===short add_char_to_party(short which_char)=== Attempts to take character which_char and add it to the party. Character slots 4 and 5 are reserved for characters traveling with the party. If both of these slots are full, the call fails. You can't use this command when outdoors or in combat. It functions best when used during a conversation.

	Returns 1 if the character is added to the party, 0 otherwise.

	When a character is added to the party, its character ID remains unchanged. The calls character_in_party and remove_char_from_party will refer to this character ID.

===short character_in_party(short char_flag)=== If a character with character ID char_flag is in the party, returns their character number (which will be 4 or 5). Otherwise, returns -1.

===short remove_char_from_party(short char_flag)=== Checks if a creature with character ID char_flag is in the party. If so, erases that character. It disappears, and no items are dropped. Returns 1 if a creature is erased, 0 otherwise.

===short this_char_is_in_party()=== This call can only be used inside a creature's script. Returns 1 if the creature is part of the party, 0 otherwise.

==Splitting Up the Party Calls==
You can split up the party, so the player only gets to play with one of his or her characters for a while.

	You can only split the party indoors. You must make sure that the split character can’t leave town without reuniting the party.

The call try_to_split_party splits up the party and moves the lone character somewhere else in the town. The reunite_party call restores the party at the location where they split up.

===void reunite_party()=== If the party is not split up, this call does nothing. Otherwise, it immediately reunites the party at the point where they were split up.

===void split_off_one_char(short dest_x,short dest_y,short telep_noise,short which_char)=== Splits up the party (so character which_char is active and the rest are absent). The lone active character is placed at {dest_x,dest_y}. If telep_noise is 0, the split is silent. If it is 1, a teleport noise plays.

===short try_to_split_party(short dest_x,short dest_y,short telep_noise)=== Splits up the party (so only one character is active and the rest are absent). Asks the player to choose a character, with the option of canceling. If the player cancels, the party is not split and the call returns 0. Otherwise, the lone active character is placed at {dest_x,dest_y} and the call returns 1. If telep_noise is 0, the split is silent. If it is 1, a teleport noise plays.

==Custom Item Ability Calls==
These calls are only used for coding the effects of items with custom abilities. When such an item is used, it calls a state in the scenario script. These calls can only be made in that state. 

===short who_is_custom_item_target()=== If the item is used on enemies (like wands), returns the number of the character it was targeted on.

===short who_used_custom_item()=== Returns the number of the party member who used the item.

==Custom Character Ability Calls==
These calls are only used for coding the custom special abilities. When such an ability is used, it calls a state in the scenario script. However, these calls can be used in any sort of script. There are 4 special ability slots, numbered 0 to 3.

===void change_custom_abil_uses(short which_char,short which_abil,short what_change)=== For character which_char, changes the number of uses of ability which_abil by what_change (which can be negative).

===short get_custom_abil_uses(short which_char,short which_abil)=== For character which_char, returns the number of uses of ability which_abil the character currently has.

===void init_special_abil(short which_abil,string abil_name,short what_state_to_call)=== This call should probably be placed in the state LOAD_SCEN_STATE in the scenario script. For custom ability which_abil, sets its name to abil_name and the state in the scenario script that is called when the ability is used to what_state_to_call.

===short who_used_custom_abil()=== This call returns the number of the character in the party who used the custom ability.

==Cutscene Calls==
	These calls are used to manually create cutscenes, dramatic scenes where the player watches what goes on. These calls can position characters, move them around, shift the screen view, and pause the action. None of these calls can be used outdoors.

	Note that calls that move characters or shift the view do not actually redraw the screen. You need to use the force_instant_terrain_redraw call for that.

	When you have a cutscene and want to leave the party where you moved them, be sure to use a block_entry call.

===void erase_text_bubbles()=== Erases all text bubbles on all characters and terrain spots.

===void force_instant_terrain_redraw()=== Immediately redraws all of the terrain. You need to use this call whenever you want the changes made by the Cutscenes calls to be displayed to the player.

===void force_view_center(short x,short y)=== Shifts the terrain view so its center is at {x,y}. Be sure that {x,y} is somewhere in the town visible to the party.

===void march_party(short x,short y)=== Has your party walk a space in the animation. Moves the lead character to spot {x,y}, and has each following character move to the space vacated by the previous character.

===void pause(short tenths_of_second)=== Stops the game for tenths_of_second tenths of a second.

===void relocate_character(short which_char,short x,short y)=== Moves character which_char to {x,y}. This call doesn't check whether the character can legally be there, so be careful not to move a character into solid terrain or onto another character. If the character is dead or doesn't exist, nothing happens.

'''Note:''' The ME paramater doesn't work with relocate_character.

===void set_character_facing(short which_char_or_group,short direction)=== Changes a character which_char's facing. Values for direction: 0 - north, 1 - nw, 2 - west, 3 - sw, 4 - south, 5 - se, 6 - east, 7 - ne.

===void set_character_pose(short which_char_or_group,short pose)=== Sets which pose (version of the graphic) to use for the character. The change will not be visible until you use the force_instant_terrain_redraw call. Note that not all poses are available for the smaller graphic template. When the cutscene is done, you should restore all poses to 0.

The pose values are: 0 - standing. 1 - attacking. 2 - combat ready. 5 - sitting in chair facing north.  6 - sitting in chair facing west. 7 - sitting in chair facing south. 8 - sitting in chair facing east. 11-14 - death poses 1-4. 

===void set_total_visibility(short mode)=== Changes how the game determines whether spaces out of view of the party are visible or not. If mode is 0, the player can not see spots of out view (the normal setting). If mode is 1, the player will be able to see every spot on the screen, whether visible to characters or not. This is used to show areas in cutscenes that are out of view. If you set every space as visible, be sure to set them as not visible before ending the cutscene.

==String Manipulation Calls==
These calls are designed to give the scenario designer a lot more control over the text displayed to the player. They’re a little complicated, but much more powerful.

	Blades of Avernum maintains a string buffer. It is a 255 character long chunk of text in memory. You can clear this buffer, append chunks of text to it, and then dump the buffer into a string variable.

	For example, here is a bit of code.

string sample_string;

clear_buffer(); // empties out the string buffer.

append_string(“Hello, “); // puts this text into the buffer

append_string(“friend.”); // adds this text to the end of the buffer

get_buffer_text(sample_string); // the buffer is copied into string variable sample_string

print_str(sample_string); // prints “Hello, friend.” to the text area

These calls were added for Scenario Format Version 2, only use them with Mac version 1.1 or later or Windows version 1.0 or later.

===void append_char_name(short which_char)=== Appends the name of the character which_char to the end of the string buffer.

===void append_number(short num)=== Appends the number num to the end of the string buffer.

===void append_string(string source_string)=== Appends the text source_string to the end of the string buffer. If the result would be longer than 255 characters, the text is truncated.

===void clear_buffer()=== Empties the text buffer. Sets it to a blank string.

===void get_buffer_text(string dest_string)=== Dest_string must be a string variable. Copies the text in the buffer into dest_string.

==Debugging Procedures==
These are all debugging functions, used to provide information while you write a scenario. They probably should be removed before you actually release your scenario to the public.

===void print_num(short num)=== Prints the number num in the text area.

===void print_nums(short a,short b,short c)=== Prints the numbers a, b, and c in the text area.

===turn_on_debug_mode()=== Enables debug mode for your scenario. To turn on debugging mode, type “}”, followed by “=” (so a right bracket, followed by an equals sign). To turn off debugging mode, type an equals sign. Once on, you can use the following commands:

{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| Shift-’k’
| Kills all hostile monsters in the whole town.
|-
| Shift-’m’
| Magic map. All creatures in the area will show up on the map. Type Shift-’m’ again to turn this off.
|-
| Shift-’g’
| Enter ghost mode. You will be able to walk through walls, and even through blackness. Type Shift-’g’ again to turn this off.
|-
| Shift-’h’
| Heals and restores spell energy for everyone in your group.
|-
| Shift-‘l’
| Add light. Gives the party 100 more turns of light.
|-
| Shift-‘i’
| Advances the time in the scenario one day.
|-
| Shift-‘s’
| Set special items. Dialog boxes will come up asking you for two numbers. The first number you give is the number of a special item. The second number is the number of that special item the party would be set to have&gt; (so if you enter 12 and 4, the party will have 4 of special item 12.)
|-
| Shift-‘f’
| Set Stuff Done Flags. You will be asked for 3 numbers. The first two numbers are the coordinates of a stuff done flag. If the third number is –1, you will be told the value of that flag in the text area. Otherwise, that SDF will be set to the third number. (So if you enter 5, 23, and –1, then the text area will tell you the value of SDF(5,23). If you enter 5, 23, and 8, then SDF(5,23) will be set to 8.
|}
	This call should definitely be removed before you release your scenario.

	Debug mode is automatically turned off whenever you load a saved game or enter a new scenario.

'''Quechua''' (''Runasimi'') is an [[w:Amerindian language|American Indian language]] native to [[w:South America|South America]] and related to [[w:Aymara_language|Aymará]], both members of the Quechumaran linguistic stock. It was the official language of the [[w:Tawantinsuyu|Tawantinsuyu]] ([[w:Inca Empire|Inca Empire]]), and today is spoken in various dialects by some 8 to 13 million people throughout South America. The language's dominion spans the entire South American continent starting as far north as southern [[w:Colombia|Colombia]] and [[w:Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[w:Peru|Peru]] and [[w:Bolivia|Bolivia]], and northwestern [[w:Argentina|Argentina]] and northern [[w:Chile|Chile]]. The dialect as it is spoken in Colombia and Ecuador is known as ''Quichua'' (''Runashimi''), and because of its frequent unintelligibility with the main branch of the language, it borders on being classed as separate. Despite this, all dialects are nonetheless considered a single tongue, consequently making it the most widely spoken of all [[w:Amerindian|American Indian]] languages in the [[w:Americas|Americas]].

The language was extended beyond the limits of the empire by the [[w:Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], which chose it to preach to Indians in the [[w:Andes|Andes]] area. It has, along with [[w:Spanish language|Spanish]] and Aymará, the status of an official language in both Peru and Bolivia. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and the introduction of the [[w:Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]], Quechua had no written alphabet. It did have a system of accountance with [[w:khipu|khipu]]-strings.

Quechua is a very regular language, but a large number of infixes and suffixes change both the overall significance of words and their subtle shades of meaning, allowing great expressiveness. It includes grammatical features such as [[w:bipersonal conjugation|bipersonal conjugation]] and conjugation dependent on mental state and veracity of knowledge, spatial and temporal relationships, and many cultural factors.

A number of Quechua [[w:loanword|loanword]]s have entered [[w:English language|English]] via [[w:Spanish language|Spanish]], including ''[[wikt:coca|coca]]'', ''[[wikt:condor|condor]]'', ''[[wikt:guano|guano]]'', ''[[wikt:gaucho|gaucho]]'', ''[[wikt:Beef_jerky|jerky]]'', ''[[wikt:inca|inca]]'', ''[[wikt:llama|llama]]'', ''[[wikt:pampa|pampa]]'', and ''[[wikt:potato|potato]]''.  The word ''[[wikt:lagniappe|lagniappe]]'' comes from the Quechua word ''nyap'' (&quot;something extra&quot;) with the article ''la'' in front of it, ''la ñapa'', in Spanish.

IB Cultural Anthropology is divided into several volumes. These in turn are divided into chapters that you can read and study for the IB exam. A review of the IB Cultural Anthropology Course is provided under the [[/The Course|Course]] volume. Ethnographic examples will be added into the text as necessary, but it is highly reccommended that you read as many ethnographies before the test as possible (at least five). This text will help you review several ethnographies in the [[/The Ethnographies|Ethnographies]] volume. A description of the IB test itself and strategies for taking it is provided under the [[/The Exam|Exam]] volume.

      <comment>/* Physical Anthropology */ revised discussion of non-human primates</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Anthropology is the study of humans. There are four major subdivisions of this discipline: physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, archaeology, and cultural anthropology. This course will concentrate on cultural anthropology. 

==Physical Anthropology==
'''Physical Anthropology''' is the study of the connection between human physiology and culture. It seeks to explain human variation and evolution in biological terms. For example, why do the Netsilik Eskimos tend to be short and stout, whereas the Nuer and Afar of Ethiopia are generally tall and slim?

Within physical anthropology are several subfields such as forensic anthropology, paleoanthropology, and primate anthropology. '''Forensic anthropology''' is concerned with studying the remains of humans for legal purposes. '''Paleoanthropology''' is the study of human evolution. '''Primatology''' is the study of non-human primates in order to find connections between these species and humans that help understand the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''. Behaviors and physical features found in both human and non-human primates sometimes point to ancient traits held by a shared ancestor more than six million years ago.

==Linguistic Anthropology==
This is the study of the connection between human language and culture. It seeks to explain why a culture communicates the way it does. For example, why do the Yanomamo not have a word for “thank you” in their language? 

Linguistic anthropology also has several subfields, some of which being sociolinguistics and historical linguistics.

==Archaeology==
This is the study of extinct human cultures by excavating their remains. 

Certain subfields of archaeology cross over with other disciplines. For example, paleoanthropology is both a subfield of archaeology and physical anthropology. It is actually a part of a more general subfield of archaeology- prehistoric archaeology. Other subfields of archaeology include classical archaeology and modern archaeology. Classical archaeology is the study of past cultures with a written history (the Greeks, for example). Modern archaeology is the study of modern cultures through excavations. Modern archaeologists might, for example, conduct excavations in city dumps to understand American culture in the 1950s. 

==Cultural Anthropology==
This course will spend most of its time on this subfield of anthropology. This is the study of the cultures of present-day groups. 

Like the other three, this subfield has its own subfields. Some of these include applied anthropology, medical anthropology, ethnology, and ethnography. 

===Applied Anthropology===

'''Applied anthropology''' is the use of the knowledge of the culture of a group to ease interaction between that group and a group with a different culture. 50% of all anthropologists are applied anthropologists. They are used by the UN, corporations, and other organizations. It’s the most profitable field of anthropology, with many jobs in the six-figure range.

===Medical Anthropology===

'''Medical anthropology''' is a branch of applied anthropology. It is the joint use of both a group’s culture and Western medicine to treat illnesses in developing nations. Knowledge of the local culture can be very important. The Trobrianders, for example, believe in witchcraft. If you are sick, then someone has used witchcraft to make you sick. Thus, saying that a previously sick person made someone sick is accusing them of witchcraft. Needless to say, the consequences of that accusation can be severe!

==Ethnology and Ethnography==

'''Ethnology''' is the comparative study of multiple cultures. '''Ethnography''' is a detailed study of a single culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So what is the goal of cultural anthropology? We are attempting to perform a holistic study of culture. How is this accomplished? Fieldwork. 

Prior to modern anthropology, anthropologists did not come in contact with the cultures they studied. Instead, they relied on reports from explorers and missionaries. One of the first modern anthropologists, '''Edward Tylor''', instead said to “go look.” But fieldwork is more than just observation of a culture. Mere observation is not science- there is no hypothesis, no test of any theories, and no practical use for the information. One must formulate a hypothesis about human behavior. One then tests this hypothesis in the field. 

This is not to say that observation is unimportant. On the contrary, if there is no data to support one’s hypothesis, then one’s hypothesis is not scientific either. 

One first must collect data about the culture. One must go into the field and live with the group for at least 18 months in order to gain an adequate understanding of the culture. This is called '''fieldwork'''. 

There are many practical issues in fieldwork: 
*Choosing a site - What sort of culture do you want to study? (European, African, Asian etc).
*What sort of climate do you want to work in? (The Netsilik might not be good if you don’t like the cold.)
*Is this group representative of the culture? Food, shelter, clothing, cleanliness, etc. Where and how does one go to the bathroom?
*Medical issues- You won’t be immune to the local diseases, get your vaccines in good time and remember some need boosting when you get back home.
*Pragmatic- Do men need a beard? (For the Tiwi, men do.) Respect of others way of life in most cases guarantees you the information you're after.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This Module is part of the [[Quechua]] [[w:wikibook|wikibook]]'''

Because Quechua was only recently transcribed into a Latin alphabet, it does not suffer from non-phonetic spellings like English; instead, what you see is what you say. In this course we will use the Quechua writing system as approved by the Peruvian government in 1985.

==Vowels==
There are only three vowel phonemes in Quechua: /'''i'''/ (front close unrounded), /'''a'''/ (central open unrounded), /'''u'''/ (back close rounded), forming a triangular system with two degrees of openness (open and close). In contrast, Spanish has a 5-vowel triangular system (i, e, a, o, u), with three degrees of openness (open, mid and close).

Note this means that '''e''' and '''o''' are phonemic in Spanish but '''not''' in Quechua where they are merely allophonic variants of /i/ and /u/; this is because those vowels contrast and distinguish words in Spanish, so in Spanish it makes sense to spell them differently, but this is not true for Quechua, where the choice of [i]/[e] and of [u]/[o] is determined purely by the phonetic environment in which the phonemes /i/ and /u/ appear and not by meaning.

Strange as it may seem to Westerners to have so few vowels and to not distinguish e and o as independent vowels, Quechua vowel system is far from rare or unique, as several other languages from different parts of the world, such as Classical Arabic and Inuktitut, feature analogous 3-vowel systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">After one has chosen a site and culture to study, one must collect data and write a good, clean description of the culture. There are several ways to collect data about a culture: 
*Participant observation 
*Interviews
*Focus groups
*Surveys. 

==Participant Observation==

Participant observation is by far the most important technique to collect data, and indeed it is fundamental to modern anthropology. Participant observation underlies many of the other techniques of gathering data. '''Participant observation''' is what its name implies- learning about a culture by observing and interacting with it. For example, one might observe members of a group eating food a certain way. You then imitate this to see if it provokes a positive response (since you would now be eating food correctly). Through this method, you have learned more of how members of that culture eat. 

==Interviews==

'''Interviews''' are a more structured form of participant observation. One learns of the culture by questioning informants. An anthropologist will have a key informant who is responsible for most of the information the anthropologist learns. There are two different types of interviews- structured and unstructured. If an anthropologist asks every informant the same question, the interview is '''structured'''. In '''unstructured''' interviews (the more common of the two), the anthropologist may begin with the same question, but will let the conversation take its course, so the topic can end up at any aspect of the culture. 

==Focus Groups &amp; Surveys==

Focus groups and surveys are rarer in anthropology. '''Focus groups''' are rather like structured interviews, but instead of a one-on-one conversation with the anthropologist, the focus group consists of six to eight people. '''Surveys''' are the rarest form of data collection in anthropology because it requires that the studied people be literate. 

==Security==

While collecting data, one must take copious notes, but also must remember to take ethics into account. One might need to use false names or code one’s data some other way. For political and social reasons, anthropology has lots of unpublished data. Whatever technique you use, make sure you are aware you are using it!

==Culture Shock==

Fieldwork is not easy. When you first live with a new culture, you know nothing of that culture and must adjust. People tend to think you are stupid because you don’t know the basic skills people of that culture know- how to build boats, houses, etc. This inability to perform the proper actions and predict the actions of others creates a rather unpleasant feeling called '''culture shock'''. Culture shock lasts for several months, but disappears after you begin to understand the culture better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Purpose of Analysis==

After collecting data, one would need to organize it into a logical form. One collects so much data in the field that without organization, the notes become virtually worthless. But organization is just the first step of analysis. 

For example, one could take notes on North American marriage patterns. After organizing the data, one could list:

*Dating
*Courtship
*Betrothal
*Wedding
*Divorce

This has no analyzation, however. One would need to examine the rights and duties bestowed upon a husband and wife when they become married. In many cultures there is compensation to the woman’s family for the loss of the woman’s labor. After divorce, what can one infer from the custody rights awarded? One would need to formulate a hypothesis as to why North American marriage patterns take this form as opposed to marriage patterns of other cultures of the world.

==Steps Toward Analyzing Data==

In order to make a strong argument for one’s hypothesis, one needs to properly analyze the data. This in turn needs a proper interpretation, which requires a proper selection of the data. Raw field notes are far too numerous and disordered to be simply typed up and published. Most of the observations one makes are irrelevant towards one’s hypothesis and can be ignored. 

After carefully selecting data, one must interpret it correctly. This analyzation is the link between one’s data and one’s hypothesis and it is called the warrant.

==Concepts for Analyzation==

There are several concepts one must understand to correctly analyze data. These are:

*Ethnocentrism
*Naïve Realism
*Culture Bound
*Cultural Relativity
*Emic &amp; Etic
*Models of Thought vs. Models of Action

===Ethnocentrism===
One attempts to avoid '''ethnocentrism''' as much as possible in anthropology. This is the belief that one’s culture is superior to that of others. An ethnocentric anthropologist will judge other cultures by his or her own cultural standards. There are, however, several positives to ethnocentrism. A list of some pros and cons:

Pros
*Everyone is slightly ethnocentric. Recognition of one’s ethnocentrism allows one to recognize one’s biases as well. 
*Ethnocentrism allows one to pinpoint what makes one feel positively about one’s own culture and facilitates comparison between one’s own culture and another.
*Ethnocentrism allows for strong group ties.
*Ethnocentrism allows for social integration
*Ultimately, ethnocentrism leads to a stronger sense of unity than patriotism.

Cons
*Might cause one to misinterpret another culture.
*Can lead to cultural evangelism. 
*A culture can become militaristic in its spread of its culture.
*Cultures can become blinded by their own self-righteousness. 
*Ethnocentrism rationalizes detrimental programs.
*Creates social problems
**Genocide is a result of ethnocentrism
**A slight problem with genocide is that it ends up creating more cultural unity in the oppressed group than before!
*Ethnocentrism can give rise to war.
**These wars are largely ineffective because culture is not a commodity for export.

===Naïve Realism===
This is rather the opposite of ethnocentrism. If one is '''naïvely realistic''', then one paints a romanticized picture of a culture and finds the culture to be superior to one’s own. One must be careful to not see something that appears similar to one’s own culture and therefore assume that the something is exactly like it is in one’s own culture. 

An example of naïve realism is that the life of a cowboy was just riding into the sunset and playing cards in saloons. One ignores the dangers a cowboy faced- disease, stampedes, etc.

===Culture Bound===
This is a state of being unable to observe and study a culture from the culture’s point of view. Anthropologists want to avoid this as much as possible as well- cultures must be evaluated in their own terms.

===Cultural Relativity===
This is the opposite of culture bound. Cultural relativity is the ability to judge a culture based on itself. The thesis behind it is:
----
&lt;center&gt;'''All cultures are unique and can be evaluated only through their own standards.'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
The logical corollary to this thesis is that all cultures are equal. Each custom is valid for the culture that uses it. Thus, one must suspend judgments of other cultures. Anthropologists strive to be as cultural relative as possible. 

Just as there are positives to ethnocentrisms, however, there are problems with cultural relativity. These will be listed briefly here:

*Value-free research is ideal, but impossible.
*It’s hard to find universal values.
**Just about the only one is that involuntary starvation is bad.
*If one takes cultural relativity too far, then one falls into an “anything goes” mindset. 
**The Holocaust was valid in the Nazi culture, but that does not mean we must approve of it. 

In using cultural relativity, one must remember that '''understanding does not necessarily imply acceptance'''.

===Emic &amp; Etic===
Cultural relativity leads directly to the concepts of emic and etic. Analysis of data can be done from two different perspectives. The '''emic''' perspective is that of the native or &quot;insider,&quot; and the '''etic''' is that of the foreigner or &quot;outsider.&quot; Observations made from an emic perspective usually consist of qualitative data and are relevant to only the study of that one particular culture. Observations made from an etic perspective usually consist of quantitative data that can be  compared to other cultures. Both emic and etic observations must be made for an anthropologist to wholly study the culture. 

===Models of Thought vs. Models of Action===
The necessity for both emic and etic observations is demonstrated by the difference between '''models of thought''' and '''models of action'''. Models of thought and models of action are also known as '''ideal''' and '''real behavior'''. Emic observations often lead to models of thought- what a person should do in a specific situation. Etic observations often lead to models of action- what person actually does in that situation. 

An example of ideal vs. real behavior is traffic lights. Most people, when asked what one should do when the light turns yellow will say that it is warning you that the light will turn red soon, so you should slow down. If one actually stands at a street corner and observes traffic when the light turns yellow, one will notice that people speed up instead of slow down! Slowing down is the ideal behavior in that situation, though speeding up, what actually happens, is the real behavior. 

A theory of culture must include both models of thought and models of action, since culture is the product of both actions and the thoughts that lead to those actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

All disciplines have assumptions. Empirical sciences are data-based and assume that theories can be formulated to explain that data. Empirical sciences also assume that data is neutral- which it is not. A '''paradigm''' is a result of these assumptions- it is the existing beliefs, practices, and general perspective of a discipline. The paradigm of a discipline is expressed through various products of the discipline such as laws, theories, generalizations, methods of collecting data, and methods of evaluating data. 

==Paradigm Shift==

Findings that do not fit within the existing paradigm may cause a paradigm shift may occur. This happened with Einstein’s theory of relativity. It was previously believed that time was constant throughout the universe. Einstein showed that it was not, so the paradigm shifted- now the belief is that time is a dimension like space.

==The Paradigm of Cultural Anthropology==

*Anthropology is comparative. 
**It is comparative synchronically and diachronically.
**Ethnography is the short term goal of data. Ethnology is the long term goal.
*Anthropology and culture are holistic.
**A change of one small aspect of a culture will ripple through to the rest of the culture.
*Multiple systems and processes for an action.
**E.g. there are many reasons why different people don’t do the same action of smoking- health, affordability, cosmetic reasons, etc.
*Emic &amp; Etic
**To wholly understand a culture, it must be observed through both an emic and etic perspective.
*Case studies must be made using participant observation.

----
An '''ethnography''' is usually a book that studies a particular culture in depth. Ethnographies do not necessarily need to be books, however- they can also be films. 

==Steps to reading ethnography==
#Find the interpretation.
#*Separate the interpretation from the description
#Examine the selection of data.
#*What did the anthropologist spend the most time on? 
#Examine the theoretical framework the ethnography is working within. 
#Find the fundamental questions the ethnography is trying to answer.
#*These are usually provided in the introduction or first chapter.
#Examine the organization of the ethnography.

==Interpretation vs. Description==

An example of the difference between description and interpretation is as follows:

Examine the “wink.” 

===Description===
A '''description''' of a wink would be: blinking one eye. This, however, is hardly satisfying. 

===Interpretation===
'''Interpretation''' of this data would show that winking is a gesture that indicates: 

*Joviality
*Flirting
*Knowing
*Other emotions 

This would provide a much more thorough understanding of what a “wink” really is.

# Make a game based on Celestia... Mostly Harmless project stalled...            Star Control! The next version of Star Control!
# Someone make an editor that allows us to tweak Celestia more easily and make worlds of our own. I'm a real lazy pig and all the .ssc generators I've checked out so far don't do a real good job.
# I have some worldwind cache-packs (folder with 50/200/800/3200/12800 little pictures). renaming to celestia-style should be no problem. but celestia starts 2x1x512pixel - and worldwind begins 10x5x512.
# Merging the goodness of World Wind, Celestia and Google Earth together!
# Make a recopilation of high resolution add-ons in a single pack, with most realistic data from official databases periodically updated. An auto-update could be great in order to manage the downloads of a large pack. Or it could be shared in a P2P network. Make a real 3D universe is now possible!
# Why not space agencies improve more this great project?
# Let Celestia include Google Earth and automatically run it when it detects the user wanting to zoom in on Earth (maybe bad idea)...
# Better promotion of this great and spectacular program (better promotion = biggest community = more developers = faster development of Celestia)
#cooperation with space agencies and another scientific institutions (universities, observatories etc.)
#Better main website (more screen shots, promo video, news about future versions, info from [http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4053&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=esa/ this] with pictures [http://public.fotki.com/ormstont/marsis_deployment/pict0705.html/ +] [http://public.fotki.com/ormstont/marsis_deployment/pict0731.html +], info about Celestia Wiki) and maybe new address
# Maybe (in far future) some spectacular computer benchmark based on Celestia (if Celestia engine needs more developers it's a good &quot;bait&quot; ;)
# Basic version with better textures and models (and version for &quot;low end&quot; computers)
# More configurations options in user interface
# [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_rendering HDR Rendering] as soon as possible and more graphic options for modern GPUs


# I believe that an educational web-based interactive game/simulator would really be beneficial.  I am a software engineer who would be interested in such a collaboration. prosetto@msn.com

'''Reaktor Wikibook''' (URL: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Reaktor) is a project started after many discussions between users on [http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?forum_us Reaktor User Forum]. Everybody agrees, that Reaktor is a very powerfull system, but unfortunately the documentation is poor and therefore it's difficult to learn and advance in Reaktor. Few people wanted to start a &quot;tutorial&quot;, but there was no adequate media for it. Wikibook seems to be perfect.

Regardless of the sound card you choose, if you use Windows you will have to tweak your system to get smooth low latency operation. Some basic tips:

# If it's a PCI sound card, make sure it's not sharing an IRQ with anything. In the device manager, choose view resources by type and make sure nothing else is on the same IRQ as your card. If there is, you might try moving it to a different PCI slot.
# Turn off screen savers, virus scanners, firewalls, Palm Pilot sync and any other memory resident programs that might interfere. A hardware gateway/router that does NAT is a good idea if you have a highspeed connection - running a Windows-based computer on a highspeed connection with no firewall at all is suicidal. 
# DO NOT lower the hardware acceleration on your video card as some resources have suggested. Running in 16 bit color could help. [http://www.rme-audio.com/english/techinfo/lola.htm more info]
# Make sure you have the latest drivers for your unit.

==Recommended soundcards==
* [http://www.echoaudio.com/Products/CardBus/IndigoDJ/index.php Echo Indigo DJ] Portable CardBus card for a laptop, doesn't require power supply, very low latency ~5ms, two independent outputs (line, phones), non-exclusive driver, which allows to run multiple sound application at the same time and mix their signal on the card
* [http://www.rme-audio.de/english/hdsp/multifa.htm RME Multiface] 8-in 8 out interface with PCI card or Cardbus, very low latency ~5ms
* [http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Audiophile2496-main.html M-Audio 24/96] An inexpensive low latency solution, good for beginners. ~5ms or less with a bit of tweaking.
* [http://www.01xray.com 01Xray site dedicated to the 01X]The yamaha 01X is ideal for Reaktor as not only do you get a low latency soundcard ~5ms or less but yo also get a control surface which is great for tweaking all those knobs and faders in Reaktor.  RRP £1299 although it is available for about £1000 from most retailers.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Description ==

If you come from [[Programming:C|C]]/[[C++|C++]] you are probably used to the fact that every element of an [[Ada Programming/Types/array|array]], [[Ada Programming/Types/record|record]] and other variables has an address. The [[Programming:C|C]]/[[C++|C++]] standards actually demand that. In Ada this is not true.

Ada is a self optimizing language &amp;mdash; there is for example no '''register''' keyword like in [[Programming:C|C]]/[[C++|C++]]. Ada compilers will use a register for storage automatically. Incidentally, most [[Programming:C|C]]/[[C++|C++]] compilers nowadays just ignore the '''register''' and allocate registers themselves, just like Ada does.

So if you want to take an [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access]] from any variable you need to tell the compiler that the variable needs to be in memory and may not reside inside a register. This is what the [[Ada Programming/Keywords|keyword]] aliased is for. Additionally it also serves as a hint to the reader of the program about the existence of pointers referencing the variable.

== For variables ==

 I : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer := 0;

== For type declarations ==

=== For the elements of an array ===

Declaring an {{Ada/kw|array}} as {{Ada/kw|aliased}} will only ensure that the array as a whole has an address. It says nothing about the individual elements of the {{Ada/kw|array}} &amp;mdash; which may be packed in a way that more than one element has the same address. You need to declare the actual elements as aliased as well. You can read in [[Ada Programming/Types/array#with_aliased_elements|Types/array]] how this is done. Here is just a short example:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Has_Appointment {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Boolean;

=== For the elements of a record ===

Just like arrays, declaring a record as aliased will only ensure that the record as a whole has an address. It says nothing about the individual elements of the record &amp;mdash; which again may be packed and share addresses. Again you need to declare the actual elements as aliased as well. You can read in [[Ada Programming/Types/record#with_aliased_elements|Types/record]] how this is done. Here is just a short example:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       A : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I was reading through the preface of your ''Logic'' in the ''Introduction to Philosophy'' wikibook. You say you need some help with the modal logic part of the book. I believe I could actually help with writing that part (as long as the tone is introductory). ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 20:34, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC))
----
O.K., Work on the Modal Logic part has started. I will assume some basic knowledge of propositional logic and predicate logic (which are previous sections, so that should be all right). ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 13:03, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC))

Hello again,&lt;br /&gt;
I will also be working on the Wikiversity [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversidad:Departamento_de_Filosof%C3%ADa Spanish School of Philosophy]. For the time being, I am just translating my contributions to the English School of Philosophy into Spanish, but, as I am presently working on the ''Logic'' course, I thought it might be a good idea to start translating what has been done so far in the logic part of the ''Introduction to Philosophy'' wikibook into Spanish. Is that O.K.? (In the sections that you have written, I would only take credit for the translation, of course). Do you think I should wait until more of the text has been done? ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 20:31, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC))
----
Hi. &lt;br /&gt;
Don't worry about slow progress. I am even slower, I'm afraid. I was hoping that translating the logic course into Spanish might be a good idea because I can keep working on the Wikiversity while I am not feeling creative. &lt;br /&gt;
I agree about the differences between languages. I also find it very interesting. One would expect to find the Spanish School of Philosophy with a greater emphasis on continental philosophy. That will not be the case for the time being, however, because I am virtually the only person writing any content in it.&lt;br /&gt;
You asked me about myself in your last message. I don't think there is very much to say. I ''do'' have a small weblog that I haven't written in for quite some time. There is a link to it on my [[User_talk:Alex_beta|user page]]. I graduated from Sussex University (I believe you spent some time there too), but I have also been studying philosophy elsewhere. In addition, I am half way through a Physics degree and I have just started a Social and Cultural Anthropology degree this year (you can study more than one degree simultaneously where I live). &lt;br /&gt;
My philosophical interests are all over the place. I can't think of any field of philosophy that I am not interested in (although I have lost some interest in the Philosophy of Mind and the Philosophy of Science recently). I am now reading about Heidegger, Husserl and Gadamer, mainly, but I don't think I'll be writing about that for a long time. ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 20:08, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC))

==Wikiversity==

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

==Looking for help==
Dear Publunch:
My name is Ivan Robaina Bychko and I am a almost 20 years old Cuban wikipedian and universitary student. I am very intersted in Philosophy and logic and I am working to write an article at my university about the history of philosophy, since it seems that no university teacher is willing to help, it seems you are the right guy for it. I do not have internet connectivity (only wikipedia and e-mail), but I think we could contact via e-mail, please, if you are willing to help me, let me know at my e-mail: nayesda.daria@medired.scu.sld.cu
Thanks,
Ivan

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Publunch. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Publunch~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Judicial Branch of the United States has the de facto role of evaluating both the legislative and executive branches of the United States Federal government. Laws which are passed by the legislative branch can be declared null and void by the Supreme Court, and the actions of a sitting president can be called into question by the judicial and legislative branches.

However, there is neither a formal nor informal check on the power of the judicial branch itself; decisions made by the Supreme Court are final and can only be overturned or modified by future Supreme Court justices and the principle of precedence. As such, it can be argued that the judicial branch can potentially operate contrary to or without the mandate of the electorate.

United States Supreme Court Justices are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. In theory, this procedure allows both the executive and legislative branches to have some power over the judiciary and thus &quot;check&quot; the judicial branch's power. However, following confirmation by the Senate, all Supreme Court justices hold office for life unless they are impeached or they voluntarily retire. 

The principle of checks and balances allows branches of government to be &quot;isolated from each other so that no branch has total power over all functions of government...an attack on or abuse of power by individuals of a single branch will not lead to tyranny or the fall of the entire government.&quot; The judicial branch, however, holds the potential to nullify laws approved by the legislative branch, disregard the executive branch, and, in essence, control the rule of law in the United States in accordance to the opinions of its sitting justices.

While there have not been any historically prominent abuses, the United States has had a history of irregular and even hypocritical laws as justices rotate and the political atmosphere of the country changes.


----

There are several checks on the powers of the Judicial branch.  First, they can only pronounce on those cases brought before them.  Judges cannot make law.  They can only interpret laws, treaties and the constitutions of the states and the United States.  If Congress feels that a law has been misinterpreted, they can pass laws to clarify their meaning as has been done many times before.  If enough people feel that the Constitution is wrong, it too can be amended as it has been 27 times to date.  Judges are subject to impeachment and removal by the Congress, and Congress may, by law, establish how the courts operate and within some constitutional limits, Congress may decide which cases are heard by which courts and how large courts are.

Some people have proposed that judges be elected or their ruling subject to overrule.  Elected judges are not independent.  They will rule based on what is popular, rather than what the laws provide.  Many rights that we now take for granted were once restricted based on majorities.  Inter-racial marriage, restrictions on speech, and even a woman's right to work were once restricted based on popularly supported laws.  An independent judge can make the tough decisions that an elected judge would be afraid to make.

In [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa78.htm The Federalist No. 78], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton Alexander Hamilton] wrote: &quot;The standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government. In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws.&quot;

Hamilton goes on to quote from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Secondat%2C_Baron_de_Montesquieu Montesquieu]'s Spirit of Laws Vol. 1 that &quot;there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.&quot;

===Snapshot changes to &quot;init&quot; when rendering audio===
Q: from [http://www.native-instruments.com/forum/showthread.php?s=6e97dc2027133bc15b3f4fa4f94aab6b&amp;threadid=15166 Reaktor User Forum]: When using a user-created ensemble or synth, when I try to render audio, the preset always reverts to &quot;init&quot; and I'm not able to export an audio file. This also occurs when I push stop on the Cubase transport. However, this thing doesn't happen when using one of the native Reaktor factory ensembles or synths. I've tried just about everything to no avail. The user ensebles are all current versions, and Reaktor is updated to the latest version. Any ideas?

A: Make sure that the inspector in Cubase is set to the snap you want to use

In Sonar 4, one way to open a softsynth is to click the &quot;Synth Rack&quot; button on the VIEWS toolbar, and then use the Insert button on the synth rack's toolbar (a big + sign). Alternatively (or if the Synth Rack isn't already open), it's slightly quicker to just click INSERT on the main menu and select from the dropdown entries under &quot;DXi Synth&quot;.

'''Note''' -- Reaktor shows up under &quot;NI&quot; as if it were a ''type'' of plugin (alongside the VST plugins). 

With Reaktor showing up as an instrument in the Synth Rack, click the Properties button in the Synth Rack's toolbar to display the Reaktor plugin window.

Once open, Reaktor's plugin view will ask for an initial Ensemble. The default view of the Reaktor Browser doesn't initially show Ensembles, so you can't immediately drag and drop into the blank part of the window as it suggests. First, you must navigate to an ensemble to load (which you can drag/drop), or you can right-click in the blank area and choose New Ensemble.

If you're using Reaktor as a softsynth, you'll probably want to add a MIDI track. To do this, right-click in Sonar's track pane and choose &quot;Insert MIDI Track&quot;. Then click on the Output selector in the MIDI track and select Reaktor1 from the list.

The output of the synth has to go somewhere, so you'll probably want to create an audio track also (Right-click; choose &quot;Insert Audio Track&quot;). Then click on the Input selector in the audio track and select Reaktor 1 Main from the list.

'''Note''' -- Reaktor plugins can be synths or FX processors, so they also show up (as expected) in the track or Console views when you want to add an FX module in any track's FX bin.

--[[User:Ashtangakasha|Allen]] 22:53, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Due to the combination of Sonar's excellent DXi automation handling, and Reaktor's incredibly flexible DXi / MIDI dual automation features, there are a number of different ways of recording and manipulating Reaktor ensemble control information.

# To be able to record direct movement of Reaktor ensemble UI controls into Sonar as automation data, you must insert a Reaktor instance (either DXi or wrapped VSTi version) directly into the FX Bin of a Sonar Audio track. It does not work if you insert it into the Synth Rack first.  Load up the Reaktor ensemble you want to use and ensure the automation controls are sorted and organised as desired.  Then right-click on the Reaktor label in the Sonar track's FX Bin and click &quot;Arm Parameter&quot; from the context menu.  This now lists all the automation parameters exposed by the loaded Reaktor ensemble.  Either select a subset, or (easier) just click Arm All.  You should now see the Record Automation icon button in Sonar Transport toolbar become clickable (changes from greyed out appearance).  Set the Now Time marker where you want to start the automation recording from.  Click the Record Automation icon button and start wiggling those Ensemble knobs and faders!  Press spacebar or click the Transport Stop button to stop recording when you are done. Sonar will display any movements as new track envelopes, handilly labelled with the appropriate Ensemble parameter.
# Having inserted a Reaktor instance in a Sonar track's FX bin, right click somewhere in the clips pane and select Envelopes -&gt; Create Track Envelope -&gt; Reaktor 1 ... A dialog window is displayed listing all automatable parameters .. but in my version of Sonar (v4.01), this list is just a bunch of numbers from P0001 to P1000 (a bug?).  All is not lost .. click on the Reaktor ensemble panel control you want to create an envelope for, and look at the UI control's Properties pages.   Find the &quot;Global ID&quot; field listed at the bottom of the Connection properties page (say &quot;117&quot; for a Filter cutoff knob).  Go back to the envelope popup window and select the P0117 checkbox. Click OK, and a new track envelope appears labelled with the panel control name.  Adjust enevelope to taste.
# If you have a midi control box, you can use its physical knobs and faders instead of directly controlling Reaktor ensemble UI controls with a mouse.  For each ensemble UI control you want to remote control, display the UI control's own Connections property page. Ensure &quot;Remote to MIDI&quot; is turned on.  Map the control to the physical knob or slider you want to use (e.g. use MIDI learn).  Repeat for all the ensemble controls you want to hook up to your midi controller box. Now proceed as described in #1 above, but instead of using your mouse to move the UI controls, use your MIDI controller box.  Any movements get converted into track envelopes, labelled with the UI control's name.
# This is probably the least preferred option of recording automation data from a Reaktor ensemble, as it requires a separate MIDI track to be used and treats all the automation data as pure MIDI CC data. However,  this is the only way to send automation data to a Reaktor ensemble if the Reaktor instance was inserted into the Synth Rack, and not into a specific track's FX Bin.  Why would you want to do that? Inserting a Reaktor instance into the Sonar SynthRack allows you to send outputs of multi-timbral Reaktor ensembles to multiple audio tracks for further, separate processing, for example.  OK, so insert a new Reaktor plugin instance using the Sonar SynthRack, and create (at least) one audio track and one associated MIDI track.   Load up the ensemble you want to use into the Reaktor plugin.  Open the Ensemble properties page and ensure the &quot;Activate MIDI in&quot; and &quot;Activate MIDI out&quot; boxes are switched on in the Connections property page.  Then do the same for all the ensemble Instruments you want to record panel automation from.  Now, for each UI control you want to record movements for, ensure the &quot;Activate MIDI In&quot; and &quot;Panel to MIDI&quot; switches are on, and a MIDI cc number is defined.  Set the Now Time marker where you want to start recording.  Select the MIDI track, and arm it for recording (the &quot;R&quot; button turns red).  Press the main Transport Record button (not the Record Automation button this time).  Now perform the UI control movements you want to record.  When you are done, click Stop.  Sonar has recorded your UI panel movements as a series of MIDI CC events.  Rewind, and press Play.  Sonar sends the recorded MIDI cc data back to Reaktor, and you should see the panel controls repeat the movements you just recorded.  If you want, you can then convert the MIDI cc data into a MIDI track envelope using Sonar's Edit -&gt; Convert MIDI to Shape .. command.
# Of course, you can use a physical midi controller in #4 above instead of using a mouse to manipulate the ensemble's controls.  Set up the mapping between the physical controller and the UI ensemble controls as described in #3 above.  Arm the MIDI track for recording, hit the Record button in the Transport bar, and move the physical MIDI controllers knobs and sliders to generate CC data which will get recorded into the MIDI track, and passed through to the Reaktor plugin receiving MIDI data from that MIDI track.

__NOTOC__
== Bulgarian Cuisine ==

'''Bulgarian food''' could easily be called one of the wonders of this world. Its unique character has developed through the ages out of wealth of local culinary traditions, intertwined with foreign influence in a way which is possible only in Bulgaria, a culture rich in history and traditions. The result, the unique Bulgarian cuisine, offers an incomparable taste with unique characteristics, originality and exceptional variety.

The variety in Bulgarian cuisine is based on the long history of the country, as well as on the long-lasting migrations of the tribes that founded Bulgaria more than 1300 years ago. The close contact with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Turkey|Turkey]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greece]] have helped us form a very attractive, and to some extent exotic, national cuisine, including some dishes which cannot be called national but which are typical of Bulgaria only. That's one of the things Bulgarians miss most when they are abroad and one of the things that make them come back. 

Indeed, who would not like the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruits, juicy meat, grilled or served with piquant sauces, mouth-watering vegetarian dishes, simmered slowly on low heat, the [[Cookbook:Egg, Cheese and Phyllo Casserole (Banitsa)|banitsa]] (cheese pie) which simply melts in your mouth, and famous Bulgarian [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]].

If you go to the country, good food will be just a part of what you'll be impressed by. Because, above all, Bulgaria is a state of traditions. And whatever you eat, you'll be told that it is a part of a particular custom, i.e. if the meal is on the menu, it's just because it is on the custom.  

Many of the Bulgarian products and dishes are known in various other parts of the world. But it's a pity that very few foreigners know how to cook original Bulgarian meals. Gourmets have long since esteemed the merits of Bulgarian cuisine with the verdict that it is tasty, spicy and varied, appealing to one and all.   

So, what's actually the secret? Above all, the concurrent cooking of products at a low temperature. Make sure that the food simmers—boil, roast or stew gently. That is the only way to retain the nutritive qualities, achieving superb favour at the same time. The same effect is reached with the variety of products which agree well with the seasoning.  

If you are invited to someone's home or choose a good traditional restaurant you'll be able to sample what's best about Bulgarian cuisine; plenty of fresh [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], eaten raw, roasted or stewed with [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] in terracotta pots. Lots of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]]. Influences of its neighbours, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Turkey|Turkey]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greece]] are also present in dishes such as &quot;[[Cookbook:Cabbage Rolls in Yogurt Sauce (Sarmi)|Sarmi]]&quot; (vine or [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] leaves stuffed with minced meat with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] and spices), &quot;[[Cookbook:Moussaka (Bulgarian)|moussaka]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cookbook:Baklava|baklava]]&quot;.

Bulgarians like their [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]]: A salad and '''Rakiya''' (Bulgarian spirit manufactured through distillation of fermented [[Cookbook:Grape|grapes]], [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]] or other fruits. Its alcoholic content is 36-55o) are the usual start to the meal. Be warned, this stage of the meal can be a very drawn-out process lasting up to an hour.

== Bulgarian Recipes ==
A wealth of Bulgarian recipes (in English) could be found on [http://www.findbgfood.com Find Bulgarian Food] website. Here are some of the more popular Bulgarian meals, salads and desserts, well worth a try:
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Shopska Salata|Shopska Salata]]&quot;- chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppers]] sprinkled with '[[Cookbook:Sirene Cheese|sirene]]' (Bulgarian white [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]);
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Snezhanka|Snezhanka]]&quot;- thick creamy [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] with chopped cucumber or [[Cookbook:Pickle|gherkins]], [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] and garlic;
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Kyopulo|Kyopulo]]&quot;- hors d'oeuvre/salad of mashed baked [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]], peppers, loads of garlic, [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] and [[Cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sunflower oil]]. 

Soups are also a very important element in the Bulgarian menu;
* &quot;[[Cookbook:White Bean Soup (Bob Chorba)|Bob Chorba]]&quot;- traditional [[Cookbook:Bean|bean]] soup with plenty of [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]];
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Zelenchukova Supa|Zelenchukova Supa]]&quot;- Vegetable soup
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Mushroom Soup (Gabi Supa)|Gabi supa]]&quot;- tasty [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]] soup
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Tripe soup (Shkembe Chorba)|Shkembe Chorba]]&quot;- [[Cookbook:Tripe|tripe]] soup with garlic, vinegar and [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], quite tasty if you can bring yourself to try it;
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Tarator|Tarator]]&quot;- cold yoghurt and [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] soup. 
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Bulgarian Meatball Soup (Supa Topcheta)|Supa Topcheta]]&quot;-Bulgarian [[Cookbook:Meatballs|meatball]] soup

Bulgarians like meat - mainly [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] (svinsko), [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] (teleshko) and [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (pile)- grilled, [[Cookbook:Fry|fried]] or as a [[Cookbook:Stew|stew]]:
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Shashlik|Shashlik]]&quot;-Small pieces of meat on a skewer, with [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppers]], onions and baby mushrooms
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Gyuvetch|Gyuvetch]]&quot;- hotch-potch) - a dish of vegetables and meat baked in an earthenware pot;
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Roasted Meatballs (Kyufteta)|Kyufteta]]&quot;- spicy [[Cookbook:Meatballs|meat balls]]/ [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburgers]];
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Bulgarian fresh sausage (Kebapcheta)|Kebapcheta]]&quot;- spicy mince meat, [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] shaped, grilled.

Very popular is also [[Cookbook:Gyuveche|Gyuveche]], a catch-all dish,  you can make with just about anything you have in the fridge. It gets its name from the small individual ceramic dishes in which it's traditionally cooked and served.

'''Vegetarians''' may find the choice on the menu a bit limiting which is a shame as there are plenty of delicious vegetarian dishes. Usually you can find the following but if all else fails try a selection of starters or a combination salad (a plate of various salads): &quot;[[Cookbook:Kashkaval Pane|Kashkaval (or sirene) pane]]&quot;- fried/breaded yellow (or white) [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]];
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Red Bell Peppers Stuffed with Cheese and Egg (Chushki Byurek)|Chushki byurek]]&quot;- roasted fried peppers stuffed with [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] and cheese;
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Sirene po Shopski|Sirene po Shopski]]&quot;- white cheese, egg, tomatoes and peppers baked in a pot;
* &quot;[[Cookbook:Egg, Cheese and Phyllo Casserole (Banitsa)|Banitsa]]&quot;- baked thin sheets of [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]] with a filling of white cheese and eggs or vegetables

== Bulgarian Wine ==
The fame of Bulgarian high-quality [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] speaks for itself.  The Bulgarian white and red wines such as Gumza, Dimiat, Pamid, Muscat, Misket, Mavrud and Melnik are well known to connoisseurs. 
Traditionally, Bulgaria boasts five wine-growing regions, specialized in the production of typical wines. In general, South Bulgaria is known for its red wines, North Bulgaria for white wine. The Black Sea area, too, is an important viticultural region, Bourgas, Pomorie and Varna being its three main centers. The smallest viticultural region in Bulgaria - the area around Melnik famous for its full-bodied red wine - is known for its specific microclimate. 
 
Bulgaria is also the only country to celebrate ''Wine-growers''' Day. February, 3rd (new style Feb 14th) which is in fact the day which we call ''Trifon Zarezan'' (St.Trifon's Day).  It dates back to the ancient Thracians.  Winegrowers celebrate with wine-trimming ceremonies on this day. So this is a celebration dedicated to  a drink, which is not celebrated anywhere else in the world. It is also essential that one knows that Bulgarian wine has very long traditions and is famous for its quality. The identity of St. Trifon's Day proves the importance of this day for the Bulgarians.

The vocabulary for excersize 8 was not discussed

== Roman Numerals ==

The Romans did not write IX for 9 but VIIII instead.  The system that subtracts the value of a symbol if it is to the left of a higher valued symbol is a mediaeval invention.  In classical Roman times the position of the symbols had no significance.  At least that is my understanding, I'll see if I can find some references. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 16:05, 20 January 2006 (UTC)


Would it be OK to suggest someone put it in some Latin examples for each of the uses of the dative? The genitive examples are good. The same thing for the dative would be useful. --[[User:59.167.249.210|59.167.249.210]] 22:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

==Split?==
I think that the genitive and dative cases are a bit too substantial to introduce them both in one lesson. I suggest that the genitive and dative cases be split into two lessons? What say you people? --[[User:BiT|BiT]] 21:30, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

-I agree. I think the concepts should be separated.

== Vowel Length ==

Very good overall, I just should like to point out that some macrons are missing and some have been put incorrectly. Eg, imperator (ought to be imperātor); sēx (ought to be sex).

I ask for someone with more knowledge to check these if possible.</text>

This popular Bulgarian dish makes one serving.

== Ingredients ==
* About 200-300 grams cheese (you may use as many different kinds of cheese as you like, but make sure to include feta cheese as it is the traditional one for this dish and is not as oily when it melts)
* 1 egg
* various chopped herbs

And everything else is optional because Bulgarians use whatever is left over in the fridge to make this dish: 
* any kind of cooked chicken, pork, or beef
* any kind of sausages or hot dogs
* vegetables: tomatoes, peppers, small hot pepper, mushrooms, cooked potatoes
* fresh greens: parsley, dill, celery leaves

== Procedure ==

# Chop or dice everything you want to put in. 
# Make alternating layers of cheese, meat, and vegetables, and finish with cheese. 
# Bake in the oven at 200 C (app. 375 F) for 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted. 
# Break the egg on top and put back in the oven for another 5-10 minutes depending on how well-done you like your eggs. 
# Serve with fresh bread or toast. Enjoy!

__NOTOC__
This is a popular dish from Bulgaria and can be eaten on its own or as part of a main meal.  This recipe will serve 2-3 people and can be prepared in less than an hour. This recipe is adapted from [http://www.roesing.net/recipes/banitsa.html Ralitsa Roesing's kitchen].

==Ingredients==
* 2 packets of [[cookbook:phyllo dough|phyllo dough]], a low fat pastry, (Bulgarian &quot;fini kori&quot; or phyllo from the frozen desserts section)
* 200 grams of yellow [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (Bulgarian kashkaval or a mixture of [[cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]] and [[cookbook:mozzarella|mozzarella]])
* 500 grams of white cheese (Bulgarian sirene or [[cookbook:Feta Cheese|Feta cheese]])
* 7 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 100 grams of [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1/2 cup of soda water
* 1 cup [[cookbook:yogurt|yogurt]]

==Procedure==
# Mix six of the eggs, the grated butter, the crumbled white cheese, the yellow cheese cut in small pieces, and the yogurt. 
# In a buttered pan, lay a layer of the phyllo dough, spread a layer of the mixture, and continue alternating layers so that the phyllo and the mixture are finished about the same time. 
# Finish with a layer of phyllo dough. 
# Cut the banitsa into serving pieces. 
# Mix the last egg with the soda water and stir. 
# Pour the mixture over the banitsa and make sure there are no pieces of the phyllo dough left dry.
# [[cookbook:Bake|Bake]] in a preheated oven at 200 °C (390 °F) for 40 minutes, or until golden. Enjoy!

Alternative: Instead of piling the phyllo leaves on top of each other, just spread the mixture on the phyllo, top with a little soda and roll two of the leaves up around the mixture. The rolled phyllo is then aligned in a spiral in the pan. Sprinkle with some oil before baking.

==Variations==
===Spinach Banitsa===
Same as the regular banitsa recipe, but substitute 3 eggs with 1/2 kilogram [[cookbook:spinach|spinach]], washed, cut and lightly fried (no more than five minutes).

===Green Onion Banitsa===
Same as the regular banitsa recipe, but substitute 3 eggs with 5-10 stalks of [[cookbook:green onion|green onion]] (about 1 cup diced onion), lightly fried (no more than ten minutes).

== Ingredients ==
* 500 g yogurt 
* 1 cup (240ml) water 
* 1 or 2 diced cucumbers (diced is far better than grated, although at many restaurants they grate them) 
* a couple of spoonfuls chopped dill 
* salt, vinegar and oil to taste 
* optional: a couple of spoonfuls chopped walnuts 

== Procedure ==
# Mix all the ingredients and serve cold in a soup dish. Use enough water so the soup is about the consistency of milk. Add a couple ice cubes if it's not cold.
# If you use all of the above ingredients without the water and strain the yogurt until it becomes half in volume, you can make a salad. It is referred to as  &quot;Snezhanka&quot; (Snow White) or mlechna salata (yogurt salad). The main difference is that people traditionally use pickles/gherkins for Snezhanka and fresh cucumbers for Mlechna Salata.

'''Moussaka''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] minced meat dish, resembling a casserole. For the Greek version of this dish, see [[Cookbook:Greek_Moussaka|Greek Moussaka]]. This recipe is adapted from [http://www.roesing.net/recipes/moussaka.html Ralitsa Roesing's kitchen].

==Ingredients==
*1/2 kg of minced meat (usually [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] in Bulgaria, but don't hesitate to experiment!)
*1 kg of [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled and finely chopped
*two [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], finely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]], 1/3 cupful, finely chopped
*one [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped

*1 cup [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
*2 spoonfuls [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
*[[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] for cooking

==Procedure==
#Fry the onion and the minced meat in a little oil. The more fatty the meat is, the less oil you need. 
#When it is no longer red, mix it with the potatoes, tomatoes, and parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
#Bake for about 1 hour, or until the potatoes are cooked. 
#Stir the eggs, the yogurt and the flour together and pour it over the dish. Bake for 10 more minutes. It's delicious with cold yogurt on the side. Enjoy!

== Ingredients ==
* 1 kg minced meat (60% pork + 40% beef; if meat is very lean modify to 75% pork + 25% beef or kepabcheta will be dry)
* 1 onion, very finely minced, or processed to paste
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin (sometimes spelled &quot;cummin&quot;; botanical name: Cuminum Cyminum) 
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* salt to taste

== Procedure ==
# Salt the meat, mix well, cover, and let stand in the refrigerat for 1-2 hours.
# Then mix with cumin, black pepper, onion, and some water (5-6 tablespoons).
# Let stand for another 2 hours.
# Form into oblong rissoles (skinless sausages) and grill on medium-high heat.
# DO NOT OVERCOOK, OR YOU WILL END UP WITH DRY AND CRUMBLY KEBAPCHETA, which are totally uncharacteristic.
# Serve hot with your choice of sides. They are best with golden French fries and cold lager or pilsner beer. 

Enjoy!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Violence and the Election of 1968==
There were 3 major assassinations in the 60ties, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.  All were suspected of &quot;governmental&quot; influence. Strong conspiracy theories still exist, which had a profound effect on how some Americans viewed their government. Some were very distrustful and some were very status quo. So it divided America in a way we hadn't seen since the Civil War. 
After the assassination of Dr. King in Memphis, riots broke out in over 100 cities. Troops were called in to control the mobs of people. Stunned and saddened by Dr. King's death, the nation worried about renewed homeland violence.

===Racism===
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a number of significant mobilizations against racism. The first sizable demonstration of Asians took place in 1972 over yet more anti-immigration laws. There were increasing numbers of protests against the National Front (NF), which was slowly building support by 1974. There was also a host of protests and campaigns against police harassment and racist educational policies. It was the concentration of anti-racist forces in a campaign against the NF, led by the Anti Nazi League (ANL), that shattered the upsurge of racism. In alliance with Rock Against Racism it was able to put on not just two huge carnivals, but countless events that drew black and white young people together.

===Robert Kennedy is Assassinated===

In the race for the Democratic nomination, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy, and Robert Francis Kennedy (brother of John F.) were competing in a close match. In most primaries, Kennedy edged out McCarthy, and meanwhile, Humphrey garnered the support of Democratic party leaders, who chose the delegates to the national convention. In June 1968, Kennedy won the primary in California, the state with the most delegates to the convention.Bobby Kennedy was trying to become president and follow in his brother's foot steps. At a celebration rally on the night of the victory, Kennedy was shot and killed by Sirhan B. Sirhan, who claimed that he did not remember shooting Bobby Kennedy. Sirhan shot Kennedy with .22 pistol. Kennedy was hit multiple times and five others were wounded. The nation was sent reeling into another shock from the new violence.
Kennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for two days before a funeral mass was held on June 8. His body was interred near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery. His death prompted the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service. Hubert Humphrey went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency, but ultimately narrowly lost the election to Richard Nixon.

===The Democratic Convention===

Because of his support among leaders and delegates from the Democratic Party, it appeared that Humphrey had enough votes to win the nomination at the convention in Chicago. Humphrey, however, was a supporter of Johnson's policy in Vietnam, so he was perceived as a war supporter.

Anti-war Democrats, most of whom had supported Kennedy, felt left out of the convention. Angry, they flocked to Chicago to protest Humphrey's nomination. On the first and second nights of the convention, the protesters were generally subdued and the Chicago police made few arrests. On the third night, however, protesters planned to march to the convention site to protest.

Fearing another outbreak of violence, the mayor of Chicago made the police block the protesters at the hall. When they tried a different route, protesters were blocked again. Outraged, protesters started throwing objects at the police. The police threw tear gas into the crowd and charged the protesters, beating some and taking others into custody.

Humphrey won the nomination, but the violence hurt his campaign. The nation saw all the anger and outrage on television. It seemed that Democrats could not control their own party.

===The Election===

Nixon, the former Vice President, had quietly been nominated by the Republicans as their candidate. Nixon claimed to represent the &quot;silent majority&quot; in America; that is, those that had begun to take on a more conservative approach to politics and disliked the &quot;hippie&quot; and civil rights movements. Nixon also promised to end the war in Vietnam, although he never said he would win it.

Because of his promises about Vietnam, Nixon was able to gain support from antiwar Democrats and Republicans alike. In a huge political comeback (Nixon was defeated in the election of 1960 and lost the race for the governor of California in 1962), Nixon barely won the popular vote, gaining only 500,000 more votes than Humphrey. He won by a larger margin in the electoral college, gaining 301 votes, while Humphrey only had 191.

Also note that Nixon made the statement on November 3rd 1969, almost a year after his election. He cribbed it from a speech his vice president, Spiro Agnew, had made on May 9th of that year. Agnew's writers may have been taking it from President Kennedy's 1956 book &lt;i&gt;Profiles in Courage&lt;/i&gt;. The original phrase goes back to Edward Young's 1721 poem &quot;The Revenge&quot;: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Life is the desert, life the solitude;&lt;br&gt; Death joins us to the great majority.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It became an in-joke among Democrats and protesters to hear Agnew and Nixon claim to represent the dead, perhaps as envoys of the Undead. This was only two years after Caesar Romero's &lt;i&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/i&gt; came out.

==Foreign Policy==

Nixon, in an attempt to bring stability to the nation, made many changes in foreign policy. He appointed Henry Kissinger as his national security advisor and later as his Secretary of State. Both believed in the philosophy of ''realpolitik'', which put national interests in front of leaders' political ideologies and reasoned that peace could only come from negotiations, not war. During Nixon's presidency, he and Kissinger would work to try to ease the cold war.

===Vietnam===

Nixon promised to ease the United States out of the Vietnam war, and for the most part, he kept his promise. He and Kissinger called their plan to hand the war over to the South Vietnamese: '''Vietnamization'''. By the end of 1970, the number of troops in Vietnam had fallen from 540,000 in the beginning of 1969 to 335,000. By January of 1970, the Vietnam conflict had become the longest in American history and, with 40,000 killed and over 250,000 wounded, the third most costly foreign war in the nation's experience. In 1971 there were only 60,000 troops in Vietnam.

In order to compensate for the loss of troops in Vietnam, Nixon hiked up the bombing campaign. The Ho Chi Minh Trail, which bordered and sometimes ran into the countries of Laos and Cambodia, was bombed. Nixon wanted to keep his public image as a peace President, so the bombing of Cambodia was kept a secret.
The Vietnam War was one of the first wars to be publicized on television. This raised awareness to Americans around the country because they were more aware of the inhumane acts of war. 

The war seemed to be fought both over in Asia and back in the states. Thousands of protesters mostly young college students were against the war and were beginning to get war weariness during the later years of the war. Many of the youth were drafted to fight overseas during this war, the lucky ones were able to escape if they could afford a college education.

The Vietnam War polarized opinion in the United States. Some people believed the war was immoral, others that it would not serve US interests while some felt it was necessary to stop the advance (as they saw if) of communism.  

The Vietnam war brought both violence but also opened up many job opportunities as well both at home and overseas. The draft was issued and thousands of men were sent to go fight in Vietnam along with thousands of other volunteer soldiers. With all these men fighting overseas many small businesses and factories were in need of employing new workers which opened up many job opportunities for other Americans at this time.

====Outrage and Tragedy====

Nixon tried to end the war through peace talks with North Vietnam, but generally, these stalled because the North Vietnamese had a wait and see attitude towards the war. They believed that opposition to the war within America would eventually grow so strong that Nixon would be forced to remove American troops from the country.

Nixon tried to appeal to his &quot;silent majority&quot; and renew support for the war, but then, Cambodia fell into a civil war between Communist and non-Communist forces. Nixon decided to send troops into Cambodia to destroy Communist strongholds, and Americans were outraged that their leader, who had strived for an end to the war, had attacked a neutral country. Opposition, especially in colleges, grew stronger.

This was especially true in Kent State University in Ohio. When students burned down a military complex on the Kent State campus, the Ohio governor declared martial law, or emergency military rule. The students were furious. On May 4th, they staged a protest on the campus lawn, but the National Guard troops told the students to disband, and that they had no right to assemble. The troops shot tear gas into the crowd, and the students ran. Some troops cornered a group between two buildings and suddenly, for unknown reasons, opened fire. Four students were killed and thirteen others were wounded.

Violence again struck at Jackson State in Mississippi. After a night of campus violence, police were called in to control the students, but eventually police opened fire on the students and two were killed. Witnesses recalled the police recklessly blasting the school's residence hall with their guns. The police claimed to be defending themselves from snipers.

====The End of the War====

In the fall of 1972, it seemed that peace was at hand. But at the last minute, the negotiations fell through because the South Vietnamese refused to have North Vietnamese forces in their country. Nixon decided to launch a last aggressive bombing campaign to try to scare the North Vietnamese into stopping the war, but they were persistent and continued to fight. In the beginning of 1975, the North Vietnamese launched a final major offensive. The South Vietnamese army collapsed, and soon, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, was in the Vietcong's grasp. Americans scrambled to evacuate from the country, and on April 29, Americans were evacuating by helicopter off the roof of the American embassy. In the early hours of April 30, 1975, Saigon fell to the Vietcong. Soon after, South Vietnam surrendered.

Upon return, the American troops had no welcome. Many Americans, angered at the outcome of the war or just angry that the war ever had to happen, just wanted to forget the ordeal. Vietnam lay in ruins, and almost 1.4 million Vietnamese lives (on either side) were claimed. Also, 58,000 Americans had died, 300,000 were wounded, and the U.S. had wasted $150 billion on the war.
Because people's homes were so badly destroyed in the war in Vietnam many decided to jump on boats and tried to find new places to live. Many came to the United States but many Americans had mixed feelings of this because they were reminded of their loss&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt; in Asia.

===China===

In 1969, Nixon wanted to ease the tensions of the Cold War to help the nation heal from the tragedy of Vietnam. He and Kissinger used ''realpolitik'', the practice of basing decisions on the interests of the nation rather than the leaders' beliefs, to shape a new foreign policy. Nixon formed a foreign policy plan of ''détente'', a plan of relaxing international tensions. Nixon's ultimate goal in his new plan was to achieve a so-called &quot;balance of power&quot; between the U.S., Europe, Soviet Union, China, and Japan so that no one nation could grow too strong.

To kick off his new plan, Nixon began to express friendliness to the People's Republic of China. The United States had severed ties with China after communists took control of the government in a political ''coup d'etat'' (a sudden change of government by force) in 1949. In 1970, Nixon began hinting at new relations with China, and he stopped referring to the country as &quot;Red China,&quot; which was an offensive term for the nation. By increasing relations with China, Nixon hoped that the Soviets would become more cooperative in talks with the U.S. because it would fear a U.S.-China alliance.

Realizing the change in U.S. sentiment, China invited a U.S. table tennis team to visit the country in April 1971, and a week later, the U.S. opened trade between the two countries. After sending Kissinger on a secret visit to China, Nixon announced that he would go to Beijing, the Chinese capital. In February 1972, Nixon finally came to Beijing. Pictures of him at the Great Wall and attending Chinese banquets were in international news. In another seven years, Chinese relations would be fully restored.

===The Soviet Union===

Nixon was right about the Soviet Union. Fearing a Chinese alliance with America, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev agreed to meet with Nixon in Moscow in May of 1972. Again, pictures of Nixon with communist leaders filled the news. While in Moscow, Nixon signed the SALT I Treaty, or the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. The treaty limited the number of nuclear arms that the Soviet Union and the U.S. could possess.

Feeling that the Soviet Union was in scientific decline, Brezhnev agreed with the U.S. to work with it in trade and information. This way, the Soviet Union could also gain access to desperately needed American grain. As a result of the talk, the Arms Race slowed and international tensions eased.

== The Women's Movement ==

In the 1970s, women in “The Women’s Movement” claimed that they had achieved a great deal through all their efforts in the past decades. These achievements consisted of: married women receiving the right to have their own credit in their own name instead of just in their husband’s name, unmarried women receiving the right to get birth control, women receiving the right to serve on a jury panel, and women receiving the right to list their help wanted ads alongside men’s help wanted ads. 

One of the goals these feminists had set was to change the view and laws on rape. Before this time, psychiatrists would claim that “A woman sometimes plays a big part in provoking her attacker by . . . her overall attitude and appearance.” Statements and beliefs like this made it easy for people to have a less sympathetic view towards victims of rape. However, by the end of the 1970s, activists worked on state levels to create crisis centers for rape victims, educate people such as police and hospital security about how to handle and take care of women who have been raped. These women even succeeded in changing some laws.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton, et al, &quot;A People and A Nation:Eighth Edition&quot;, 902-903&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Roe v. Wade''==

In March 1970, a Texas woman by the name of Norma McCorvey, unmarried and pregnant, decided to sue the state of Texas by the recommendation of Sarah Weddington, a young attorney. At the time, the vast majority of the other states had similar laws. At the time, Texas had a law in place that banned abortion in women, with the exception of women with life-threatening pregnancies. As part of standard court procedure, McCorvey was renamed Jane Roe, because she did not want her identity to be known by the court.

With rulings favoring both Roe and Dallas Country district attorney Henry Wade in various levels of the courts, the case eventually landed in the Supreme Court. Argued first on December 13, 1971 and again on October 11, 1972 (at the court's request), Weddington contended that the Texas law (and therefore all abortion banning laws) were in violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, which gave a citizen the right to privacy, and that abortion laws violated the privacy of women.

The case was decided on January 22, 1973, with Harry Blackmun writing the ruling. With a 7-2 majority, the Court ruled that the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments did indeed collectively give a citizen the right to privacy, and that abortion laws did indeed violate the right to privacy of women.

Having recently appointed Warren Burger (the Chief Justice), Harry Blackmun, Lewis Powell, and William Rehnquist, Nixon was disappointed in the ruling. All of them Republicans, Nixon had presumed that the judges would rule conservatively. Only Rehnquist would dissent with the majority. The other dissenting vote was Byron White, who had been appointed by John F. Kennedy.

The ruling continued the abortion divide that still exists today. It gave the general pro-choice sentiment among the more liberal and progressive Democratic Party and the pro-life sentiment among more conservative and religious Republican Party. The case was reopened in 1992, only to reaffirm the ruling. Norma McCorvey would go on later to become a pro-life advocate.

Roe vs Wade was a turning point in planned parenthood. It was another form of birth control that became legal. Some women viewed this as a sign of liberation and freedom because women could control how many children they had. Other people however thought abortion was immoral. The question that is commonly asked is &quot;is this murder or not?&quot;. Their are continuing arguments to this day that abortion is violating the sanctity of life.

Roe v. Wade was decided primarily on the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a part of the Bill of Rights. The Court's decision in this case was that the Ninth Amendment, in stating that &quot;the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people,&quot; protected a person's right to privacy.

==Watergate and the Election of 1972==

In 1971, Nixon had many doubts about the 1972 election. But this was before Nixon and Kissinger had vastly improved relations with the Soviet Union and China. By the time those tasks had been accomplished, much of the nation approved of Nixon. Even more in his favor was the Democratic disunity and the nomination of the radically liberal George McGovern. Some voters found his views disturbing.

Even so, Nixon's paranoia and the stress of the presidential campaign would conspire to send the nation reeling and his administration into crisis. Much later, it would be found that Nixon's campaign would stretch the truth, the law, and ethics.

To start his campaign, Nixon asked a group of only the most loyal aides to create an &quot;enemies list,&quot; a list of political opponents to the Nixon administration. Then, Nixon asked the IRS and the FBI to investigate those on the enemies list, and justified his actions by saying that he believed that those investigated were a threat to national security. Nixon was slowly changing his campaign from a campaign for the presidency to a campaign against enemies. Nixon was the renominated Republican nominee running with Sprio T. Agnew. They were running against the democratic nominee, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. McGovern was running with Senator Thomas Eagleton for vice president. Eagleton was shortly replaced with Sargent Shriver after the press discovering Eagleton had been treated for psychological problems. Nixon was also running against longtime segregationist, George Wallace. On May 15, 1972, Wallace became a victim of an assassination attempt that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Wallace was shot by twenty-one year old, Arthur Bremer. Bremer had also shot three others and was sentenced to 63 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Super Reviewm; United States History&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Using some of the money allotted for his campaign, Nixon funded a secret group of &quot;plumbers,&quot; who &quot;plugged&quot; information leaks that were damaging to the administration. Money also funded dirty tricks against Nixon's Democratic opponents.

In November of 1972, an unknowing public headed to the polls to cast votes for the President. Nixon won the election by a landslide, with almost 61 percent of the popular vote and 520 out of 537 electoral votes.

Things were quiet for a while after the election. In late 1973, countries in the Middle East imposed an embargo, or refusal to trade, on oil to the U.S. after the U.S. supported Israel in a short war against Egypt (the most powerful country in the region) and Syria. Prices for gas shot up in the U.S. and stations had to ration the gas, putting restrictions like &quot;ten gallons per customer.&quot; Many people were laid off. Nixon worked to help relations with the Middle East, and in March 1974, the embargo was lifted. He was also able to get the U.S. out of Vietnam. Because of his work, Americans generally approved of Nixon.

Voters did not know that a little while after midnight on June 17, 1972, a security guard named Frank Wills had been patrolling in the parking garage of the Wartergate complex, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, and found tape on the locks to doors leading into the building. He removed the tape and thought little of it, but an hour later, he would find it replaced. He would call the police, and they would arrest five robbers inside the complex.

The subsequent arrests of &quot;plumbers&quot; Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt would slowly but surely send tremors through the presidency. Initially, the Nixon administration denied that it had anything to do with the two plumbers or the bugs that the five men were trying to plant in the telephones of the Democratic headquarters (bugs are telephone listening devices, commonly used by spies and others in the field of espionage) when investigators gathered info that suggested it did. Ronald Ziegler, Nixon's press secretary, decried the break-in a &quot;third rate burglary.&quot;

Hearing of the incident at the Watergate complex, the Washington Post, a prominent Washington D.C. newspaper with a national circulation, started publishing a series of articles linking Nixon to the burglary. Also, after questioning, one of the burglars confessed that the White House lied about its involvement in the break-in. Still, only about half of Americans had even heard of the robbery.

In early 1973, the Senate voted to hold hearings on the Watergate break-in. They asked the Department of Justice to hire a special prosecutor outside of the Nixon-influenced department to investigate Watergate. Slowly, Cox and Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina would reveal the massive scandal going on in the White house. In May, former deputy White House counsel John Dean, a source close to Nixon, would testify that there indeed had been a cover up and that it had been directed by Nixon himself. 

The extent of Nixon's desperation would become evident in October 1973 when Cox ordered that Nixon hand over tapes from a secret taping system that recorded conversations in the President's office. He refused on ''executive privilege'' grounds, contending that the release of the tapes would compromise national security. 

When Cox tried to get an injunction for the release of the tapes, Nixon ordered Elliot Richardson, the attorney general, to fire Cox (after all, it was the Justice Department that had hired Cox), but Richardson refused and resigned. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Rickelshaus to fire Cox, but he, like Richardson, refused and resigned. Finally, Nixon got a minor Justice Department official, Solicitor General Robert Bork, to fire Cox. The series of resignations and the firing of Cox became known as the Saturday Night Massacre. The public was outraged.

At the height of the Watergate scandal, the Department of Justice uncovered another: Vice President Spiro Agnew had accepted bribes as the governor of Maryland. He resigned on October 10, 1973. Nixon nominated Michigan congressman Gerald Ford as his Vice President, who was quickly confirmed.

The House of Representatives decided to initiate the impeachment process as public outrage mounted over the Saturday Night Massacre. If a majority voted to charge the President of high crimes and misdemeanors, he would be tried by the Senate and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would preside over the trial. If 67 of the 100 senators voted to find Nixon guilty, he would be expelled from office.

In April of 1974, Nixon decided to release heavily edited transcripts of the tapes to try to improve his image. This only led to more public protest, and the Supreme Court eventually ruled that Nixon had to hand over the tapes. After a conversation on one of the tapes revealed that Nixon had ordered a cover up of the robbery, the public was stunned and the House mulled impeachment. Before any more damage could be done, Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974. He would be the first and (so far) only president to resign and Gerald Ford would become the only president not elected to the office of president or vice president.

The impact of the scandal was wide and far-reaching. Among other things, Congress passed a series of laws sharply limiting a president's power to wage undeclared war, limiting campaign spending and strengthening public access to government information. Also, it proved that the Constitution's system of checks and balances could work to bring an abusive or tyrannical president out of power. But by far the biggest impact of the crisis was the loss of the public's faith and trust in politicians and elected officials; cynicism concerning the ethics, behavior, and motives of elected officials would be deep and lasting. Because of Nixon's party affiliation and the outrage over a preemptive pardon that Ford granted Nixon after he became president, people associated corruption with the Republican party. Decades of gerrymandering by New Dealers and their successors had assured nearly-impregnable overwhelming Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress since the 1930s. Fallout from Watergate assured that this trend would continue in the midterm elections of November 1974. The Republicans would pay the ultimate price for Watergate in 1976, with Ford losing the White House to a relative political newcomer.

== President Carter==

Jimmy Carter (James Earl Carter, Jr.), the thirty-ninth president of the United States, was born Oct. 1, 1924, in the small farming town of Plains, Ga., and grew up in the nearby community of Archery. His father, James Earl Carter, Sr., was a farmer and businessman; his mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, a registered nurse.

He was educated in the public school of Plains, attended Georgia Southwestern College and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and received a bachelor of science degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1946. In the Navy, he became a submariner, serving in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets and rising to the rank of lieutenant. 
In 2002 President Carter was given the Nobel Peace Prize.  He is the only American president to ever get a Nobel Peace Prize after his presidency.  Carter was also against the death penalty in the United States.  His thoughts on it were to remove the death penalty with life in prison which was not heard of at the time.

James Earl Carter, Jr., was born on October 1, 1924, in the tiny southwest Georgia city of Plains, near Americus. The first president born in a hospital,[6] he is the eldest of four children of James Earl Carter and Bessie Lillian Gordy. Carter's father was a prominent business owner in the community and his mother was a registered nurse.
The Carter family had come from southern England (Carter's paternal ancestor arrived in the American Colonies in 1635),[7] and had lived in the state of Georgia for several generations. Carter has documented ancestors who fought in the American Revolution, and he is a member of the Sons of the American Revolution.[8] Carter's great-grandfather, Private L.B. Walker Carter (1832–1874), served in the Confederate States Army.[9]

James Earl Carter ran in the 1976 election. He was formerly the Governor of Georgia and was elected to run as the democratic nominee. Carter ran with Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota as his vice presidential candidate. Carter ran for president against Gerald Ford who had won the Republican nomination against Ronald Reagan by a slim margin. Carter defeated Ford in the election of 1976. During his presidency, Carter sought to conduct the presidency on democratic and moral principles. He approached economic problems inconsistently and he offered amnesty to Americans who had fled the draft and gone to other countries during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Super Review; United States History&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A {{Ada/kw|range}} is a signed integer value which ranges from a {{Ada/attribute|First}} to a last {{Ada/attribute|Last}}. It is defined as

  {{Ada/kw|range}} First .. Last

When a value is assigned to an object with such a range constraint, the value is checked for validity and Constraint_Error [[Ada Programming/Exceptions|exception]] is raised when the value is not within {{Ada/attribute|First}} to {{Ada/attribute|Last}}.

When declaring a range type, the corresponding mathematical operators are implicitly declared by the language at the same place.

The compiler is free to choose a suitable underlaying hardware type for this user defined type.

== Working demo ==

The following Demo defines a new range from -5 to 10 and then prints the whole range out.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|range_1.adb}}
  
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Range_1 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Range_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -5 .. 10;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO (Range_Type);
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|for}} A {{Ada/kw|in}} Range_Type {{Ada/kw|loop}}
       I_IO.Put (
          Item  =&gt; A,
          Width =&gt; 3,
          Base  =&gt; 10);
 
       {{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt; Range_Type'{{Ada/attribute|Last}} {{Ada/kw|then}}
          T_IO.Put (&quot;,&quot;);
       {{Ada/kw|else}}
          T_IO.New_Line;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Range_1;

You can add features which you think are neccessay or desirable for the next version of Reaktor, just go to edit this page.
* MP3 playback module just like in Traktor with scrub, beat markers etc..
* An actual release at some point in time
* ReWire
* [http://www.native-instruments.com/forum_us/showthread.php?t=34201 Thread on Reaktor User Forum]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform FFT] desired by all advanced instrument builders
* Send and receive '''SYSEX''' (System Exclusive). This will allow Reaktor to control hardware synths and fx. This will permit a better integration of hardware devices and total recall of hardware settings using reaktor within a daw. +2
* click-free switches
* direct sample loading without having to store samples in maps before
* Sample preview in sample browser window
* Record samples inside Reaktor//this can already be done//add 24 bit recording in standalone 
* Ability to export sample maps as wavs &amp; more control over maps   
* Ability to connect to a mysql database for patch storage 
* NRPN control assignment
* Macro Object Inheritance / Ghost Copies (i.e., changes made to one macro are made to all macros of the same type. This saves you the time of having to copy and wire 20 macros when you edited one.)
* Automatic patching to said Ghost Copies (i.e., patching a signal to an input on one macro patches that signal to all 'ghost' macros)
* Replacing macros while retaining patches to inputs/outputs that are named the same.
* More help and in depth descriptions on how to utilize event and audio tables. 
* Reaktor 4 was heavily lacking in quantity of instruments, Reaktor 6 should come with a library as large as Reaktor 3's built in library. Flashy, bloated ensembles are nice, but a wider variety of functional instruments would be more useful than a 50 megabyte 2 oscillator synth. 
* Macros and modules should be allowed back into the main ensemble structure view.  With the Reaktor 4 update, this was disabled for the user. 
* Import more audio format (rex, mp3, AAC...)
* Ability to program own modules with text code, not graphically
* Scripting Language like Kontakt 2's KSP mainly for advanced midi control
* Easier Sample Handling - Kontakt Style +1
* Proper &amp; CPU friendly midi sequencers for live use
* Proper bandlimiting at Reaktors outputs or downsample module or proper adaptation of oscs to samplerate. (A.k.a Anti-aliasing)
* Additive resynthesis
* VST module to insert e.g dedicated efx
* Save/Compile your ENS as a VST or VSTi
* New Acoustic Modelling Macro Library - something comparable to Tassman or Harm Visser (Edit: Harm Visser has Reaktor Ensembles available at his website, and Karplus Strong can be easily done in Reaktor already)
* New Module:  Unity Gain Saturation
* New oscillators that have a fuller, less digital sound (Edit: There are several Anti-Aliased Oscillators built with Core. Check out Multiwave Osc and the ones built into Carbon2)
* Filter modules which can be compared with other NI products. (Absynth, Kontakt etc)
* MIDI file player module
* drawable anti-aliased oscillator (absynth style)
* drawable oscillator should include all editing methods of absynth oscillators &amp; should include all the same oscillator types, including Morph
* Absynth style envelopes (Edit: Already exists, or at least an FM8-style one (similar to Absynth): Macros&gt;Building Blocks&gt;Envelopes&gt;Multi BP Env)
* internal recording higher than 16bit resolution
* Trim/cut/normalize etc in sample map
* '''Remove the distinction between contol resolution and audio resolution so that the control signals can work in real time. This would allow for accurate pitch tracking and other wonderful things'''  +1 (Edit: Core already does this)
* Option to disable the grid when editing the Panel.
* large selection of super high quality panel elements - knobs, sliders, buttons, etc, . .
* less cpu usage
* Optional wire clean-up
* View and compare structure using more than one window. Similarly, with the panel/interface view, separating instruments and effects into separate windows.
* Transparency for every single element (not just for mouse area)
* Tutorials &amp; How to do Manuals (Edit: ADSR Tutorials  has great Reaktor tutorials)
* Proper in-depth description of components/modules/etc.
* Support more languages (German / French / Spain / Russian)
* Front Panel cabling option to build proper modular synths.  (Not sure why this wasn't there from the start)
* A reload option on skins as well as alphabetized listing in the drop down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">i'm not sure what the real intention of this page was, so i just started editing it.  then i decided to rewrite some of the parts and finally pretty much overhauled the entire thing.  i think each of the topics included here is probably big enough to deserve its own page.  i'm also not a big fan of the name of this page.  i think a better name would likely be &quot;Classroom Teaching Skills&quot;.  Tutoring is such a different animal it should not even be included, maybe just a link to another page.</text>

{{:Template:Computer Programming/Control/1.3}}

In Ada, conditional statements with more than one conditional do not use short-circuit evaluation by default.  In order to mimic C/C++'s short-circuit evaluation, use &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|and}} {{Ada/kw|then}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|or}} {{Ada/kw|else}}&lt;/code&gt; between the conditions.

{{:Template:Computer Programming/Control/2}}

 {{Ada/kw|case}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|when}} 1 {{Ada/dl|1= =&gt;}}
 
       Walk_The_Dog;
 
    {{Ada/kw|when}} 5 {{Ada/dl|1= =&gt;}}
 
       Launch_Nuke;
 
    {{Ada/kw|when}} 8 | 10 {{Ada/dl|1= =&gt;}}
 
       Sell_All_Stock;
 
    {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|others}} {{Ada/dl|1= =&gt;}}
 
       Self_Destruct;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};

The subtype of X must be a discrete type, i.e. an enumeration or integer type.

In Ada, one advantage of the case statement is that the compiler will check the coverage of the choices, that is, all the values of the subtype of variable X must be present or a default branch {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|others}} must specify what to do in the remaining cases.

 ''Endless_Loop'' :
    {{Ada/kw|loop}}
 
       Do_Something;
 
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} ''Endless_Loop'';

The loop name (in this case, &quot;Endless_Loop&quot;) is an optional feature of Ada. Naming loops is nice for readability but not strictly needed. Loop names are
useful though if the program should jump out of an inner loop, see below.

{{:Template:Computer Programming/Control/8}}

 ''While_Loop'' :
    {{Ada/kw|while}} X &lt;= 5 {{Ada/kw|loop}}
 
       X := Calculate_Something;
 
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} ''While_Loop'';

{{:Template:Computer Programming/Control/9}}

 ''Until_Loop'' :
    {{Ada/kw|loop}}
 
       X := Calculate_Something;
 
       {{Ada/kw|exit}} Until_Loop {{Ada/kw|when}} X &gt; 5;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} ''Until_Loop'';

{{:Template:Computer Programming/Control/10}}

 ''Exit_Loop'' :
    {{Ada/kw|loop}}
 
       X := Calculate_Something;
 
       {{Ada/kw|exit}} Exit_Loop {{Ada/kw|when}} X &gt; 5;
 
       Do_Something (X);
 
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}  ''Exit_Loop'';

In Ada the '''exit''' condition can be combined with any other loop statement as well. You can also have more than one '''exit''' statement. You can also exit a named outer loop if you have several loops inside each other.

{{:Template:Computer Programming/Control/11}}

 ''For_Loop'' :
    {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10 {{Ada/kw|loop}}
 
       Do_Something (I)
 
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} ''For_Loop'';

You don't have to declare both subtype and range as seen in the example. If you leave out the subtype then the compiler will determine it by context; if you leave out the range then the loop will iterate over every value of the subtype given.

As always with Ada: when &quot;determine by context&quot; gives two or more possible options then an error will be displayed and then you have to name the type to be used. Ada will only do &quot;guess-works&quot; when it is safe to do so.

The loop counter I is a constant implicitly declared and ceases to exist after the body of the loop.

{{:Template:Computer Programming/Control/12}}

 ''Array_Loop'' :
    {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} X'{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
 
       X (I) := Get_Next_Element;
 
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} ''Array_Loop'';

With X being an array. Note: This syntax is mostly used on arrays &amp;mdash; hence the name &amp;mdash; but will also work with other types when a full iteration is needed.

==== Working Demo ====

The following Demo shows how to iterate over every element of an integer type.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|range_1.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Range_1 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Range_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -5 .. 10;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Integer_IO}} (Range_Type);
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|for}} A {{Ada/kw|in}} Range_Type {{Ada/kw|loop}}
       I_IO.Put (Item  =&gt; A,
                 Width =&gt; 3,
                 Base  =&gt; 10);
 
       {{Ada/kw|if}} A &lt; Range_Type'Last {{Ada/kw|then}}
          T_IO.Put (&quot;,&quot;);
       {{Ada/kw|else}}
          T_IO.New_Line;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Range_1;

Here is a simple line for your links home. I noticed that the link home went to your intro page which was a little annoying.

&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;small&gt;''back to [[Calculus:Outline#Introductory_concepts | Calculus]]''&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

you can change the part after the # to reflect the section that you want to link back to on that page.

:It is now ussually preferable to use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus:TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]] 04:36, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)


----

Given that this outline page is now significantly more compelete than the main page isn't it about time to move it over? [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]


---
Is the &quot;beyond&quot; section a joke?  Can it just be removed?  Sure Lie theory and postdoc stuff does not belong in a calculus book.  and imho nor does a mention of cauchy sequences.  -- julius

== &quot;Advanced&quot; Topics ==

I took calculus two and three at Georgia Tech, and then went to Israel for college. Tere is a very simple problem with the book being written; it's fine for an engineer, or a high school student, but by the time a student approaches calculus in college anywhere except in the good ol' US of A, it is taught as real math, with proofs, and formal definitions. I'm just wondering, if this is indeed a high school/American Calculus book, should there also be a &quot;Calculus with analysis,&quot; of &quot;Rigorous Calculus&quot; book?
I am going to attempt to write a formal introduction to calculus, starting with sets and working upwards, with proofs either provided or suggested, as a set of modules to parallel how this book is organized. I hope this isn't seen as an attempt to take effort from this book, but as far as I can tell, the book is evolving into something I would prefer not to contribute to in any case. 
  -David Manheim, 1:37 EDT, 8/18/05

== Adding exercise set for each page ==

To be clear up front, I'm using book/section/article as the terminology for the hierarchy of the book (e.g. Calculus/Limits/Continuity has book=Calculus, section=Limits and article=Continuity).  I'd like to propose adding exercise sets for each article rather than just for each section as it is now.  I propose a naming convention of BOOK/SECTION/ARTICLE/Exercises.  I'm new to wikibooks, so I don't even know if that's possible.  I just think there needs to be exercises at regular intervals to keep the student active in the discussion rather than having the student read tons of info and then overwhelm them with tons of mixed exercises at the end of a section.  Is special permission required to create new wikibook articles?  I'm currently trying to re-learn calculus, so I'm planning on going through the whole Calculus wikibook, and I figure I may as well make improvements while I'm at it.  So I'd like to get good input at the beginning of the process so that I can apply a consistent style and organization throughout the book.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 18:46, 23 March 2011 (UTC)

== Navigation links ==

Something I've noticed as I read through the pages is that the navigation is somewhat inconvenient.  The normal flow is to read from the beginning of the page to the end, i.e. top to bottom.  However, the link to the next page is at the top of the current page, so the reader has to scroll back up to the top of the page when they are finished with the current one.  It seems to me that the positions of the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Top Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; templates ought to be reversed.  Anyone agree/disagree?  [[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 11:09, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
:I've started adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Calculus/Top Nav}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; templates to the bottom of each of the pages.  IMO it makes navigation easier, although maybe it also makes it more cluttered.  Any opinions?  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 18:40, 16 May 2011 (UTC)

== Conventions ==

I've added a conventions section that lists some of the conventions that I've picked up as I've edited the book. I've tried to not only add the convention but also give the reason for it so that contributors can evaluate whether the convention makes sense in their particular circumstance. I hope also that, if someone has a better way of doing something, that they communicate that here. I envision this talk page as a place to discuss best practices for the book and the corresponding article as a place to record the consensus on what the best practices are.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 02:05, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

== Non Rigorous ==

I am starting a new subsection, meant just for people who need to apply calculus, like differentiation and integration in physics, and chemistry. It wont be rigorous, but will have something like &quot;cheat sheet&quot; for reader.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the printf Function==
In C, the '''&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;''' function prints the optional arguments under the control of the template string ''template'' to the stream ''stdout''. It returns the number of characters printed, or a negative value if an output error occurred.   

int printf (const char *template, ...)

For more information about printf in general, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf Wikipedia article on printf].

== Output Conversions ==

Here is a table summarizing what all the different conversions do in the C implementation of printf:

; `%d', `%i' : Print an integer as a signed decimal number. `%d' and `%i' are synonymous for output, but are different when used with &lt;code&gt;scanf()&lt;/code&gt; function  for input.

; `%o' : Print an integer as an unsigned octal number.

; `%u' : Print an integer as an unsigned decimal number.

; `%x', `%X' : Print an integer as an unsigned hexadecimal number.  `%x' uses lower-case letters and `%X' uses upper-case.

; `%f' : Print a floating-point number in normal (fixed-point) notation.

; `%e', `%E' : Print a floating-point number in exponential notation.  `%e' uses lower-case letters and `%E' uses upper-case.

; `%g', `%G' : Print a floating-point number in either normal or exponential notation, whichever is more appropriate for its magnitude.  `%g' uses lower-case letters and `%G' uses upper-case.

; `%a', `%A' : Print a floating-point number in a hexadecimal fractional notation which the exponent to base 2 represented in decimal digits.  `%a' uses lower-case letters and `%A' uses upper-case.

; `%c' : Print a single character.

; `%lc' : Print a single wide character.

; `%C' : This is an alias for `%lc'. (This is a non-standard Unix-specific extension.)

; `%s' : Print a string.

; `%ls' : Print a wide character string.

; `%S' : This is an alias for `%ls'. (This is a non-standard Unix-specific extension.)

; `%p' : Print the value of a pointer.

; `%n' : Get the number of characters printed so far. Note that this conversion specification never produces any output.

; `%m' : Print the string corresponding to the value of &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; variable. (This is a non-standard [[GNU]] extension.)

; `%%' : Print a literal `%' character.

If the [[syntax]] of a [[conversion specification]] is invalid, unpredictable
things will happen, so don't do this.
If there aren't enough [[function argument]]s provided to supply values for all the conversion specifications in the template string, or if the arguments are not of the correct types, the results are unpredictable.
If you supply more arguments than conversion specifications, the extra argument values are simply ignored; this is sometimes useful.

[[Image:Sarmi.jpg|150px|right]]
'''Sarmi''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] dish of stuffed [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] leaves, which shows significant [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] influences.

==Ingredients==
*500 g (about 1 1/8 lb) minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] or beef 
*300 g (about 3/4 lb) minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*One bunch of [[Cookbook:Spring Onion|spring onions]]
*Half a cupful [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
*One cupful [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
*[[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
*[[Cookbook:Mint|Mint]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
*30-40 [[Cookbook:Grape|vine]] or [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] leaves (depending on the size, a substantially smaller number of leaves may be needed)
*100 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or half a cupful [[Cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sunflower oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]

==Procedure==
#Boil the vine or cabbage leaves in salted water until they look cooked and are just bendable enough to roll.  Drain and allow to cool during the follow steps.
#Lightly fry the finely chopped onions in a small amount of oil, stir in a teaspoon or more of paprika and mix. 
#Add the meat, rice, pepper, mint and finely chopped parsley and cook until the meat looks almost done. 
#Add 3/4 cup of water, bring to a boil, then immediately cover and reduce heat to a bare minimum for 10 minutes, until the water is absorbed by the rice. Uncover and fluff as needed with a small spatula or spoon.  Allow to cool to handling temperature. 
#Put one teaspoonful of the meat mixture on each leaf and make into a rolled, fully enclosed, package, similar to a small egg roll. A bit more filling can be used if you are using large cabbage leaves, but try to make all the rolls somewhat uniform in size. 
#Arrange the rolls in a saucepan, add 1.5 cups of warm water, cover and simmer gently on a low fire. 
#In the meantime, mix the yogurt with a bit of paprika, for color (or omit if you wish to keep the dish somewhat white in color), and other spices as you desire.
#When rolls are done, allow to cool a bit, gently remove to a dish, and add the yogurt mixture to coat. 
#Serve with vegetables of your choice. Enjoy!

For a gathering you may wish to consider presenting these somewhat 'white' rolls side-by-side with a dish of cabbage rolls in tomato sauce.

      <text xml:space="preserve">8.  The Stem of a word is that part of it which remains substantially unchanged through varieties of inflection.  Nouns, Adjectives and Pronouns are 'declined'; Verbs are 'conjugated' by the help of prefixes or terminations added to the stem, which may itself be variously modified, but can always be traced, and contains the main idea of the word. To know this Stem, therefore, is an essential preliminary to the study of the inflections.

The stems of words shall in this section be distinguished by dark letters, and in general by an appended hyphen, as the stem in itself is incomplete, requiring some kind of addition before it becomes a ''word''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==9.  The Noun==

Nouns in Greek are inflected.  Inflection means that a suffix which is appended to the stem is modified.  In Greek the suffix is modified according to gender, case, and number.

There are three genders: &lt;B&gt;Three Genders&lt;/B&gt;: Masculine (m.), Feminine (f.) and Neuter (n.).  Substantives have grammatical gender, where gender is an inalieable property and often not correlated to physical sex.  Pronouns and Adjectives modify their gender to match the gender of the substantive described.

In Greek, there are three numbers: singular, denoting a quantity of one; dual, denoting a pair; plural, denoting more than two.

In Greek there are five cases; the cases and their primary uses are tabulated below:

&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;td colspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Use of the Cases&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(all words underlined are in the case specified in the first column)&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CASE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Answers the Question&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;&gt;Example (English)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;NOMINATIVE&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Who or what?&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;&gt;&lt;U&gt;Who&lt;/U&gt; gave? &lt;U&gt;A man.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;VOCATIVE&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Person called or addressed&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;&gt;Oh, &lt;u&gt;Cornelius!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;ACCUSATIVE&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Whom or what?&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;&gt;&lt;U&gt;Whom&lt;/U&gt; I see? &lt;U&gt;A boy&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;GENITIVE&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Whose or whereof?&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;&gt;&lt;U&gt;Whose&lt;/U&gt; gift? &lt;U&gt;A man's&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;DATIVE&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;To or for whom or what&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;&gt;&lt;U&gt;To whom&lt;/U&gt; given? &lt;U&gt;To a man&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;

The Nominative Case singular is the form given in all vocabularies and dictionaries.  The method of its formation from the Stem is therefore a matter of prime importance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">10 The Definite Article is employed in combination with nouns, and is declined in gender, number, and case, to correspond with them.

There is no Indefinite Article in Greek, but its place is often supplied by the Indefinite Pronoun (any, a certain).

The Following forms, which should be carefully committed to memory, afford a general type of the inflections of nouns, adjective, and pronouns, and will therefore be useful in their acquisition.

11.  The Definite Article, &lt;I&gt;the&lt;/I&gt;. It has first and second declension endings. Note that the nominative
masculine and feminine forms of the definite article start with a vowel and not τ, and also note that
there are no accents on the vowel. By contrast, the relative pronoun who (ὅς, ἥ, ὅ) has accents on the vowels, but is otherwise
spelled the same.

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
 |+ ὁ - the

 |-
 ! Dat || τῷ || τῇ || τῷ || τοῖς || ταῖς || τοῖς

 |}

12. Indefinite Pronoun: any, a certain, a

 |-
 ! Dat || τινί || τινί || τισί(ν) || τισί(ν)
 |-
 ! Acc || τινά || τι || τινάς || τινά
 |}


13.  In the two forms now given there are three particular patterns applicable to all nouns, adjectives and pronouns.

1) Neuters are alike in the nominative and accusative of number.  Neuters plural, nominative and accusative all end in α.
2) The dative singular always ends in i; although to the vowel the iota is subscript (please note, this needs to be added)
3) The genitive plural always ends in ων.

In Gujarati culture:

These are the &quot;titles&quot; for family members. With the exception of Father, Mother, and Grandparents (who are called by the title only), all of these titles are added after the name of the person.

* Father: Papa or Bapuji
* Mother: Ba, Mummy or Maa

* Brother (also male cousins): Bhai (e.g. Haresh Bhai)
* Brother's Wife: Bhabhi (e.g. Komal Bhabhi)

* Sister (also female cousins): Ben (e.g. Mayuri Ben)
* Older Sister: Didi (e.g. Mayuri Didi)
* Sister's Husband: Banevi or Jijaji (e.g. Kunal Jijaji)

* Father's Younger Brother: Nana or Kaka (e.g. Rajesh Nana or Rajesh Kaka)
* Father's Younger Brother's Wife: Nani or Kaki(e.g. Komal Nani or Komal Kaki)

* Father's Older Brother: Kaka(e.g. Jiten Kaka)
* Father's Older Brother's Wife: Kaki (e.g. Bhavna Kaki)

* Father's Oldest Brother: Mota Kaka or Bapu(e.g. Jiten Kaka)
* Father's Oldest Brother's Wife: Moti Kaki or Moti ba (e.g. Purva Kaki)

* Father's Sister: Foi,Fui, Faiba (also spelled Foy) (e.g. Komal Foi)
* Father's Sister's Husband: Fua (e.g. Akshay Fua)

* Mother's Brother: Mama (e.g. Siddarth Mama)
* Mother's Brother's Wife: Mami (e.g. Komal Mami)

* Mother's Sister: Massi (e.g. Sneha Massi)
* Mother's Sister's Husband: Massa (e.g. Gopal Massa)

* Paternal Grandfather: Dada or Bapuji
* Paternal Grandmother: Dadi or Ba

* Maternal Grandfather: Nana or Bapuji (some parts of Gujarat also use Bobo).
* Maternal Grandmother: Nani or Ba

*Wife's Sister: Saali
*Wife's Brother: Saalo

*Wife's Sisters husband: Saadhoo bhai
*Wife's Brothers wife: Saadhotri (e.g. Bhumika Saadhotri)


*Cousins are considered to be &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot;. 

*Son: Babo, Beto, Dikro
*Daughter: Baby, Beti, Dikri

If an uncle or aunt is a generation above usual (a &quot;great uncle&quot; or &quot;great aunt&quot;), a &quot;mota&quot; (big) is usually added to the title, and the name is dropped. So Maternal Grandmother's Brother is &quot;Mota Mama&quot; (Big Uncle). 

Names are usually followed by titles, as they have listed above.  This is different from the English, where we would say &quot;John Uncle&quot;.  

It is not unusual for this to vary from family to family, but these are the generally accepted titles.

Also spelled and pronounced [[Cookbook:Tabouli|Tabouli]] - regional pronunciations vary.

== Ingredients ==

*1/2 cup bulghur wheat (fine grind is best, medium grind acceptable)
*2 bunches parsley (flat leaf or curly Italian)
*1 bunch green onion 
*Tomatoes - at least 2 cups chopped 
*5 or 6 stalks fresh mint
*2 to 3 lemons - to taste
*Olive oil
*Salt
*Cucumbers (optional)
*Romaine lettuce leaves (garnish and scoopers, optional)
*Fresh grape leaves (scoopers - optional)

== Procedure ==

#Soak the bulghur wheat in at least three times its volume of cold water. Fine grind only needs a half hour of soaking. Medium grind needs longer. Bulghur wheat has already been parboiled before cracking or grinding, so it doesn’t need further cooking to be edible in tabbouli.
#Drain bulghur. 
#Chop the parsley leaves, green onions, mint, tomatoes and cucumbers.
#Chop the parsley quite fine, using a knife, not food processor. 
#Mix veggies and bulghur together. Douse with strained lemon juice. If you are not ready to serve immediately, then cover and hold in a cool place. Do NOT add salt and olive oil until immediately before serving.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

You may garnish with more diced tomatoes and/or diced cucumber, and insert lettuce or fresh grape leaves around the sides of the bowl. Use green leaves to scoop up the salad, popping leaf and salad into mouth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several different types of motors. Each motor type has several advantages as well as disadvantages depending on a particular robots design.
See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_motor this Wikipedia article] for basic information about the different electro motors.

===AC-motors===
There are several different types of AC-motors, but their use is limited to high power stationary industrial robots. They are harder to use than DC-motors.

===DC-motors===
DC-motors are very easy to use, but like most other motors their usefulness for robotics is very dependent on the gearing available. DC-motors are made much more effective if they have an efficient gear ratio for a particular task. If your priority is to have a fast spinning motor and torque is of little concern a low gearing or even no gearing may be what you need; however, most motors used in robots need torque over top speed so a motor with a high gear ratio could be more useful.

The control of a DC motor can be split into two parts: speed and direction.

====Direction====
[[Image:H-bridge.jpg|thumb|The principle behind a H-bridge]]
Changing which direction a DC-motor turns is very simple: simply reverse the polarity.

Both pairs of switches ( (S1A,S1B) and (S2A, S2B) )-see the picture on the right- will always switch together. This circuit is called an H-bridge. In a real design the switches can be several different components (Relays, transistors, FETs) or the whole circuit (without the motor) could be an IC (integrated circuit.
use sugarcan relays

====Speed====
Speed is a little bit more complicated. Many beginners would try to slow down a motor by reducing its voltage with a variable resistor or other ways. This does not work well, because it will not only reduce the motor's speed, it will also reduce a motor's strength, while also consuming a lot of electricity as large amounts of heat are generated by the resistor.

A far better way is to use a PWM ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation Pulse-width modulation]) device.

===Servo===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomechanism What is a servo?]

Servos are used in robotics for different uses: e.g. to move a sensor around, or to move the legs of a robot. Some users modify the servo so they can use it as a DC-motor with a gearbox.

Controlling a servo is done with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation Pulse-width modulation]. The length of the pulse is relative to the position the servo will turn to. The length of this pulses is usually located between 1ms and 2ms, if so 1.5ms would be the center position. This pulse needs to be repeated with small intervals (otherwise the servo might turn to a &quot;save&quot; position or it might simply stay at its current position. This depends on the type of servo used).

===Stepper motor===
We cover stepper motors in more detail in the next chapter, [[Robotics/Stepper Motors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The format effecively treats the whole set of riddles as a single puzzle.  People should be able to check their guesses, or even add new riddles, without accidentally seeing the answers to the ones they haven't yet thought about or are still thinking about.  I therefore suggest that we split up the answers into one page per riddle. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 14:57, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Sounds great. It would also handle the problems of the huge ToC and the oversized page. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 05:16, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)

::[[Puzzles/Logic puzzles|Logic puzzles]] has a good format for this. -[[User:160.36.157.78|160.36.157.78]] 05:47, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Does it seem navigable now that I've put the solutions on individual pages?  It might be good to split the riddles themselves into groups of 10, so that the table of contents will fit within the page.  (e.g. riddles 1-10 on [[Puzzles:Riddles|Riddles]], 11-20 on [[Riddles 2]], etc.)  -[[User:Tormod|Tormod]] 06:40, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:The only objection I have is that we have many incredibly small pages; then again, that's the only way to do it (that I know of). One other way I found in a riddle book was to title each and every riddle and organize them alphabetically for the answers and by difficulty for the riddles. I do like your plan for splitting up the riddles; see [[Chip's Challenge]] for a way I did this. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 02:06, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)
::Does it take up a lot more memory to have many little pages than one big one?  I think hyperlinking is easier for the reader than looking through an index like the book of riddles you mention.  Chip's Challenge looks good. -[[User:Tormod|Tormod]] 19:08, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:::I ran into the many-little-pages problem with [[SMW: Yoshi's Island 1]]. I tried to explain the walkthrough using what would have ended up becoming about 100 pages. I wanted to make it completely comprehensive, but that took so long to copy-paste, rewrite and test, that I gave up on it and put the 30 or so pages I had written on VfD. I don't know if it takes more memory or what, but it sure takes a lot of time and energy to make them all work. This especially applies when you want to make a change to all of them at once and you don't have a bot. So I would go with the strategy I used on Chip's Challenge. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:44, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:I actually really like the format now - as a user, it's super-convenient to click on the link to see the solution.  If there was a hints/discussion page for each one, that'd be perfect!  -PK

I came to this page to have a look and was totally put off. No one wants to see &quot;Riddle 1, Riddle 2&quot; all the way down to 40. No one, equally, wants those riddles just listed off underneath. Furthermore, some of the riddles are pathetically easy (eg the first) and some are really quite hard. If someone's looking for a hard riddle, how are they going to find it? They can't read every one.

I suggest that the riddles be split up by difficulty: Very-Easy, Easy, Average, Hard, Very-Hard. Aesthetically, it would also be nice to give each riddle a title rather than a number. A hints/discussion page for each one would also be extremely nice. However those are extraneous. The splitting into difficulty categories is essential. --[[User:212.135.1.84|212.135.1.84]] 18:49, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Hints? ==

why are you giving hints before giving people the chance to figure things out? put the hints in a link.

== Hiding the answer in a template instead ==

In an attempt to help fix some of the problems with the solutions being deleted by over zealous administrators seeking to delete very small pages, I've tried to put the answers into a special template called [[:Template:Riddle]].

I've also gone and deleted the first two solution pages, and it would be useful to transfer the talk pages that may have been started for each answer to be here instead as well.  I'm not going to go any further at the moment, but instead I'm looking for general input in this matter before I add this template to all of the rest of the answers.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:56, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:Since there hasn't been any arguments either for or against this proposal, I'm going to go ahead and make the changes and delete the various ''Riddles'' sub-modules that are mostly one or two words anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:57, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

The title stays as one line regardless of line breaks in firefox. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 04:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

== Discussion about Each Riddle ==

=== Riddle 2 ===

This riddle could mean anything black on white, eg text, an oven, washing machine, etc...

==== scholar ====

The word scholar suggests that the answer is supposed to be book.
huhahua

=== Riddle 9 ===

Thats a sick riddle.

Really? I think is pretty cool.

=== Riddle 12 ===

How does a shadows footsteps talk?

=== Riddle 14 ===

My best guess is: bokrage
:Bok is Afrikaans for antelope. The springbok is the best known.
:Okra is a pepper-like vegetable. 
:Rag is a bit of a stretch for a utensil, but it's the best I can do.
:While by some definitions a person's age does change from year to year, it can also mean forever, which shouldn't change. (Ago could also fit here, but I don't think it works any better.)


&lt;P&gt;Brilliant work, but I don't think it answers the question - 1234567 was supposed to be a 7 letter word, too, and as far as I can tell, it's not.

&lt;P&gt;I have also seen this riddle saying &quot;changes every year&quot; instead of being the same every year.  Age would fit very well there.
&lt;br&gt;
The answer is Cabbage - Sudhish

----

&lt;P&gt;Other suggestions that I've seen:
&lt;P&gt;PROPEND
:PRO = professional sports teams get named after animals (lions, bears, ducks) -- doesn't really work
:ROPE = slang for licorice
:PEN = a writing utensil
:END = December 31st

&lt;P&gt;GARBAGE
:GAR = A fish
:ARBA = American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) -- doesn't really work
:BAG = A Bag is a utensil
:AGE = Age itself does not change just the ###'s that represent our age or Age of our waste is unproved.

----

Has anyone worked this one out?

=== Riddle 15 ===

This can also be the wind.

I agree most with wind. Mostly because of the breathing and how dying down doesnt really mean ending with wind.

''I disagree. The wind doesn't breathe, because it IS breath, actually. Though it may breeze. In order to breathe, you need another substance to breathe. The wind is made up of air, so it can't also breathe air. Fire, however, is kept alive by the oxygen in the air, so it breathes.''[[User:Balthus|Balthus]] 07:40, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
*I believe something is wrong with the format as I can't see anything on firefox or internet explorer [[User:Aznph8playa|Aznph8playa]] 04:43, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

Other suggestions:
the Sun

&quot;[B]lue fields&quot; can be interpretted as either a body or water or the sky.
problem: the sun burns.

The North star or big dipper

A compass needle
&quot;never moves&quot; applies to the needle, while the compas moves, the needle, when working properly and without too much interference from local magnetic sources, does not move or turn. It only appears to turn when you move the compass.




---The Day.---

''Guides travelers...'' Rises East, Sets West

''never moves...''  As opposed to day being in the nighttime.

''Always turning...'' Time of day

''never looks...'' Just to confuse the issue, from the phrase &quot;turn &amp; look&quot;

''Always shining...'' The Sun

''never burns...'' It never burns out.

''Looks on blue fields with each of its turns...'' The Sky is Blue. Each of it's turns just means the day.

---Dylan Campbell---


I vouch for the North Star.

''Guides travelers, never moves.'' - It is stationary in the sky.
''Always turning, never looks.'' - It is (from our perspective) revolving 360 degrees per day because of the rotation of the planet, though we can't really tell because it's a sphere.
''Always shining, never burns.'' - It is always shining, and doesn't burn anything on the Earth, unlike, say, the sun.  Obviously it is burning because it's a star, but...  You could apply this to lighthouses too.  Stand directly in front of the light and tell me it doesn't burn.
''Looks on blue fields with each of its turns.'' - Referring to blue sky during the day.

&quot;I feast on your body, your soul, and your mind,&quot; This doesnt make any sense for a shadow, or am I missing something?

      um i think because little kids, (and even adults) play games with shadows and avoid them or whatever. also, the later in the day it gets, the farther up your body a shadow would be if someone walked past you. ;)
==== Deletion and undeletion ====

Three times, users created this page and wrote &quot;shadow&quot; or &quot;a shadow&quot;. Twice, sysops deleted the page, but missed it the third time. I decided that this page was okay, so I undeleted the older versions. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Riddles%3A+21 deletion log].

Generally, a page containing only &quot;a shadow&quot; is nonsense, and eligible for speedy deletions. What those sysops did not know is that this page, [[Riddles: 21]], is linked from [[Puzzles:Riddles]]. &quot;A shadow&quot; is the answer to riddle 21.

However, visitors to [[Riddles: 21]], unless they come from [[Puzzles:Riddles]], have no idea what this page is about. There is no link back to [[Puzzles:Riddles]] or anywhere, and the module title does not show that module is part of the [[Puzzles]] book. This is ''another reason'' to support the requirement for slash convention in [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:16, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Ada's type system allows the programmer to construct powerful abstractions that represent the real world, and to provide valuable information to the compiler, so that the compiler can find many logic or design errors before they become bugs.  It is at the heart of the language, and good Ada programmers learn to use it to great advantage.  Four principles govern the type system:

* '''Strong typing''': types are incompatible with one another, so it is not possible to mix apples and oranges.  There are, however, ways to convert between types.
* '''Static typing''': type checked while compiling, this allows type errors to be found earlier.
* '''Abstraction''': types represent the real world or the problem at hand; not how the computer represents the data internally.  There are ways to specify exactly how a type must be represented at the bit level, but we will defer that discussion to another chapter.
* '''Name equivalence''', as opposed to ''structural equivalence'' used in most other languages.  Two types are compatible if and only if they have the same name; ''not'' if they just happen to have the same size or bit representation.  You can thus declare two integer types with the same ranges that are totally incompatible, or two record types with exactly the same components, but which are incompatible.

Types are incompatible with one another.  However, each type can have any number of ''subtypes'', which are compatible with their base type and may be compatible with one another. See below for examples of subtypes which are incompatible with one another.

== Predefined types ==

There are several predefined types, but most programmers prefer to define their own, application-specific types.  Nevertheless, these predefined types are very useful as interfaces between libraries developed independently.  The predefined library, obviously, uses these types too.

These types are predefined in the {{Ada/package|Standard}} package:
; Integer: This type covers at least the range &lt;math&gt;-2^{15}+1&lt;/math&gt; .. &lt;math&gt;+2^{15}-1&lt;/math&gt; (RM {{Ada/RM3|3|5|4|(21)}}). The Standard also defines &lt;code&gt;Natural&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Positive&lt;/code&gt; subtypes of this type.
{{Ada/Integer subtypes diagram}}
; Float: There is only a very weak implementation requirement on this type (RM {{Ada/RM3|3|5|7|(14)}}); most of the time you would define your own floating-point types, and specify your precision and range requirements.
; Duration: A [[Ada Programming/Types/delta|fixed point type]] used for timing. It represents a period of time in seconds (RM {{Ada/RM2|A|1|(43)}}).
; Character : A special form of [[Ada Programming/Types/Enumeration|Enumerations]]. There are three predefined kinds of character types: 8-bit characters (called &lt;code&gt;Character&lt;/code&gt;), 16-bit characters (called &lt;code&gt;Wide_Character&lt;/code&gt;), and 32-bit characters (&lt;code&gt;Wide_Wide_Character&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;Character&lt;/code&gt; has been present since the first version of the language ([[Ada Programming/Ada 83|Ada 83]]), &lt;code&gt;Wide_Character&lt;/code&gt; was added in [[Ada Programming/Ada 95|Ada 95]], while the type &lt;code&gt;Wide_Wide_Character&lt;/code&gt; is available with [[Ada Programming/Ada 2005|Ada 2005]].
; [[Ada Programming/Strings|String]]: Three indefinite [[Ada Programming/Types/array|array types]], of &lt;code&gt;Character&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Wide_Character&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Wide_Wide_Character&lt;/code&gt; respectively.  The standard library contains packages for handling strings in three variants: fixed length (&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}}&lt;/code&gt;), with varying length below a certain upper bound (&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Bounded}}&lt;/code&gt;), and unbounded length (&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Unbounded}}&lt;/code&gt;).  Each of these packages has a &lt;code&gt;Wide_&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Wide_Wide_&lt;/code&gt; variant.
; Boolean : A &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; in Ada is an [[Ada Programming/Types/Enumeration|Enumeration]] of &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; with special semantics.

Packages &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|System}}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|System|Storage_Elements}}&lt;/code&gt; predefine some types which are primarily useful for low-level programming and interfacing to hardware.

; System.Address : An address in memory.
; System.Storage_Elements.Storage_Offset : An offset, which can be added to an address to obtain a new address.  You can also subtract one address from another to get the offset between them.  Together, &lt;code&gt;Address&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Storage_Offset&lt;/code&gt; and their associated subprograms provide for address arithmetic.
; System.Storage_Elements.Storage_Count : A subtype of &lt;code&gt;Storage_Offset&lt;/code&gt; which cannot be negative, and represents the memory size of a data structure (similar to C's &lt;code&gt;size_t&lt;/code&gt;).
; System.Storage_Elements.Storage_Element : In most computers, this is a byte.  Formally, it is the smallest unit of memory that has an address.
; System.Storage_Elements.Storage_Array : An array of &lt;code&gt;Storage_Element&lt;/code&gt;s without any meaning, useful when doing raw memory access.

== The Type Hierarchy ==

Types are organized hierarchically.  A type inherits properties from types above it in the hierarchy.  For example, all scalar types (integer, enumeration, modular, fixed-point and floating-point types) have [[Ada Programming/Operators|operators]] &quot;{{Ada/op|&lt;}}&quot;, &quot;{{Ada/op|&gt;}}&quot; and arithmetic operators defined for them, and all discrete types can serve as array indexes.

Here is a broad overview of each category of types; please follow the links for detailed explanations. Inside parenthesis there are equivalences in C and Pascal for readers familiar with those languages.

; [[Ada Programming/Types/range|Signed Integers]] &lt;small&gt;('''int''', '''INTEGER''')&lt;/small&gt; : Signed Integers are defined via the [[Ada Programming/Types/range|range]] of values needed.
; [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|Unsigned Integers]] &lt;small&gt;('''unsigned''', '''CARDINAL''')&lt;/small&gt; : Unsigned Integers are called [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|Modular Types]]. Apart from being unsigned they also have wrap-around functionality.
; [[Ada Programming/Types/Enumeration|Enumerations]] &lt;small&gt;('''enum''', '''char''', '''bool''', '''BOOLEAN''')&lt;/small&gt; : Ada [[Ada Programming/Types/Enumeration|Enumeration]] types are a separate type family.
; [[Ada Programming/Types/digits|Floating point]] &lt;small&gt;('''float''', '''double''', '''REAL''')&lt;/small&gt; : Floating point types are defined by the [[Ada Programming/Types/digits|digits]] needed, the relative error bound.
; [[Ada Programming/Types/delta|Ordinary and Decimal Fixed Point]] &lt;small&gt;('''DECIMAL''')&lt;/small&gt; : Fixed point types are defined by their [[Ada Programming/Types/delta|delta]], the absolute error bound.
; [[Ada Programming/Types/array|Arrays]] &lt;small&gt;( '''[ ]''', '''ARRAY [ ] OF''', '''STRING''' )&lt;/small&gt; : Arrays with both compile-time and run-time determined size are supported.
; [[Ada Programming/Types/record|Record]] &lt;small&gt;('''struct''', '''class''', '''RECORD OF''')&lt;/small&gt; : A '''record''' is a [[Ada Programming/Types#List of types|composite type]] that groups one or more fields.
; [[Ada Programming/Types/access|Access]] &lt;small&gt;('''*''', '''^''', '''POINTER TO''')&lt;/small&gt; : Ada's [[Ada Programming/Types/access|Access]] types may be more than just a simple memory address.
; [[Ada_Programming/Tasking|Task &amp; Protected]] &lt;small&gt;(no equivalence in C or Pascal)&lt;/small&gt; : Task and Protected types allow the control of concurrency
; [[Ada Programming/Keywords/interface|Interfaces]] &lt;small&gt;(no equivalence in C or Pascal)&lt;/small&gt; : New in Ada 2005, these types are similar to the Java interfaces.

=== Classification of Types ===

The types of this hierarchy can be classified as follows.

'''Specific vs. Class-wide'''

 {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} ...  -- specific
   T'Class      -- class-wide

Operations of specific types are ''non-dispatching'', those on class-wide types are ''dispatching''.

New types can be declared by ''deriving'' from specific types; primitive operations are ''inherited'' by derivation. You cannot derive from class-wide types.

'''Constrained vs. Unconstrained'''

 {{Ada/kw|type}} I {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;           -- constrained
 {{Ada/kw|type}} AC {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 10) {{Ada/kw|of}} ...  -- constrained

 {{Ada/kw|type}} AU {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (I {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} ...          -- unconstrained
 {{Ada/kw|type}} R (X: Discriminant [:= Default]) {{Ada/kw|is}} ...  -- unconstrained

By giving a ''constraint'' to an unconstrained subtype, a subtype or object becomes constrained:

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} RC {{Ada/kw|is}} R (Value);  -- constrained subtype of R
 OC: R (Value);            -- constrained object of anonymous constrained subtype of R
 OU: R;                    -- unconstrained object

Declaring an unconstrained object is only possible if a default value is given in the type declaration above. The language does not specify how such objects are allocated. GNAT allocates the maximum size, so that size changes that might occur with discriminant changes present no problem. Another possibility is implicit dynamic allocation on the heap and re-allocation followed by a deallocation when the size changes.

''' Definite vs. Indefinite'''

 {{Ada/kw|type}} I {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;                     -- definite
 {{Ada/kw|type}} RD (X: Discriminant := Default) {{Ada/kw|is}} ...  -- definite

 {{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} ...                    -- indefinite
 {{Ada/kw|type}} AU {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (I {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} ...  -- indefinite
 {{Ada/kw|type}} RI (X: Discriminant) {{Ada/kw|is}} ...      -- indefinite

Definite subtypes allow the declaration of objects without initial value, since objects of definite subtypes have constraints that are known at creation-time. Object declarations of indefinite subtypes need an initial value to supply a constraint; they are then constrained by the constraint delivered by the initial value.

 OT: T  := Expr;                       -- some initial expression (object, function call, etc.)
 OA: AU := (3 =&gt; 10, 5 =&gt; 2, 4 =&gt; 4);  -- index range is now 3 .. 5
 OR: RI := Expr;                       -- again some initial expression as above

'''Unconstrained vs. Indefinite'''

Note that unconstrained subtypes are not necessarily indefinite as can be seen above with RD: it is a definite unconstrained subtype.

== Concurrency Types ==

The Ada language uses types for one more purpose in addition to classifying data
+ operations. The type system integrates concurrency (threading, parallelism).
Programmers will use types for expressing the concurrent
threads of control of their programs.

The core pieces of this part of the type system, the '''task''' types and
the '''protected''' types are explained in greater depth in
[[Ada_Programming/Tasking|a section on tasking]].

== Limited Types ==

Limiting a type means disallowing assignment.
The &amp;ldquo;concurrency types&amp;rdquo; described above are always limited.
Programmers can define their own types to be limited, too, like this:

 {{Ada/keyword|type}} T {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|limited}} &amp;hellip;;

(The ellipsis stands for {{Ada/kw|private}}, or for a {{Ada/kw|record}} definition,
see the corresponding subsection on this page.)
A  limited type also doesn't have
an equality operator unless the programmer defines one.

You can learn more in the [[Ada_Programming/Types/limited|limited types]] chapter.

== Defining new types and subtypes ==

You can define a new type with the following syntax:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}}...

followed by the description of the type, as explained in detail in each category of type.

Formally, the above declaration creates a type and its ''first subtype'' named &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;.  The type itself, correctly called the &quot;type of T&quot;, is anonymous; the RM refers to it as &lt;code&gt;''T''&lt;/code&gt; (in italics), but often speaks sloppily about the type T. But this is an academic consideration; for most purposes, it is sufficient to think of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; as a type.
For scalar types, there is also a base type called &lt;code&gt;T'Base&lt;/code&gt;, which encompasses all values of T.

For signed integer types, the type of T comprises the (complete) set of mathematical integers. The base type is a certain hardware type, symmetric around zero (except for possibly one extra negative value), encompassing all values of T.  

As explained above, all types are incompatible; thus:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
 A : Integer_1 := 8;
 B : Integer_2 := A; {{Ada/comment|illegal!}}

is illegal, because &lt;code&gt;Integer_1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Integer_2&lt;/code&gt; are different and incompatible types.  It is this feature which allows the compiler to detect logic errors at compile time, such as adding a file descriptor to a number of bytes, or a length to a weight.  The fact that the two types have the same range does not make them compatible: this is ''name equivalence'' in action, as opposed to structural equivalence.  (Below, we will see how you can convert between incompatible types; there are strict rules for this.)

=== Creating subtypes ===

You can also create new subtypes of a given type, which will be compatible with each other, like this:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Integer_2 {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer_1      {{Ada/kw|range}} 7 .. 11;  {{Ada/comment|bad}}
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Integer_3 {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer_1'Base {{Ada/kw|range}} 7 .. 11;  {{Ada/comment|OK}}
 A : Integer_1 := 8;
 B : Integer_3 := A; {{Ada/comment|OK}}

The declaration of &lt;code&gt;Integer_2&lt;/code&gt; is bad because the constraint &lt;code&gt;7 .. 11&lt;/code&gt; is not compatible with &lt;code&gt;Integer_1&lt;/code&gt;; it raises &lt;code&gt;Constraint_Error&lt;/code&gt; at subtype elaboration time.

&lt;code&gt;Integer_1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Integer_3&lt;/code&gt; are compatible because they are both subtypes of the same type, namely &lt;code&gt;Integer_1'Base&lt;/code&gt;.

It is not necessary that the subtype ranges overlap, or be included in one another.  The compiler inserts a run-time range check when you assign A to B; if the value of A, at that point, happens to be outside the range of &lt;code&gt;Integer_3&lt;/code&gt;, the program raises &lt;code&gt;Constraint_Error&lt;/code&gt;.

There are a few predefined subtypes which are very useful:

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Natural  {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. Integer'Last;
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Positive {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Integer'Last;

=== Derived types ===

A derived type is a new, full-blown type created from an existing one.  Like any other type, it is incompatible with its parent; however, it inherits the primitive operations defined for the parent type.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|range}} 2 .. 8;
 A : Integer_1 := 8;
 B : Integer_2 := A; {{Ada/comment|illegal!}}

Here both types are discrete; it is mandatory that the range of the derived type be included in the range of its parent.  Contrast this with subtypes.  The reason is that the derived type inherits the primitive operations defined for its parent, and these operations assume the range of the parent type.  Here is an illustration of this feature:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Derived_Types {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Pak {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
       {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (I: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer_1); {{Ada/comment|primitive operation, assumes 1 .. 10}}
       {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|range}} 8 .. 10; {{Ada/comment|must not break P's assumption}}
       {{Ada/comment|procedure P (I: in Integer_2);  inherited P implicitly defined here}}
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Pak;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Pak {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Pak;
 
    {{Ada/kw|use}} Pak;
    A: Integer_1 := 4;
    B: Integer_2 := 9;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
    P (B); {{Ada/comment|OK, call the inherited operation}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Derived_Types;

When we call &lt;code&gt;P (B)&lt;/code&gt;, the parameter B is converted to &lt;code&gt;Integer_1&lt;/code&gt;; this conversion of course passes since the set of acceptable values for the derived type (here, 8 .. 10) must be included in that of the parent type (1 .. 10). Then P is called with the converted parameter.

Consider however a variant of the example above:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Derived_Types {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|package}} Pak {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (I: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer_1; J: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer_1);
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|range}} 8 .. 10;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Pak;
 
   {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Pak {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (I: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer_1; J: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer_1) {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       J := I - 1;
     {{Ada/kw|end}} P;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Pak;
 
   {{Ada/kw|use}} Pak;
 
   A: Integer_1 := 4;  X: Integer_1;
   B: Integer_2 := 8;  Y: Integer_2;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   P (A, X);
   P (B, Y);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Derived_Types;

When &lt;code&gt;P (B, Y)&lt;/code&gt; is called, both parameters are converted to &lt;code&gt;Integer_1&lt;/code&gt;. Thus the range check on J (7) in the body of P will pass. However on return parameter Y is converted back to &lt;code&gt;Integer_2&lt;/code&gt; and the range check on Y will of course fail.

With the above in mind, you will see why in the following program Constraint_Error will be called at run time, before &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; is even called.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Derived_Types {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|package}} Pak {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (I: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer_1; J: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer_1);
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Integer_2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Integer_1'Base {{Ada/kw|range}} 8 .. 12;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Pak;
 
   {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Pak {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (I: {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer_1; J: {{Ada/kw|out}} Integer_1) {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       J := I - 1;
     {{Ada/kw|end}} P;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Pak;
 
   {{Ada/kw|use}} Pak;
 
   B: Integer_2 := 11;  Y: Integer_2;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   P (B, Y);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Derived_Types;

== Subtype categories ==

Ada supports various categories of subtypes which have different abilities. Here is an overview in alphabetical order.

=== Anonymous subtype ===

A subtype which does not have a name assigned to it. Such a subtype is created with a variable declaration:

 X : String (1 .. 10) := ({{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; ' ');

Here, (1 .. 10) is the constraint. This variable declaration is equivalent to:

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Anonymous_String_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} String (1 .. 10);
 
 X : Anonymous_String_Type := ({{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; ' ');

=== Base type ===

In Ada, all types are [[#anonymous|anonymous]] and only subtypes may be [[#named subtype|named]].
For scalar types, there is a special subtype of the anonymous type, called the ''base type'', which is nameable with the '{{Ada/attribute|Base}} attribute.
The base type comprises all values of the ''first subtype''. Some examples:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Int {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 100;

The base type &lt;code&gt;Int'Base&lt;/code&gt; is a hardware type selected by the compiler that comprises the values of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;. Thus it may have the range -2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; .. 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;-1 or -2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; .. 2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;-1 or any other such type.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Enum  {{Ada/kw|is}} (A, B, C, D);
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Short {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Enum {{Ada/kw|range}} A .. C;

&lt;code&gt;Enum'Base&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;Short'Base&lt;/code&gt; also holds the literal &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Constrained subtype ===

A subtype of an indefinite subtype that adds constraints. The following example defines a 10 character string sub-type.

  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} String_10 {{Ada/kw|is}} String (1 .. 10);

You cannot partially constrain an unconstrained subtype:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;, Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Some_Type;
 
  -- {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Constr {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Array (1 .. 10, Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;);  illegal
 
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Constr {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Array (1 .. 10, -100 .. 200);

Constraints for all indices must be given, the result is necessarily a definite subtype.

=== Definite subtype ===

A definite subtype is a subtype whose size is known at compile-time. All subtypes which are not indefinite subtypes are, by definition, definite subtypes.

Objects of definite subtypes may be declared without additional constraints.

=== Indefinite subtype ===

An '''indefinite subtype''' is a subtype whose size is not known at compile-time but is dynamically calculated at run-time. An indefinite subtype does not by itself provide enough information to create an object; an additional constraint or explicit initialization expression is necessary in order to calculate the actual size and therefore create the object.

 X : String := &quot;This is a string&quot;;

&lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is an object of the indefinite (sub)type &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. Its constraint is derived implicitly from its initial value.  &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; may change its value, but not its bounds.

It should be noted that it is not necessary to initialize the object from a literal. You can also use a function. For example:

 X : String := Ada.Command_Line.Argument (1);

This statement reads the first command-line argument and assigns it to &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;.

A subtype of an indefinite subtype that does not add a constraint only introduces a new name for the original subtype (a kind of renaming under a different notion).

  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} My_String {{Ada/kw|is}} String;

&lt;tt&gt;My_String&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; are interchangeable.

=== Named subtype ===

A subtype which has a name assigned to it. “First subtypes” are created with the keyword &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}}&lt;/code&gt; (remember that types are always anonymous, the name in a type declaration is the name of the first subtype), others with the keyword &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|subtype}}&lt;/code&gt;. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Count_To_Ten {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;

&lt;code&gt;Count_to_Ten&lt;/code&gt; is the first subtype of a suitable integer base type.
However, if you would like to use this as an index constraint on &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, the following declaration is illegal:

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Ten_Characters {{Ada/kw|is}} String (Count_to_Ten);

This is because &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;Positive&lt;/code&gt; as its index, which is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; (these declarations are taken from package &lt;code&gt;Standard&lt;/code&gt;):

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Positive {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Integer'Last;
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} String {{Ada/kw|is}} (Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Character;

So you have to use the following declarations:

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Count_To_Ten {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Ten_Characters {{Ada/kw|is}} String (Count_to_Ten);

Now &lt;code&gt;Ten_Characters&lt;/code&gt; is the name of that subtype of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; which is constrained to &lt;code&gt;Count_To_Ten&lt;/code&gt;.
You see that posing constraints on types versus subtypes has very different effects.

=== Unconstrained subtype ===

Any indefinite type is also an unconstrained subtype. However, unconstrainedness and indefiniteness are not the same.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (A, B, C);
  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Record (Discriminant: My_Enum) {{Ada/kw|is}} ...;
 
  My_Object_A: My_Record (A);

This type is unconstrained and indefinite because you need to give an actual discriminant for object declarations; the object is constrained to this discriminant which may not change.

When however a default is provided for the discriminant, the type is definite yet unconstrained; it allows to define both, constrained and unconstrained objects:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (A, B, C);
  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Record (Discriminant: My_Enum := A) {{Ada/kw|is}} ...;
 
  My_Object_U: My_Record;      -- unconstrained object
  My_Object_B: My_Record (B);  -- constrained to discriminant B like above

Here, My_Object_U is unconstrained; upon declaration, it has the discriminant A (the default) which however may change.

=== Incompatible subtypes ===

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Integer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -10 .. + 10;
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} My_Positive {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} + 1 .. + 10;
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} My_Negative {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} -10 .. -  1;

These subtypes are of course incompatible.

Another example are subtypes of a discriminated record:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (A, B, C);
  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Record (Discriminant: My_Enum) {{Ada/kw|is}} ...;
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} My_A_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Record (A);
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} My_C_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Record (C);

Also these subtypes are incompatible.

== Qualified expressions ==

In most cases, the compiler is able to infer the type of an expression; for example:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (A, B, C);
 E : Enum := A;

Here the compiler knows that &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is a value of the type &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt;.  But consider:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Bad {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Enum_1 {{Ada/kw|is}} (A, B, C);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (E : {{Ada/kw|in}} Enum_1) {{Ada/kw|is}}... {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Enum_2 {{Ada/kw|is}} (A, X, Y, Z);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (E : {{Ada/kw|in}} Enum_2) {{Ada/kw|is}}... {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    P (A); {{Ada/comment|illegal: ambiguous}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Bad;

The compiler cannot choose between the two versions of &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;; both would be equally valid.  To remove the ambiguity, you use a ''qualified expression'':

    P (Enum_1'(A)); {{Ada/comment|OK}}

As seen in the following example, this syntax is often used when creating new objects. If you try to compile the example, it will fail with a compilation error since the compiler will determine that 256 is not in range of &lt;code&gt;Byte&lt;/code&gt;.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|convert_evaluate_as.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Convert_Evaluate_As {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 2**8;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte_Ptr {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Byte;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} M_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Modular_IO}} (Byte);
 
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Byte_Ptr := {{Ada/kw|new}} Byte'(256);
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;A = &quot;);
    M_IO.Put (Item  =&gt; A.all,
              Width =&gt;  5,
              Base  =&gt; 10);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Convert_Evaluate_As;

== Type conversions ==

Data do not always come in the format you need them. You must, then, face the task of converting them. As a true multi-purpose language with a special emphasis on &quot;mission critical&quot;, &quot;system programming&quot; and &quot;safety&quot;, Ada has several conversion techniques.  The most difficult part is choosing the right one, so the following list is sorted in order of utility. You should try the first one first; the last technique is a last resort, to be used if all others fail. There are also a few related techniques that you might choose instead of actually converting the data.

Since the most important aspect is not the result of a successful conversion, but how the system will react to an invalid conversion, all examples also demonstrate '''faulty''' conversions.

=== Explicit type conversion ===

An explicit type conversion looks much like a function call; it does not use the ''tick'' (apostrophe, ') like the qualified expression does.

 Type_Name (''Expression'')

The compiler first checks that the conversion is legal, and if it is, it inserts a run-time check at the point of the conversion; hence the name ''checked conversion''.  If the conversion fails, the program raises Constraint_Error.  Most compilers are very smart and optimise away the constraint checks; so, you need not worry about any performance penalty.  Some compilers can also warn that a constraint check will always fail (and optimise the check with an unconditional raise).

Explicit type conversions are legal:
* between any two numeric types
* between any two subtypes of the same type
* between any two types derived from the same type (note special rules for tagged types)
* between array types under certain conditions (see RM 4.6(24.2/2..24.7/2))
* and ''nowhere else''

(The rules become more complex with class-wide and anonymous access types.)

 I: Integer := Integer (10);  {{Ada/--|Unnecessary explicit type conversion}}
 J: Integer := 10;            {{Ada/--|Implicit conversion from universal integer}}
 K: Integer := Integer'(10);  {{Ada/--|Use the value 10 of type Integer: qualified expression}}
                              {{Ada/--|(qualification not necessary here).}}

This example illustrates explicit type conversions:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|convert_checked.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Convert_Checked {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Short {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -128 .. +127;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 256;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Integer_IO}} (Short);
    {{Ada/kw|package}} M_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Modular_IO}} (Byte);
 
    A : Short := -1;
    B : Byte;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    B := Byte (A);  -- range check will lead to Constraint_Error
    T_IO.Put (&quot;A = &quot;);
    I_IO.Put (Item  =&gt;  A,
              Width =&gt;  5,
              Base  =&gt; 10);
    T_IO.Put (&quot;, B = &quot;);
    M_IO.Put (Item  =&gt;  B,
              Width =&gt;  5,
              Base  =&gt; 10);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Convert_Checked;

Explicit conversions are possible between any two numeric types: integers, fixed-point and floating-point types. If one of the types involved is a fixed-point or floating-point type, the compiler not only checks for the range constraints (thus the code above will raise Constraint_Error), but also performs any loss of precision necessary.

Example 1: the loss of precision causes the procedure to only ever print &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;, since &lt;code&gt;P / 100&lt;/code&gt; is an integer and is always zero or one.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Naive_Explicit_Conversion {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Proportion {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|digits}} 4 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0.0 .. 1.0;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Percentage {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 100;
    {{Ada/kw|function}} To_Proportion (P : {{Ada/kw|in}} Percentage) {{Ada/kw|return}} Proportion {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} Proportion (P / 100);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} To_Proportion;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Proportion'Image (To_Proportion (27)));
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Naive_Explicit_Conversion;

Example 2: we use an intermediate floating-point type to guarantee the precision.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Explicit_Conversion {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Proportion {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|digits}} 4 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0.0 .. 1.0;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Percentage {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 100;
    {{Ada/kw|function}} To_Proportion (P : {{Ada/kw|in}} Percentage) {{Ada/kw|return}} Proportion {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|type}} Prop {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|digits}} 4 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0.0 .. 100.0;
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       {{Ada/kw|return}} Proportion (Prop (P) / 100.0);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} To_Proportion;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Proportion'Image (To_Proportion (27)));
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Explicit_Conversion;

You might ask why you should convert between two subtypes of the same type. An example will illustrate this.

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} String_10 {{Ada/kw|is}} String (1 .. 10);
 X: String := &quot;A line long enough to make the example valid&quot;;
 Slice: {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := String_10 (X (11 .. 20));

Here, &lt;code&gt;Slice&lt;/code&gt; has bounds 1 and 10, whereas &lt;code&gt;X (11 .. 20)&lt;code&gt; has bounds 11 and 20.

=== Change of Representation ===

Type conversions can be used for packing and unpacking of records or arrays.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unpacked {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   {{Ada/comment|any components}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Packed {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Unpacked;
 {{Ada/kw|for}}  Packed {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   {{Ada/comment|component clauses for some or for all components}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

 P: Packed;
 U: Unpacked;
 
 P := Packed (U);  {{Ada/comment|packs U}}
 U := Unpacked (P);  {{Ada/comment|unpacks P}}

=== Checked conversion for non-numeric types ===

The examples above all revolved around conversions between numeric types; it is possible to convert between any two numeric types in this way.  But what happens between non-numeric types, e.g. between array types or record types?  The answer is two-fold:

* you can convert explicitly between a type and types derived from it, or between types derived from the same type,
* and that's all.  No other conversions are possible.

Why would you want to derive a record type from another record type?  Because of representation clauses.  Here we enter the realm of low-level systems programming, which is not for the faint of heart, nor is it useful for desktop applications.  So hold on tight, and let's dive in.

Suppose you have a record type which uses the default, efficient representation.  Now you want to write this record to a device, which uses a special record format.  This special representation is more compact (uses fewer bits), but is grossly inefficient.  You want to have a layered programming interface: the upper layer, intended for applications, uses the efficient representation.  The lower layer is a device driver that accesses the hardware directly and uses the inefficient representation.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Device_Driver {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Size_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 64;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Register {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
       A, B : Boolean;
       Size : Size_Type;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Read (R : {{Ada/kw|out}} Register);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Write (R : {{Ada/kw|in}} Register);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Device_Driver;

The compiler chooses a default, efficient representation for &lt;code&gt;Register&lt;/code&gt;.  For example, on a 32-bit machine, it would probably use three 32-bit words, one for A, one for B and one for Size.  This efficient representation is good for applications, but at one point we want to convert the entire record to just 8 bits, because that's what our hardware requires.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Device_Driver {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Hardware_Register {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Register; {{Ada/comment|Derived type.}}
    {{Ada/kw|for}} Hardware_Register {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
       A {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 0;
       B {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 1;
       Size {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 2 .. 7;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Get {{Ada/kw|return}} Hardware_Register; {{Ada/comment|Body omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (H : {{Ada/kw|in}} Hardware_Register); {{Ada/comment|Body omitted}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Read (R : {{Ada/kw|out}} Register) {{Ada/kw|is}}
       H : Hardware_Register := Get;
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       R := Register (H); {{Ada/comment|Explicit conversion.}}
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Read;
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Write (R : {{Ada/kw|in}} Register) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       Put (Hardware_Register (R)); {{Ada/comment|Explicit conversion.}}
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Write;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Device_Driver;

In the above example, the package body declares a derived type with the inefficient, but compact representation, and converts to and from it.

This illustrates that '''type conversions can result in a change of representation'''.

=== View conversion, in object-oriented programming ===

Within [[ada Programming/Object Orientation|object-oriented programming]] you have to distinguish between specific types and class-wide types.

With specific types, only conversions to ancestors are possible and, of course, are checked. During the conversion, you do not &quot;drop&quot; any components that are present in the derived type and not in the parent type; these components are still present, you just don't see them anymore.  This is called a ''view conversion''.

There are no conversions to derived types &lt;small&gt;(where would you get the further components from?)&lt;/small&gt;;  ''extension aggregates'' have to be used instead.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Parent_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Child_Type  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Parent_Type {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 Child_Instance  : Child_Type;
 
 {{Ada/comment|View conversion from the child type to the parent type:}}
 Parent_View : Parent_Type := Parent_Type (Child_Instance);

Since, in object-oriented programming, an object of child type ''is an'' object of the parent type, no run-time check is necessary.

With class-wide types, conversions to ancestor and child types are possible and are checked as well. These conversions are also view conversions, no data is created or lost.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (Parent_View : Parent_Type'Class) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/comment|View conversion to the child type:}}
    One : Child_Type := Child_Type (Parent_View);
 
    {{Ada/comment|View conversion to the class-wide child type:}}
    Two : Child_Type'Class := Child_Type'Class (Parent_View);

This view conversion involves a run-time check to see if &lt;code&gt;Parent_View&lt;/code&gt; is indeed a view of an object of type &lt;code&gt;Child_Type&lt;/code&gt;.  In the second case, the run-time check accepts objects of type &lt;code&gt;Child_Type&lt;/code&gt; but also any type derived from &lt;code&gt;Child_Type&lt;/code&gt;.

==== View renaming ====

A renaming declaration does not create any new object and performs no conversion; it only gives a new name to something that already exists.  Performance is optimal since the renaming is completely done at compile time.  We mention it here because it is a common idiom in [[ada Programming/Object Orientation|object oriented programming]] to rename the result of a view conversion.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Parent_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
    &lt;components&gt;;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Child_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Parent_Type {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
    &lt;further components&gt;;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 Child_Instance : Child_Type;
 Parent_View    : Parent_Type'{{Ada/attribute|Class}} {{Ada/kw|renames}} Parent_Type'{{Ada/attribute|Class}} (Child_Instance);

Now, &lt;code&gt;Parent_View&lt;/code&gt; is not a new object, but another name for &lt;code&gt;Child_Instance&lt;/code&gt; viewed as the parent, i.e. only the parent components are visible, the further child components are hidden.

=== Address conversion ===

Ada's [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access type]] is not just a memory location (a thin pointer). Depending on implementation and the [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access type]] used, the [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access]] might keep additional information (a fat pointer). For example GNAT keeps two memory addresses for each [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access]] to an indefinite object &amp;mdash; one for the data and one for the constraint informations &lt;small&gt;({{Ada/attribute|Size}}, {{Ada/attribute|First}}, {{Ada/attribute|Last}}'')&lt;/small&gt;.

If you want to convert an access to a simple memory location you can use the package &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|System|Address_To_Access_Conversions}}&lt;/code&gt;.
Note however that an address and a fat pointer cannot be converted reversibly into one another.

The address of an array object is the address of its first component. Thus the bounds get lost in such a conversion.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Something;
 A: My_Array (50 .. 100);
 
      A'{{Ada/attribute|Address}} = A(A'{{Ada/attribute|First}})'{{Ada/attribute|Address}}

=== Unchecked conversion ===

One of the great criticisms of Pascal was &quot;there is no escape&quot;. The reason was that sometimes you have to convert the incompatible. For this purpose, Ada has the generic function ''Unchecked_Conversion'':

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Source (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Target (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|function}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Conversion}} (S : Source) {{Ada/kw|return}} Target;

&lt;code&gt;''Unchecked_Conversion''&lt;/code&gt; will bit-copy the source data and reinterpret them under the target type without any checks. It is '''your''' chore to make sure that the requirements on unchecked conversion as stated in RM {{Ada/RM2|13|9|}} are fulfilled; if not, the result is implementation dependent and may even lead to abnormal data. Use the 'Valid attribute after the conversion to check the validity of the data in problematic cases.

A function call to (an instance of) &lt;code&gt;Unchecked_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; will copy the source to the destination. The compiler may also do a conversion ''in place'' (every instance has the convention ''Intrinsic'').

To use &lt;code&gt;Unchecked_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; you need to instantiate the generic.

In the example below, you can see how this is done. When run, the example will output &lt;code&gt;A = -1, B = 255&lt;/code&gt;. No error will be reported, but is this the result you expect?

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|convert_unchecked.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Conversion}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Convert_Unchecked {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Short {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -128 .. +127;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 256;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Integer_IO}} (Short);
    {{Ada/kw|package}} M_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Modular_IO}} (Byte);
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Convert {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Conversion}} (Source =&gt; Short,
                                                      Target =&gt; Byte);
 
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Short := -1;
    B : Byte;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
    B := Convert (A);
    T_IO.Put (&quot;A = &quot;);
    I_IO.Put (Item  =&gt;  A,
              Width =&gt;  5,
              Base  =&gt; 10);
    T_IO.Put (&quot;, B = &quot;);
    M_IO.Put (Item  =&gt;  B,
              Width =&gt;  5,
              Base  =&gt; 10);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Convert_Unchecked;

There is of course a range check in the assignment &lt;code&gt;B := Convert (A);&lt;/code&gt;. Thus if &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; were defined as &lt;code&gt;B: Byte {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 10;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Constraint_Error&lt;/code&gt; would be raised.

=== Overlays ===

If the copying of the result of &lt;code&gt;Unchecked_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; is too much waste in terms of performance, then you can try overlays, i.e. address mappings. By using overlays, both objects share the same memory location. If you assign a value to one, the other changes as well. The syntax is:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Target'{{Ada/attribute|Address}} {{Ada/kw|use}} ''expression'';
 {{Ada/pragma|Import}} (Ada, Target);

where ''expression'' defines the address of the source object.

While overlays might look more elegant than &lt;code&gt;Unchecked_Conversion&lt;/code&gt;, you should be aware that they are even more dangerous and have even greater potential for doing something very wrong. For example if &lt;code&gt;Source'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} &lt; Target'{{Ada/attribute|Size}}&lt;/code&gt; and you assign a value to Target, you might inadvertently write into memory allocated to a different object.

You have to take care also of implicit initializations of objects of the target type, since they would overwrite the actual value of the source object. The Import pragma with convention Ada can be used to prevent this, since it avoids the implicit initialization, RM {{Ada/RM2|B|1|}}.

The example below does the same as the example from &quot;Unchecked Conversion&quot;.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|convert_address_mapping.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Convert_Address_Mapping {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Short {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -128 .. +127;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 256;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Integer_IO}} (Short);
    {{Ada/kw|package}} M_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Modular_IO}} (Byte);
 
    A : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Short;
    B : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Byte;
   
    {{Ada/kw|for}} B'{{Ada/attribute|Address}} {{Ada/kw|use}} A'{{Ada/attribute|Address}};
   {{Ada/pragma|Import}} (Ada, B);
   
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    A := -1;
    T_IO.Put (&quot;A = &quot;);
    I_IO.Put (Item  =&gt;  A,
              Width =&gt;  5,
              Base  =&gt; 10);
    T_IO.Put (&quot;, B = &quot;);
    M_IO.Put (Item  =&gt;  B,
              Width =&gt;  5,
              Base  =&gt; 10);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Convert_Address_Mapping;

=== Export / Import ===

Just for the record: There is still another method using the {{Ada/pragma name|Export}} and {{Ada/pragma name|Import}} pragmas. However, since this method completely undermines Ada's visibility and type concepts even more than overlays, it has no place here in this language introduction and is left to experts.

== Elaborated Discussion of Types for Signed Integer Types ==

As explained before, a type declaration

 {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 10;

declares an anonymous type &lt;code&gt;''T''&lt;/code&gt; and its first subtype &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; (please note the italicization). &lt;code&gt;''T''&lt;/code&gt; encompasses the complete set of mathematical integers. Static expressions and named numbers make use of this fact.

All numeric integer literals are of type &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt;. They are converted to the appropriate specific type where needed. &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt; itself has no operators.

Some examples with static named numbers:

  S1: {{Ada/kw|constant}} := Integer'{{Ada/at|Last}} + Integer'{{Ada/at|Last}};       {{Ada/--|&quot;+&quot; of Integer}}
  S2: {{Ada/kw|constant}} := Long_Integer'{{Ada/at|Last}} + 1;             {{Ada/--|&quot;+&quot; of Long_Integer}}
  S3: {{Ada/kw|constant}} := S1 + S2;                           {{Ada/--|&quot;+&quot; of root_integer}}
  S4: {{Ada/kw|constant}} := Integer'{{Ada/at|Last}} + Long_Integer'{{Ada/at|Last}};  {{Ada/--|illegal}}

Static expressions are evaluated at compile-time on the appropriate types with no overflow checks, i.e. mathematically exact (only limited by computer store). The result is then implicitly converted to &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt;.

The literal 1 in &lt;code&gt;S2&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt; and implicitly converted to &lt;code&gt;Long_Integer&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;S3&lt;/code&gt; implicitly converts the summands to &lt;code&gt;root_integer&lt;/code&gt;, performs the calculation and converts back to &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;S4&lt;/code&gt; is illegal because it mixes two different types. You can however write this as

  S5: {{Ada/kw|constant}} := Integer'Pos (Integer'{{Ada/at|Last}}) + Long_Integer'Pos (Long_Integer'{{Ada/at|Last}});  {{Ada/--|&quot;+&quot; of root_integer}}

where the Pos attributes convert the values to &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt;, which are then further implicitly converted to &lt;code&gt;root_integer&lt;/code&gt;, added and the result converted back to &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;root_integer&lt;/code&gt; is the anonymous greatest integer type representable by the hardware. It has the range &lt;code&gt;System.Min_Integer .. System.Max_Integer&lt;/code&gt;. All integer types are rooted at &lt;code&gt;root_integer&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. derived from it. &lt;code&gt;Universal_Integer&lt;/code&gt; can be viewed as &lt;code&gt;root_integer'Class&lt;/code&gt;.

During run-time, computations of course are performed with range checks and overflow checks on the appropriate subtype. Intermediate results may however exceed the range limits. Thus with &lt;code&gt;I, J, K&lt;/code&gt; of the subtype &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; above, the following code will return the correct result:

 I := 10;
 J :=  8;
 K := (I + J) - 12;
 {{Ada/--|1= I := I + J;  -- range check would fail, leading to Constraint_Error}}

Real literals are of type &lt;code&gt;Universal_Real&lt;/code&gt;, and similar rules as the ones above apply accordingly.

== Relations between types ==

Types can be made from other types. Array types, for example, are made from two types, one for the arrays' index and one for the arrays' components. An array, then, expresses an association, namely that between one value of the index type and a value of the component type.

  {{Ada/keyword|type}} Color {{Ada/keyword|is}} (Red, Green, Blue);
  {{Ada/keyword|type}} Intensity {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|range}} 0 .. 255;
  
  {{Ada/keyword|type}} Colored_Point {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|array}} (Color) {{Ada/keyword|of}} Intensity;

The type &lt;tt&gt;Color&lt;/tt&gt; is the index type and the type &lt;tt&gt;Intensity&lt;/tt&gt; is the component type of the array type &lt;tt&gt;Colored_Point&lt;/tt&gt;. See [[Ada_Programming/Types/array|array]].

* Snapshot Recall and Store ports won't always fire on switch pressing. They only fire when they should (ie when a snap is recalled or stored respectively)

* MultiPicture module works in incremental mode. MX and MY ports do not fire anything on ensemble start up, or on switch pressing, as that usually conflicts with a [[Reaktor/Modules/Snap Value|Snap Value]]. They only fire as you move the mouse.</text>

* The CR output fires constantly at the [[Reaktor:Control Rate|control rate]] (typically 400hz). So, if the CR output is connected to a complex event structure, you will have a lot of events being processed that will eat more CPU.

* The difference between the Selector and [[Reaktor/Modules/Router M to 1|Router]] is that when you change the Selector to a new position, it sends whatever value was last received there (even if it's not currently being received) - while changing the position on the Router only &quot;opens that pathway&quot; to allow something new to pass though (nothing is sent until new values arrive at that input).
* Selector module can be used to scale values from 0..1 range to any other range, defined by two input values, e.g. -10..40. [http://www.nativeinstruments.de/forum_us/showthread.php?t=25977 See thread on User Forum]</text>

This is a must! I worked on something very similar on my own, but abandoned the work after incidentally finding this.
Thanks a lot, guys.

==Needs moving==
The test has been rescaled, and the old level 4 (that this page name references) has become level N5.  The new name should be something like &quot;JLPT Guide/JLPT N5 Vocabulary&quot;.  Anyone opposed?  --[[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 06:56, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

== Restoring contributer signature ==

Do we acutally need the signature of everyone who has contributed to a page? I'd rather see a move toward editing the pages to make them more cohesive, like a book or article, rather than a chat session. For example, if we could convince people to create wiki accounts and add themselves to the &quot;Contributers&quot; page so you can easily look up their contributions.
[[User:Canscorch|Canscorch]] 00:13, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Apparent Vandalism: changing signatures ==

Have you noticed someone changing the signatures on many AA pages? At first I thought it was just that you had changed usernames, since it was only yours that I noticed being changed at first. I see now that many others are being modified.</text>

{{Book Search}}

== About This Book ==
''Blender 3D: Noob to Pro'' is a product of shared effort by numerous [[/Team|team members]] and anonymous editors. Its purpose is to teach people how to create three-dimensional computer graphics using [http://www.blender.org Blender], a [[w:free software|free software]] application.

This book is intended to be used in conjunction with other on-line resources that complement it:
*[[Subject:Blender 3D|other blender-related Wikibooks]] on topics such as scripting and creating games;
*the [http://wiki.blender.org/ Blender Wiki] for technical documentation;
*user forums, such as the [http://blenderartists.org/forum/ Blender Artists Forum].

While you can learn simply by reading the book, you'll get more out of the tutorials if you follow along. In order to do this, you'll need access to a computer with Blender installed. You can [http://www.blender.org/download download Blender] from the [http://www.blender.org/ Blender Foundation]'s website; more detailed instructions are in the [[/Unit 1: Knowing Before Making|first module]].

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Version compatibility:''' Blender is under continual development, and some of the following tutorials were written for older versions and have not (yet) been updated to the current version. In particular, major changes in the user interface and scripting API took place beginning with the 2.5''x'' series. If you find outdated content, feel free to edit as required to bring it up to date.}}

Version-specific content should be tagged with a [[Template:B3D:N2P/ForVersion|note]] that looks like this: {{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.75}}

== Overview ==
{{collection}}
The core of this book is a series of tutorials that increase in complexity, with later tutorials building on the preceding ones.  While experienced users can skip ahead, ''beginners are urged to proceed through the tutorials in sequence.''

The tutorials in the core series are grouped into four '''units''':
# [[#Unit 1: Background|''Background'']] — a basic orientation regarding:
#* computer graphics
#* the Blender user interface (UI)
# [[#Unit 2: Basic Modeling and Shading|''Basic Modeling and Shading'']] — basic techniques for building and rendering 3D models
# [[#Unit 3: Broadening Horizons|''Broadening Horizons'']]
#* alternative modeling and rendering techniques
#* introductions to lighting, animation, and game creation
# [[#Unit 4: Taking Off with Advanced Tutorials|''Taking Off'']]
#* scripting
#* advanced techniques for modeling, animation and game creation

Each unit is subdivided into '''sections''', which are made up of '''modules'''.

Three appendices are also provided:
* ''Reference Material'' — including:
** [[/FAQ|Frequently-Asked Questions]]
** [[/Glossary|Glossary]]
* ''General Advice'' — tips to help you get the most out of Blender
* ''Miscellaneous Tutorials'' — tutorials that aren't part of the core series

You are strongly encouraged (read as ''begged'') to contribute to this book!  There are many things you can do to help:
*edit existing modules (to correct errors, improve the writing, or make additions)
*add new modules (tutorials or reference material)
*upload new images (screen shots or sample renders)
*join the team responsible for this WikiBook 

=== How to Edit a Module ===
To edit any wiki page (including this one):
# Click on the '''Edit''' tab at the top of the page.
# Make your change in the large text box.
# Type an explanation of your change in the '''Edit summary''' text box below.
# Click on the '''Show preview''' button below the edit summary to preview your change.
# If you're satisfied with the result, click on the '''Save page''' button.

Your contribution will be [[Help:Revision_review|reviewed]] before it is officially published. 

Things you shouldn't add to modules:
* external links that are not directly related to the module
* comments or questions regarding the text

To ask questions and make comments about any module:
#Click on the '''Discussion''' tab at the top of the page.  This will take you to the corresponding talk page.  Note that the talk page name begins with the &quot;Talk:&quot; prefix.
#If the topic of your question or comment is under discussion, edit the relevant section.
#If it's a new topic, click on the '''Add topic''' tab at the top of the talk page to start a new discussion.
#Sign your message by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end.  (This will expand to your username and the date.)
#Remember to save your edit when you're done!
#To return to the WikiBook, click on the '''Book''' tab at the top of the talk page.

=== How to Add a Module ===
To add a module (such as a tutorial or reference page) to this book:
#Edit the [[#Table of Contents|Table of Contents]] section (below) and add a list item with a descriptive wikilink.  (If you're creating a tutorial and are unsure where it belongs, put it in the [[#Miscellaneous Tutorials|Miscellaneous Tutorials section]].)
#After saving your edit, follow the redlink to create the module and begin adding content to it.
#To make it easy to read the book in sequence, each module should have '''navigation links''' to the previous module and the next module.  Provide these links by transcluding the [[Template:B3D:N2P/NAV|NAV template]] at the top and bottom of the page, as shown on the [[/Nav Demo Page 2|demo page]].  (If you expect the your module to be moved elsewhere in the sequence, you can skip this step.)
#Preview your work. When you're satisfied with it, use the '''Save page''' button to add your new module to the wiki.
#If you provided navigation links, update the NAV templates on the previous and next modules, if they exist.
#If you didn't provide navigation links, please ask someone to insert your new module in an appropriate place.  One way to do this would be to create a talk page for your new module and type your request there.

=== Images ===
Images are a vital part of Blender tutorials. They clarify instructions, provide a point of reference, and improve the teaching process.  However, '''if the image's copyright is not attributed correctly, we must remove it.''' This can make a once-great tutorial useless.  Even if you believe you know what copyright to use, please check the '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using proper copyright RE:Blender|proper Blender images copyright]]''' page to see how and where you should add copyright information. Please make sure every image you use is not copyrighted or that you have permission to use it.

Before uploading an image:
* Search [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]] or look in [[:Commons:Category:Blender 3D screenshots|the appropriate Commons category]] to see if the image you want to use already exists. (Uploading duplicate images is wasteful.)
* Before uploading a general image (such as an icon or button) or if you want an image to use as an example, look in our [[/Image Portfolio|image portfolio]]. Remember to attribute the work of others.

If you use a Commons image in this WikiBook, please use one of the categories shown in the templates on '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using proper copyright RE:Blender|proper Blender images copyright]]''' to make it visible from the category links in the [[/Image Portfolio|image portfolio]].

&quot;Songwriters and poets suffer from the same affliction . . . they both believe they have something to say.&quot;

Do any of the following statements describe you?
*&quot;I spend a large portion of every day thinking about writing songs.&quot;
*&quot;I read scripture and think . . . surely these are the lyrics to a song.&quot;
*&quot;I write down interesting remarks I overhear.&quot;
*&quot;I put a lot of energy into writing songs, and trying to write songs.&quot;
*&quot;I see all the bits and pieces of songs I have lying around and it drives me crazy.&quot;
*&quot;I go to songwriting workshops given by people who make their living writing songs.&quot;
*&quot;I spend time with other songwriters.&quot;
*&quot;I read books on songwriting.&quot;
*&quot;I think I am a songwriter.&quot;
*&quot;I am obsessed with songs.&quot;
*&quot;I sometimes feel angry with lyrics and just go with the flow.&quot;
*&quot;I feel an overwhelming sense of satisfaction when I finish writing a song. Writing is difficult, but I am always challenged to do my best. Sometimes I feel like songwriting should be called song rewriting, because I spend a lot of time rewriting until the song is right.&quot;
If these statements generally describe you, then read on, as we discuss &quot;Writing Effective Songs&quot;.



Music and lyrics, comes from the heart. It's not something you can just do easily. Lyrics are created from events that have happened in your life, A.K.A. an ex lover, the present, dreams, or everyday life. All the different experiences you have had in your life can be written down as songs if you think hard enough.

==The Mechanical Elements of a Song==
For the beginning songwriter, it may be helpful to know something about the various elements of a song.  Following are some definitions:
*'''Measure (Bar):'''  a segment of time defined as a given number of beats of a given duration. The word &quot;measure&quot; is heard more frequently in the U.S., while bar is used in other English-speaking countries.
*'''Melody:'''  the part of a song that can be sung alone so that the song is recognizable; the &quot;lead&quot;.  Elements of the melody include:
**Motif: a short group of notes
**Phrase: Two motifs combined
**Sentence or period: Two phrases combined
**Paragraph: A group of sentences
**Sequence: a melodic phrase that is repeated but is transposed
*'''Harmony''': the notes that compliment or support the melody line. These may be sung or played. In music theory, they are described as the vertical structure. If using a chord progression format, should base the harmony of the song upon the progression and only vary a bit.
*'''Rhythm''': the pattern of beats to which the words are sung. There are two versions: The traditional, where every note is played as shown, and the &quot;swing&quot;, used in Blues and Jazz, where, for example, two half-beats go &quot;bomp-bomb&quot; (kind of like heartbeat
*'''Tempo''': the speed of the song.
*'''Time Signature''': 3/4, 4/4, 6/8, etc. the top number relates to amount of beats in a measure/bar and the bottom number relates to the value of the notes in the bar. i.e  4/4 = four Quarter/crochet notes in a bar. 6/8 = six eighth/quaver notes in a bar.

Usually, each song consists of the following:
*'''Intro''': the short instrumental section at the beginning of the song.
*'''Verse''': a section of the song having its own melody, usually following the introduction and occurring again after the chorus. Most songs have two or three verses, repeating the same melody with different words. Verses usually have about eight measures, but traditional twelve bar blues may use twelve measures.
*'''Pre-Chorus''' (a.k.a. Channel): a short section that builds beyond the verse and usually leads to the Chorus.
*'''Chorus''': a different section in the song with a different melody, usually following the verses and the bridge. The chorus may be very repetitive.
*'''Bridge, or Middle 8''': a section of the song that is different from the verses and chorus. The bridge usually occurs during a transition between verse and chorus or between two choruses in separate keys; hence, it is sometimes called the &quot;bridge.&quot;  Because it is frequently 8 bars long, it also known as the &quot;Middle 8,&quot; particularly in Britain and Europe.  However it is conceived, its primary function is to provide the ear with a kind of &quot;relief&quot; from the repetitiveness of the Verse and Chorus, to provide a fresh perspective within the context of the overall structure.
*'''Hook''': an important phrase in the song, the memorable theme. The hook is usually repeated at various times during the song.  Also referred to as the motif.
*'''Coda''': the ending section of the song; usually repeats the hook or an important portion of the song. Maybe integrated into the chorus.

Often, it is worth the effort to first invent a melody from a chord (or string for guitar) sequence around which your song will be focused. Song writing for the popular vote requires a 'hook' as it is known. The hook may be simply a melodic structure, but is perhaps preferably a mix of the melody coupled with a clever line of words.

For instance, in the well known 'Danny Boy' or 'Derry Air' as it is sometimes called, the 'hook' is found where the melody appears to try to surge forward into the chorus and the words &quot;But come ye back&quot; accompany that surge in chord progression.

The reverse process, putting music to words, is a lot more difficult and is also less successful in most formats.

But there are certain cases where putting music to words is a better option... for instance, a rhyming poem or free verse with a regular meter can easily be made a song. Basic chords lend themselves well, the I - IV - V progression and iv - IV - V - I chords work.

===Popular Song forms===
Popular music has several forms that are commonly used.  These usually consist of four 8-bar phrases, making up the typical 32 bar form. Typically, this entire 32-bar is a chorus.
*'''A-A1-B-A (ternary)''' is the most famous. The hook is typically in A, which allows it to be repeated, setting the hook in the listener's mind. The hook is a memorable, catchy part of the song, and may consist of one or more of the following: the title, a musical phrase, a riff, or a production effect. {{{needs explanation of A1 section}}} The B section, often referred to as the bridge, is a musical (and usually lyrical) contrast.
:Example: Over the rainbow, Yesterday, Just the Way You Are, What'll I Do, Ain't Misbehavin', As Time Goes By.
*'''A-B-A-B (binary verse/chorus)''' consist of eight-bar of A as verse, followed by eight bar of B as chorus. The 2nd half, acting as repetition , have a slight difference either melodically, harmonically, or both.
:Example: Material girl, &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot;
*'''A-A-B-B (binary)''': One A phrases for 8 bars, followed by its repetition, then followed by B phrases for 8 bars and its repetition. Repetition may or may not have variations.
:Example: Bouree in E minor
*'''A-B-A-C''': Provide variation with the B phrase and repetition of A phrase with new concluding material in C phrase.
*'''A-B-C-D''': Each phrase provides a variation with new melodic material. This is rarer since it requires more attention from the listener and fewer opportunities to bring home the hook through its repetition.

the other popular form, the 12-Bar Blues, is also common. See [[Music Theory/Blues]] for numerous type of 12-bar blues form.

==Tools for Your Songwriting “Toolbox”==
Some things that will help, but are not required:
*'''The gift of songwriting'''.  Obviously, if you are gifted in this way, you’ll be way ahead of the game.  Some people are born skilled writers.  It comes to them like breathing.  Others want to write so bad it's killing them, but they can't come up with anything that moves people.  Most of us are somewhere in between . . . pretty good writers who could benefit from studying the craft of songwriting.
*'''Absolute Pitch'''.  Of course it is a helpful tool but is not necessary.
*'''Some creative bent'''.  &quot;Most people see the sun go down.  I see the mountain rise up.&quot;
*A good understanding of poetry writing.
*Ability to sing or play an instrument.
*Collaboration with other writers.
*Multi-track Recorder (cassette 4-track, computer program, smartphone app, etc.)
*'''A voice recorder''', to record how it sounds.
*'''Music Theory'''.  While some of the greatest songs being sung around the world today were birthed in the hearts of people who knew nothing about music, if one wants to play in a certain style, they should also follow the style. One should not deviate too much from the 12-Bar Blues, for example, if they are to make a song in the style of Blues, regardless of the song's content.

Things that are not required, PERIOD
*Virtuoso ability on an instrument.
*A great singing voice.

Some things that ARE required:
*An intimate and vital relationship with your topic.
*A sensitive spirit relative to your intended audience.
*Patience.  (Sometimes you block or hit snags.  Work through them.)
*A paying job, or normal education. (Don't expect to hit a record contract so soon, pal)

==Becoming an Effective Songwriter==
You need to know your subject matter, this is IMPERATIVE. After all, it is difficult at best to discuss subjects that you’re not knowledgeable of—and research, know about the subject matter as much as possible

Write about what you know.  If your songs are not meaningful to you, they probably won't be meaningful to other people, and the lack of knowledge on your subject and your lack of enthusiasm for it will show through.

Write primarily as an expression of your own feelings, and who knows better about what you're feeling than you?

Strive to expand your vocabulary. While some phrases may be very meaningful, there are probably words that fit the image you are trying to create more appropriately. Also, if possible, try to live &quot;in&quot; the subject matter.

You need to be vulnerable; to be a good writer, you must remain vulnerable in your writing.  If you hide, then the song hides.  There is no safe haven for songwriters.	If you choose to play it safe and not lay it on the line, your songs will be cliché-ridden, shallow and boring.

You need to practice and you need to be persistent; Yes, sometimes, the words and melody simply flow.  But most of the time songwriting is hard work. Songwriting requires work, practice, mentors, study, diligence, and commitment. We should give ourselves to the development of our writing	skills. 

Practice, sing and write constantly. Write something every day, even if you come up with something that might initially sound trite.  You can revise it and make it something good later.  Whatever musical impulse lies within will come out.

==Important Elements of a Song==
The most important aspect of a song is &quot;'''sing-ability'''&quot;
*Do the stressed syllables of the lyrics match the stressed beats of the music?
*Are the words you want emphasized sung with longer notes?
*Does it have a smooth melody?
*Are the intervals easy to sing?  (Usually 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, 5ths and octaves are easiest.)
*Is the melody supported by the chord progression?
*Does the melody fall within the sing-able range of the	majority?  (Usually, not much lower than an A; not much higher than a D.)
*Is it too wordy?  Too many words make it difficult to focus on the subject matter.
*'''One Theme''': stay focused on the &quot;seed thought&quot;.
*'''Repetition''': This makes the song easier for the congregation to retain and memorize.&lt;br&gt;
*'''Imagery''': Does it capture an image? Does it paint a picture of how you feel about a given situation at a given moment in time?
*'''Consistent within itself''': Is the melody &quot;saying&quot; the same thing as the lyrics?  Try to avoid putting happy sounding lyrics with a haunting melody. Of course, this can be done: for example, songs by Asaki are a good example (they have haunting songs, but celebratory)
*'''Is it “catchy”?''': Is there a creative chord progression? Is there an interesting rhyming scheme? Is there a creative melody? Is there alliteration?

===Making the Connection===
*The lyric is arguably the most important part of a song.  Be clear.  It is primary and fundamental that the audience understands what you are saying.  If not . . . it might as well have been an instrumental.
*Does it use the language of the assembly? If aimed at Youth, does it &quot;groove&quot;? If aimed at Kids, is it happy?
*Is it simple &quot;ABC-rock,&quot; or is it 70's &quot;Art-Rock&quot;?
*Is it intended for small group or a large crowd? Can it be sung by your choice of line up?
*Are there long pauses that could be filled with a lead instrument?
*Could there be more pauses to let your rhythm take a &quot;rest&quot;?

===Simplicity===
Simple images cut deep like a sharp knife. One of the most common mistakes made by beginning songwriters is trying to say too much.  The simplest songs are usually the most powerful.

Complex writing in &quot;code&quot; that sounds like some other good song somewhere doesn't cut it.  Many writers play it safe behind vague or complex lyrics.

If you try to say in three minutes or less how you feel about everything in your life, you will lose people. It is more powerful to show how you feel about ONE thing, right now.

Once you've gained considerable experience in writing songs, you may decide to add some elements of symbolism, metaphor, or irony into your work. A song with several layers grows progressively interesting; if there is more to the song than first meets the ear, it will stay fresh.

==Sparking the Creative Flow==
*'''Quiet time''': The key to expressive songs and lyrics is personal quiet times. 
Meditation is a very effective way to do this. 
There is no more creative expressiveness than your inner voice.
Inner voice can both flow and be shaped: you can let ideas come to you and you can alter them. 
It usually comes when you quiet your mind. 
As you open to your inner voice, 
it becomes easier to hear, grasp and shape ideas.
*'''Difficulties and Devastation''' Speaking from life-changing personal experience. 
This is important in folk-style songs, such as Blues and Country Music.
Negative stories with a positive resolution can be very inspirational.
Angry lyrics can be the release a listener is looking for.
*'''Brainstorming''' If you are a musician, sit at your instrument and just play. 
If you are a lyricist, write or sing whatever comes to mind.
Even seemingly boring or strange lyrics must be written down,
to open your mind to the more interesting and familiar lyrics.
It is important to at least consider everything that comes to mind.
You can rewrite and reshape the lyrics later, 
as it becomes more and more clear, 
what you were trying to say or realized you could say instead.

*'''Was it just a feeling?''' Then follow your feeling—do not look for anything else.
Put those feelings into words and music.
Either you must look for situations to match the feeling or feelings to match the words,
Be emotionally well-rounded: write songs of varying feelings, but realize what emotions won't fit,
Don't write funny if you consider your genre very serious.
*'''Do you just have a melody?''' Sing something, anything, to it.
Flip the notes around: try the second note as a fifth then as a fourth and third.
See what works.
Remember that the more familiar always sounds better,
so you have to try any new melody you wrote several times before throwing it out.
*'''Is it just a thought?'''
Single thoughts are a powerful way to write.
The feeling is often already implied.
An interesting story, onatomatopiea, or extended reasoning or metaphor,
could easily be written around a simple thought with enough hours spent.
Every little thought counts,
that you have about every phrase, word, and sound.
Don't be afraid to try anything that comes to mind.
Use the satisfaction from improving your thoughts to continue to improve your thoughts.

**Brainstorm - write down every corresponding thought that comes to mind, 
and don’t ever throw anything away.
Bob Dylan is quoted in his famous deal with a higher power interview,
as saying that he would move onto other songs if a new song wasn't happening.
In another interview about Dylan's song Tangled Up In Blue,
he said he spent years on the song graphting various women into one character,
so sometimes move on, but keep every idea for some use somewhere.

**Write down your ideas and lyrics, and always record a rough draft of your songs.
Listen to the recording.
Does it have a linear thread through the whole song?
Or is it like this wiki: a patchwork of many seperate ideas under one umbrella?
Are there any phrases that don't quite make sense?
Is there another phrase you could replace it with?
Is there anything you cring at? 
Do you talk about your muffin in a song about poker? 
**Read your lyrics out loud.
Is there a clunky bunch of words?
Is there anything that means something very powerful,
but doesn't sound that way outloud?
What is that powerful meaning and can you just write that instead?
**Is the theme universal, or is it so personal that it could only mean something to you?
Remember theme is the universal meaning behind the details like love, bravery, good, evil, etc.
There is always a theme, you just have to make it consistent.
*'''Do you have a great chord progression?''' If you have access to a piano, voice the chords with left hand and just improvise a melody with the right.
There are actually a limited number of simple good progressions,
and they've all been written already,
which explains why you wrote that really cool song, 
and then realized you took it from so and so,
They &quot;took&quot; it too, because we ran out of &quot;new&quot; simple chord pregressions centuries ago,
and the more complex ones are really combinations of simple ones.

*'''Or . . . do you just want to get rich?'''
We don't waste your time in music,
there are a lot of other professions that immediately pay a lot more than 99.99% of musicians ever make.
Even many supposedly rich musicians never made a dime, 
because of too much money spent on production, touring, and distribution.
If you want to get rich, then check out any profession with a lot of demand.
Yes you can become a millionaire from music,
but count the number of hit songs and then think of the total number of songs written ever,
and then think of the number of hit songs that were profitable.
Also, consider that even if you wrote a hit level song,
how do you get the national audience needed to become a millionare?
Record labels don't even listen to submissions anymore.
You have to tour relentlessly after you spent years begging friends, 
to come to shows amd not even listen your perfectly written songs.
And then consider that everyone has an ego,
and that your song is not as good as it at first seems.
Actually success depends on you opening your ego, 
unless you just happen to part of a social movement,
and then nobody is really listening anyway.
One exercise in ego would be to take the first two lines of your favorite song and break it down,
then break down the language and poetry of your best song.
And even opening up to better writing still doesn't guarantee success,
There are countless songwriters that pop up years after there death as being great writing,
but yet unacknowledged in their lifetime.
**It's not completely impossible. Just close to impossible. 
If you make songs just to get rich, there’s a strong chance you’re going to be terribly frustrated. 
We have little control over how others receive what we create. 
And if you try to change to fit what you think they want, you will never be happy with it, 
and they will never be happy with you.
But at the same time, if you are unwillingly to change your lyrics to make more sense,
because of some intangible lofty feeling,
then you might be fooling yourself,
and your success depends on deaf ears.

==A Word Concerning Originality...==
As songwriters, we don't have to re-invent the wheel; we just need to spin it our own way. A composer fails to be original when he or she does not listen to his or her own musical voice. Composers frequently re-create melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic tapestries that lie deep in their sub-conscious.  Initially this is not a problem, since all music must take off from somewhere.  We must be able to take it to a NEW place . . . one that it is original to our &quot;take&quot; on the style. Sometimes a composer is successful with a song only to find it has already been written.

Alternatively, it is common for a songwriter to use the same (or similar) well known melody. for example, Gekkoka (Moonlight Flower) and Tsubasa (wings) are both based on a classical piano piece, Midori no haze. However, with variations on melody (one is more melodramatic, while Tsubasa is more upbeat), and different lyrics, they become two distinct songs. Still, one should be very careful about using another person's melody, especially in countries in the developed world, which usually have the toughest copyright laws.

==Conclusion==
*Once you have a song that you think is ready for the group, run it past a few objective and mature friends for an honest critique.  Don't be afraid to refine it, taking into consideration their input.
*Focus on the process, not the outcome.  It's good to have a goal.  It's more important to spend your days doing what pleases you.  Years of deprivation and sacrifice to reach a “place” most times equal years of deprivation and sacrifice.  The “place” is never enough compensation.  Just ask anyone who is in the “place” you want to be.
*If you are really strong, you can find your identity in the songs you write, just like any poem.
Meter is something not always fully understood, by learning writers, briefly meter in songs is the measurement of each note,  Study the best writers and see where they  relieve any chance of metric boredom , by inserting contrasting sections in each stanza.

The most fundamental step in the 3D development process is modeling, which entails creating 3D models of objects. 

Blender supports many modeling techniques.  &quot;Mesh modeling&quot; is the most basic and common modeling technique.

In this module, you'll learn the parts of a mesh, and you'll construct 2D meshes on paper and using Blender.  You'll also learn how to create, select, and grab vertices in Vertex select mode.

=== Definitions ===

A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|mesh}} is a collection of vertices, edges, and faces that describe the shape of a 3D object:
* A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|vertex}} is a single point.  (The plural of vertex is &quot;vertices&quot;)
* An {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|edge}} is a straight line segment connecting two vertices.
* A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|face}} is a flat surface enclosed by edges.  (Some other applications call these &quot;polygons&quot;)

=== An Exercise ===

To give you a feel for how the components of a mesh fit together, you'll now draw a 2D mesh on paper.

[[Image:MeshModeling.svg|thumb|Your sketch might look like this.]]
# Get a piece of paper and a pen or pencil.
# Draw three dots that are a couple centimeters (about an inch) apart from each other.
#* Each dot represents a vertex in the mesh.
# Connect two of the dots with a line segment.
#* The line segment represents an edge in the mesh.
# Draw two more edges so that all three vertices are connected.
# You've drawn a triangle; fill it in.
#* The area you filled in is a face.
# Now draw a fourth vertex (dot) on the paper.
# Connect the new vertex to two of the vertices you've drawn previously.
# You now have another triangle; fill it in to create the second face.

Could you imagine creating a mesh of faces in 3D space?  That's what mesh modeling boils down to.

You can keep filling up the paper with more vertices, edges, and faces if you want.  You may want to try and create something interesting (like a letter of the alphabet) with your triangles.

=== More about Meshes ===

[[File:Frankie mesh in Blender.png|thumb|300px|A character from the &quot;Yo Frankie!&quot; 3D video game in Edit Mode, showing edges and faces.&lt;br&gt;The model is &quot;(c) copyright Blender Foundation: apricot.blender.org&quot;.]]

Early versions of Blender supported faces only with three edges (triangles) or four edges (called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|quads}}).  However, faces with five or more edges (so-called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|N-gons}}) are supported in Blender starting from version 2.63. Before Blender 2.63, for creating a new face you'd had to select 3 or 4 verts in order and then create the face, repeating the process for every new polygon needed. Version 2.63 and following versions with {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|BMesh}}, you can create N-gons, regardless the number of verts.&lt;ref&gt;Create faces with N-gons http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/Release_Notes/2.63/BMesh&lt;/ref&gt;

Examine a 3D video game or CGI character for a while. Believe it or not, it is made up of little faces joined together.  With modern technology, of course, there can be a ''lot'' of faces, so they may be tiny and hard-to-see. Surfaces that appear curved are composed of very many individual flat faces.

When you edit objects in Blender, you'll see every vertex and edge.  However, vertices and edges are never rendered; only faces are rendered.  The purpose of vertices is to provide 3D control points for faces.
{{Clear}}

=== Another Exercise ===

While it's possible to construct 3D meshes vertex-by-vertex, this is rarely done.  However, doing it once the hard way will help you appreciate the powerful modeling tools built in by Blender.  Along the way, you'll learn about Edit Mode and the grab tool, both of which you'll need in the next module.

First, summon the default cube:
# Launch Blender.
# If the NumLock indicator on your keyboard is unlit, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NumLock}} so that numpad hotkeys will work properly.
# Load the factory settings using ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings''.

(If you're unsure what {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} means, please review {{B3D:N2P/Module|Keystroke, Button, and Menu Notation}}.)

Because you loaded the factory defaults, the 3D manipulator will be enabled.  For mesh editing, it helps to turn the manipulator off:
# Make sure the 3D View window is active.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Space}} to toggle the manipulator on or off. You also could turn it on/off with the manipulator button on the 3D View header.

[[File:Blender-2.5_cube_object_mode.PNG|thumb|200px|In Object Mode, the cube will look like this.]]
Because you just loaded the factory defaults, Blender should be in Object Mode with the default cube selected.
{{Clear}}

In order to modify the cube's mesh, you must put Blender into {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Edit Mode}}.  (Edit Mode is a special mode for making changes to a single object.)

# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} once to go into Edit Mode on the cube.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|{{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} puts Blender into Edit Mode only if it's in a different mode to start with.  If it's already ''in'' Edit Mode, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} returns it to whatever mode it was in previously.  So pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} a second time would put Blender back into Object Mode.}}

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender-edit-select-modes.png|thumb|Select mode buttons in a 3D View header, showing Vertex select mode active.]]
Edit Mode has three (sub-)modes for selecting vertices, edges, and faces.  Because you just loaded the factory defaults, you should be in Vertex select mode.  In Vertex select mode, vertices show up as yellow, black, or white dots when they're selected and as pink dots when they're not.   Because you just loaded the factory defaults, all eight vertices of the cube should be selected. 

In Blender 2.59/2.60 the vertex(ices) that are either unselected/selected are the following colors: Unselected will be black; Currently selected will be white; Already selected (other than the current selection) will be orange. Also note that these colors correspond to edge selections as well. 

To clear the boards for your first model, delete all of the cube's vertices:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Xkey}}
# A &quot;Delete&quot; menu will pop up.  Choose ''Vertices''.

Now you can repeat the previous exercise using mouse and monitor instead of pen and paper.

[[File:Blender 2.59 hardway 1.png|thumb|After step 3]]
# Create a vertex by clicking with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}}.
# Create another vertex.  Blender will automatically join the two vertices with an edge.
# Create additional vertices (and edges) by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}}, but don't attempt to close a loop yet.
{{Clear}}

To create a face:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} to deselect all vertices.
# Move the mouse to one of the vertices you want in the face.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} (or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Cmd|LMB}}) to select the vertex.
# Move the mouse to another vertex you want in the face.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}} (or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Cmd|LMB}}) to add it to the selection.
# Continue adding vertices until you have three or four selected.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Fkey}} to create the face.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} performs a “deselect all” operation ''only'' if something is selected.  If ''nothing'' is selected, it performs a “select all” operation.}}
{{B3D:N2P/Note|Pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}} does a &quot;select&quot; ''only'' if the vertex isn't already selected.  If it is, it ''de''selects the vertex.}}
{{B3D:N2P/Note|If you make a mistake, you can undo your work step-by-step by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Z}}.}}

[[File:Blender 2.59 hardway 2.png|thumb|A completed 3D mesh]]
Create additional faces until all vertices belong to at least one face.  Congratulations!  You've just created your first 2D mesh in Blender.
{{Clear}}

You can reshape your mesh by moving vertices with the &quot;grab tool&quot;.

To move one or more vertices:
# Select the vertices using {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}}.
# Drag in the viewport with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} (or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Gkey}}) to activate the grab tool.

The 3D View header will be replaced by numbers: &quot;Dx: 0.0000 Dy: 0.0000 Dz: 0.0000 (0.0000)&quot;.  You're now using the &quot;grab tool&quot; and can drag the vertex around using the mouse.

The grab tool disables most of the normal hotkeys, so it's important to know how to get out.  You can exit the tool at any time using:
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}} to confirm the changes
or
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} to cancel the changes.

If you're up for a challenge, try making your mesh 3D:
# Change the viewpoint, perhaps to one of the perfect views.
# Add vertices and/or move the existing ones around in the new view plane.
# When you're done, rotate to a new viewpoint to examine your work.

Now that you know how to create and grab vertices, you're ready for a quick lesson in extrusion and merging.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

[[File:Blender-2.5_quickie_model_stage6.png|thumb|Your goal.]]
In this module, you'll learn how to extrude and merge vertices of a mesh and how to save a model.  This module also introduces the File Browser window type.

Your first model will be a house, with four walls and a pyramidal roof.  Simple!  And because you're going to use the default cube as a base, all you actually need to build is the roof!

Editing in Blender generally involves four steps:
# Selecting an object to edit.
# Activating Edit Mode on that object.
# Selecting part(s) of the object to act upon.
# Specifying the action(s) to be performed on those parts.

==Bring up the Default Cube==

[[File:Blender-2.5_cube_object_mode.PNG|thumb|The default cube in Object Mode.]]

# Launch Blender.
# Load the factory settings using ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings''.
This should give you a perspective view of a scene containing three objects:
* a cube,
* a light source,
* a camera.

{{Clear}}

== Setting up the Viewport ==

It will be easier to work on the roof of your house in a perspective side view:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num3}} to switch to a &quot;perfect&quot; right side view.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|{{B3D:N2P/Do|Num5}} puts the viewport into perspective ''only'' if it's not ''already'' in perspective.  Otherwise, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num5}} switches the viewport ''back'' to orthographic view.}}

&quot;Right Persp&quot; will be shown on the top left of the 3D View. The &quot;up&quot; ({{Blue|Z}}) direction in the scene is now &quot;up&quot; on your monitor as well.

It will also help to zoom in a bit:
# Make sure the 3D View window is active (which means your mouse cursor is in it).
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|Scroll}} or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num+}} a few times until the cube is about 1/3 the height of the viewport.

Because you just loaded the factory defaults, the 3D transform manipulator will be enabled.  For mesh editing, it will help to turn the manipulator off:
# Make sure the 3D View window is active.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Space}} to toggle the manipulator on or off.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} once.  This puts you into Edit Mode on the selected object(s)—namely, the cube.  

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If the lamp and/or camera were selected instead of (or in addition to) the cube, you wouldn't be able to enter Edit Mode. (Cameras and lamps are edited in a different fashion.)}}

Here's how the cube should look at this point:

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Cube_persective_mode.PNG
|imageWidth=488px

|type1=text
|bottom1=10%
|width1=40%
|left1=10%
|text1=Examine the 3D View header to verify that Blender is in {{Red|Edit Mode}} and {{Green|Vertex select mode}} with {{Blue|Occlude background geometry &quot;on&quot;}}.

}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The ''Occlude Background Geometry'' button is only visible when Blender is in Edit Mode and the draw type is Solid, Shaded, or Textured.}}

The default cube is constructed as a mesh.  Now that you're in Edit Mode, you can access the individual vertices, edges, and faces that make up the mesh.  The default cube consists of eight vertices, twelve edges, and six faces.

== Adjusting the Height ==

Right now, all eight vertices are selected, so any vertex edits you make will affect them all.  For instance, if you were to move a vertex, the other seven vertices would follow.  In order to build a roof peak for the house, you need to alter just the four top vertices of the cube.  To do that, you must change the selection so that only ''those'' vertices are selected.

# Turn 'Occlude Background Geometry' off, so you can see all vertices. Note, in newer versions, this button is called &quot;Limit Selection to Visible.&quot; It is one of the buttons to the right of transform orientation which is to the right of the mode select which should be currently set to &quot;edit mode&quot;.  
# Deselect the bottom four vertices, one by one, using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}}.

[[File:Blender-2.5_quickie_model_stage2.png|right|frame]]
The picture on the right shows the cube (in right perspective view and occlude background geometry &quot;off&quot;) with the correct vertices selected.
{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Remember, if you make a mistake, you can undo your work step-by-step by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Z}}.}}

Now you'll adjust the height of your house's ceiling.  Activate the '''grab tool''':
# Make sure Blender is in Edit Mode, with the relevant part(s) of the object selected.
# Make sure the 3D View window is active.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Gkey}}.

The 3D View header will be replaced by numbers: &quot;Dx: 0.0000 Dy: 0.0000 Dz: 0.0000 (0.0000)&quot;. 

You want to lower the ceiling without making the walls crooked.  This is hard to do freehand, but happily the grab tool provides an option for doing just that.

With the grab tool activated:
#Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to limit movement to the global Z-axis.

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.5_quickie_model_stage3.png
|imageWidth=488px

|type1=text
|bottom1=10%
|width1=40%
|left1=3%
|text1=Now when you move the mouse pointer around, Blender will adjust the height of your ceiling without making the walls crooked.  (You can also limit grabs to the X and Y axes and in many other ways besides.)

}}

When your ceiling is the height you want, confirm the grab with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} (or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}).

== Extruding ==

[[File:Blender-2.5_quickie_model_stage4.png|thumb|450px|Step 7: the extruded attic, ready to confirm]]

Now you're going to &quot;add on&quot; to your house by '''extruding'''.  Extrusion begins by duplicating selected parts of an object.  Then the new parts are pulled away from the old ones, with new faces and edges created as necessary.

To add an attic to your house:

#Make sure Blender is in Edit Mode, with the top four vertices selected.
#Make sure the 3D View window is active.
#Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} to activate the '''extrude tool'''.
#Restrict movement to the Z axis and move the mouse pointer upward.
#When the attic is the height you want, confirm the extrude with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}.

{{Clear}}
{{B3D:N2P/Note|At the end of this process only the four new vertices (the upper corners of the attic) will be selected.  The others (including the four that were originally selected) will not be selected.}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If you cancel an extrude operation without confirming it, duplicate vertices and edges have already been created.  If this isn't what you wanted, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Z}} to undo the duplication. }}

== Merging ==

[[File:Blender-2.5_quickie_model_stage5.png|thumb|350px|The Specials menu]]

You can change the roof from a flat one to a pyramidal one by merging the vertices of the roof:

# Make sure Blender is in Edit Mode, with the four top-most vertices selected.
# Make sure the 3D View window is active.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} to bring up the ''Specials'' menu.
# Select ''Merge''. (You can also access this by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|M}}.)
# The ''Merge'' menu should pop up, select ''At center''.

A message should appear on the Info header saying that 3 vertices have been deleted, this is because in order to merge four vertices into one, three vertices must be deleted.

[[File:Blender-2.5_quickie_model_stage6.png|thumb|left|Your house now has a pyramidal roof!]]
{{Clear}}

== Saving your Work ==

[[File:Blender-2.5_saving_quickie_model.png|thumb|550px|Saving the .blend]]

To save the current scene in a &lt;code&gt;.blend&lt;/code&gt; file:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F2}} (or select ''File &amp;rarr; Save As'').  This temporarily changes the active window into a File Browser window.
# Navigate to the directory (folder) where you want to write the file by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on directory names in the File Browser window.  (Clicking on &quot;..&quot; will take you up one level.)
# If you wish to name the file something other than &quot;untitled.blend&quot;, type a filename in the text box to the left of the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.  (The .blend suffix will be added automatically.)
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the &quot;Save File&quot; button.  As soon as the save operation is complete, the window will automatically revert back to its former type.

=== Saving Further Changes ===
Once you have saved your work to a file for the first time, you can save subsequent changes to the same file name by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|SKEY}} and confirming you want to overwrite the existing file.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.63}}

[[File:Blender-2.5_quickie_model_render.png|thumb|350px]]

If you haven't completed {{B3D:N2P/Module|Quickie Model}}, do so now.  You will need the resulting model for this module.

Now that you've created your first model, you'll probably want to try rendering it.  Your first render, with a single light source and only nine faces, should finish quickly.  However, as your 3D scenes become more complex, you'll find that rendering can take a long time.

In this module, you'll render your quickie model and save the result in various file formats.  You'll also learn how to aim cameras and create lamps.

== Rendering the Quickie Model ==
# Launch Blender and load factory settings.
# To load the house model from the previous module:
## Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F1}} or select ''File &amp;rarr; Open''.  This temporarily changes the active window into a File Browser window.
## Navigate to the directory (folder) where you wrote the file, by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on directory names in the File window.  (Clicking on &quot;..&quot; will take you up one level.)
## Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the name of the file you wrote.
## Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the &quot;Open File&quot; button.  As soon as the operation is complete, the window will revert back to its former type.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} or select ''Render &amp;rarr; Render Image''.  This opens the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Image Editor}} so you can watch the render progress.

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If F12 is in use by the window manager...}}
* With the new Apple keyboard, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Fn|F12}} to avoid the Mac Dashboard.
* With Macintosh OS X 10.5, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt|Fn|F12}}.
* With Gnome, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt|F12}} to avoid the Gnome Search Dialog.
{{Hidden end}}


{{B3D:N2P/Note|You can stop a render in progress by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} any time when the render window has the focus. Bear in mind that this will stop the rendering of the current frame and abandon any partial results; pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} will start rendering the image from the beginning again.}}

== Seeing Your Render ==
By default, pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} will switch to the UV/Image Editor window, and show you your render there. You can switch back to the 3D view with {{B3D:N2P/Do|F11}}. Pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|F11}} in the 3D view will switch you to the UV/Image Editor window without redoing the render—you will simply see the same image as last time.

== Aiming the Camera ==
If you don't get a picture of the house, or if the picture is not framed well, try moving or re-aiming the camera:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} to get back to Edit Mode, if needed.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num0}} to take the camera's viewpoint.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|F}} to put the 3D View window into {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|camera fly mode}}.

In camera fly mode, you can:
* {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Pan}} and {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|tilt}} by moving the mouse pointer up, down, left, or right.
* Accelerate by {{B3D:N2P/Do|Scroll}} forwards.
* Decelerate by {{B3D:N2P/Do|Scroll}} backwards.
* Press any key or button to exit fly mode.

(It works differently in version 2.70 and later, more like a FPS game with possibility to slide and so on, buttons are regular FPS controls)

When you're done positioning the camera, try rendering again.

== Lighting ==
If your cube is completely black, you may not have a lamp in the scene.  Either the default lamp got deleted, or you're using a version of Blender that doesn't provide a default lamp.

To add a lamp:
# Make sure Blender is in Object Mode.
# Place the 3D cursor where you want the lamp to go; or add the lamp then immediately grab it, and move it somewhere else.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Akey}}.
# In the popup menu, select ''Lamp &amp;rarr; Point''.

== Saving the Render ==
Saving the scene (with {{B3D:N2P/Do|F2}}, for instance) does not save any renders.  Saving renders is a separate step.

To save your current render:
# Make sure you are in the Image Editor. If not press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F3}}.  This temporarily changes the active window into a File Browser window.
# Navigate to the directory (folder) where you want to write the file.
# Type a filename in the text box (to the left of the &quot;Cancel&quot; button).
# To the left of the window, choose your preferred file type.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the &quot;Save as Image&quot; button.  As soon as the save operation is complete, the window will revert back to its former type.

== Renderer Selection ==
[[File:Blender263RendererSelectionMenu.png|right]]
Blender offers a choice of different rendering engines for producing images. The menu for selecting from these appears in the Info window (the thin one that contains the menu bar at the top of the default layout). In most of these tutorials, you will leave this choice set at Blender Render. But it is worth knowing what other choices are available:
* Blender Render—the oldest renderer, commonly known as the Blender Internal renderer. Built into Blender right from its early days. Can still produce good results with the right tricks, but considered by the Blender developers to be antiquated and not worthy of continuing development.
* Blender Game—this is the renderer used by the Blender Game Engine. Designed to be fast enough for interactive use in a game, which means there are limitations in the quality of renders it produces. You also use this renderer to create rigid-body physics simulations.
* Cycles Render—for this and other choices, see [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Rendering|Advanced Rendering]].
 
{{Clear}}

== Render Control ==
[[File:Blender263RenderRender.png|right]]
The top panel under the Render tab [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] in the Properties window shows 3 buttons and a menu. The first button renders a single frame, equivalent to {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}}. The other two buttons are more relevant to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Animation/Rendering|animations]].
{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender263RenderDisplayMenu.png|right]]
The “Display:” menu controls what happens when you press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}}: the default “Image Editor” causes the 3D view to be switched to the UV/Image Editor showing the rendered image. “Full Screen” causes the UV/Image Editor display to take over the entire screen, while “New Window” makes it appear in a separate OS/GUI window (similar to how older versions of Blender used to work). Finally, “Keep UI” causes no changes to your window layout at all; you have to explicitly bring up the Image Editor with {{B3D:N2P/Do|F11}} to see the rendered image.

== Render Image Dimensions ==
[[File:Blender263RenderDimensions.png|right]]
You can control the size of the image that Blender creates when rendering. This is specified in the “Dimensions” panel under Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] properties. Apart from the menu at the top, the settings in this panel are grouped into two columns:
* The column on the left controls settings for a single image.
* The column on the right specifies additional settings for rendering a whole sequence of images as part of an [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Animation|animation]]. These settings will be discussed [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Animation/Rendering|later]].

At the upper left, under “Resolution:”, we have the dimensions in pixels of the image (the default settings are 1920×1080 as shown in the screenshot), plus an additional scale factor slider below (showing 50% by default). With these settings, the image will actually be rendered at (1920×50%)×(1080×50%) = 960×540. Having the scale factor is a convenience; rendering smaller, lower-quality images is faster, which speeds things up when you are initially working on your model, but of course you want full quality for the final result. Instead of mentally having to work out numbers for initial- versus final-quality renders, you can simply set the resolution to the full final quality, and use the scale factor to reduce this to, say, 50% or 25% for interim work, and then set it to 100% for the final output.

{{clear}}

== Image File Formats ==
[[File:Blender263RenderFormats.png|right]]

You set the format and location for saving rendered images in the “Output” panel under the Render [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]] properties.

In current versions of Blender, the default format for saving rendered images is [[w:Portable_Network_Graphics|PNG]]. This is a ''lossless'' format which has the option for ''alpha transparency'' (which means the sky background is replaced by transparent pixels—enabled by clicking the “RGBA” button). This is a good format if you intend to do further work with the image (e.g. in an image editor like Gimp or Photoshop), but the files can be large.

[[w:JPEG|JPEG]] is a [[w:lossy compression|lossy]] image format, which means it throws away information that the human eye doesn’t see. This produces much smaller files than PNG, and is adequate if you just want to upload the render directly for use in a Web page or other such document, but is not the best choice if you intend to do further processing of the image. It also doesn’t support alpha transparency.

To change the render file format:
# Switch to the Render tab in the Properties window.
# Look for the “Output” panel.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the popout menu with the current file format.
# Select your preferred format.

Certain window managers also use the following hotkeys.
So '''ALT+CTRL''' can be substituted for '''CTRL''' to perform the
functions described below if a conflict arises.
: '''CTRL+LEFTARROW'''. Go to the previous Screen.

== Universal HotKeys ==

The following HotKeys work uniformly in all Blender Windows, if the Context allows:
: '''CTRL+LMB'''. Lasso select: drag the mouse to form a freehand selection area.
** '''ESC.'''
** This key always cancels Blender functions without changes.
** ''or'': FileWindow, DataView and ImageSelect: back to the previous window type.
**  ''or'': the RenderWindow is pushed to the background (or closed, that depends on the operating system).
: '''SPACE.''' Open the Toolbox.
: '''TAB.''' Start or quit EditMode.
: '''F1.''' Loads a Blender file. Changes the window to a FileWindow.
: '''SHIFT+F1.''' Appends parts from other files, or loads as Library-data. Changes the window to a FileWindow, making Blender files accessible as a directory.

== Object Mode HotKeys ==

These hotkeys are mainly bound to the 3D Viewport Window, but many work on Objects in most other windows, like IPOs and so on, hence they are summarized here.

[[Image:BlenderHotkeysObjectMode.png|800px|Graphical HotKey Representation]]

: '''HOME'''. All Objects in the visible layer are displayed completely, centered in the window.
: '''PAGEUP'''. Select the next Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT+PAGEUP'''. Adds to selection the next Object Key.
: '''PAGEDOWN.''' Select the previous Object Key. If more than one Object Key is selected, the selection is shifted up cyclically. Only works if the AnimButtons-&gt;DrawKey is ON for the Object.
: '''SHIFT+PAGEDOWN.''' Adds to selection the previous Object Key.
: '''ACCENT.(~)''' (To the left of the '''1KEY''' in US keyboard) Select all layers.
: '''SHIFT+ACCENT.''' Revert to the previous layer setting.
: '''TAB.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''ALT+E.'''
: '''A KEY.''' Selects/deselects all.
: '''CTRL+A.''' Apply size and rotation. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are assigned to the ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.). At first glance, it appears as if nothing has changed, but this can have considerable consequences for animations or texture mapping. This is best illustrated by also having the axis of a Mesh Object be drawn (EditButtons-&gt;Axis). Rotate the Object and activate Apply. The rotation and dimensions of the Object are 'erased'.
: '''SHIFT+CTRL+A.''' If the active Object is automatically duplicated (see AnimButtons-&gt;DupliFrames or AnimButtons- &gt;Dupliverts), a menu asks Make duplis real?. This option actually creates the Objects. If the active Mesh Object is deformed by a Lattice, a menu asks Apply Lattice deform?. Now the deformation of the Lattice is assigned to the vertices of the Mesh.
: '''SHIFT+A.''' This is the AddMenu. In fact, it is the ToolBox that starts with the `ADD' option. When Objects are added, Blender starts EditMode immediately if possible.
: '''B KEY.''' Border Select. Draw a rectangle with the LeftMouse; all Objects within this area are selected, but not made active. Draw a rectangle with the RightMouse to deselect Objects. In orthonormal ViewMode, the dimensions of the rectangle are displayed, expressed as global coordinates, as an extra feature in the lower left corner. In Camera ViewMode, the dimensions that are to be rendered according to the DisplayButtons are displayed in pixel units.
: '''SHIFT+B.''' Render Border. This only works in Camera ViewMode. Draw a rectangle to render a smaller cut-out of the standard window frame. If the option DisplayButtons-&gt;Border is ON, a box is drawn with red and black lines.
: '''C KEY'''. Center View. The position of the 3DCursor becomes the new center of the 3DWindow.
** '''ALT+C.''' Convert Menu. Depending on the active Object, a PopupMenu is displayed. This enables you to convert certain types of ObData. It only converts in one direction, everything ultimately degrades to a Mesh! The options are:
*** Font -&gt; Curve
*** MetaBall -&gt; Mesh The original MetaBall remains unchanged.
*** Curve -&gt; Mesh
*** Surface -&gt; Mesh

**'''CTRL+C.''' Copy Menu. This menu copies information from the active Object to (other) selected Objects.
*** ''Fixed components are:''
**** Copy Loc: the X,Y,Z location of the Object. If a Child is involved, this location is the relative position in relation to the Parent.
**** Copy Rot: the X,Y,Z rotation of the Object.
**** Copy Size: the X,Y,Z dimension of the Object.
**** DrawType: copies Object Drawtype.
**** TimeOffs: copies Object time offset.
**** Dupli: all Duplicator data (Dupliframes, Dupliverts and so on)
**** Mass: Real time stuff.
**** Damping: Real time stuff.
**** Properties: Real time stuff.
**** Logic Bricks: Real time stuff.
**** Constraints: copies Object constraints.
*** ''If applicable:''
**** Copy TexSpace: The texture space.
**** Copy Particle Settings: the complete particle system from the AnimButtons.
*** ''For Curve Objects:''
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all beveling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Font Objects:''
**** Copy Font Settings: font type, dimensions, spacing.
**** Copy Bevel Settings: all beveling data from the EditButtons.
*** ''Camera Objects:''
**** Copy Lens: the lens value.
: '''SHIFT+C.''' CenterZero View. The 3DCursor is set to zero (0,0,0) and the view is changed so that all Objects, including the 3Dcursor, can be displayed. This is an alternative for '''HOME.'''
: '''D KEY.''' Draw mode menu. Allows to select draw modes exactly as the corresponding menu in the 3D viewport header does.
: '''SHIFT+D.''' Add Duplicate. The selected Objects are duplicated. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''ALT+D.''' Add Linked Duplicate. Of the selected Objects linked duplicates are created. Grab mode starts immediately thereafter.
: '''CTRL+D.''' Draw the (texture) Image as wire. This option has a limited function. It can only be used for 2D compositing.
: '''ALT+E.''' Start/stop EditMode. Alternative hotkey: '''TAB.'''
: '''F KEY.''' If selected Object is a mesh Toggles Face selectMode on and off.
: '''CTRL+F.''' Sort Faces. The faces of the active Mesh Object are sorted, based on the current view in the 3DWindow. The leftmost face first, the rightmost last. The sequence of faces is important for the Build Effect (AnimButtons).
** '''G KEY'''. Grab Mode. Or: the translation mode. This works on selected Objects and vertices. Blender calculates the quantity and direction of the translation, so that they correspond exactly with the mouse movements, regardless of the ViewMode or view direction of the 3DWindow. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a straight line.
** The following options are available in translation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL:''' in increments of 1 grid unit.
**** '''SHIFT:''' fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT+CTRL:''' in increments of 0.1 grid unit.
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current translation to the X,Y or Z axis. Blender calculates which axis to use, depending on the already initiated mouse movement. Click MiddleMouse again to return to unlimited translation.
*** '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' constrains movement to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''N KEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''TAB''' will switch between values, '''ENTER '''finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS:''' These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Grabber can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER:''' move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC:''' everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''G KEY:''' starts Grab mode again.
**** '''S KEY:''' switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''R KEY:''' switches to Rotate mode.
: '''ALT+G.''' Clears translations, given in Grab mode. The X,Y,Z locations of selected Objects are set to zero.
** '''SHIFT+G.''' Group Selection
*** ''Children:'' Selects all selected Object's Children.
*** ''Immediate Children:'' Selects all selected Object's first level Children.
*** ''Parent:'' Selects selected Object's Parent.
*** ''Shared Layers:'' Selects all Object on the same Layer of active Object

** '''IKEY.''' Insert Object Key. A keyposition is inserted in the current frame of all selected Objects. A PopupMenu asks what key position(s) must be added to the IpoCurves.
*** ''Loc:'' The XYZ location of the Object.
*** ''Rot:'' The XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''Size:'' The XYZ dimensions of the Object
*** ''LocRot:'' The XYZ location and XYZ rotation of the Object.
*** ''LocRotSize:'' The XYZ location, XYZ rotation and XYZ dimensions of the Object.
*** ''Layer:'' The layer of the Object.
*** ''Avail:'' A position is only added to all the current IpoCurves, that is curves which already exists.
*** Mesh, Lattice, Curve or Surface: depending on the type of Object, a VertexKey can be added
: '''CTRL+J.''' Join Objects. All selected Objects of the same type are added to the active Object. What actually happens here is that the ObData blocks are combined and all the selected Objects (except for the active one) are deleted. This is a rather complex operation, which can lead to confusing results, particularly when working with a lot of linked data, animation curves and hierarchies.
: '''K KEY.''' Show Keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects. If all of them were already ON, they are all turned OFF.
: '''SHIFT+K.''' A PopupMenu asks: OK? Show and select all keys. The DrawKey option is turned ON for all selected Objects, and all Object-keys are selected. This function is used to enable transformation of the entire animation system.
: '''L KEY.''' Makes selected Object local. Makes library linked objects local for the current scene.
** '''CTRL+L.''' Link selected. Links some of the Active Object data to all selected Objects, the following menu entry appears only if applicable.
*** ''To Scene:'' Creates a link of the Object to a scene.
*** ''Object IPOs:'' Links Active Object IPOs to selected ones.
*** ''Mesh data:'' Links Active Object Mesh data selected ones.
*** ''Lamp Data:'' Links Active Object Lamp data to selected ones.
*** ''Surf Data:'' Links Active Object Surf data selected ones.
*** ''Material:'' Links Active Object Material to selected ones.

** '''SHIFT+L.''' Select Linked. Selects all Objects somehow linked to active Object.
*** ''Object IPO:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's IPOs.
*** ''Object Data:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active  Object's ObData.
*** ''Current Material:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing active Object's current Material.
*** ''Current Texture:'' Selects all Object(s) sharing  active Object's current Texture.
: '''M KEY.''' Moves selected Object(s) to another layer, a pop-up appears. Use '''LMB''' to move, use '''SHIFT+LMB''' to make the object belong to multiple layers. If the selected Objects have different layers, this is ORed in the menu display. Use ESC to exit the menu. Press the &quot;OK&quot; button or '''ENTER''' to change the layer setting. The hotkeys ('''ALT'''-)('''1KEY, 2KEY''', ... - '''0KEY''') work here as well (see 3DHeader).
: '''CTRL+M.''' Mirror Menu. It is possible to mirror an Object along the X, Y or Z axis.
: '''N KEY.''' Number Panel. The location, rotation and scaling of the active Object are displayed and can be modified.
: '''ALT+O.''' Clear Origin. The `Origin' is erased for all Child Objects, which causes the Child Objects to move to the exact location of the Parent Objects.
: '''SHIFT+O.''' If the selected Object is a Mesh toggles SubSurf onn/ off. '''CTRL+1''' to '''CTRL+4''' switches to the relative SubSurf level for display purpouses. Rendering SUbSurf level has no HotKey.
** '''CTRL+P.''' Make selected Object(s) the child(ren) of the active Object. If the Parent is a Curve then a popup offers two choices:
*** ''Normal Parent:'' Make a normal parent, the curve can be made a path later on.
*** ''Follow Path:'' Automatically creates a Follow Path constraint with the curve as target. If the Parent is an Armature, a popup offers three options:
**** ''Use Bone:'' One of the Bones becomes the parent. The Object will not be deformed. A popup permits to select the bone. This is the option if you are modelling a robot or machinery
**** ''Use Armature:'' The whole armature is used as parent for deformations. This is the choice for organic beings.
**** ''Use Object:'' Standard parenting. In the second case further options asks if Vertex groups
should not be created, should be created empty or created and populated.
** '''ALT+P.''' Clears Parent relation, user is asked if he wishes to keep or clear parent-induced transforms.
*** ''Clear Parent:'' the selected Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent. since the transformation of the Parent disappears, this can appear as if the former Children themselves are transformed.
*** ''... and keep transform:'' the Child Objects are unlinked from the Parent, and an attempt is made to assign the current transformation, which was determined in part by the Parent, to the (former Child) Objects.
*** ''Clear Parent inverse:'' The inverse matrix of the Parent of the selected Objects is erased. The Child Objects remain linked to the Objects. This gives the user complete control over the hierarchy.

** '''R KEY.''' Rotate mode. Works on selected Object(s). In Blender, a rotation is by default a rotation perpendicular to the screen, regardless of the view direction or ViewMode. The degree of
rotation is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try moving around the rotation midpoint with the mouse. The rotation pivot point is determined by the state of the 3DWiewport Header
buttons. Alternatives for starting this mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a C-shaped curve.
** The following options are available in rotation mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 5 degrees.
**** '''SHIFT''': fine movements.
**** '''SHIFT+CTRL''': in increments of 1 degree.
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the current rotation to the horizontal or vertical view axis.
*** '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the global reference.
*** a second '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' constrains rotation to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a third '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''N KEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. 
*** '''ENTER''' finalizes.
*** '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''': These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** ''Rotation can be terminated with:''
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old position.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''G KEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''S KEY''': switches to Size (Scale) mode.
**** '''R KEY''': starts Rotate mode again.
: '''ALT+R.''' Clears Rotation. The X,Y,Z rotations of selected Objects are set to zero.
** '''S KEY.''' Size mode or scaling mode. Works on selected Object(s). The degree of scaling is exactly linked to the mouse movement. Try to move from the (rotation) midpoint with the mouse. The pivot point is determined by the settings of the 3D Viewport header pivot Menu. Alternatives for starting scaling mode:
*** '''LMB''' to draw a V-shaped line.
** The following options are available in scaling mode:
*** ''Limiters:''
**** '''CTRL''': in increments of 0.1.
**** '''SHIFT+CTRL''': in increments of 0.01.
*** '''MMB''' toggles: A short click restricts the scaling to X, Y or Z axis. Blender calculates the appropriate axis based on the already initiated mouse movement. Click '''MMB''' again to return to free scaling.
*** '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' constrains scaling to X, Y or Z axis of the local reference.
*** a second '''X KEY, Y KEY, Z KEY''' removes constraints.
*** '''N KEY''' enters numerical input, as well as any numeric key directly. '''ENTER''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** '''ARROWS''':These keys can be used to move the mouse cursor exactly 1 pixel.
*** Scaling can be terminated with:
**** '''LMB SPACE''' or '''ENTER''': move to a new position.
**** '''RMB''' or '''ESC''': everything goes back to the old dimension.
*** ''Switching mode:''
**** '''G KEY''': switches to Grab.
**** '''S KEY''': starts Size mode again.
**** '''R KEY''': switches to Rotation.
: '''ALT+S.''' Clears Size. The X,Y,Z dimensions of selected Objects are set to 1.0.
** '''SHIFT+S.''' SnapMenu:
*** Sel-&gt;Grid: Moves Object to nearest grid point.
*** Sel-&gt;Curs: Moves Object to cursor.
*** Curs-&gt;Grid: Moves cursor to nearest grid point.
*** Curs-&gt;Sel: Moves cursor to selected Object(s).
*** Sel-&gt;Center: Moves Objects to their barycentrum.
: '''T KEY.''' Texture space mode. The position and dimensions of the texture space for the selected Objects can be changed in the same manner as described above for Grab and Size mode. To make this visible, the drawingflag EditButtons-&gt;TexSpace is set ON. A PopupMenu asks you to select: &quot;Grabber&quot; or &quot;Size&quot;.
: '''CTRL+T.''' Makes selected Object(s) track the Active Object. Old track method was Blender default tracking before version 2.30. The new method is the Constrain Track, this creates a fully editable constraint on the selected object targeting the active Object.
: '''ALT+T.''' Clears old style Track. Constraint track is removed as all constrains are.
: '''U KEY.''' Makes Object Single User, the inverse operation of Link
** ('''CTRL+L''') a pop-up appears with choices.
*** ''Object:'' if other Scenes also have a link to this Object, the link is deleted and the Object is copied. The Object now only exists in the current Scene. The links from the Object remain unchanged.
*** ''Object &amp; ObData:'' Similar to the previous command, but now the ObData blocks with multiple links are copied as well. All selected Objects are now present in the current Scene only, and each has a unique ObData (Mesh, Curve, etc.).
*** ''Object &amp; ObData &amp; Materials+Tex:'' Similar to the previous command, but now Materials and Textures with multiple links are also copied. All selected Objects are now unique. They have unique ObData and each has a unique Material and Texture block. 
*** ''Materials+Tex:'' Only the Materials and Textures with multiple links are copied.
: '''V KEY.''' Switches in/out of Vertex Paint Mode.
: '''ALT+V.''' Object-Image Aspect. This hotkey sets the X and Y dimensions of the selected Objects in relation to the dimensions of the Image Texture they have. Use this hotkey when making 2D Image compositions and multi-plane designs to quickly place the Objects in the appropriate relationship with one another.
: '''W KEY.''' Opens Object Booleans Menu.
: '''X KEY.''' Erase Selected? Deletes selected objects.
: '''Z KEY.''' Toggles Solid Mode on/off.
: '''SHIFT+Z.''' Toggles Shaded Mode on/off.
: '''ALT+Z.''' Toggles Textured Mode on/off.

== Edit Mode - General==

Again, Most of these hotkeys are useful in the 3D Viewport when in Edit Mode, but many works on other Blender Object, so they are summarized here. Many Object Mode keys works in Edit mode too, but on the selected vertices or control points; among these Grab, Rotate, Scale and so on. These hotkeys are not repeated here.
: '''TAB''' or '''ALT+E.''' This button starts and stops Edit Mode.
: '''CTRL+TAB.''' Switches between Vertex Select, Edge Select, and Face Select modes. Holding SHIFT while clicking on a mode will allow you to combine modes.
: '''A KEY.''' Select/Unselect all.
: '''B KEY+B KEY'''. Circle Select. If you press BKEY a second time after starting Border Select, Circle Select is invoked. It works as described above. Use NUM+ or NUM- or MW to adjust the circle size. Leave Circle Select with '''RMB''' or '''ESC'''.
: '''CTRL+H.''' With vertices selected, this creates a &quot;Hook&quot; object. Once a hook is selected, CTRL+H brings up an options menu for it.
: '''N KEY.''' Number Panel. Simpler than the Object Mode one, in Edit Mode works for Mesh, Curve, Surface: The location of the active vertex is displayed.
: '''O KEY.''' Switch in/out of Proportional Editing.
: '''SHIFT+O.''' Toggles between Smooth and Sharp Proportional Editing.
: '''P KEY.''' SeParate. You can choose to make a new object with all selected vertices, edges, faces and curves or create a new object from each separate group of interconnected vertices from a popup. Note that for curves you cannot separate connected control vertices. This operation is the opposite of Join ('''CTRL+J''').
: '''CTRL+P.''' Make Vertex Parent. If one object (or more than one) is/are selected and the active Object is in Edit Mode with 1 or 3 vertices selected then the Object in Edit Mode becomes the Vertex Parent of the selected Object(s). If only 1 vertex is selected, only the location of this vertex determines the Parent transformation; the rotation and dimensions of the Parent do not play a role here. If three vertices are selected, it is a `normal' Parent relationship in which the 3 vertices determine the rotation and location of the Child together. This method produces interesting effects with Vertex Keys. In EditMode, other Objects can be selected with CTRL+RMB.
: '''CTRL+S.''' Shear. In EditMode this operation enables you to make selected forms `slant'. This always works via the horizontal screen axis.
: '''U KEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and can be returned to via U KEY. Mesh Objects have better Undo, see next section.
: '''W KEY.''' Specials PopupMenu. A number of tools are included in this PopupMenu as an alternative to the Edit Buttons. This makes the buttons accessible as shortcuts, e.g. EditButtons-&gt; Subdivide is also `W KEY, 1 KEY'.
: '''SHIFT+W.''' Warp. Selected vertices can be bent into curves with this option. It can be used to convert a plane into a tube or even a sphere. The center of the circle is the 3DCursor. The mid-line of the circle is determined by the horizontal dimensions of the selected vertices. When you start, everything is already bent 90 degrees. Moving the mouse up or down increases or decreases the extent to which warping is done. By zooming in/out of the 3Dwindow, you can specify the maximum degree of warping. The CTRL limiter increments warping in steps of 5 degrees.

== EditMode - Mesh ==

This section and the following highlight peculiar EditMode Hotkeys.
[[Image:BlenderHotkeysEditMode.png|800px|Graphical Representation of Edit Mode Hotkeys]]
: '''CTRL+NUM+.''' Adds to selection all vertices connected by an edge to an already selected vertex.
: '''CTRL+NUM-.''' Removes from selection all vertices of the outer ring of selected vertices.
: '''ALT+CTRL+RMB.''' Faces loop select.
: '''ALT+RMB.''' Edges loop select.
: '''C KEY.''' If using curve deformations, this toggles the curve Cyclic mode on/off.
: '''E KEY.''' Extrude Selected. &quot;Extrude&quot; in EditMode transforms all the selected edges to faces. If possible, the selected faces are also duplicated. Grab mode is started directly after this command is executed.
: '''SHIFT+E KEY.''' Crease Subsurf edge. With &quot;Draw Creases&quot; enabled, pressing this key will allow you to set the crease weight. Black edges have no weight, edge-select color have full weight.
: '''CTRL+E KEY.''' Mark LSCM Seam. Marks a selected edge as a &quot;seam&quot; for unwrapping using the LSCM mode.
: '''F KEY.''' Make Edge/Face. If 2 vertices are selected, an edge is created. If 3 or 4 vertices are selected, a face is created.
: '''SHIFT+F.''' Fill selected. All selected vertices that are bound by edges and form a closed polygon are filled with triangular faces. Holes are automatically taken into account. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession.
: '''ALT+F.''' Beauty Fill. The edges of all the selected triangular faces are switched in such a way that equally sized faces are formed. This operation is 2D; various layers of polygons must be filled in succession. The Beauty Fill can be performed immediately after a Fill.
: '''CTRL+F.''' Flip faces, selected triangular faces are paired and common edge of each pair swapped.
: '''H KEY.''' Hide Selected. All selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''SHIFT+H.''' Hide Not Selected: All non-selected vertices and faces are temporarily hidden.
: '''ALT+H.''' Reveal. All temporarily hidden vertices and faces are drawn again.
: '''ALT+J.''' Join faces, selected triangular faces are joined in pairs and transformed to quads
** '''K KEY.''' Knife tool Menu.
*** ''Face Loop Select:'' ('''SHIFT+R''') Face loops are highlighted starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Face Loop Cut:'' ('''CTRL+R''') Face loops are cut starting from edge under mouse pointer. '''LMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (exact):'' ('''SHIFT+K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges are cut at intersections with mouse line. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
*** ''Knife (midpoints):'' ('''SHIFT+K''') Mouse starts draw mode. Selected Edges intersecting with mouse line are cut in middle regardless of true intersection point. '''ENTER''' or '''RMB''' finalizes, '''ESC''' exits.
: '''L KEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an unselected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''SHIFT+L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected, together with all vertices that share an edge with it.
: '''CTRL+L.''' Select Linked Selected. Starting with all selected vertices, all vertices connected to them are selected too.
: '''M KEY.''' Mirror. Opens a popup asking for the axis to mirror. 3 possible axis group are available, each of which contains three axes, for a total of nine choices. Axes can be Global (Blender Global Reference); Local (Current Object Local Reference) or View (Current View reference). Remember that mirroring, like scaling, happens with respect to the current pivot point.
: '''ALT+M.''' Merges selected vertices at barycentrum or at cursor depending on selection made on pop-up.
: '''CTRL+N.''' Calculate Normals Outside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `outward'.
: '''SHIFT+CTRL+N.''' Calculate Normals Inside. All normals from selected faces are recalculated and consistently set in the same direction. An attempt is made to direct all normals `inward'.
: '''ALT+S.''' Whereas '''SHIFT+S''' scales in Edit Mode as it does in Object Mode, for Edit Mode a further option exists, '''ALT+S''' moves each vertex in the direction of its local normal, hence effectively shrinking/fattening the mesh.
: '''CTRL+T.''' Make Triangles. All selected faces are converted to triangles.
: '''U KEY.''' Undo. When starting Edit Mode, the original ObData block is saved and all subsequent changes are saved on a stack. This option enables you to restore the previous situation, one after the other.
: '''SHIFT+U.''' Redo. This let you re-apply any undone changes up to the moment in which Edit Mode was entered
: '''ALT+U.''' Undo Menu. This let you choose the exact point to which you want to undo changes.
** '''W KEY.''' Special Menu. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Subdivide:'' all selected edges are split in two.
*** ''Subdivide Fractal:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced randomly.
*** ''Subdivide Smooth:'' all selected edges are split in two and middle vertex displaced along the normal.
*** ''Merge:'' as '''ALT+M.'''
*** ''Remove Doubles:'' All selected vertices closer to each other than a given threshold (See EditMode Button Window) are merged '''ALT+M.'''
*** ''Hide:'' as '''H KEY.'''
*** ''Reveal:'' as '''ALT+H.'''
*** ''Select Swap:'' Selected vertices become unselected and vice versa.
*** ''Flip Normals:'' Normals of selected faces are flipped.
*** ''Smooth:'' Vertices are moved closer one to each other, getting a smoother object.
*** ''Bevel:'' Faces are reduced in size and the space between edges is filled with a smoothly curving bevel of the desired order.

** '''X KEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Vertices:'' all vertices are deleted. This includes the edges and faces they form.
*** ''Edges:'' all edges with both vertices selected are deleted. If this `releases' certain vertices, they are deleted as well. Faces that can no longer exist as a result of this action are also deleted.
*** ''Faces:'' all faces with all their vertices selected are deleted. If any vertices are `released' as a result of this action, they are deleted.
*** ''All:'' everything is deleted.
*** ''Edges and Faces:'' all selected edges and faces are deleted, but the vertices remain.
*** ''Only Faces:'' all selected faces are deleted, but the edges and vertices remain.
: '''Y KEY.''' Split. This command splits the selected part of a Mesh without deleting faces. The split parts are no longer bound by edges. Use this command to control smoothing. Since the split parts have vertices at the same position, selection with '''L KEY''' is recommended.

== EditMode - Curve ==

: '''C KEY.''' Set the selected curves to cyclic or turn cyclic off. An individual curve is selected if at least one of the vertices is selected.
: '''E KEY.''' Extrude Curve. A vertex is added to the selected end of the curves. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is executed.
: '''F KEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the end of two curves. These two curves are combined into one curve.
: '''H KEY.''' Toggle Handle align/free. Toggles the selected Bezier handles between free or aligned.
: '''SHIFT+H.''' Set Handle auto. The selected Bezier handles are converted to auto type.
: '''CTRL+H.''' Calculate Handles. The selected Bezier curves are calculated and all handles are assigned a type.
: '''L KEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve.
: '''SHIFT+L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, it is deselected together with all the vertices of the same curve.
: '''M KEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.
: '''T KEY.''' Tilt mode. Specify an extra axis rotation, i.e. the tilt, for each vertex in a 3D curve.
: '''ALT+T.''' Clear Tilt. Set all axis rotations of the selected vertices to zero.
: '''V KEY.''' Vector Handle. The selected Bezier handles are converted to vector type.
** '''W KEY.''' The special menu for curves appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices.
*** Switch direction. The direction of the selected curves is reversed. This is mainly for Curves that are used as paths!

** '''X KEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following options:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''Segment:'' a curve segment is deleted. This only works for single segments. Curves can be split in two using this option. Or use this option to specify the cyclic position within a cyclic curve.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== EditMode - Metaball ==

: '''M KEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.

== EditMode - Surface ==

: '''C KEY.''' Toggle Cyclic menu. A PopupMenu asks if selected surfaces in the `U' or the `V' direction must be cyclic. If they were already cyclic, this mode is turned off.
: '''E KEY.''' Extrude Selected. This makes surfaces of all the selected curves, if possible. Only the edges of surfaces or loose curves are candidates for this operation. Grab mode is started immediately after this command is completed.
: '''F KEY.''' Add segment. A segment is added between two selected vertices at the ends of two curves. These two curves are combined into 1 curve.
: '''L KEY.''' Select Linked. If you start with an non-selected vertex near the mouse cursor, this vertex is selected together with all the vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''SHIFT+L.''' Deselect Linked. If you start with a selected vertex, this vertex is deselected together with all vertices of the same curve or surface.
: '''M KEY.''' Mirror. Mirror selected control points exactly as for vertices in a Mesh.
: '''SHIFT+R.''' Select Row. Starting with the last selected vertex, a complete row of vertices is selected in the `U' or `V' direction. Selecting ''Select Row'' a second time with the same vertex switches the `U' or `V' selection.
** '''W KEY.''' The special menu for surfaces appears:
*** Subdivide. Subdivide the selected vertices
*** Switch direction. This will switch the normals of the selected parts.
*** Mirror. Mirrors the selected vertices

** '''X KEY.''' Erase Selected. A PopupMenu offers the following choices:
*** ''Selected:'' all selected vertices are deleted.
*** ''All:'' delete everything.

== VertexPaint Hotkeys ==

: '''SHIFT+K.''' All vertex colours are erased; they are changed to the current drawing colour.
: '''U KEY.''' Undo. This undo is `real'. Pressing Undo twice redoes the undone.
: '''W KEY.''' Shared Vertexcol: The colours of all faces that share vertices are blended.

== EditMode - Font ==

In Text Edit Mode most hotkeys are disabled, to allow text entering.

: '''RIGHTARROW.''' Move text cursor 1 position forward

: '''ALT+V.''' Paste text. The text file /tmp/.cutbuffer is inserted at the cursor location.

== UV Editor Hotkeys ==

: '''E KEY.''' LSCM Unwrapping. Launches LSCM unwrapping on the faces visible in the UV editor.
: '''P KEY.''' Pin selected vertices. Pinned vertices will stay in place on the UV editor when executing an LSCM unwrap.
: '''ALT+PKEY.''' Un-Pin selected vertices. Pinned vertices will stay in place on the UV editor when executing an LSCM unwrap.

== EdgeSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT+CLICK.''' Selects an Edge Loop.

== FaceSelect Hotkeys ==

: '''ALT+CLICK.''' Selects a Face Loop.
: '''TAB.''' Switches to EditMode, selections made here will show up when switching back to FaceSelectMode with TAB.
: '''F KEY.''' With multiple, co-planar faces selected, this key will merge them into one &quot;FGon&quot; so long as they remain co-planar (flat to each other).
: '''L KEY.''' Select Linked UVs. To ease selection of face groups, Select Linked in UV Face Select Mode will now select all linked faces, if no seam divides them.
: '''R KEY.''' Calls a menu allowing to rotate the UV coordinates or the VertexCol.
** '''U KEY.''' Calls the UV Calculation menu. The following modes can the applied to the selected faces:
*** ''Cube:'' Cubical mapping, a number button asks for the cubemap size
*** ''Cylinder:'' Cylindrical mapping, calculated from the center of the selected faces
*** ''Sphere:'' Spherical mapping, calculated from the center of the selected faces
*** ''Bounds to x:'' UV coordinates are calculated from the actual view, then scaled to a boundbox of 64 or 128 pixels in square
*** ''Standard x:'' Each face gets default square UV coordinates
*** ''From Window:'' The UV coordinates are calculated using the projection as displayed in the 3DWindow


== Render Window Hotkeys (to be written) ==
To be written (if someone could it would be very useful! : there's no place about it on the internet (or I didn't search enough) )
: '''J KEY.''' Changes the image output. You have two slots in which to render. Very useful when you want to see what a specific change did to the image.
: '''A KEY.''' Toggles display of alpha channel. The alpha channel of a picture determines it's transparency: Black areas are fully transparent, white areas are fully opaque and grey means semi-transparent. This can be useful when rendered images are arranged in layers, or used in applications which support alpha channels in images. To save images with alpha channel, make sure that the RGBA button in the render panel (F10) is enabled. Also, not all image formats support alpha channels, i.e. TGA and PNG do, but JPG does not. Note: Any background texturing which is done via the world panel (F8) will have an alpha value of 0, meaning it will be transparent. However, the world background will still be rendered correctly on (opaque) surfaces as reflections (i.e. mirrors) - this must be taken into account when later composing rendered images with a different background.
: '''Z KEY.''' Toggle Zoom (2x). This will zoom the rendered image. The mouse can still be used to scroll around the zoomed image.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Walabio. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Walabio~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

__NOTOC__
'''Nachynka''' in Ukrainian literally means stuffing.  This dish is usually not stuffed inside anything, but served as a side dish.

==Ingredients==
*½ cup (125 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 cup (250 ml) [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]
*3 cups (750 ml) homogenized [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1 tsp (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*½ tsp (7 ml) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tsp (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*butter to grease casserole dish

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
#Melt butter in a pot on medium heat.
#Add cornmeal.  Stir mixture to warm up the cornmeal.
#Add milk.  Stir until mixture has thickened.
#Beat eggs.  Beat in salt, sugar, and baking powder.
#Slowly add some of the thickened cornmeal mixture to the egg mixture while mixing to temper the eggs.
#Stir the egg mixture into the rest of the cornmeal.
#Pour the mixture into a greased casserole dish
#Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30 minutes or until the top has browned

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*While you are thickening the cornmeal mixture, you have enough time to beat the eggs
*Doubling the recipe will yield enough to fill a 2 litre casserole dish

For different flavour variations:
*Mix in a ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon.
*Chop up a small onion and cook till tender in the butter, before adding cornmeal.

==Warnings==
*Do not add the egg mixture to the cornmeal.  Some of the eggs will cook on impact resulting in streaks of cooked eggs and a heavier Nachynka

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{merge from | Cryptography/Hash function}}

A '''digest''', sometimes called a '''hash''', is the result of the application of a [[Cryptography/Hash function|hash function]] (a very specific mathematical function or algorithm) that takes in some arbitrary value and produces a hash value, based on the given input.

Information security often includes situations where a user wants to transform one block of information into another block of information in such a way that the original block can not be recreated. It is also required that every time the input block is processed, it will produce the same output block. This  means that the process is deterministic.

Such processes behave similar to a hash function and so are typically called '''cryptographic hashes'''. These hashes are used in serving authentication and integrity goals of cryptography. A cryptographic hash can be described as &lt;math&gt;f(message) = hash&lt;/math&gt; and has property that the hash function is ''one way''. A given hash value can not feasibly be reversed to get a message that produces that hash value. I.e. There is no useful inverse hash function &lt;math&gt;f'(hash) = message&lt;/math&gt;

This property can be formally expanded to provide the following properties of a secure hash:
* Preimage resistant : Given H it should be hard to find M such that H = hash(M).
* Second preimage resistant: Given an input m1, it should be hard to find another input, m2 (not equal to m1) such that hash(m1) = hash(m2).
* Collision-resistant: it should be hard to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Because of the birthday paradox this means the hash function must have a larger image than is required for preimage-resistance.


A ''hash function'' is the implementation of an algorithm that, given some data as input, will generate a short result called a digest.

For Ex: If our hash function is 'X' and we have 'wiki' as our input... then X('wiki')= a5g78 i.e. some hash value.

Qualities of a  good hash function are

1. Produces a fixed length key for variable input&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;s&gt;
2. Has got infinite key space, implies the next point&lt;br/&gt;
3. No collisions (i.e. no two different pieces of input give the same key value)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/s&gt;

== Applications of hash functions ==

Non-cryptographic hash functions have many applications,&lt;ref&gt;
applications of non-cryptographic hash functions are described in [[Data Structures/Hash Tables]] and [[Algorithm Implementation/Hashing]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
but in this book we focus on applications that require cryptographic hash functions:

A typical use of a cryptographic hash would be as follows: Alice poses to Bob a tough math problem and claims she has solved it. Bob would like to try it himself, but would yet like to be sure that Alice is not bluffing. Therefore, Alice writes down her solution, appends a random nonce, computes its hash and tells Bob the hash value (whilst keeping the solution secret). This way, when Bob comes up with the solution himself a few days later, Alice can verify his solution but still be able to prove that she had the solution earlier.

In actual practice, Alice and Bob will often be computer programs, and the secret would be something less easily spoofed than a claimed puzzle solution. The above application is called a commitment scheme. Another important application of secure hashes is verification of message integrity. Determination of whether or not any changes have been made to a message (or a file), for example, can be accomplished by comparing message digests calculated before, and after, transmission (or any other event) (see Tripwire, a system using this property as a defense against malware and malfeasance). A message digest can also serve as a means of reliably identifying a file.

A related application is password verification. Passwords are usually not stored in cleartext, for obvious reasons, but instead in digest form.
We discuss password handling -- in particular, why hashing the password once is inadequate -- in more detail in a later chapter, [[../Secure Passwords#Password handling|Password handling]].

A hash function is a key part of [[../message authentication/]] (HMAC).

Most distributed version control systems (DVCSs) use cryptographic hashes.&lt;ref&gt;
Eric Sink.
&quot;Version Control by Example&quot;.
Chapter 12:
[http://ericsink.com/vcbe/html/cryptographic_hashes.html &quot;Git: Cryptographic Hashes&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;

For both security and performance reasons, most digital signature algorithms specify that only the digest of the message be &quot;signed&quot;, not the entire message. Hash functions can also be used in the generation of pseudo-random bits.

[[../SHA-1/]], [[../MD5/]], and RIPEMD-160 are among the most commonly-used message digest algorithms as of 2004. In August 2004, researchers found weaknesses in a number of hash functions, including MD5, SHA-0 and RIPEMD. This has called into question the long-term security of later algorithms which are derived from these hash functions. In particular, SHA-1 (a strengthened version of SHA-0), RIPEMD-128 and RIPEMD-160 (strengthened versions of RIPEMD). Neither SHA-0 nor RIPEMD are widely used since they were replaced by their strengthened versions.

Other common cryptographic hashes include [[../SHA-2/]] and [[../Tiger/]].


Later we will discuss the &quot;birthday attack&quot; and other techniques people use for [[../Breaking Hash Algorithms/]].

== Hash speed ==

There are two contradictory requirements for cryptographic hash speed:

* When using hashes for password verification, people prefer hash functions that take a long time to run. If/when a password verification database (the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, the &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; file, etc.) is accidentally leaked, they want to force a brute-force attacker to take a long time to test each guess.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://blog.codinghorror.com/speed-hashing/ &quot;Speed Hashing&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some popular hash functions in this category are
** scrypt
** bcrypt
** PBKDF2

* When using hashes for file verification, people prefer hash functions that run very fast. They want a corrupted file can be detected as soon as possible (and queued for retransmission, quarantined, or etc.).
Some popular hash functions in this category are
** SHA256
** SHA-3

      <text xml:space="preserve">In cryptography, an asymmetric key algorithm uses a pair of different, though related, cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt. The two keys are related mathematically; a message encrypted by the algorithm using one key can be decrypted by the same algorithm using the other. In a sense, one key &quot;locks&quot; a lock (encrypts); but a different key is required to unlock it (decrypt). 

Some, but not all, asymmetric key cyphers have the &quot;public key&quot; property, which means that there is no known effective method of finding the other key in a key pair, given knowledge of one of them. This group of algorithms is very useful, as it entirely evades the key distribution problem inherent in all symmetric key cyphers and some of the asymmetric key cyphers. One may simply publish one key while keeping the other secret. They form the basis of much of modern cryptographic practice.   

== A postal analogy ==

An analogy which can be used to understand the advantages of an asymmetric system is to imagine two people, Alice and Bob, sending a secret message through the public mail. In this example, Alice has the secret message and wants to send it to Bob, after which Bob sends a secret reply.

With a symmetric key system, Alice first puts the secret message in a box, and then locks the box using a padlock to which she has a key. She then sends the box to Bob through regular mail. When Bob receives the box, he uses an identical copy of Alice's key (which he has somehow obtained previously) to open the box, and reads the message. Bob can then use the same padlock to send his secret reply.

In an asymmetric key system, Bob and Alice have separate padlocks. Firstly, Alice asks Bob to send his open padlock to her through regular mail, keeping his key to himself. When Alice receives it she uses it to lock a box containing her message, and sends the locked box to Bob. Bob can then unlock the box with his key and read the message from Alice. To reply, Bob must similarly get Alice's open padlock to lock the box before sending it back to her. The critical advantage in an asymmetric key system is that Bob and Alice never need send a copy of their keys to each other. This substantially reduces the chance that a third party (perhaps, in the example, a corrupt postal worker) will copy a key while it is in transit, allowing said third party to spy on all future messages sent between Alice and Bob. In addition, if Bob were to be careless and allow someone else to copy his key, Alice's messages to Bob will be compromised, but Alice's messages to other people would remain secret, since the other people would be providing different padlocks for Alice to use.

== Actual algorithms - two linked keys ==

Fortunately cryptography is not concerned with actual padlocks, but with encryption algorithms which aren't vulnerable to hacksaws, bolt cutters, or liquid nitrogen attacks.

Not all asymmetric key algorithms operate in precisely this fashion. The most common have the property that Alice and Bob own two keys; neither of which is (so far as is known) deducible from the other. This is known as public-key cryptography, since one key of the pair can be published without affecting message security. In the analogy above, Bob might publish instructions on how to make a lock (&quot;public key&quot;), but the lock is such that it is impossible (so far as is known) to deduce from these instructions how to make a key which will open that lock (&quot;private key&quot;). Those wishing to send messages to Bob use the public key to encrypt the message; Bob uses his private key to decrypt it.


== Weaknesses ==

Of course, there is the possibility that someone could &quot;pick&quot; Bob's or Alice's lock. Unlike the case of the one-time pad or its equivalents, there is no currently known asymmetric key algorithm which has been proven to be secure against a mathematical attack. That is, it is not known to be impossible that some relation between the keys in a key pair, or a weakness in an algorithm's operation, might be found which would allow decryption without either key, or using only the encryption key. The security of asymmetric key algorithms is based on estimates of how difficult the underlying mathematical problem is to solve. Such estimates have changed both with the decreasing cost of computer power, and with new mathematical discoveries.

Weaknesses have been found in promising asymmetric key algorithms in the past. The 'knapsack packing' algorithm was found to be insecure when an unsuspected attack came to light. Recently, some attacks based on careful measurements of the exact amount of time it takes known hardware to encrypt plain text have been used to simplify the search for likely decryption keys. Thus, use of asymmetric key algorithms does not ensure security; it is an area of active research to discover and protect against new and unexpected attacks.

Another potential weakness in the process of using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a 'Man in the Middle' attack, whereby the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party and modified to provide the third party's own public keys instead. The encrypted response also must be intercepted, decrypted and re-encrypted using the correct public key in all instances however to avoid suspicion, making this attack difficult to implement in practice.


== History ==

The first known asymmetric key algorithm was invented by Clifford Cocks of GCHQ in the UK. It was not made public at the time, and was reinvented by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman at MIT in 1976. It is usually referred to as RSA as a result. RSA relies for its security on the difficulty of factoring very large integers. A breakthrough in that field would cause considerable problems for RSA's security. Currently, RSA is vulnerable to an attack by factoring the 'modulus' part of the public key, even when keys are properly chosen, for keys shorter than perhaps 700 bits. Most authorities suggest that 1024 bit keys will be secure for some time, barring a fundamental breakthrough in factoring practice or practical quantum computers, but others favor longer keys.

At least two other asymmetric algorithms were invented after the GCHQ work, but before the RSA publication. These were the Ralph Merkle puzzle cryptographic system and the Diffie-Hellman system. Well after RSA's publication, Taher Elgamal invented the Elgamal discrete log cryptosystem which relies on the difficulty of inverting logs in a finite field. It is used in the SSL, TLS, and DSA protocols.

A relatively new addition to the class of asymmetric key algorithms is elliptic curve cryptography. While it is more complex computationally, many believe it to represent a more difficult mathematical problem than either the factorisation or discrete logarithm problems.


== Practical limitations and hybrid cryptosystems ==

One drawback of asymmetric key algorithms is that they are much slower (factors of 1000+ are typical) than 'comparably' secure symmetric key algorithms. In many quality crypto systems, both algorithm types are used; they are termed 'hybrid systems'. PGP is an early and well-known hybrid system. The receiver's public key encrypts a symmetric algorithm key which is used to encrypt the main message. This combines the virtues of both algorithm types when properly done.

We discuss asymmetric ciphers in much more detail later in the [[../Public Key Overview/]] and following sections of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cryptography relies on puzzles. A puzzle that can not be solved without more information than the cryptanalyst has or can feasibly acquire is an unsolvable puzzle for the attacker. If the puzzle can be understood in a way that circumvents the secret information the cryptanalyst doesn't have then the puzzle is breakable. Obviously cryptography relies on an implicit form of '''security through obscurity''' where there currently exists no likely ways to understand the puzzle that will break it. The increasing complexity and subtlety of the mathematical puzzles used in cryptography creates a situation where neither cryptographers or cryptanalysts can be sure of all facets of the puzzle and security.

Like any puzzle, cryptography algorithms are based on assumptions - if these assumptions are flawed then the underlying puzzle may be flawed.

Secret knowledge assumption - Certain secret knowledge is not available to unauthorised people. Attacks such as packet sniffing, keylogging and meet in the middle attacks try to breach this assumption.

Secret knowledge masks plaintext - The secret knowledge is applied to the plaintext so that the nature of the message is no longer obvious. In general the secret knowledge hides the message in way so that the secret knowledge is required in order rediscover the message. Attacks such as chosen plaintext, brute force and frequency analysis try to breach this assumption

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;The more secret information you know, the more successful the concealment of the plaintext.&quot;

It is important to realize that any crypto system in its design is an exercise in resource allocation and optimization.  

If we were to return to the postal analogy used in the discussion of [[Cryptography/Asymmetric Ciphers|Asymmetric Ciphers]].  Suppose Alice has a secret message to send to Bob in the mail.  Alice could put the message in her lock box and use Bob's padlock to lock it allowing Bob to open it with his key, as describe earlier.  But if it were a really important message or Alice and Bob had a higher expectation of the opponent they wished to thwart (Bob's girlfriend knows where Bob keeps his keys) Alice and Bob might want to resort to a more complicated crypto system.  For example Bob could have multiple keys, one he keeps on his key chain, one he keeps in a rented Post Office box and one that is in a box in a Swiss bank vault.  Bob might welcome this sort of security for really serious messages but for day to day messages between Bob and Alice Bob will no doubt find a daily flight to Switzerland rather expensive inconvenient.  All crypto systems must face a resource trade-off between convenience and security.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;The higher the entropy of a random source, the better the quality of the random data it generates.&quot;

Many cryptographic algorithms call for a random source, either in key-generation, or some other primitive. Implementors must be extremely cautious in selecting that random source, or they will open themselves up to attack. For example, the only formally proven encryption technique, the one time pad, requires a completely random and unbiased key-stream that is at least as long as the message itself, and is never reused. There are many implicit complications presented in this requirement, as the only sources of &quot;true randomness&quot; are in the physical world (silicon decay is an example), and are impossible to implement in software. Thus, it is often only feasible to obtain pseudo-randomness. Pseudo-Random Number Generators, or PRNGs, use multiple sources that are thought to be difficult to predict (mouse movement, least significant digits of the computer clock, network statistics, etc.) in order to generate an entropy pool, which is passed through assorted algorithms which attempt to remove  any biases, and then used as a seed for a pre-determined static set of numbers. Even with all of the sources of entropy, a determined attacker can usually reduce the effective strength of an implementation by cutting out some of the factors -- for instance making educated guesses on the time. PRNGs that are thought to be acceptable for cryptographic purposes are called Cryptographically-Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators, or CSPRNGs. 

==Entropy==
In terms of information theory, entropy is defined as the measure of the amount of information expressed in a string of bits.  For example gender contains 1-bit of entropy as it can be represented using a 1 for males and a 0 for females.  The quality of a random source is determined by just how much entropy it generates, if the entropy is less than the actual number of bits then there is some repetition of information.  The more information that is repeated, or the shorter the period of some PRNG, the lower the entropy and the weaker and more predictable the source of randomness.  Therefore in cryptography one seeks to get as close to perfect randomness as possible with the resources available - where a perfect random number generator creates a sequence of bits which are unpredictable no matter how large a sample of previously generated bits is obtained.

==Main types of adjectives==
There are basically four types of adjectives in Tok Pisin:

'''[[../Class 1 adjectives|Class 1 adjectives]]'''&lt;br&gt;
They have the suffix -pela in attributive position, and also when they follow the copula. &lt;br&gt;Example: 
*'''bikpela''', ''big''. '''Bikpela haus''', ''A big building'', '''Haus i bikpela''', ''The building is big''.  

'''[[../Class 2 adjectives|Class 2 adjectives]]'''&lt;br&gt;
They have the suffix -pela in attributive position, but they usually lose it when they follow the copula.&lt;br&gt;Example: 
*'''kolpela''', ''cold''. '''Kolpela wara''', ''Cold water'' but '''Wara i kol''', ''The water is cold''.  

'''[[../Class 3 adjectives|Class 3 adjectives]]''' &lt;br&gt;
They do not have the suffix -pela. &lt;br&gt;Example: 
*'''liklik''', ''small''. '''Liklik haus''', ''A small building'', '''Haus i liklik''', ''The building is small''. 

'''[[../Class 4 adjectives|Class 4 adjectives]]''' &lt;br&gt;
They do not have the suffix -pela either. Unlike other adjectives, they stand after the noun in attributive position.&lt;br&gt;Example: 
*'''nogut''', ''bad''. '''Tok nogut''', ''bad words, insults''.

==Numerals==
Numerals belong to class 1 (they have -pela in all positions), or to class 3 (they never have -pela, and stand before the noun in attributive position).&lt;br&gt; Examples: 
*'''tripela''', ''three''. '''Tripela man o meri''', ''Three persons''.
*'''tupela ten''' or '''twenti''', ''20''. '''Tupela ten pikinini''' or '''Twenti pikinini''', ''20 children''.
*'''nambatri''', ''third''. '''Bilong nambatri kain''', ''Of the third type''.
[[Tok_Pisin:Numerals|More about numerals]] &lt;br&gt;
==Quantifiers==
Quantifiers also belong to class 1 (they have -pela in all positions), or to class 3 (they never have -pela, and stand before the noun in attributive position). &lt;br&gt;
Examples: 
*'''sampela''', ''some''. '''Sampela buk''', ''Some books''.
*'''planti''', ''many''. '''Planti buk''', ''Many books''.

== A plea not to use small pages that disadvantage most people ==

I know it is generally considered that smaller web pages are somehow &quot;better&quot;, but this seems to be one of those generally accepted beliefs that goes unquestioned, yet is actually wrong. The idea behind Wikibooks is to make books freely available to everybody, but slicing Wikibooks up into tiny pieces severely disadvantages people who do not have fast, cheap, always-on internet. That is, most of the people in the world.

This is spectacularly evident in the case of [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]. This wikibook used to be available as three large pages: &quot;Beginner Tutorials&quot;, &quot;Advanced Tutorials&quot;, and &quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot;. That allowed people to easily download the wikibook for offline use. However, now that the book has been decimated into 254(!) parts it is virtually impossible to use offline.

The Collections service only makes PDF format available for downloading and that seems to be broken. PDF is a terrible format for viewing on computer and is really suitable only for printing on dead trees, which is impossible anyway for those of us who don't have printers -- most of the people in the world. Also, it doesn't display animated GIFs or videos or play sounds (HTML does), and the format is often up to ten times the size of the HTML pages it is created from. Those same people who do have always-on, fast, cheap internet will also have computers with lots of memory, so reading an enormous PDF file will seem to be no problem for them, but for the rest of us (most of the people in the world) PDF is an absolute blight. It can't even be converted back to the original HTML for viewing on screens.

The current version of the book could be easily and naturally divided into 6 big pages:
* Background
* Basic Modeling and Shading
* Broadening Horizons
* Taking Off
* FAQ, Glossary, and advice
* Miscellaneous Tutorials

[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] is a truly amazing piece of work. Please let it be available to those of us who must work mostly offline and without printers -- we comprise most of the world's internet users. Please don't exclude us.

== Todo Page ==

Thought I’d mention the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Todo|Todo]] page, though it’s not quite clear why that exists (and has its own discussion page!) separate from this discussion page, which would seem to be the natural place to discuss things needing doing. It doesn’t seem to have been used in a while, anyway.

== Please Rename This Book! ==
After spending the past two or three weeks going through several of the pages, discussions, tutorials, always with the attitude that even though they were written for an earlier version of Blender, that the interface changed significantly since then, that even though several commands given no longer apply, there could be something gleaned, something of value learned. 

Probably the most lasting thing learned from this experience is that you should not try reading something written 7 or 8 years old appended with (maybe) parenthetical update notes as the frustration from an imposed aging filter does not lend itself for material that's constantly changing and a targeted group of newcomers hoping to learn.

Therefore, it would serve readers new to Blender much service if they were informed straight up that this book is not current by renaming it to: 

'''&lt;u&gt;Blender 3D, v2.4x: Noob to Pro&lt;/u&gt;''' 

along with something like the following:

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Version compatibility:''' Blender is under continual development, and the tutorials contained in '''&lt;u&gt;Blender 3D, v2.4x: Noob to Pro&lt;/u&gt;''' were written for older versions of Blender. Readers however will find that many of the foundation principals have not changed and that in limited cases some of the pages have been updated to a later version through the appreciated contributions of folks just like you. 

Major changes in the user interface and scripting API took place beginning with the 2.5''x'' series. And by the very dynamic nature of Blender's development, it will continue to be ever more robustly developed as we move on from it and into the future. 

Whenever you find outdated content in '''&lt;u&gt;Blender 3D, v2.4x: Noob to Pro&lt;/u&gt;''', feel free to edit it as required to bring it up to date, or much better still, rewrite that page into its own date/ Blender version-stamped specific new page. 

Please, when making your edits, make note of the version-specific content which should be tagged with a [[Template:B3D:N2P/ForVersion|note]] that looks like this: {{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.65a}}


Blender's phenomenal development has succeeded because of the phenomenal programming talent in this community of artists and the ''willingness'' of its members to help. Please, consider joining the team (&lt;- provide hyperlink to point-of-contact) to write the next wiki book on Blender 3D.

I'm going through the tutorials right now, and I'd like to know if this book still need updating. It's been a year now since you wrote this, have things changed since then?.[[Special:Contributions/2A01:E35:8AB6:1930:F454:B7EE:9D:58A9|2A01:E35:8AB6:1930:F454:B7EE:9D:58A9]] ([[User talk:2A01:E35:8AB6:1930:F454:B7EE:9D:58A9|discuss]]) 07:39, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Yes, it still needs updating. The interface has changed significantly (for the better, in my opinion) making some of the tutorial steps unnecessary or able to be achieved in simpler ways. I'm hoping in a month (maybe two) I'll have the time to go through some of the tutorials and add some tips for the new version's interface, which I'm still learning to use properly.
--[[User:Miriam e|Miriam e]] ([[User talk:Miriam e|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Miriam e|contribs]]) 13:02, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Okay, thanks.[[Special:Contributions/2A01:E35:8AB6:1930:D052:451C:4C06:201A|2A01:E35:8AB6:1930:D052:451C:4C06:201A]] ([[User talk:2A01:E35:8AB6:1930:D052:451C:4C06:201A|discuss]]) 15:56, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I should add that I think most, perhaps all, of the tutorials in Noob to Pro still work with the new Blender interface, just that the new interface makes many things easier, while being initially confusing to those used to the old interface (like me :) ).

== Questions about text ==

*Q: how can I download the ENTIRE book in PDF-format?
*A: it can be downloaded [[Wikibooks:PDF_versions|here]], it is split in 3 parts though.

er...  maybe i'm missing the 3D woods for the textured trees, but i don't find the pdf files at the link above.

*Q: On the page linked above, Blender 3d: Noob to Pro is not listed. Is there another place I should look?
*A: There are two other ways.  The first is to create a collection (under Print/Export, to the left) and then download it as a PDF.  The other is to use [[User:Sendoshin/Collections/Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]], a collection I have already created myself.  The latter method is faster; the first method gives you more control over what is and is not included.  - [[User:Sendoshin|Sendoshin]] ([[User talk:Sendoshin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sendoshin|contribs]]) 07:58, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
:* Update: The collection linked above has been accepted as the official version; it is now a redirect to [[Wikibooks:Collections/Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]].  Feel free to use the new location instead. [[User:Sendoshin|Sendoshin]] ([[User talk:Sendoshin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sendoshin|contribs]]) 22:14, 26 February 2011 (UTC)
*Q:Cannot open to PDF. It says &quot;The file you are trying to download does not exist: Maybe it has been deleted and needs to be regenerated. &quot; or opens another page and acts like its going to display but, it displays nothing but a blank page. And this book is not listed on the PDF page on Wikibooks. -TheEnder
A*Okay, well what worked for me is to download the Wikibook as ODT and then convert it to a PDF.
* The Collections system for downloading books seems badly broken at the moment. I spent 4 hours adding all 254 pages to a collection then tried to download it as epub format, but failed with an error message, then tried as ODT and failed with the same error. I noticed broken PDF documents in my /tmp directory. It only sends PDF. [[User:Miriam e|Miriam e]] ([[User talk:Miriam e|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Miriam e|contribs]]) 09:38, 9 December 2013 (UTC)

I updated the PDF Version linked on the main page of this book just now. So you can simply download that and got an up to date copy.--[[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 15:12, 25 May 2015 (UTC)

== Suggestion ==

I'm wondering if we can add a new page that explains in DETAIL, normals, and animation keys,
Bake, etc....  Since frankly, most of the tutorials just let you set the parameters and
don't bother explaining what they do in detail.  It's just a suggestion though..... [[User:492star|492star]] ([[User talk:492star|talk]]) &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment was added 02:14, 25 February 2010.&lt;/small&gt;
: I, too, hate long sequences of steps that don’t shed any light on what effect they’re trying to achieve. Far better to have a short sequence, explain how the result from that falls short of what you’re trying to achieve, then another short sequence to fix part of the problem, and so on. Like I did with my [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Textures|Simple Wood Texture]] example. [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 03:13, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

I'm not sure if we really need the isometric projection page, as I don't see that Blender actually supports it.


I added info about normals to [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Simple_Vehicle:_Body]], as it is required to deal with the results of one of the methods to make the truck bed. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 22:52, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

== Printing? ==

If anyone would take this book to a publisher, and I can order it in Holland I would definitely order a copy.
I really prefer a real book than an e-book.

Mediawiki recently added a feature that lets you order a real book. In the sidebar, click &quot;Create a book&quot; under &quot;Print/export&quot;. [[User:LeftClicker|LeftClicker]] ([[User talk:LeftClicker|talk]]) 18:21, 31 May 2010 (UTC)

:Alternately, you can use the collection I've already created to do the same thing - just choose &quot;Order Printed Book&quot; instead of &quot;Download PDF&quot;.  The link is at the top of this page.  :D  [[User:Sendoshin|Sendoshin]] ([[User talk:Sendoshin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sendoshin|contribs]]) 03:33, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

== Merging Other Material ==

There are two books suggested to be merged into this one, and I think it would be a good choice.

I agree! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 14:11, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

== moving sections around ==
it's silly to show painting in die easy, but show us a finished result in the peguin, I think they should be reversed [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 14:10, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

die easy 2 and die another day need to be reversed in position as die easy 2 is now in sync with the more recient version of blenders [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 14:10, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

==The Vision of the Book==
taken from [[Talk:Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Mountains_Out_Of_Molehills]]

Since you're planning on helping out a bit around here, let me sort of explain what my vision is for the book.

: Beginner Tutorials focus on learning how to use the tools, hotkeys available in the blender.  this is mostly technical documentation 

: Intermediate Tutorials focus on the artistic use of the tools learned in the beginner tutorials.  Some people say that you can't teach somebody to be an artist.  I beg to differ.  The ability to become an artist is in the desire.  Artistic modeling, artistic lighting, artistic scene creation, artistic animation.

: Advanced Tutorials focus on the advanced functions of the Blender, such as python scripting for advanced animation, advanced modeling, etc.

: If you can see my vision here (and if you can agree with it), then you'll see why I want subsurf edges to be in the Beginner Tutorials.  Obviously a lot more tutorials will need to be created in the Beginning Tutorials part to make it comprehensive.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 21:56, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

== Problem downloading PDF linked in additional resources ==

I've tried multiple times to download the PDF copy of Noob to Pro provided under the link in additional resources and each time the download is nearly halfway completed when it suddenly completes and Adobe Reader opens saying that he document is corrupted and is unable to be repaired.  Any ideas on how to overcome this issue would be greatly appreciated.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Nk.warren77|Nk.warren77]] ([[User talk:Nk.warren77|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nk.warren77|contribs]]) 10:51, 23 October 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Possible style change ==

Colleagues:

Thank you all for this book. It is extremely useful in its present form.

I have been working through the book, mostly from front to back, but with some diversions. One thing has struck me as a problem, and I think I can see a path to a solution.

The problem is that it is essential to provide detailed instructions to the Noob, but these detailed instructions become repetitious as the reader gains experience, and in the more advanced and complex examples they can interfere with the flow of the higher-level explanatory text to the extent that a user can lose the thread of the narrative. So when I read a section that says &quot;create a vertex,&quot; I want to know exactly how to do it if I do not know or if I have forgotten, and if I am trying to actually follow along in my Blender window, but I am very distracted and irritated if the method is repeated inline and I already know it, or if I am reading to get an overview.

I think the solution is to create a footnote (like a reference on Wikipedia.) The text will still say &quot;create a vertex&quot;, but the exact keystrokes will be given in the footnote. For more complex operations, the footnote will also give a link to the earlier location in the book where the technique is explained.

I think this solution has several advantages, one important advantage is that it takes advantage of linking while still remaining viable when the book is printed.

Clearly, In an article that is intended to explain the technique, all of the keystrokes should be inline. They should only go into footnotes when the technique has already been explained in an earlier article and is being used as an element of a more complex technique.

Please comment. I will create a &quot;worked example&quot; of the concept for further discussion unless a preliminary discussion here is negative.-[[User:Arch dude|Arch dude]] ([[User talk:Arch dude|talk]]) 17:30, 11 December 2010 (UTC)
:&lt;s&gt;Done. Please contrast the current-style [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Spin a goblet]] with the proposed [[User:Arch dude/Spin a goblet]]. -[[User:Arch dude|Arch dude]] ([[User talk:Arch dude|talk]]) 01:53, 12 December 2010 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt; (See below.)

I see that this book has its template for keystrokes.  I just want to note that (for a help page) I imported [[Template:Key press]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:15, 15 December 2010 (UTC)
:I use the book's keystroke templates in both the &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;proposed&quot; version. They are inline in the standard version, and in the footnotes in the &quot;proposed&quot; version. If anything, these templates are more distracting inline than Blender's standard conventions. However, I think that they are just fine in the footnotes. {{tl|B3D:N2P/Do}} is perhaps preferable to {{tl|Key press}}, because it uses a white background for modifier keys and a grey background for execution keys, but the difference is not really important. -[[User:Arch dude|Arch dude]] ([[User talk:Arch dude|talk]]) 00:27, 16 December 2010 (UTC)

Having received no comments on the proposal, I switched the tutorial to the footnoted version. To see the inline version, go to the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Spin_a_goblet&amp;oldid=1998485 old version]. -[[User:Arch dude|Arch dude]] ([[User talk:Arch dude|talk]]) 16:21, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

== Print version ==

I would agree that this page should no longer be used.  It nearly crashes my browser trying to load it.  The PDFs on demand via the collections can also be printed and I personally believe they should replace all &quot;print versions&quot; entirely. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:36, 27 February 2011 (UTC)

== Collective Flow ==

It has been noted (see above, in the &quot;Possible Style Change&quot; section) that the articles in this WikiBook are not necessarily optimized for compilation into a coherent whole.  Each article is designed for web viewing, and is therefore fairly self-contained.  This isn't a problem on the web, or even when printed as a stand-alone article, where being self-contained is, after all, A Good Thing™.  However, when the same articles are collected into a PDF or print-on-demand book, the various articles frequently don't even reference that the others exist, which is not very good for the flow of a book.  In order to address this, I propose going through each article, in the order it appears in the ToC or the Collection (the two are currently synonymous, save for several pages that don't exist), and editing it to:
* Fix the Navigation templates to point to the actual previous and next articles
* Acknowledge what has been said in preceding articles
* Lead into following articles
* Change redundant (appearing after the first time) instructions so they:
** Will be collapsed or moved to footnotes by default
** Will be consistently presented through the whole book
** Will be omitted when the article is viewed as a Collection (PDF or print-on-demand)

It might also be good to rearrange some articles in the ToC/Collection so the topics themselves will flow naturally from one to the next - I haven't actually read through the whole book as of yet, so I'm not sure how much of this actually needs doing, and how much has already been done.  Ultimately, of course, this is a community effort, and therefore a community decision.  - [[User:Sendoshin|Sendoshin]] ([[User talk:Sendoshin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sendoshin|contribs]]) 04:30, 28 February 2011 (UTC)

-- you are one of the few who is well versed in written communications, so please do what you can for all the future readers, as most of us find this aspect of book writing quite boring. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pearts|contribs]]) 00:53, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

I agree, maybe we should make those into guidelines? I'm not sure about using footnotes to hold unnecessary information though, wouldn't it be better to just give the information required and forget the useless stuff? e.g If you're writing a module on how to make a detailed 747, just leave out the &quot;Switch to Edit Mode&quot; stuff in favor of &quot;Scale the first 5 fuselage loops by 1.2x&quot;. --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 05:09, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

== Delete the 2.4x reference? ==

I think we should delete &quot;Although a fantastic resource, absolute newcomers to Blender will have to install and use version 2.4x...&quot;, it seems unnecessary. What do you think? --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 05:13, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

probley needs to be reworded to say that most of the tutorials where written with 2.4x in mind. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pearts|contribs]]) 03:16, 9 August 2011 (UTC)

That would be better, I'll change it. --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 04:59, 9 August 2011 (UTC)

As I make my way through the tutorials, it strikes me that whenever material is updated, it's worth removing most references to archival versions of the software. Anyone learning Blender through the tutorials will of course have downloaded the most recent version, and preserving references to how older versions worked is distracting at best. Those who are seriously invested in older versions of Blender will no longer be reading tutorials.  No?  [[User:Arnoldofcrete|Arnoldofcrete]] ([[User talk:Arnoldofcrete|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Arnoldofcrete|contribs]]) 22:36, 5 January 2013 (UTC)

'''Another 2₡''' - I completely agree with Arnoldofcrete's remark. As of v2.65a, much of the interface has changed since the bulk of this wiki book had been started with keyboard shortcuts no longer working and screen captures that no longer apply. The band aid approach of appending a parenthetical note to a section predicated on an earlier release has its place, but also has its limitations. 

Though I'm only now beginning to learn this program over the past two weeks with many thanks to all who have contributed to this wiki book with all of their kind and selfless work, it appears that v2.5 was a watershed event. This leads me to think that with each major release, the wiki book should be cloned, renamed to reflect that major release; e.g., '''Blender 3D v2.5: Noob to Pro''', the various sections updated, the inapplicable purged and new bits created.

[[User:Kbellis|Kbellis]] ([[User talk:Kbellis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kbellis|contribs]]) 21:28, 19 January 2013 (UTC)

'''Yet another 2₡''' - I totally agree. I'm starting from scratch on version 2.72.  Thanks of course to all who have contributed (for free, I understand), but there seems to be too many repetitions of the same issues along with too many defunct bits of info from previous versions.  Ideally the tutorials would only cover each issue once and thereby create a lean-and-mean per-edition basic grounding.  In comparison with propriety software, Blender seems stunningly creative and community-minded.  So a better intro for newbies would go a long way to pushing its presence even further.

== Table of Contents ==

I've found this book a few days ago while searching for beginner tutorials. Having been reading it for a few days, one issue I have right off the bat is the lack of a proper table of contents. Or, to be more specific, a table of contents that links directly to each section using bookmarks (like this: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37844107/Photos/Contents%20example.jpg). This would make moving back and forth between sections much easier, especially because new users like me will probably be jumping back and forth to remind ourselves of commands, settings, etc. I'm actually kinda curious as to why this wasn't in there to begin with. I realize that with a book of this size, this would require a huge amount of effort, and I'm willing to help if and when I can (i.e. when I don't have homework and I don't want to play games or surf the web). So, does anyone else think this is a good idea and want to help add this?

== Image on the Cover ==

I feel like there should be something more on the &quot;cover&quot; page (really just page 1). It just seems a bit boring to me as is. I would suggest the Blender logo, and I found a high-res on on Google if you want to use it: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DjogBLK0-DA/TuSK_wb0MoI/AAAAAAAAAjE/0S34nPPFqpw/s1600/blender_logo.png

Actually, I could do this myself. How would I go about adding the image to the PDF? [[User:BBlender gGuy|BBlender gGuy]] ([[User talk:BBlender gGuy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BBlender gGuy|contribs]]) 21:18, 13 February 2012 (UTC)

:Images are uploaded by using the Upload file option which you will see on the toolbox menu to your right. Once the image is uploaded, you can include it on the cover page where it will automatically become part of the PDF &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:54, 13 February 2012 (UTC)

== PDF version problems ==

Not all of the keystroke images show up in the PDF version. For instance, in section 29.1 the online version says to bring up the ''Snap'' menu with Shift + S but the PDF version omits the S. The whole PDF is riddled with these errors and it makes it completely useless. In general it seems to be multiple keystrokes that go wrong so I suspect it's an artifact of converting to PDF format, but whatever it is it needs fixing. [[User:Reyk|Reyk]] ([[User talk:Reyk|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Reyk|contribs]]) 22:52, 28 June 2012 (UTC)

Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. It is resolved with the PDF I uploaded a few minutes ago. [[User:Dirk Hünniger|Dirk Hünniger]] ([[User talk:Dirk Hünniger|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dirk Hünniger|contribs]]) 06:22, 2 July 2012 (UTC)

Another example of missing images is in chapter I, unit 1, par. 16, e.g. after Render Context you have &quot;File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png&quot; instead of the icon.

== Obsolete 2.4''x'' Scripting Pages ==

I have removed links to the following obsolete pages that described scripting in 2.49 and older:

== Yafray Is Obsolete ==
Yafray has been replaced by Yafaray. On top of which, all the references to Yafray seem to date from many years ago, when it looks like it was commonly used to get around limitations in the Blender Internal renderer that have since been (mostly) rectified.

To this end, I am removing the pages discussing Yafray, [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Yafray_Render_Options|Yafray Render Options]] and 
[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Realistic_Water_using_Fluid_Sim_and_Yafray|Realistic Water using Fluid Sim and Yafray]], and just leaving links to them here. For the future, I think it is best to stick with the Blender Internal renderer for all lessons apart from the Game Engine, until we get to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Rendering|Advanced Rendering]]. If anybody wants to add information about Yafaray, put it in that section.

== Typographic consistency ==

Hello everyone

First, I must say I'm very impressed with what I've read so far. The attention to detail and overall level of polish are outstanding.

Being a pedant, I've noticed a couple of typographical inconsistencies. Dashes, for example, are not standardised – I've so far seen spaced em-dashes, spaced en-dashes and spaced hyphens used for the same purpose. For purposes such as parenthesis, the Wikipedia Manual of Style [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Dashes recommends] either spaced en-dashes or unspaced em-dashes.

I'd like to tweak copy for this sort of stylistic consistency, if I may. In the case of dashes, I prefer the spaced en-dash to the unspaced em-dash, but I would be happy to go with whatever is agreed upon by the powers that be.

Thoughts?

[[User:Hidden Exit|Hidden Exit]] ([[User talk:Hidden Exit|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hidden Exit|contribs]]) 11:08, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

:Spaced em dashes are far the easiest-to-read convention; as I recall, it was also the most popular convention on en.wp before WP:MOS took its bizarre position.  How the WP:MOS folks ended up with that loony convention is beyond me, except that it illustrates the subtle disfunctionality of that system (not that WP:MOS doesn't get some things right, and not that any system doesn't have problems).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:45, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

It's certainly a matter of style, but I believe the em-dash is usually used without word spaces. Because there are often no sidebearings around an em-dash, it can get uncomfortably close to surrounding characters, so hair spaces are commonly inserted for padding. In terms of personal preference, I think the spaced em-dash is too jarring a break, and it doesn't offer any significant readability benefits. But that's just my opinion; using a spaced em-dash certainly wouldn't rob me of any sleep. My main intention is to improve consistency. [[User:Hidden Exit|Hidden Exit]] ([[User talk:Hidden Exit|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hidden Exit|contribs]]) 13:28, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

== Video Tutorials ==

I create video tutorials for Blender Geek and was wondering if I, along with a few others, can create video tutorials for parts of the book that don't have videos.  You can view my [http://www.youtube.com/user/blendergeekvideos?feature=g-all-u YouTube channel] or [http://www.blendergeek.co.za/ website].

All the videos will be in the latest version of Blender, so many will probably be converted along the way.

This will also expose me to parts of Blender that I haven't learnt yet.

Thanks

== Merging Lighting Tutorials? ==

It seems rather superfluous to have two tutorials on basic lighting.  Does anyone have any thoughts on merging [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Lighting Suzanne: Introductory one lamp lighting]] and [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Lighting Rigs]]?  The other option would be to move the Basic Lighting somewhere earlier than the Suzanne tutorial.

== The PDF/ Collection generation system is broken ==

[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro| Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] is an excellent book. But it's not currently very book-like. Neither can it be made book-like. 
By which I mean that the WikiBooks render server is broken. Despite trying 3 browsers and 2 operating systems over two different ISP's,
the render process always seems to fail after reaching exactly 36.67 %, at which point, instead of collection-specific titles, the render
line reads [Parsoid]. Is there a way to render this collection externally? Or collect it in book format some way or other?

Hi,
I was able to generate an updated version of the PDF fileː

[[File:BlenderTest.pdf]]

unfortunately there are some minor typographic issues that I currently don't have time to fix, so I do not favour using it as a replacement for the one linked on the main page of this book. I hope it is still useful. If someone wants to work on the typographic details I will happily provide him/her with the latex source code of the book. I generated the latex code as well as the provided pdf file with mediawiki2latex using the latest source from the git repository in with I just committed the disabling of threading particularly for this book. The command line was like that
&lt;pre&gt;
mediawiki2latex -u https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Dirk_H%C3%BCnniger/blender -o dirk.pdf -i -c blender +RTS -K2000M

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Introduction_to_Philosophy|Introduction to Philosophy]] &gt; [[Introduction_to_Philosophy/Logic|Logic]] &gt; Modal Logic

== Modality ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Still holding the copy of ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', Robert said, 'What sort of alternate present does this book describe?'&lt;br /&gt;Betty, after a moment, said, 'One in which Germany and Japan lost the war.' &lt;br /&gt;They were all silent. &lt;br /&gt;('''Philip K. Dick''', ''The Man in the High Castle'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is the basic premise of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic modal logic]: some things could have been otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;In our everyday reasoning, we distinguish between ''necessary'' truths and statements that just happen to be true but could have been false. We say that the latter are ''contingently'' true, or that their negation is ''possible''. The concepts of ''necessary'', ''contingent'', ''possible'' and ''impossible'' are very closely related: something is ''necessary'' if it is ''impossible'' for it to be false, and something is ''possible'' if its falsehood is not ''necessary''. ''Contingency'' is the negation of ''necessity'', and ''impossibility'' the negation of ''possibility''.&lt;br /&gt;Modal logic attempts to include the notions of modality (''necessary'', ''contingent'', ''possible'' and ''impossible'', among others) into the structure of ''classical logic'' (propositional logic and predicate calculus) and is therefore an extension of classical logic.

== Modal propositional calculus ==
=== Syntax ===
Modal logic introduces three new symbols into classical logic: &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;(necessary),&lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; (possible) and &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (if, then). Formulae are constructed in the usual way, with the following rules added ''before the closure clause'' (see the rules for [[Introduction to Philosophy/Logic/A More Formal Approach to Sentential Logic#Well-Formed_Formulae|Well-Formed Formulae]] in propositional calculus):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a well-formed formula, then &lt;math&gt;\Box \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond \alpha&lt;/math&gt; are also well-formed formulae.
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are well-formed formulae, then &lt;math&gt;\alpha \Rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; is also a well formed formula.
&lt;/ul&gt;
Actually, one can define the modal propositional calculus axiomatically using just &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if we wish to define &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Diamond \alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be defined simply as a abbreviated notation for &lt;math&gt;\neg \Box \neg \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \Rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; as another way of writing &lt;math&gt;\Box (\alpha \rightarrow \beta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

== What you can do with Remote Desktop Connection ==
Wish you could access your home desktop from work? Going on vacation, but want to be able to use your home computer? This can be easily done with Windows XP’s built in Remote Desktop Connection feature.

Some companies also use remote Desktop for technical support.  Cisco systems (among others) allow engineers to use remote desktop to look in on issues and correct them.  This troubleshooting method can save time and money for numerous industries.

=== Setup ===
'''In order to take advantage of remote desktop connection, you have to have port 3389 (TCP) open on your firewall/router. To do so consult your firewall or router’s manual.'''
==== User Password ====
In order for remote desktop to work, you have to set a password on your user account. Follow these steps to set a password.

# Go to Start then to My Computer (or go to your desktop and go to My Computer)
# Go to Control Panel
# Go to User Accounts
# Click on your user account
# Go to Create a Password
# Fill everything out and hit Create Password

==== Enabling Remote Desktop Connection (on the host) ====
Now you’re ready to enable remote desktop. '''You have to be logged in as an administrator'''

# Go to Start then right click on My Computer (or right click My Computer on your desktop)
# Select Properties
# Go to the Remote tab
# Check “Allow users to connect remotely to this computer”
# If you have other users that you want to allow remote access to the computer then go to Select Remote Users and select add and type in the user account name of the user where it says “Enter the object names to select”

==== Getting your IP address ====
You now have to get your ip address.  Please see [[Finding Your IP Address]] for more information.

==== Connecting to the host machine from another machine ====

Now, this is how to connect to your computer from using Remote Desktop Connection. If you’re using a computer that doesn’t have Windows XP then you can load the client side of Remote Desktop Connection. Get it at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/rdclientdl.asp and then you can follow these steps.

# Go to Start
# Go to All Programs
# Go to Accessories
# Go to Communications
# Click Remote Desktop Connection
# Go to Options and modify the options as you seem fit
# Type in your IP address by 'Computer'
# Log in with your username and password

You should now have access to your computer. Take note that playing music will not work well with over the remote connection unless you have it stay at the local computer (change this in the options). Also, if you view images and webpages over the connection it will be very slow. Oh, and of course, you can’t play games like Quake 3 over the connection, this simply isn’t possible.

Similar software does exist for other operating systems, such as rdesktop.

=== Pros ===

* You can access your documents from anywhere.
* You can keep your IRC (internet relay chat) and IM clients open on one machine and then connect to your computer from other places. Thus you don’t have to leave your screen names and whatnot behind on other people’s computers.
* Check and save email in YOUR email client instead of using webmail.
* Perhaps your workplace/school doesn’t allow you to run IRC or IM clients, but you can use remote desktop. Then you can log on to your computer and IRC and IM from there.
* You could use this as some sort of tech support method.
* You can use Remote Desktop if you can’t always have a monitor plugged in to the box.
* Great for servers, you don't need to buy keyboard, mouse, monitor etc. to use.

=== Cons ===

* Applications with high graphics abilities can't be used (due to network and graphical lag).
* In order to start the server you have to log into your account, meaning if you’re on vacation and your computer locks up, you’ll have to have someone else reboot the computer and log in with your password. But this problem can be fixed by modifying a DLL file and adding a registry value. And up to 2 more computers can be connected remotely at the same time.
See the following link for more information on the procedure for enabling it.

http://www.golod.com/2005/10/enabling-multiple-remote-desktop-sessions-in-windows-xp-professional-and-media-center-edition-2005/

* You need a broadband connection that is always on, if you want to be able to access it all the time. Dialup won’t cut it there.

Welcome to the Hungarian Wikibook, a free online textbook on the Hungarian language. Hungarian is spoken by roughly 14.5 million people in Hungary and elsewhere. It is spoken in Europe but is not an Indo-European language, and bears little resemblance to languages of the Indo-European family.  It is classed as a Finno-Ugric language, its closest relatives being Finnish, Estonian and some similar languages spoken in the parts of Russia adjoining Finland and Estonia.

Hungarian is spoken in a lot of countries since the [[w:Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Trianon]] redefined Hungary's borders in 1920 and because of the emigration that followed the outbreak of [[w:World War II|World War II]] and the [[w:Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]]:

Can you add a bit on how to route it over SSH?  It would be nice to have secure RDC on windows.  There is information out there about this but not on Wikibooks, and none clear enough for me to even attempt. --[[User:Me at work|Me at work]] 22:44, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Rpugatch. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Rpugatch~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Hello Me at work,
As answer to your question, yes, I like the browser, but that's not the reason for my name. I've had this name before on whole the internet: nl.wikipedia, MSN and so on.
I've to confess I don't have the browser myself (at this moment). My opinion says that you should have the right browser on the right platform (and I use Windows XP at this moment.) When I will install Liunux Redhat (this Christmas), I'll surely take Firefox, because I've seen the preview and also the full version on the pc of a friend of me and I liked it.&lt;BR&gt;[[User:Firefox|Firefox]] 18:08, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1     &lt;-your system Gateway
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are on broadband, or use a network modem or your internet connection is not through your current PC, that IP is a local ip. Meaning, that is the IP my router gave me, not the IP the world sees. This means that the address is only specific to me in my local network.

If you use dialup with a modem on your current computer, that will be your external IP.


=== Windows XP ===
You can double click on the two computers on the task bar at the lower right hand corner also known as your Local Area Connection.
Once that opens you can see the status of your local area connection as well as the activity of it.
The status referring to whether or not it's connected, how long it has been connected, and the speed of the connection.
The activity referring to the number of packets sent and received. 
Then you click the Support tab. 
The support tab shows you your IP address, the address type, subnet mask and default gateway if you have one.
You can also click details.  Details shows you your Physical (MAC) address, IP address, the subnet mask address, the address for your DHCP server, your DNS server as well as when you obtained the lease for your IP address and when it expires.

=== Windows VISTA ===
* Click Start --&gt; Control Panel--&gt; Network and Internet--&gt; Network snd Sharing Center
* In the left side pane select the fifth option Manage Network Connections.
* In the new window right click Local Area Connection (or Wireless Network connection in case your connected to the net via wireless).
* Select the second option Status and in the Local Area Connection Status dialog click the Details button.
* The Network Connection Details window will appears with Property and Value.
* In that you can find the fifth propperty as IPv4 Address and a value similar to this format 192.168.1.2.
* Thats the IP address.

=== Windows 7 ===

* Click on '''Windows Logo --&gt;Control Panel --&gt; Network and Internet --&gt; Network and Sharing Center'''.
* In the left side pane select the second option '''&quot;Change Adapter Settings&quot;.'''
* In the new window right click '''&quot;Local Area Connection&quot;''' (or Wireless Network connection in case your connected to the net via wireless).
* Right click on the appropriate connection and select the third option Status.
* In the new  '''&quot;Local Area Connection Status&quot;''' dialog click the &quot;Details&quot; button.
* The '''&quot;Network Connection Details'''&quot; window will appears with Property and Value. 
* In that you can find the fifth propperty as '''IPv4 Address''' and a value similar to this format '''192.168.1.2.''' 
* Thats the IP address.

Another simple way is to use a little tool at:http://www.softpedia.com/get/Network-Tools/IP-Tools/JMCNSOFT-My-IP.shtml

=== MAC OS X LION ===

* Click the '''Apple icon''' that is located on the top left hand side.
* From the menu select the option '''&quot;System Preferences...&quot;'''
* Select '''Network''' under the heading '''Internet &amp; Wireless''' (Internet &amp; Network in 10.5).

WIRELESS
* If Connected via '''Wi-Fi'''(Airport in 10.5) select that option from the left.
* In the right u can find a message reading something similiar to this
 &quot;Wi-Fi is connected to '''NETWORK1''' and has the IP address '''192.168.
  1.2&quot;'''
* Where NETWORK1 is the network you are currently connected to and the '''192.168.1.2 is the &quot;IP ADDRESS&quot;.'''
   
WIRED
* Select the '''Ethernet''' option from the left.
* In the right you can find '''IP Address : 192.168.1.2'''
=== Linux  ===

In Linux the are two commands that are used to find IP addresses of
the machines interfaces.  
These are the new ''ip'' command that is used for almost all configuration
of networks and the old obsoleted ''ifconfig'' command.
Most installations of Linux has both of them installed, but some only have the new
command.

# Open a Terminal/Console
# Type ''ip address show'' or ''ifconfig''
# Look for ''inet 192.168.1.2/24'' resp. ''inet addr:192.168.1.2
where the ''192.168.1.2'' is your machines IPv4 address in your LAN.

&lt;pre&gt;
[user@wikibooks]$ ip add show dev eth0
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:80:C8:F8:4A:51 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.99.35  Bcast:192.168.99.255 scope global eth0
    inet6 fe80::0280:c8ff:fef8:4a51/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
[root@wikibooks]# ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:80:C8:F8:4A:51
          inet addr:192.168.99.35  Bcast:192.168.99.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:190312 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:86955 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100 
          RX bytes:30701229 (29.2 Mb)  TX bytes:7878951 (7.5 Mb)
          Interrupt:9 Base address:0x5000
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also use curl and the [http://ipinfo.io ipinfo.io] API:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ curl ipinfo.io/ip
67.188.232.xxx
&lt;/pre&gt;

where ''67.188.232.xxx'' is your global IPv4 address.  
If you are behind a NAT:et router, this isn't the same as your machines private IPv4 address in your LAN.

== Finding your global IP address ==

To find your global IP which is what the outside world sees, you may use a website such as [http://www.inetclue.com/ INet Clue] or [http://www.ipfinding.com IP Finding] or [http://www.ipchicken.com IP Chicken].

=== On this page ===
Click on edit. Anywhere in the edit box type four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; Click ''Show preview'' (please, &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; ''Save page''!). Lo and behold, in the preview your &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; has become your external IP address!

=== In Firefox  ===

Simply download the extension &quot;[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1731 Live IP Address]&quot; to keep track of your current IP address. Useful if you are used to using automatic proxies.

=== In any browser on any operating system ===
Many websites can give you your IP address. These include, but are nowhere near limited to:
* [http://ipinfo.io/ http://ipinfo.io/]
* [http://inetclue.com/ http://inetclue.com/]
* [http://en.toolpage.org/tool/ip-address http://en.toolpage.org/tool/ip-address]
* [http://whatismyipaddress.com/ http://whatismyipaddress.com/]

__TOC__

Here's a screenshot to give you a preview of Blender's interface.

For those familiar with older (pre-2.5''x'') versions of Blender, this will look very different. The redesign made it much easier to find things.

For a detailed rationale explaining the redesign, read [http://download.blender.org/documentation/bc2008/evolution_of_blenders_ui.pdf this].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Why Doesn’t It Follow UI Conventions For &amp;#91;Insert OS Of Choice Here]? ==

Blender follows its own user-interface conventions. Instead of making use of multiple windows as defined by your particular OS/GUI, it creates its own “windows” within a single OS/GUI window, which is best sized to fill your screen. Many people accustomed to how applications normally work on their platform of choice get annoyed by Blender’s insistence on being different. But there is a good reason for this.

The essence of the Blender UI can be summed up in one word: ''workflow''. Blender was originally created by a 3D graphics shop for their own in-house use. Being a key revenue engine for them, they designed it for maximum productivity, speed and smoothness of operation. That means avoiding “bumps” that slow down the user. For example, windows never overlap, so there’s no need to keep reordering them to see hidden stuff. You don’t have to click in a window to make it active, just move the mouse. There is a minimum of interruption from popups asking for more information before performing some action; instead, the action is immediately performed with default settings, which you can then adjust afterwards and get immediate feedback on the results.

Blender may not be “intuitive” to start learning, in that you cannot simply sit down in front of it on your own and figure out things by messing about from a position of knowing nothing at all. But once you have picked up some basic conventions, you will find it all starting to make sense and ''then'' you will be free to experiment and discover things on your own.

== Why Doesn’t It Prompt To Save Changes? ==
Most applications on whatever platform nowadays will ask for confirmation if you try to close a document that has unsaved changes. Blender is frequently criticized for not doing so.

But think about it: what constitutes an “unsaved change”? Are switching tools or adjusting the window layout changes worth saving? In Blender’s case, the answer is “yes”, because all that is part of the document state to be restored on opening. So Blender would have to prompt for confirmation practically ''every time'' you closed a document or quit Blender.

Instead, Blender always saves changes when it closes, to a file called 'quit.blend'. The next time you use Blender, simply select ''File --&gt; Recover Last Session'' and you can resume right where you left off.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}

The Blender user interface may appear daunting at first, but don't despair. This book explores the interface one step at a time.

In this module, you'll learn about Blender windows:
* recognizing windows and their headers,
* the different types of windows,
* how to activate and resize windows,
* how to split and join windows.

You'll also practice launching and leaving Blender. 

==An Interface Divided==
Blender's user interface is divided into rectangular areas called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|windows}} (or sometimes, {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|areas}}). The overall arrangement of windows is called a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|workspace}}.

If you haven't already launched Blender, go ahead and do so.  You should soon see something that resembles the following.

Blender has had some major changes to its user interface (UI) since version 2.4x. Some of these changes include moving buttons and changing  the space bar hot key from the “add menu” to the “search menu” ({{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}}  is now the &quot;add menu” hot key). This is important to know when trying to follow tutorials. 

Other changes include the addition of the tool bar and window splitting widget. The shelf widget (indicated by a plus sign) opens hidden tool shelves. The object tool shelf can be toggled on and off by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|TKEY}}. The properties tool shelf can be toggled on and off by pressing the {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}}. The split window widget allows you to split and join windows.
Blender 2.69 is shown below.

[[File:Blender269DefaultView.png|800px]]
{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If you see something substantially different...}}
*You may be running a different version of Blender - maybe a higher version.  The screenshot was made using the 2.69 release. 
::If you're running an older version, you should probably upgrade.  Download instructions are in [[../Unit 1: Knowing Before Making|the Introduction]].
*The user-interface settings on your computer may have been changed.
*:Try resetting the user interface with ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings''.
::To take a screenshot in Blender, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt|F3}}, and click ''Make Screencast''. This will record what's on your screen until you click the red ''Close'' button on the info header. The screencasts will be saved in the ''tmp'' folder-In Microsoft Windows, ''tmp'' folder is located on 'C:\tmp'.
{{Hidden end}}

==Window Headers==

Did you find all five headers?

Every Blender window has a header.  A header can appear at the top of the window, at the bottom of the window, or it can be hidden.  Let's take a closer look at the headers.

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.57 headers.jpg
|imageWidth=800px

|type3=text
|top3=25%
|width3=40%
|text3=
The header of the Info window is outlined in {{Green|green}}.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The header of the 3D View window is outlined in {{Red|red}}.  Note that it runs along the ''bottom'' of the 3D View window, not the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The header of the Properties window is outlined in {{Blue|blue}}.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The header of the Outliner window is outlined in white.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The header of the Timeline window is the one on the bottom (not outlined)
}}

If you click with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the header, a menu pops up which lets you move the header (to the top if it’s at the bottom, or vice versa), or maximize the window to fill the entire workspace:

[[File:Blender269HeaderMenu.png|center]]

To hide the header completely, move the mouse to the edge of the header furthest from the edge of the window (i.e. the top edge of the header if it is at the bottom of the window, or vice versa); it will change into a vertical double-headed arrow. Now click with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} and drag towards the window edge, and the header will disappear. In its place, you will see the following symbol appear at the corner of the window: [[File:Blender274RevealShelfIconBrightened.png]]. Click this with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to bring the header back.

==Window Types==

Blender has many types of windows (there are 16 of them in Blender 2.69) and a Console for the Python programming language.  You've just encountered the Info, 3D View, Properties, and Outliner windows. The rest will be introduced as needed in later modules.

Every window header in Blender has an icon at the left end to indicate the window type.  For instance:
*[[File:Blender 2.59 Info ico.png]] = Info
*[[File:Blender 2.59 User Prefs ico.png]] = User Preferences
*[[File:Blender 2.59 3d view icon.png]] = 3D View
*[[File:Blender 2.59 Outliner ico.png]] = Outliner
*[[File:Blender 2.59 Properties ico.png]] = Properties

If you {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the icon, a menu will pop up. (If you don't know what {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} means, please review the [[../Keystroke, Button, and Menu Notation|Keystrokes, Buttons, and Menus Notation]] module.)

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender269 3DViewWindowType.png
|imageWidth=408px

|type3=text
|top3=20%
|left3=60%
|width3=60%
|text3=By matching the icon in the header to the icons in the menu, you can tell that the window here is a 3D View window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The menu can be used to alter a window's type.  In this screenshot, the user is about to change the window into a Properties window.
}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Any window can be changed to any type. Blender doesn't mind if there are multiple windows of the same type.}}
{{B3D:N2P/Note|The workspace layout is saved along with the document. Anybody subsequently opening the document will see the last-saved layout.}}

If you've changed any window's type, please change it back (or reload the factory settings with ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings'') before continuing with this tutorial.

==The Active Window==

The '''active window''' is the one that will respond if you press a key. Exactly one Blender window is active at any given time.

The active window is usually the one containing the mouse pointer. (Blender uses a &quot;focus follows mouse&quot; user interface model. When a hotkey fails to work as expected, it is often because the mouse pointer has strayed into a neighboring window.)  To change the active window, simply move the mouse pointer into the window you wish to activate.

Practice changing the active window by moving your mouse between the 3D View and the Timeline windows. The Timeline window is exactly below the 3D View header. At this point, it is worth mentioning that the header for the 3D View window and Timeline window is at the BOTTOM of its own window instead of the top as the name &quot;header&quot; implies.  

{{B3D:N2P/Note|When a window becomes active, its header gets brighter.}}

==Resizing Windows==

Resizing windows is easy.

===Dragging on a Border===
{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender 2.63 init factory bottom.png
|imageWidth=800px

|type2=text
|top2=3%
|width2=90%
|label2=Step 1
|text2=Move the mouse pointer to the border between two windows (the area outlined in {{Red|red}} below.  The pointer will change to an up/down arrow.

|type3=text
|bottom3=3%
|width3=90%
|label3=Steps 2-4
|text3=Press and hold {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.&lt;br&gt;Drag with the mouse to move the border up and down.&lt;br&gt;When the border is where you want it, release {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.

|type4=draw
|top4=123px
|left4=-3px
|width4=100%
|height4=7px
}}

Whenever you increase the size of one window, you decrease the size of another.  That's because Blender has a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|non-overlapping window interface}}: unlike many other programs, it does not permit windows to overlap.

===Maximizing a Window===
Another way to resize a window is to maximize it.  When Blender {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|maximizes}} a window, it makes it as big as possible.  The previous window configuration is saved.

* To maximize the active window, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|UpArrow}} , {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|DownArrow}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Space}}.
* When a window is maximized, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|UpArrow}} , {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|DownArrow}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Space}} to restore the previous (unmaximized) window configuration. 


Practice maximizing and un-maximizing the 3D View and Timeline windows.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If you are running a version of Blender before 2.57, you cannot maximize a User Preferences window.}}

==Shelves==
You will notice that the 3D View [[File:Blender2693DViewIcon.png]] window (the largest window in the above screenshots) has several buttons down the left. This rectangular portion is called the ''Tool Shelf''. This is like a window within a window, and you can drag the boundary between it and the main part of the 3D View to resize.

If you drag all the way to the window boundary, the shelf will disappear. In its place, the following symbol will appear: [[File:Blender274RevealShelfIconBrightened.png]]. Click that to bring the shelf back.

==Too Much To Fit==
If a window or shelf contains too much information to fit within its display area, scrollbars will appear along the bottom or right edge. You can scroll the contents by dragging these with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}; alternatively you can drag with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} directly within the contents.

A window header may also contain more than fits within its displayable area. There is no explicit visual clue for this (except maybe the tell-tale of widgets being cut off at the right edge), but if it happens, you can drag sideways within the header with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} to scroll its contents.

==Splitting And Joining Windows==
At the top right and bottom left of every window, you will see something like this: [[File:Blender254WindowWidget.png]]. If you move the mouse over this icon, you will see the pointer turn into a cross. At this point, you can do one of the following by clicking and dragging with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}:
* Split the window into two copies horizontally by dragging horizontally away from the edge.
* Split the window into two copies vertically by dragging vertically away from the edge.
* Join the window to the adjacent one horizontally (getting rid of it and taking over its space) by dragging towards it.
* Join the window to the adjacent one vertically (getting rid of it and taking over its space) by dragging towards it.

Of course, the last two are only possible if there ''is'' in fact another window in that direction. Note also that you can only join windows horizontally that are the same height, and windows vertically that are the same width.

==The Default Workspace==
If you look at the above screenshot of the default workspace, you will see the following window types:
* The menu bar at the top (outlined in green) is actually a window, called Info [[File:Blender269InfoIcon.png]]. In previous versions of Blender, you could resize this to reveal the User Preferences, but in 2.5''x'' they have been moved to their own window type. Instead, all you can see here if you enlarge the window are some debug messages, which may be removed in a future version of Blender. As of 2.70, the debug messages are still present in this menu.
* The largest window on the screen is the 3D View [[File:Blender2693DViewIcon.png]]. This is where you work on your model.
* The Properties [[File:Blender269PropertiesIcon.png]] window is the tall area on the right; this is where most of the functions are located for performing operations on models, materials etc. In previous versions of Blender this was called the Buttons window, and was degenerating into a disorganized grab bag of functionality that made it difficult to find things. This has been cleaned up in a major way in 2.5''x''. Note also that it defaults to a vertical layout, rather than the horizontal one of previous versions. The new design prefers a vertical layout, which works better on today’s widescreen monitors.
* The Outliner [[File:Blender269OutlinerIcon.png]] (at the top right) gives you an overview of the objects in your document. As your models get more complex, you will start to appreciate the ability to find things quickly here.
* The Timeline [[File:Blender270TimelineIcon.png]] (across the bottom) becomes important when you’re doing animations.

Of course, this is just the default layout. For example, if you’re doing a static model or scene, not an animation, you can get rid of the Timeline. If you’re doing heavy script development, you’ll probably want the Console available to try things out. And so on.

==Workspace Presets==
Up in that Info window/titlebar, you will see a menu with an icon  like this [[File:Blender267ScreenLayoutIcon.png]]. Clicking on it with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} will show the following menu:

[[File:Blender255WorkspaceMenu.png|center]]

Selecting from this menu lets you quickly switch between various predefined workspace layouts, tailored to various workflows. Try it and see—you can return to the default layout by selecting “Default” (but note that any changes you make to the layout are immediately associated with the name being displayed here). The menu even has a search box at the bottom: typing some text in here will restrict the menu to only showing items containing that text. Hard to believe it has much use here, but perhaps in complicated projects which need dozens of different layouts, a search function could become very useful indeed!

Note also the “+” and “X” icons to the right of the menu; clicking “+” creates a new entry which is a duplicate of the last-selected entry, while clicking “X” gets rid of the currently-selected entry. You will see these conventions appear consistently in menus elsewhere in Blender’s new, revamped interface.

== One Document At A Time ==

Blender can only work with one open document at a time. To save changes to the current document, select one of the Save options from the File menu (or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|S}} to save under the last-saved name). To open a new document (actually load a copy of your last-saved user preferences), select “New” from the File menu (or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|N}}), and select “Reload Start-Up File” from the little popup that appears, but be aware ''this will not automatically save changes to the previous document''—you should have remembered to do that first.

== Scenes ==
A ''scene'' is like a separate Blender document-within-a-document. Different scenes within the same document can easily share objects, materials etc, so you can define them once and make different renderings and animations from them. You create, delete and switch scenes using the scene [[File:Blender267SceneIcon.png]] menu in the info header. A new document starts by default with just one scene, called “Scene”.

==Leaving Blender==

To close down Blender:
# If there's a tool active, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} to exit the tool.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Q}}.  This brings up an ''OK?'' menu.
# Confirm ''Quit Blender'' by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Blender will not prompt you to save your work.  However, you can easily restart Blender and then pick up where you left off using ''File &amp;rarr; Recover Last Session''.}}

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.70}}

3D View [[File:Blender2693DViewIcon.png]] windows in Blender are used to visualize 3D scenes. You’ll do a lot of work in these windows, so you will need to learn your way around.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The 3D view only shows an ''approximation'' to the final appearance of the scene. The overall geometry should be correct, but don’t expect accurate rendition of materials, textures, lighting etc, since that can be very time-consuming, and the 3D view is designed to respond to your actions at interactive speeds. Plus there are additional view options (like wireframe, hiding etc) that make it easier to see what parts of the model you’re working on, that have no effect on the final render. Also you can change your viewpoint at any time (which will be essential while working on your model/scene), while the viewpoint of the render is controlled by the camera position.}}

In this module, you'll learn:
* to recognize 10 things commonly seen in viewports
* to tell which mode Blender is in
* how to change viewport options and viewpoints
* how to position the 3D cursor

You'll also learn the fundamentals of: 
* visibility layers

==The Viewport and its Contents==

Aside from its header, the remainder of a 3D View window is its {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|viewport}}.  In Blender, you use viewports any time you need an up-to-date view of the scene you're working on.

Viewports are busy places.  Go on a scavenger hunt and see what you can find in a simple viewport.

# Launch Blender.
# Just so we're all looking at the same scene, load the factory settings using ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings''.
# Confirm the “Load Factory Settings” popup with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} (or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}).
# If the NumLock indicator on your keyboard is unlit, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NumLock}} so that numpad hotkeys will work properly.
(If you're unsure what {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} means, please review [[../Keystroke, Button, and Menu Notation|the Keystroke, Button, and Menu Notation module]].)

You should see something like this:

{{B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.57_viewport_outline.png
|imageWidth=800px

|type2=text
|bottom2=5%
|left2=10%
|width2=80%
|text2=Here the viewport has been outlined in {{Red|red}} to focus your attention on it.

}}

===A Virtual Scavenger Hunt===
Peer into the viewport at the default scene provided by the creators of Blender and find the following eight items:

;In the Center
1. [[File:Blender-2.5_cube_object_mode.PNG|60px]] a solid gray cube with orange edges.
:* This is the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|default cube}}, your first Blender object!

2. [[File:Blender_3D_Manipulator_screenshot.png|60px]] Three big arrows, one red, one green and one blue, their tails joined to a white circle
:* This is not an object (part of your model/scene), but part of Blender’s user interface for manipulating objects.  It is the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|manipulator}}, also known as the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|3D transform widget}}.
:* The arrows represent the directions of the {{Red|X}}, {{Green|Y}} and {{Blue|Z}} axes of the currently-chosen {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|transform orientation}} coordinate system. Initially this is the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|global coordinate system}}.
:* The circle represents the center of the selected object (namely, the cube).
:* If you don't know what a &quot;global coordinate system&quot; is, please review [[../Coordinate Spaces in Blender|the module on Coordinate Spaces in Blender]].
{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If you don't see the manipulator...}}
* It's possible that a tool is active.  Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} to cancel any tool action.
* Another possibility is that the manipulator has been disabled:
** Toggle it on or off with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Space}}.
{{Hidden end}}
3. [[File:Blender 2.49b cursor.png]] A red-and-white striped circle with black cross-hairs
:* This is not an object. It is the '''3D Cursor''', which indicates where newly-created objects will appear in the scene.
:*The cursor is similar to the insertion point in a text editor, which indicates where newly-typed text will appear in a document.

;In the Lower Left Corner
4. [[File:Blender_3D_mini_axis_screenshot.png]]
:* This is not an object.  It is the '''mini axis''', and its orientation matches that of the global coordinate system, with the usual conventions: red for X, green for Y and blue for Z. Think of it as a little compass, reminding you which way is left/right, front/back and up/down.
5. The notation &quot;(1) Cube&quot;
: This is not an object.  It is {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|object info}}, indicating that:
:* You're viewing the first frame of an animation.
:: and 
:* The current or most recently selected object is named &quot;Cube&quot;.

;In the Upper Left Corner
6. The notation “User Persp”
: This is not an object. This is telling you something about the view being displayed by the viewport. The first word will change if you select one of the ''perfect'' views or the camera view (see below), otherwise it just says “User”, and the second word is “Persp” or “Ortho” to indicate whether this is a perspective or orthographic view.

;To the Right of Center
7. [[File:Blender 2.49b lamp icon.png]] A black round thing that resembles a sun-symbol
:: This represents a '''lamp''', a light source for the scene. (It is an object.)
8. [[File:Blender 2.49b camera icon.png|50px]] A pyramidal wireframe thing
:: This represents a '''camera''', a viewpoint that can be used for rendering.  (It, too, is an object.) The direction it is looking is out the base of the pyramid. The solid triangle attached to one side of the base is to remind you which way is up in the image that the camera takes.
:: On a small display, the camera might initially lie outside of the viewport and thus be invisible.  In that case, zoom out by scrolling with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} until it becomes visible.

;Throughout
9. A dark gray background, divided into squares by lighter lines. This is the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|grid floor}}, which you can (but don’t have to) use as a ground plane for positioning your models.
:: Each grid square is one '''blender unit''' (or '''BU''') on a side.  A BU can be whatever you wish:  an inch, a centimetre, a mile, or a cubit.  Blender lets you decide what the scale should be for your scene in the Scene tab of the Properties Panel.
10. Three mutually-perpendicular coloured lines associated with the grid floor: the red and green ones lying horizontally in the floor and the blue one running vertically. These are the global coordinate axes for orienting your scene: as usual, red is the X-axis, green the Y-axis, and blue the Z-axis.
* In Blender 2.67a, you can't see the blue line for Z-axis here because you can see it in Front or Side view.

== Modes ==

Blender has a lot of '''modes''', that is, settings that affect its behavior, and this is especially true of 3D View windows.

Sometimes it's not obvious what modes are active. This leads to '''mode errors''' where Blender will do something you didn't expect because you thought it was in one mode and it was actually in another.

In Blender, the function performed by a hotkey or mouse button can depend on:
* what mode the user interface is in,
* whether the keyboard is in NumLock mode,
* which window is active,
* the mode the active window is in,
* which item or items are selected,
* whether you've initiated a hotkey sequence.

It helps to recognize the common modes and how to get out of them.

=== Object Mode vs. Edit Mode ===
The 3D View windows are normally in Object Mode.  In this mode:
** The mouse pointer is a white arrow   (on MacOS it is black).
** {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} is used to select objects in the scene

If there are objects in the scene, you can get into five other modes:
* Edit Mode: used to edit the shapes of objects
** The mouse pointer is a thin inverse-video cross.
** {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} is used to select vertices, faces or edges of the current object.
** Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} to enter/exit this mode.
* Sculpt Mode
** The mouse pointer is now a thin, orange circle.
* Vertex Paint
** The mouse pointer is the same as in sculpt mode, a thin, orange circle.
* Texture Paint
** The mouse pointer is a thin white circle.
* Weight Paint
** The mouse pointer is again, a thin orange circle

These modes are also indicated by a menu in the 3D View header.  You can use this menu to change modes.

[[File:Blender-2.5_mode_menu.png]]

These modes are a setting shared by all 3D View windows.  In other words, when you change the mode in one window, any other 3D View windows change mode also.

== Viewport Options ==

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The options in this section only affect 3D View viewports.  They do not affect renders.}}

=== Solid vs. Wireframe ===
By default, the 3D View window draws objects using the Solid drawtype, in which surfaces are opaque. To toggle between Solid and Wireframe drawtype (edges only, no faces) for a particular viewport:
# Activate the 3D View window.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKey}}.
Alternatively, you can choose these and other drawtypes from the &quot;Draw type&quot; menu in the 3D View window header.

=== Orthographic vs. Perspective ===
By default, viewports draw orthographic views.  To toggle a viewport between orthographic and perspective views:
# Activate the 3D View window.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num5}}.

(If you're unsure what the difference is, please review {{B3D:N2P/Module|Orthographic Views}} and {{B3D:N2P/Module|Perspective Views}}.)

Note this perspective versus orthographic setting for the 3D viewport is completely separate from the similar setting in the camera properties; the former takes effect while you’re working on the model, the latter when you render.

So why have this separate setting for the 3D view? It’s because, regardless of what you want for the final render, certain aspects of modelling are easier in one view than another. If the final render will be using perspective, then naturally showing perspective in the 3D view gives you a better idea of how the final render will look. But perspective foreshortening can sometimes make it hard to ensure the model has the proper shape, which is why there is the option to flip to orthographic view if it helps.

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If you have trouble distinguishing between orthographic view and perspective view}}
... you should activate the View Name option. This is enabled by default and causes the name of the current view (&quot;User Persp&quot;, for instance) to appear in the upper left corner of every viewport. If there is no text, then you can enable it by:
# Accessing the User Preferences window.
# Click on the ''Interface'' tab.
# Enable ''View Name''.
{{Hidden end}}

==Changing Your Viewpoint, Part One==

Each viewport has a '''viewpoint''', which takes into account:
* the location of the viewer in the 3D scene (There doesn't need to be an object at that location.)
* the direction the viewer is looking
* the magnification (or zoom factor) used

Changing your viewpoint allows you to navigate your way through a 3D scene.

We'll start with three very basic techniques:
* Zooming
* Orbiting/View Rotation
* Perfect Views.

Additional techniques will be covered later in this module.

=== Zooming ===

Blender offers several ways to zoom in and out:
* Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Scroll}}
* Click and drag vertically with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|MMB}}.
* Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num+}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num-}} to zoom in and out in small increments.

Note the following limitations of Blender's zoom feature:
* If the viewport is in orthographic mode, Blender zooms as if looking through a telescope.  You can increase the magnification, but the viewpoint's location doesn't change.  For this reason, you cannot zoom into or through objects in orthographic mode.
* If the viewport is in perspective mode, Blender zooms to a point—namely the center of the viewport.  The viewpoint can pass through objects, but it can't pass beyond this point, no matter what you do. Zooming only gets slower and slower and slower.  If the center of the viewport is somewhere you don't expect, zooming may appear to be broken.

=== Orbiting and View Rotation ===

Let's fly around in the default cube, viewing it from different angles.  In this way you'll see that it really is a cube, centered on the origin, half above the X-Y plane and half below it.

#Activate the 3D View window by placing the mouse pointer inside it.
#Now you can:
#*Click and drag with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} to orbit freely around the center of the view.
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Alt|Scroll}} to rotate the viewpoint vertically around the center of the view.
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num2}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num8}} to rotate the viewpoint vertically around the center of the view in 15-degree increments.
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Alt|Scroll}} to rotate the viewpoint around the Z axis.
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num4}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num6}} to rotate the viewpoint around the Z axis in 15-degree increments.

If this is all very confusing for you, don't worry! You'll learn as you get more experience.

When you are finished flying around the cube, you can restore the original view by reloading the factory settings with ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings''.

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If the hotkeys don't work...}}

You may have pressed number keys above the letters instead of the ones on the numpad. If you do so, the default cube will vanish. This is because the scene consists of multiple layers. The default cube is in layer 1, and you've told Blender to switch to another layer of the number you just pressed. The selected object (the cube in this case) remains in layer 1, which isn't shown anymore. For instance, {{B3D:N2P/Do|2Key}} tells Blender to switch to layer 2. To switch to layer 1 again, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|1Key}}. You can view the different layers by clicking on the little squares on the layer map: [[File:Blender-2.5_layers.png]]

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Because the center of the viewport is invisible (not marked in any way), it's hard to tell where it is.  This sometimes results in unexpected behavior during rotation.}}

=== Perfect Views ===

It's often useful to get a '''perfect view''' of a scene—in other words, to view it along one of the main axes, with the other two main axes oriented up-down and left-right.

The following screenshot shows all three perfect views plus camera perspective for the Suzanne primitive:

[[File:Blender-2.5_perfect_view_quad.png|600px]]

In fact, this layout of four viewports showing top, front and right views plus camera view is so commonly used that it has its own menu item (from the “View” menu, select “Toggle Quad View”) and keyboard shortcut ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|ALT|Q}}).

==Positioning the 3D Cursor==

Positioning the 3D cursor is a very basic operation, yet one that many beginners find challenging.  It touches on an issue common to all 3D graphics software: &quot;How do you specify points in a 3D scene when we can only see two dimensions at a time?&quot;

===Basic Technique===
# Go into either Object Mode or Edit Mode.
# Move the mouse pointer to the desired position (in any viewport).
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.

{{Warning|This technique will fail if the 3D manipulation widget is enabled and your desired position is too close to it.  Clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on or near the widget (the white circle with the colored arrows) will initiate a transform operation; the object's outline will turn white and the mouse pointer will begin dragging the object around. If this happens, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} to cancel the transform operation.}}

{{Warning|Clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} in a viewport can only reposition the cursor in two out of three dimensions.  (The cursor's projected distance along the central line-of-sight remains unchanged.)  For this reason, any time you reposition the cursor this way you should immediately verify its position using a different viewpoint.}}

===Two Challenges===
'''Challenge #1.''' Using only tools presented this far, try positioning the 3D cursor on the virtual camera.

Try it!

When you're done, check your work by orbiting the camera.

Perhaps you thought you were done when you clicked on the camera.  But the moment you changed your viewpoint, you probably found that the 3D cursor was actually behind (or in front of) the camera.

Hints:
* Try positioning the cursor in two different perfect views.
* Use orthographic views, not perspective ones.

'''Challenge #2.''' Using only tools presented thus far,  try repositioning the 3D cursor at the origin (that is, at the center of the cube).

As before, check your work by orbiting the cube.  Don't spend too much time on this.

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=User Comments}}

&quot;I found that I would select the cube when left clicking on it in object mode, if the '''&quot;Use 3d transform manipulator&quot;''' button was enabled.  To toggle this off, you click on the '''gray pointing hand''' in the 3d panel header, or (Ctrl Space).&quot;

&quot;When you want the cursor back into the cube, just select the camera with '''RMB''', put the cursor into the cube following the steps above, and re-select the cube with '''RMB'''.&quot;

&quot;I've discovered it helps a lot if you are in Object Mode and not in Edit Mode. I wrote the following before discovering this: ''The problem with this exercise, for me, is that left clicking on the cube selects the cube instead of moving the 3d cursor. If I click on the cube outside of its central white circle I can get the cursor to move there, but only to outside of this white circle, and even then this only works sometimes.''&quot;

&quot;I failed at this until I had zoomed in close enough to the cube. When I was too far zoomed out I kept selecting the cube rather than creating an edit point.&quot;

&quot;I had the same problem and found it was because the cube was selected. I made sure I was in object mode, right clicked on the camera to select the camera instead of the cube, and I could then position the edit point in the cube. However, doing this messed up the next part of the tutorial because you cannot switch into edit mode with the camera selected! Perhaps the suggestion of trying to put the 3D cursor in the cube should be dropped as it raises too many questions at this stage.&quot;

&quot;You can deselect all by pressing the AKEY or the select button in the 3D View.&quot;

&quot;Use wireframe mode works better to get the cursor in.&quot;

&quot;To get it back in the cube: 1) Make sure you're in object mode. 2) Select the cube. 3) Object &gt; Snap &gt; Cursor to selection (cursor refers to the 3D cursor here) so it puts it right in the middle of the cube.&quot;

&quot;I think it's an essential point to note that ''in order to place the cursor inside the cube, the cube must NOT be selected''. AKEY was probably the best way to deselect the object.&quot;

&quot;If I remember correctly, undo history gets cleared when you switch between object and edit mode.&quot;

&quot;I wasted a lot of time here. ''Thank you'' to the reader who suggested (on the 3D view header) Object &gt; Snap &gt; Cursor to selection. It was the only thing that worked to get the cursor visible again and placed where clicked.&quot;

&quot;I missed the point of the exercise first time around. You can't set a 3D point on a 2D screen without technique. Orthographic views are crucial. I am just learning, but take that, at least, away from it.&quot;

&quot;Positioning the 3D cursor in othographic views always made it snap to the cube surface, making it impossible to center
precisely. Fix this by disabling &quot;Cursor Depth&quot; on the &quot;interface&quot; tab under &quot;User Preferences&quot;.

{{Hidden end}}

===More Ways to Position the Cursor===

[[File:Blender-2.5_snap_menu.png|thumb|500px]]

Here's an easy way to position the cursor at the center of an object:
# Make sure Blender is in Object Mode, with the object selected.
# Move the mouse pointer to any 3D View window.
# Snap the cursor to the selected object using either:
#* {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|S}} ''Cursor to Selected''
#: or 
#* ''Object &amp;rarr; Snap &amp;rarr; Cursor to Selected''
{{Clear}}

Here's 2 easy ways to relocate the cursor to the scene's origin (0, 0, 0):
# Move the mouse pointer to any 3D View window.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|C}} to reset the cursor to the origin.
#* Note that this also changes the view location, meaning that when you zoom in, you won't zoom in to the scene origin.
# A better way is to click ''Object &amp;rarr; Snap &amp;rarr; Cursor to Center''
#* You can also do this by {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|S}} &amp;rarr; ''Cursor to Center''.

==Changing Your Viewpoint, Part Two==

Now you'll learn some additional techniques for obtaining the view you want:
* Panning
* Centering
* Jumping to the camera's viewpoint
* Zooming in on a selected area

=== Panning ===

When you orbited the cube, the viewpoint's position and direction both changed at the same time.  You also can shift the viewpoint up-down or left-right ''without'' changing its direction.  (This is similar to the side-scrolling effect in the classic Mario and Sonic video games.)

This is called ''[[w:Panning_(camera)|panning]]'', and it's an important skill to master.  Try it now:

#Activate a 3D View window by placing the mouse pointer inside it.
#Now you can:
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Scroll}} to pan up and down.
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Num2}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Num8}} to pan up and down in small increments.
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Scroll}} to pan left and right.
#*Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Num4}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Num6}} to pan left and right in small increments.
#*Click and drag with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|MMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Alt|LMB}} to pan freely in the viewplane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You will likely find this to be a distraction in some cases. To move the viewpoint position back to the center, snap the cursor to the center, then click ''View &amp;rarr; Align View &amp;rarr; Center View to Cursor''. You could also snap the cursor to the center then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Num.}}.
&lt;br /&gt; 

In version 2.74 use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt|Home.}} to center the view to the cursor.

=== Centering ===

When you zoom or rotate the view, you always zoom or rotate around the center of the view.

To make sure everything in your scene is visible:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Home}}.

To center the view on an arbitrary point:
# Move the 3D cursor to the point of interest.
# Verify the cursor position from a second viewpoint.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Home}} to center the view.

To center the view on an object in the scene:
# Make sure Blender is in Object Mode.
# Zoom out until the object is in the viewport.
# If any objects are selected, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} (or ''Select &amp;rarr; Select/Deselect All'') to deselect them.
# Select the object of interest by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on it.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num.}} to center the view.

=== Jumping to the Camera's Viewpoint ===

To see the scene as the virtual camera sees it, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num0}}.  Afterwards, you can rotate, pan, and zoom normally, but the virtual camera will not follow.  To go back to your previous view, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num0}} again.
(In the latest versions of Blender, the virtual camera can be made to follow all the changes made in viewpoint while in camera view by checking the option &quot;Lock Camera to View&quot; on the Transform panel. Hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|N}} on your keyboard to bring the transform panel. To disable this option you can uncheck that and get back to previous settings.)

=== Zooming into a Selected Area ===

Suppose you want to get an extreme closeup of a particular area.  Because there's no center mark on the viewport, you might have to pan and zoom several times to get the desired view.

The shortcut for zooming to an area is:
# Activate a 3D view window that contains the area of interest.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|B}}.  A crosshair appears in the viewport.
# Click and drag with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to draw a rectangle around the area of interest.
# When you release {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}, the viewport will zoom in on the area you selected.

== View Navigation ==
You can also change your viewpoint in the 3D view by “walking” or “flying” through it. To activate this, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|F}}. By default in Blender 2.70, this puts you in “walk” mode, while earlier versions only offered “fly” mode. (In Blender 2.70 and later, you can choose which one you prefer in your User Preferences, under the Input tab.)

In both modes, helpful prompts appear in the header of the 3D view window to remind you of the key functions while the mode is in effect. When you have reached the position and orientation you want, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}} to end the navigation mode and stay there, or {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}} to abandon the navigation mode and be teleported immediately back to your original position and orientation.
=== Walk Mode ===
In this mode, you move the mouse to turn your view up/down/left/right, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|D}} or the corresponding arrow keys to move forward, left, back or right, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Q}} to move up or down respectively. Hold the movement keys down to keep moving; movement stops as soon as you release them. Pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} will “teleport” you close to whatever objects lie within the crosshairs at the centre of the view.

You can also use {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} to turn on gravity—make sure there is a floor or other object under you to land on! With gravity on, you can no longer use the vertical-movement keys, but you can use {{B3D:N2P/Do|V}} to make jumps. Just {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} again to turn gravity off.
=== Fly Mode ===
In this older mode, moving the mouse to change the view works the same as in Walk mode, but the above direction keys ({{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|D}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Q}} and the arrows) apply “thrust” in the respective directions, so you keep moving after releasing the key; press the key repeatedly to increase your speed in that direction, or press the key for the ''opposite'' thrust direction to reduce your speed. Also you can scroll up the mouse wheel to apply forward thrust, or scroll it down to apply backward thrust.

Your current velocity vector automatically changes direction with you when you turn. Thus, for example, you can apply a single burst of sideways thrust while facing an object, and then, without applying any further thrust, keep turning to face the object, and you will go right around it.

== Visibility Layers ==

Every object in the scene is assigned to one or more of 20 {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|visibility layers}}.

Visibility layers have many uses:
* You can put scenery, characters, particles, and lamps in different layers, to help organize your scene.
* By changing which layers are visible, you can simplify your view of the scene and work with only one or two layers at a time.
* When rendering, only visible layers are included. You can use this to render your scene layer by layer, checking each layer separately.
* You can configure lamps to illuminate only objects in the same layer.

[[Image:Layers_grid.png|thumb|right|Left: Viewing layer 1 only.&lt;br&gt;Right: Viewing all 20 layers.]]
In Object Mode, you can tell which layers are visible by looking at the twenty small boxes located in the 3D View header between the Transform Orientation menu and the &quot;Lock&quot; button.  The top row of boxes represents layers 1 through 10, with 1 being the leftmost and 10 being the rightmost.  Similarly, the bottom row of boxes represents layers 11 through 20.

{{Clear}}

=== Hotkeys ===
* To view just one of layers 1 .. 9, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|1KEY}} .. {{B3D:N2P/Do|9KEY}}.
* To view just layer 10, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|0Key}}.
* To view just one of layers 11 .. 19, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|1KEY}} .. {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|9KEY}}
* To view just layer 20, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|0KEY}}.
* To toggle the visibility of one of layers 1 .. 9 without affecting the visibility of the other layers, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|1KEY}} .. {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|9KEY}}.
* To toggle the visibility of layer 10 without affecting the visibility of the other layers, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|0KEY}}.
* To toggle the visibility of one of layers 11 .. 19 without affecting the visibility of the other layers, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|SHIFT|1KEY}} .. {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|SHIFT|9KEY}}.
* To toggle the visibility of layer 20 without affecting the visibility of the other layers, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|SHIFT|0KEY}}.
* To make all layers visible at once, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|~}}. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|~}} again to return to your previous layer visibility setting.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The hotkeys in this section ''will not work'' if you've enabled numpad emulation in the User Preferences window.  See {{B3D:N2P/Module|User Preferences Windows}} for more details.}}

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=Note to AZERTY users:}}
On the AZERTY keyboard layout, the standard number keys are the &amp;é&quot;'(-è_çà keys.  Do not use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}} unless you want to toggle visibility as explained below.
{{Hidden end}}


Holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}} while selecting a layer (by keyboard or mouse) will, instead of making only that layer visible, toggle the visibility. In this way, you can select combinations or to hide particular layers.

The key to press to select all layers at once differs by keyboard layout. It is:
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|¬'}} (the key under Esc) on UK keyboards,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|`~}} on US ones,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|ö}} on German, Swedish, Finnish and Hungarian ones,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|æ}} on Danish ones,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|ù}} on AZERTY ones,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|ø}} on Norwegian ones,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ñ}} on Spanish ones,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|&quot;}} on Brazilian Portuguese ones,
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|ò}} on Italian ones, and
* {{B3D:N2P/Do|ё}} on Russian ones.

After pressing the aforementioned key, holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}} while pressing it again will restore the visibility settings you had ''before'' you made all layers visible.

When only one layer is selected, new objects are automatically assigned to that layer.  When two or more layers are visible, new objects are assigned to the layer that became visible most recently.

== Count Your Polys ==

If you want to count the polygons in your scene, this data is available in the Info Header.

{{Template:B3D:N2P/VTT1
|image=Blender-2.5_polycount.png
|imageWidth=480px
}}

As you can see in the above image, this scene has 507 vertices and 500 faces (polygons).

So you've come to learn Blender, eh? You've made a great choice. Blender is one of the most powerful 3D animation and 3D creation tools out there, especially if you're short on cash. Learning how to use Blender can be a daunting task, so '''don't give up!''' With the help of this wikibook, you can become a Blender power user and put those Maya folks to shame.

If you ever get stuck in a tutorial for some reason, there are a number of places you can turn for help.  The best way to get help is with an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client such as [http://xchat.org X-Chat]. Connect to '''irc.freenode.net''' and talk to blender users in the following channels.

*&lt;div&gt;[irc://irc.freenode.net/blenderwiki #blenderwiki]&lt;/div&gt;
*&lt;div&gt;[irc://irc.freenode.net/blender #blender]&lt;/div&gt;
*&lt;div&gt;[irc://irc.freenode.net/blenderchat #blenderchat]&lt;/div&gt;
*&lt;div&gt;[irc://irc.freenode.net/blenderqa #blenderqa]&lt;/div&gt;
*&lt;div&gt;[irc://irc.freenode.net/gameblender #gameblender]&lt;/div&gt;

If you can't get help there, click the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top of the page that you're having trouble with, and explain your problem on that page.  Wait at least 24 hours for help.

If you're still not getting help, try asking for help in the [http://blenderartists.org/forum BlenderArtists.org forums].

'''Novial''' ([http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=nov ISO 639-3 code: nov]) is an international auxiliary language (IAL) designed by the eminent Danish linguist Professor Otto Jespersen. Of the major IALs it is the most similar to English in terms of both grammar and vocabulary, and is possibly the easiest foreign language for an English speaker to learn.

The vocabulary has been carefully selected from the words most common to English, the Romance languages (especially French) and German and to a lesser extent the Scandinavian languages. The grammar and sentence structure are based mainly on English, allowing students to advance rapidly to reading texts which are interesting in their own right.  

The texts in this course are based on an exciting Sherlock Holmes novel with supernatural undertones: ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' written by Arthur Conan Doyle and first published in serial form in the Strand Magazine in 1901-1902.
In each lesson the text is followed by a full list of new words and thorough notes on points of grammar and word formation. Exercises are then provided for students to practise and consolidate their vocabulary and sentence formation.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Beginner's Course&lt;/font&gt;==

Here are the lessons (there is also a detailed [[Novial/Hound main|List of Contents here]]):

{{quote|Novial, invented by Professor Jespersen, is really good: there is a good deal of English in it, so that it is delightfully easy to read. Besides, Professor Jespersen has common sense, which is a great advantage in a professor. Everybody can learn Novial, there is very little grammar in it; but one must be English to understand how one can get along splendidly without grammar.|George Bernard Shaw}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Population Genetics is the field of [[genetics]] which studies allele distributions and genetic variation in populations.  Population geneticists study the processes of mutation, migration, natural selection and genetic drift on populations, and in doing so are studying evolution as it occurs.

{{Editor note|Chapter or book approach: The approach of this chapter / book is to work through a series of models.  The first model will be the Hardy-Weinberg Model, and then progressively, the models will move away from the premises of Hardy-Weinberg.}}

== Foundations of Population Genetics==

Templeton states that the three premises of population genetics are the same premises for population genetics:

# Templates/DNA can replicate
# Templates/DNA can mutate and recombine
# Phenotypes emerge from the interaction of templates/DNA and environment.

===Replication of Populations===

There are three major properties that a population must maintain with replication: 
# They are composed of reproducing individuals
# They are distributed over space and time
# They host a population of genes

The first property indicates that individuals of the population must reproduce to keep the population stable.  This is necessary because individuals breakdown over time do to the introduction of entropy and inability for an individual to continuously remove the entropy added by the environment.  Thus to maintain the population, individuals must pass down their DNA, or organizational encoding, to the next generation.  Through continuous reproduction, a population can be maintained over a much longer time than the individuals that comprise it.  In addition, the continuous reproduction of over time enables for the population to have properties and components of its own.

The second property is that a population is distributed over a space.  Populations can exists as:
* small isolated groups
* a collection of groups with a varied amount of genetic exchange
* a large interbreeding population that exists over a vast space

In general though the population can be divided into a primary group that can be considered as interbreeding and a secondary group that mates occasionally with the primary group.  It is this primary group that population geneticists generally study, as it is generally stable.  They define the group as a group of interbreeding individuals that share a common system of mating.  The secondary group is generally ignored, and treated as noise in the system, unless it is having a major effect on the primary group.

The third property that must be maintained with reproduction is the population's gene pool.  The gene pool is the collection of all the genes, organizational templates, in the population that can be used to create new individuals.  By studying this gene pool, geneticists can determine the frequency of alleles, and or groups of alleles in the population and how they are changing over time.  From the patterns of result that are obtained, geneticists then can start to understand what forces are acting on the population.

===Template Mutations===

Change is a requirement of evolution and one method of introducing change is through modification of the templates used sustain the population.   In the case of living life, these templates are genes.  

Sources of Mutation:
* Insertions
* Deletions
* Single Nucleotide Substitutions (sometimes changing the protein sequences and sometimes not)
* Transpositions
* Duplications

An [[w:en:allele|allele]] is an alternate form of an template.  In the case of biological systems, an allele is a form of a gene.  Zooming further out, a version of a region of templates is called a haplotype.  Biological systems would call this a sequence of nucleotides, while a in a computer system, this would be a sequence of linked objects.

== Modeling Evolution ==

Initially we are going to consider populations with genetic architectures of two loci per template.  

=== Hardy-Weinberg Model ===

The genetic architecture of the Hardy Weinberg model is one locus, two allele model (Templeton, p. 35). 

=== Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium ===

If a population has no forces of evolution acting upon it is in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium.
Quantitatively it says that if the allele proportions of two alleles ''A'' and ''a'' are denoted ''p'' and ''q'' then the genotype proportions will be such that the homozygote AA will be of proportion p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;, the heterozygote Aa will have proportion 2pq and the homozygote aa will be of proportion q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;.

==== Testing for Hardy-Weinberg ====

To do this test you do what is known as a [[Chi Square]] test (&lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt;). Where:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \chi ^2 = \sum \frac{(observed - expected)^2}{expected} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and the degrees of freedom is no. of Genotypes - no. of Alleles
if &amp;chi; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt; &lt; table value then we accept that our population is in Hardy-Weinberg.

...note that we don't actually take a square, it is there out of tradition.

=== Concise Chisquare Table ===
&lt;table&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Degrees of Freedom&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;chi; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt; Value&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3.84&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5.99&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7.83&lt;/td&gt;      
   &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


=== Example ===
If there is a population with genotype proportions AA: 0.1 Aa: 0.4 aa: 0.5

So the allele proportions are
&lt;math&gt; p = 0.1 + \frac{1}{2} 0.4 = 0.3 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; q = 0.5 + \frac{1}{2} 0.4 = 0.7 &lt;/math&gt;

So our expected values are AA: 0.09 Aa: 0.42 aa: 0.49.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \chi ^2 = \sum \frac{(observed - expected)^2}{expected} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \chi ^2 = \frac{(0.1-0.09)^2}{0.09} + \frac{(0.4 - 0.42)^2}{0.42}+ \frac{(0.5 - 0.49)^2}{0.49} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \chi ^2 = 0.002 &lt; 3.84 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Therefore we can accept the hypothesis is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and that there are no forces of equilibrium on these alleles.

===Two Autosomal Loci, Two Allele Model===

Extending the H.W. model to two autosomal locus model with two alleles.  

For the purpose of this discussion, the first locus will have alleles ''A'' and ''a'' and the second locus will have ''B'' and ''b''.  From this we can get the following gamete types and their frequencies through recombination:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Gamate !! Frequency
|-
! AB
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-
! Ab
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! aB
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! ab
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Sum
| 1

|}

A population producing the above four gamates can produce the following genotypes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Gamates !! AB !! Ab !! aB !! ab
|-
! AB
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt; ||Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-
! Ab
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt; ||Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-
! aB
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt; ||Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-
! ab
| Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt; ||Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt; || Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt; . &lt;/sup&gt;Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-

If you analyze the table above, it can be noticed that there are only ten unique combinations.  Four combinations correspond to homozygous zygotes and the remaining six are the heterozygous zygotes.

[[Image:Population Genetics - Gamate_Mix_(4_to_10).jpg]]

Notice that the sum of Freq&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;, Freq&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt;, Freq&lt;sub&gt;aB&lt;/sub&gt;, and Freq&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; is one.  This follows from the earlier model where the sum of p and q equaled one.

====Recombination====
(this section is used to discuss how we get term ''r'')

=====Homozygous Case=====

AB/AB or ab/ab or aB/aB or Ab/Ab

=====Single Heterozygous Case=====
AB/Ab or AB/aB
aB/ab or Ab/ab

=====Double Heterozygous Case=====
AB/ab or Ab/aB

Note that recombination is only noticeable in double heterozygotes.

==== Linkage Disequilibrium====

(this section is used to discuss how we get term D)

=====Linkage disequilibrium measure, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;=====
Formally, if we define pairwise LD, we consider [[indicator variable]]s on [[allele]]s at two loci, say &lt;math&gt;I_1, I_2&lt;/math&gt;. We define the LD parameter &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; as:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta := \operatorname{cov}(I_1, I_2) = p_1 p_2 - h_{12} = h_{AB}h_{ab}-h_{Ab}h_{aB}  &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;p_1, p_2 &lt;/math&gt; denote the marginal [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] at the two loci and &lt;math&gt;h_{12}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the haplotype frequency in the joint distribution of both alleles. 
Various derivatives of this parameter have been developed. In the genetic literature the wording &quot;two alleles are in LD&quot; usually means to imply &lt;math&gt;\delta \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. Contrariwise, linkage equilibrium, denotes the case &lt;math&gt;\delta = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Pulling Information from the Model====

=====Is Evolution Occurring=====

If r &gt; 0 and D != 0 then evolution is occurring

If r = 0 or if D equals 0, then no evolution is occurring

First experiments were done in the early 30's.  German was a major scientific language before the second world war.  

Genetic drift is a function of population size N.  

The effects of genetic drift is inversely proportional to population size.  This means as the population increases, the deviation from expected allelic frequencies will decrease.  (Templeton, p. 84). 

Genetic drift is non-directional.

There is no attraction to return ancestral allele frequencies.

Genetic drift is a cumulative function.  Changes in allele frequencies from the previous generations are added to the changes that occur in the current generation.

Genetic drift is only occurs when there is variability. 

To study genetic drift this section will create a simplified model and expand upon it.  The model will just have two states, a) genetic drift is occurring and b) genetic drift is not occurring.

a-&gt;b fixation
b-&gt;a mutations causing differentiable patterns
b-&gt;a reintroduction of differentiable patterns

Genetic drift can be broken down into two simplified states to start.  The f

===Example===

In each population, 2N=32, po=qo=0.5 initially and then did 19 generations of data.  (Buri, P. 1956 &quot;Gene frequency in small populations of mutant Drosophila.  Evolution 10: 367-402

(See Figure 6.3 from Hedrick, P.W. 2005, Genetics of populations, 3rd edition.  Jones and Bartlett, Sudbury, MA)

Note that in this figure, variance is increasing, but mean allele frequency over populations is staying relatively the same.

===Simulation of Genetic Drift===

Genetic Drift can be simulated using a Monte Carlo Simulation.
(See Figure 6.2 in Hedrick)

The proportion of populations expected to go to fixation for a given allele is equal to the initial frequency of that allele  

Only the allele frequencies are changing and the distribution of the allele frequency.  The mean allele frequency over multiple replicate populations does not change due to genetic drift.

Heterzygositity or the variance of the allele frequency over the replicate population can be used to understand genetic drift.

We can calculate the number of generations necessary to reduce the reduce the heterozygostity 

t=ln(x)*-2*N, where x is how much heterozgostity is left, and N is the population size.

====Example 1====

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! !! Homozygotes!! Heterozygotes !! Sum
|-
! Observed
| 85
| 15
| 100
|-
! Expected
| 60
| 40
| 100
|}

The probability of observing these numbers is:


&lt;math&gt; P=\frac{N!}{(N_{homo,~observed}!)\cdot(N_{hetero}!)}\cdot freq(Homo_{expected})^{N_{homo,~observed}}\cdot freq(Hetero_{expected})^{N_{hetero,~observed}} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{100!}{(85!)\cdot(15!)}\cdot (0.6)^{85}\cdot (0.4)^{15}&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2====

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Genotype!! Count
|-
| Homo&lt;sub&gt;dom&lt;/sub&gt;
| 20
|-
| Hetro
| 50
|-
| Homo&lt;sub&gt;rec&lt;/sub&gt;
| 30
|}

What are the observed frequencies of p and q?

&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{2\cdot Homo_{dom}\cdot Hetero}{2\cdot N}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{2\cdot Homo_{rec}\cdot Hetero}{2\cdot N}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{2\cdot 20 \cdot 50}{2\cdot 100}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{2\cdot 30 \cdot 50}{2\cdot 100}&lt;/math&gt;

What are the expected number of genotypes?

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;freq_{homo,~dom}=p^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;N_{homo}=freq_{homo,~dom}\cdot N&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;freq_{het~}=2pq&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;N_{hetero}=freq_{hetero}\cdot N&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;freq_{homo,~rec}=q^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;N_{homo}=freq_{homo,~rec}\cdot N&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Do the observed genotypes fit H-W expectation?

&lt;math&gt;\chi^2=\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}{}\frac{observed_i-expected_i}{expected_i}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G=2\sum\limits^{i=1}_{n}observed_i \cdot \ln{\frac{observed_i}{expected_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

If χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; greater than degree of freedom, then the null hypothesis, in this case it fits H.W. can be rejected.

====Example 3 - Next Generation====

For an autosomal locus

&lt;math&gt;p_{next~generation}=homo_{dom}\cdot 1/2 \cdot(hetero)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{next~generation}=1-p_{next~generation}&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 4 - Sex Linked (1 locus, 2 allele)====

&lt;math&gt;p_{next,~male}=p_{female}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{next,~male}=q_{female}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_{next,~female}=\frac{p_{female}+p_{male}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{next,~female}=\frac{q_{female}+q_{male}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to solve for the amount of time it will take till an initial frequency is less than or equal to a particular threshold by using the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{deviation_{threshold}}{deviation_{initial}}=(-0.5)^{t}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;t=\max{}\left( \frac{\log{}\frac{deviation_{threshold}}{deviation_{initial}}}{-\log0.5}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


====Example 5 - Inbreeding - Self Pollination====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Genotype!! Count
|-
| Homo&lt;sub&gt;dom&lt;/sub&gt;
| 20
|-
| Hetro
| 50
|-
| Homo&lt;sub&gt;rec&lt;/sub&gt;
| 30
|}

Calculate F Value

&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{2\cdot homo_{dom} + hetero}{2N}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{2\cdot homo_{rec} + hetero}{2N}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Heterozygosity_{observed}=H_{o}=\frac{Hetero_{observed}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;Heterozygosity_{ expected } =H_{e} = 2pq\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;F=1-\left( \frac{H_{observed}}{H_{expected}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Chi-squared then can be calculated by:

&lt;math&gt;\chi^{2}=F^{2}N\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 6 - Inbreeding (1 Locus / 2 alleles)====

Given the frequency of the dominant allele and an F value:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Allele!! Frequency
|-
| p
| 0.6
|-
| q
| 0.4
|}


&lt;math&gt;Heterozygosity_{expected}=H_{e}=2pq\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;Heterozygosity_{observed}=H_{o}=(1-F)\cdot H_{e}&lt;/math&gt;

What sample size would be necessary to detect an effect of F=0.01 at the S% significant level?

# Look up the X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value for S% significant level (usually S = 5%)
# Use the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;N=\frac{\chi^2 }{F^2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 7 - Null Allele====

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Genotype!! Count
|-
| Homo&lt;sub&gt;dom&lt;/sub&gt;
| 20
|-
| Hetro
| 50
|-
| Homo&lt;sub&gt;rec&lt;/sub&gt;
| 30
|}

&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{2\cdot homo_{dom} + hetero}{2N}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{2\cdot homo_{rec} + hetero}{2N}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Heterozygosity_{observed}=H_{o}=\frac{Hetero_{observed}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Heterozygosity_{ expected } =H_{e} = 2pq\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_{null}=\frac{H_E-H_O}{1+H_E}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;p_{adjusted}=p \cdot (1-p_{null})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{adjusted}=q \cdot (1-p_{null})&lt;/math&gt;

What is the mean fitness of this population?

&lt;math&gt;w_{mean}=w_{rel,~homo,~dom}\cdot Homo_{dom} +w_{rel,~hetero}\cdot Hetero + w_{rel,~homo,~rec} \cdot Homo_{rec}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p = Homo_{dom} + \frac{Hetero}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q = Homo_{rec} + \frac{Hetero}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Homo_{dom,~next}=\frac{w_{rel,~homo,~dom}\cdot p^2}{w_{mean}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Hetero_{next}=\frac{w_{rel,~homo,~dom}\cdot 2pq}{w_{mean}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Homo_{rec,~next}=\frac{w_{rel,~homo,~rec}\cdot q^2}{w_{mean}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_{next} = Homo_{dom,~next} + \frac{Hetero_{next}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{next} = Homo_{rec,~next} + \frac{Hetero_{next}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = p_{next} - p\,&lt;/math&gt;

What are the equilibrium frequencies for the pf and qf alleles in females considering that heterozygotes have intermediate fitness?

&lt;math&gt;selection_{female}=s_{f}=1-fitness_{homo,~dom,~female}=1-w_{11,~f}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;selection_{male}=s_{m}=1-fitness_{homo,~dom,~male}=1-w_{11,~m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{equilibrium,~female}=\frac{s_f - 1}{s_f}+(\frac{s_m \cdot s_f - s_f - s_m + 2}{2s_f \cdot s_m})^{(1/2)}]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w_{homo,~dom}=w_{hetro}=1+\frac{s_{homo,~dom}}{1-q^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(w_{homo,~dom}-1) \cdot (1-q^2) = s_{homo,~dom}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w_{homo,~rec}=1+\frac{s_{homo,~rec}}{q^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(w_{homo,~rec}-1) \cdot (q^2) = s_{homo,~rec}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s_{homo,~rec}= (w_{homo}-1) \cdot (q^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Calculate the stable equilibrium frequency, q&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;q_e = (\frac{s_2}{s_1+s_2})^{(1/2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_e = 1-q_e\,&lt;/math&gt;

Calculate the mean fitness assuming HW equilibrium and using:

(a) current allele frequencies

&lt;math&gt;w_{mean}=w_{homo,~dom}\cdot homo_{dom}+w_{hetero}\cdot hetero + w_{homo,~rec}\cdot 

homo_{rec}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w_{mean}=w_{homo,~dom}\cdot (p)^2+w_{hetero}\cdot 2pq+ w_{homo,~rec}\cdot

&lt;math&gt;w_{mean}=w_{homo,~dom}\cdot (p_e)^2+w_{hetero}\cdot 2 p_e q_e+ w_{homo,~rec}\cdot (q_e)^2&lt;/math&gt;

(c) general formula

&lt;math&gt;w_{mean} = 1 + s_1 + s_2&lt;/math&gt;

Given initial frequencies:

(a) What are the frequencies of the S1, S2, and S3 alleles initially, and after one and two generations?

&lt;math&gt;p_1=(1/2)\cdot (P_{S_{1}S_{2}}+P_{S_{1}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_2=(1/2)\cdot (P_{S_{1}S_{2}}+P_{S_{2}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

(b) After one generation?

&lt;math&gt;P_{next,~S_{1}S_{2}}=(1/2)\cdot (1-P_{S_{1}S_{2}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{next,~S_{1}S_{3}}=(1/2)\cdot (1-P_{S_{1}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{next,~S_{2}S_{3}}=(1/2)\cdot (1-P_{S_{2}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;p_{next, ~1}=(1/2)\cdot (P_{next,~S_{1}S_{2}}+P_{next,~S_{1}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_{next, ~2}=(1/2)\cdot (P_{next,~S_{1}S_{2}}+P_{next,~S_{2}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_{next, ~3}=(1/2)\cdot (P_{next,~S_{1}S_{3}}+P_{next,~S_{2}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

(b) After two generations?

&lt;math&gt;P_{next,~S_{1}S_{2}}=(1/2)\cdot (1-P_{prev,~S_{1}S_{2}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{next,~S_{1}S_{3}}=(1/2)\cdot (1-P_{prev,~S_{1}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{next,~S_{2}S_{3}}=(1/2)\cdot (1-P_{prev,~S_{2}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;p_{next, ~1}=(1/2)\cdot (P_{next,~S_{1}S_{2}}+P_{next,~S_{1}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_{next, ~2}=(1/2)\cdot (P_{next,~S_{1}S_{2}}+P_{next,~S_{2}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_{next, ~3}=(1/2)\cdot (P_{next,~S_{1}S_{3}}+P_{next,~S_{2}S_{3}})&lt;/math&gt;

I only corrected the technical errors in the text, but I leave it to the original author (Martin Krischik) to change the title.

C. Grein

== Not finished ==

The page has not been finished - when finished converting types will only one aspect of concepts of Subtypes.

BTW: By a trick of words in the RM all types are subtypes.

== 'Class ==

ASAIK 'Class types can be cast upward and downwards and this is what I wanted to point out in the oo section of convertion. We should extend the chapter to point that out.

== Type System ==

I have renamed the page from Subtypes to Type System, because this chapter discusses more than just subtypes.  Accordingly, I have updated the link from the front page of the wikibook, but I don't know if there are any other links.

I think this chapter should become more ambitious; it should discuss:

* limited types
: I have written a few words, but I'm not happy with the placement of the new subsection, as it uses type definition before type definition is introduced. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 23:15, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
* discriminants
* numeric types with their attributes 'Valid, 'First, 'Last, 'Range
* arrays, with their attributes 'First, 'Last, 'Range
* records
* tagged types, but briefly; refer the reader to the OOP page for more details.

and I would like to merge the page Types into this one.  This page will then become ''the'' chapter about all types, subtypes, and conversions in the Wikibook; it will be suitable for printing like a good old-fashioned book chapter.

:Now that Types page has been merged to this one, shouldn't Types redirect to Type System? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:31, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

:: I marked Types for deletion, and someone made it a redirect to Type System.  I also deleted the link to Types from the main page. --[[User:Ludovic Brenta|Ludovic Brenta]] 13:42, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

::: The redirect was a better solution - otherwise some of the automated backlinks from [[Ada Programming/Types/range]], [[Ada_Programming/Types/digits]] etc. would have been broken. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:::: I made the redirect. Apart from the reason Krischik gives, a page whose content is still in the wiki should never be deleted, since change history and authors would be lost. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:23, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Ada Programming/Types/range]], [[Ada_Programming/Types/digits]] etc. ==

The last renames and merge of [[Ada_Programming/Types]] and [[Ada_Programming/Subsypes]] left the pages named above without a propper parent page. While ''Type system'' is a nicer name the hirachie might be better served by a the simple ''Types'' name.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:28, 7 July 2006 (UTC)


In fact, Type System links to these pages.  Do you think we should add make these links more prominent, e.g. by adding them to &quot;See also&quot;?

As for the name &quot;Types&quot;, I think it should at least be &quot;Types and conversions&quot;; but I think &quot;Type system&quot; is better because more general.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

[[Image:Blender simple person.png|right|thumb|Your simple person will look like this.]]
In this module, you will model a simple human figure.  Along the way, you will practice using extrusion and learn additional ways to select vertices, edges, and faces.
__TOC__
{{Clear}}

==Start a New Scene==

# Start with the default cube (''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings'') and NumLock &quot;on&quot;.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} to edit the cube.
# Scale the cube down 50% by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|.}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|5KEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.

==Selection Methods==

Just as you did for the house model, you will begin by selecting the top four vertices of the cube.  This section presents six methods for doing so.

Ease of selection depends partly on the viewport settings and viewpoint.  For greatest ease, you want a view in which the parts you are trying to select are both visible and close together.

For clarity, use a view of the cube in which all vertices are visible:
* Go to right side view with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num3}}.
* Disable the manipulator widget with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Space}}.
* Make sure the Limit selection to visible option is &quot;off&quot;.

[[File:Blender-2.5_quickie_model_stage2.png|right|thumb|450px]]
The picture on the right shows the cube with the correct vertices selected.
{{Clear}}

To begin, make sure you start in Vertex select mode.

===Border Select Tool===
The {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|border select tool}} selects things that lie in a rectangular region of the viewport.

# Activate (place the mouse pointer in) a 3D View window.
# Deselect all vertices by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}}.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Bkey}} to activate the border select tool.  Two dashed gray lines should appear, one vertical and one horizontal, forming a crosshair in the viewpoint.
# Click and drag {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} diagonally across the area you want to select.  The area will be outlined in dashed gray lines.
# When you release the mouse button, the vertices inside the rectangle will be added to the selection.

Practice selecting the top four vertices this way. If you make a mistake, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} and try again.

===Circle Select Tool===
The {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|circle select tool}} selects or deselects things that lie in a circular region of the viewport.

# Activate a 3D View window.
# Deselect all vertices by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}}.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ckey}} to activate the circle select tool. A dashed gray circle should appear. note: Prior to Blender 2.5 {{B3D:N2P/Do|Bkey}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|Bkey}} twice.

When this tool is active, you can do various things:
* To move the select area, simply move the mouse pointer.
* To resize the select area, use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Scroll}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num+}}/{{B3D:N2P/Do|Num-}}..
* To select all vertices within the circle, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.
* To deselect all vertices within the circle, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}} + {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.
* To deactivate the tool, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}.

Practice selecting the top four vertices this way. If you make a mistake, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} and try again.

===Lasso Select Tool=== 
Like many graphics programs, Blender 3D has a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|lasso select tool}}.

# Activate a 3D View window.
# Deselect all vertices by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}}.
# Click and hold {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|LMB}}.
# Drag the mouse pointer in a loop around the vertices you want to select.  As you drag, a dashed gray line will appear.
# You can deselect with lasso by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.
# Release the {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} when you're done.

===Vertex by Vertex Selection===
You can select (or deselect) vertices one by one, as you did in {{B3D:N2P/Module|Quickie Model}}.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on a vertex to make it the only selected vertex.
# Toggle the select state of additional vertices by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}}.

===Edge Select Mode===
You can select (or deselect) edges one by one, as you did in {{B3D:N2P/Module|Improving Your House}}.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the Edge select mode button in the 3D View header. 
# Select the top left edge of the cube by clicking on it with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}.
# Toggle the select state of top right edge of the cube by clicking on it with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}}.
# Switch back to Vertex select mode by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the Vertex select mode button in the 3D View header.

After you switch back to Vertex select mode, all four vertices in the two selected edges are selected.

=== Face Select Mode ===
You can select (or deselect) faces one by one, as you did in {{B3D:N2P/Module|Improving Your House}}.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the Face select mode button in the 3D View header.
# Select the top face of the cube by clicking on its center dot with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}.
# Switch back to Vertex select mode by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the Vertex select mode button in the 3D View header.

After you switch back to Vertex select mode, all four vertices in selected face are selected.

==Extruding Limbs== 

[[Image:Blender-2.5_view_menu.png|thumb|right|thumb|The view menu.]]
The illustrations in this section are in front orthographic view, so:
* Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num5}} (or ''View &amp;rarr; Orthographic'') to switch to orthographic view.
* Use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num1}} (or ''View &amp;rarr; Front'') to switch to front view.
{{Clear}}

===Region Extrusion===
#Make sure you're still in Edit Mode, with the top four vertices selected. (Only two will be visible in front ortho view.)
#Activate the extrude tool by using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ekey}} (or ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Extrude Region'').
#Move the mouse pointer upwards.  As you do, four ''new'' vertices will appear, each connected to one of the four that were previously selected.

The new vertices and their associated edges will move with the mouse pointer. You can lock them into place with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}).

===Extruding a Leg===
[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_snapping.png|right|frame]]

Suppose you want to extrude a region the same size as the default cube -- in other words, one Blender unit on a side.

# Undo your previous extrude by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Z}}.
# Activate the extrude tool again by using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ekey}} (or ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Extrude Region'').
# This time, as you're moving the extruded vertices around, hold down the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}} key.  You'll see that the new vertices will only move in multiples of a Blender unit.  This is called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|snapping}}, and it makes it easy to extrude by exactly one blender unit. The size of the snapping depends on the zoom level; if you are zoomed out a long way from the object the snapping will be done in large increments and if you are zoomed in close you can snap in finer amounts.

Continue extruding until you have five cubes of equal size stacked atop one another.  This will be one leg of your figure.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Another way to extrude by exactly one Blender unit is to press {{B3D:N2P/Do|1key}} while the tool is active.

If you press {{B3D:N2P/Do|2key}} when no tool is active, Blender will switch to the second layer, and your (first-layer) object will disappear.  To make it visible again, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|1key}}.
}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If you are not using Front Ortho view, the blender unit will be much larger than the cube.  Switching to that view will allow for the proper size, although you can manually enter the extrusion as 0.4 units.}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Don't extrude any cube more than a unit at a time.  You'll want those extra vertices, edges and faces later in this tutorial.}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If the mesh gets too big for your view, you can zoom out using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Scroll}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num-}}}}

{{Clear}}

===Extruding the Pelvis===
[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_step2.png|right|frame]]

#Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} until all vertices are deselected.
#Rotate the view (by dragging {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}) so you can see all four vertices on the right face of the top cube.
#Select those four vertices.
#Extrude twice to the right.

{{Clear}}

===Extruding the Rest of the Body===
The same trick is repeated over and over to build the rest of our simple body.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|To speed things up, you may want to switch to Face select mode.  In Face select mode, you can select a face with a single click.}}

#Create a second leg by extruding down four times from the last cube of the pelvis.
#Create the torso by extruding up five times from the middle cube of the pelvis.
#Extrude to each side from the next-to-top cube of the torso to create arms. (Making sure there are five on each side. Refer to the picture on the top of the page)

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_step3.png|Legs and Pelvis
Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_step4.png|Torso
Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_step5.png|Arms
&lt;/gallery&gt;

To be safe, remove any double vertices you may have inadvertently created:
# In Vertex select mode, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} until all vertices are selected.
# With a 3D View window active, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Wkey}} to bring up the ''Specials'' menu.
# Choose ''Remove Doubles''.

Now check your work:
# Return to Object Mode by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}}.
# Make sure the viewport draw type is Solid. (Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Zkey}} if it isn't.)
# Rotate the viewpoint and examine the body from every side (it might be useful to return to perspective view for this). 

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If any faces are missing...}}
This is easily fixed. To create a face:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} to go back into Edit Mode.
# Select four vertices.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Fkey}} (or choose ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Faces &amp;rarr; Make Edge/Face'' from the 3D View header).
* Note that you can also make edges with this tool if you select two vertices.
{{Hidden end}}

==Adding the Head==
[[File:Editmodewithhead.PNG|right|frame]]
# Move the 3D cursor to a point above the neck by clicking with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.
# Adjust the cursor position in orthographic top, front and side views ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Num7}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num1}}, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num3}} respectively) until the 3D cursor is about where the center of the head should be. It may help to use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|S}} &amp;rarr; ''Snap'' &amp;rarr; ''Cursor to Grid''.
# Make sure you're in Edit Mode with a 3D View window active. (If you create the head in Object Mode, it will be a separate object from the body, and changes to the body later in this tutorial won't affect the head.)
# Create a sphere using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|A}} &amp;rarr; ''Mesh'' &amp;rarr; ''Icosphere''.
# Leave the default settings for subdivisions and size in the bottom left of the screen. (Note: Your computer may slow down if you set subdivisions above 6)

You should now have a small sphere at the top of the body. To make it more proportional to the body, resize it using the scale tool:
# Make sure you're still in Edit Mode, with a 3D View window active and the head selected.
# If necessary change the pivot point to ''Median Point''.
# Activate the scale tool by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Skey}} (or ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Transform &amp;rarr; Scale'').
# Move the mouse pointer until the head is the size you want.

You may also adjust its position using the grab tool:
# Make sure you're still in Edit Mode, with a 3D View window active and the head selected.
# Activate the grab tool by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Gkey}} (or ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Transform &amp;rarr; Grab/Move'').
# Move the mouse pointer until the center of the head is where you want it.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If you deselect the head and then decide that you want to select it again:
# Hover the mouse pointer over any vertex/edge/face.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Lkey}}.  In Edit Mode this will select all vertices that are linked to the vertex nearest the mouse pointer.
}}

Now check your work:
[[File:Objectmodeverification.PNG|right|frame]]
# Return to Object Mode by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}}.
# Make sure the viewport draw type is Solid. (Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} if it isn't.)
# Rotate the viewpoint and examine the body from every side.  Make sure that the head connects properly to the neck.

==Save Your Work==
You will continue working on your simple person model in the next module.

To save the scene in a &lt;code&gt;.blend&lt;/code&gt; file:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ctrl}} + {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} (or select ''File &amp;rarr; Save'').
# Navigate to the directory (folder) where you want to write the file.
# Type a filename in the text box to the left of the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the &quot;Save Blender File&quot; button.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

[[File:Blender-2.5 simple person detailed.png|thumb|Your goal.]]
Few real-life objects have perfectly sharp edges.  People, in particular, consist of mainly smooth surfaces.  How does one model a smooth object using flat faces and sharp edges?

In this module, you'll learn how to smooth a mesh by using subsurfaces and smooth shading.

__TOC__

You'll need the simple person model from the previous module.  If you haven't done it, either go back and do it now or download the pre-made model from {{B3D:N2P/Web|Yosun Chang's website|www.nusoy.com/blender}}.


If the model doesn't look solid, your Viewport Shading setting may be set to Wireframe.  To switch to Solid shading:
#Activate the 3D View window.
#Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Zkey}}.

==Subsurfaces==

[[File:Blender3D-2.5properties-modifier.png|right|thumb|The sub surface modifier.]]
So far, all the meshes you've created have had sharp edges, giving them a faceted appearance like that of a cut diamond.  To model a smooth object (like a human body) you might think you'd need a huge number of vertices and faces.  {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Subsurfaces}} partly solve this problem by automatically subdividing a mesh into a finer mesh suitable for smooth rendering.  

You subsurface in Blender by adding a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|subsurf modifier}} to a pre-existing mesh object. A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|modifier}} is simply an algorithm (automatic process) which can be added to an object. (Blender modifiers are analogous to Photoshop adjustment layers.)

To get started, make sure Blender is in Object Mode, with only the simple person object selected:
#If Blender is in Edit Mode, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}}.
#To select the simple person, {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on it.

To add a subsurf modifier to the selected object:
#Click on the modifiers tab (wrench icon) in a Properties window.
#''Add Modifier &amp;rarr; Subdivision Surface''.

The object's appearance should immediately become more faceted and more rounded.  In addition, several subsurface controls will appear in the Modifiers tab.
{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The modifier has been added, but it hasn't actually been &quot;applied&quot; yet. (Applying a Blender modifier is analogous to flattening a Photoshop adjustment layer.)}}

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If a few faces don't subsurf...}}
The model may include some double vertices.  To get rid of these:
#Edit the model in Vertex select mode.
#Select all vertices.
#''Mesh → Vertices → Remove Double''
#Try again.
{{Hidden end}}

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If Blender crashes when you attempt to subsurf an object...}}
You need to look in to upgrading (or possibly even downgrading) your graphics drivers.  Having the right graphics driver can avert a lot of problems.
{{Hidden end}}

What just happened?  The default subsurf modifier (one level of Catmull-Clark) subdivided each face of the object into four smaller faces that are progressively angled.  This softened the sharp edges of the original model where faces met at 90-degree angles.

===Controls===
For this model, one level of subsurf isn't quite enough.  To increase the number of levels to two, just increase the number in the text box directly underneath ''Subdivisions''. The ''View'' setting controls the number of subdivision levels visible in the viewport. This can be very useful when you have a high-poly scene, just decrease the number of visible subdivisions to speed up viewport action.

You can specify additional levels of subsurfing to be used during renders.  For extra smooth renders, you might want three levels of subsurfing.  Set this with the ''Render'' control immediately below the ''View'' control.

The ''Apply'' button applies the modifier to the mesh. Do not click it yet; we'll be playing with the model a bit longer before we want to apply the changes. While useful with some modifiers, applying a subsurf modifier produces a very complex mesh, and there's no need to do so here.

Remember that you can undo any accidental modifications with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Zkey}}.

Blender can combine a series of modifiers by {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|stacking}} them.  For this reason, the Modifier tab includes buttons for arranging and removing modifiers.

You can hide edges created by the modifier by activating the ''Optimal Display'' toggle button.  The effect of Optimal Draw is especially clear with the Wireframe draw type.

You can edit the mesh in modified form (without actually applying the modifier) by activating the ''Apply modifier to editing cage during Editmode'' toggle button, a small button to the left of the Up/Down arrows (the arrows are for changing the position of the modifier in the stack) in the Modifier panel. [[Image:Modifier_editmode.png]]

Try this out:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} to enter Edit mode.
# Make sure Blender is in Vertex select mode.
#: Note that the vertices no longer lie on the surface of the object.
# Activate the ''Apply modifier to editing cage during Editmode'' button.
#: Now all vertices lie on the surface of the object, and you can adjust the (modified) vertices directly.  However, any additional vertices created by the modifier cannot be directly edited without applying the modifier.

You will be editing the boxy version of the simple person awhile longer, so before continuing, deactivate the ''Apply modifier to editing cage during Editmode'' button.
{{Clear}}

==Smooth Shading==
[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_detailed.png|right|thumb|400px|Your simple person after setting smooth.]]
Subsurfaces do a good job of smoothing out corners in meshes.  Even with two levels of subsurfaces, however, the simple person does not look completely smooth; when viewed close up, it has a scaly appearance.  This is because each face is {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|flat shaded}}—shaded to resemble a flat surface—resulting in sudden changes in brightness at most edges.  For a smooth object, you want {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|smooth shading}}, which smooths out the changes in brightness.

# Go to Object Mode.
# Set the draw type of a 3D View window to &quot;Solid&quot;.
# Select your subsurfed object.
# In the Toolshelf on the left, look for a caption called ''Shading''. Under it should be a button called ''Smooth''.
#: All the mesh edges will be smoothed out, leaving no sudden changes in brightness.  The faces blend smoothly into one another, making the edges nearly invisible. If the icosphere has not smoothed properly and is dimpled, enter Edit Mode by pressing  {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}}, select all vertices (A) and recalculate the normal direction (CTRL+N). This is also available in the Toolshelf under ''Normals''.
# Click the other button under ''Shading'' in the Toolshelf, named 'Flat'.
#: The edges will reappear.  Now you know the difference between Flat and Smooth.
# Since the model looks better with smooth shading, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the &quot;Smooth&quot; button again.

Note that if you didn't have subsurf enabled, then the mesh wouldn't look much different. This is because smooth shading doesn't affect the mesh shape, it just changes how the computer draws the triangles.

Smooth shading also removes a lot of definition. A good way to get rid of this is simply to add a subsurf modifier like you just did. The modifier will not only require fewer vertices, but add definition.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

In this module, you'll create a hat for your simple person.  Along the way, you'll learn how to use the Spin tool and use layers. 

__TOC__

==Creating a Generatrix==

For future convenience, you'll create the hat as a new object in the scene containing the simple person. If you haven't created the simple person, either go back and do it now or else download the pre-made model from {{B3D:N2P/Web|Yosun Chang's website|www.nusoy.com/blender}}.

Start by changing layers to layer two, then add the basis for your hat:
[[Image:Blender-2.5_layers.png|right]]
# Make sure you're in Object Mode (so that a new object will be created).
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the second little square, this will make the viewport display layer two. (The top row is for layers 1 to 10, the bottom for 11 to 20, so layer 2 is immediately to the right of layer 1; layer 6 is across the space from layer 5.)
# Go to orthographic front view by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num1}}.
# Create a mesh circle at the cursor, by activating the 3D View window, pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|shift}} + {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}}  and choosing ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Circle''.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The new circle will probably look more like a line segment than a circle.  If so, it's because you're viewing the circle edge-on.}}

The new mesh object doesn't actually have to be a circle.  You could use any sort of mesh object here because you're about to reshape it into a custom 2D mesh (called a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|generatrix}}) that describes the profile of your hat.  More precisely, the generatrix describes one side of a vertical cross-section through the hat.  You'll want your generatrix to have a slope; it should be higher on one side (which will become the top of the crown) than on the other (which will become the brim).

# The newly-created mesh should be selected.  If it isn't, select it by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on it.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} to edit the mesh.
# Activate Vertex select mode.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} until all vertices are selected.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Xkey}} to erase all vertices.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Some users are confused as to the purpose of creating the mesh only to delete it afterwards. The point of this process is to create a new &quot;blank&quot; object which you can then shape into a hat.}}

[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-SimpleHat-Profile.png|right]]
Now draw your generatrix, starting with the brim and sloping upwards toward the top of the crown:
# Make sure you're still in orthographic front view.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|RMB}} to create the first vertex.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|RMB}} to one side of that vertex to extrude another vertex, connected to the first by an edge.
(If this doesn't work, make sure you are in vertex select mode.)

Keep adding vertices until you're satisfied with the shape of your generatrix.  You can always undo using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Zkey}} or go back and adjust the positions of particular vertices using the grab tool.

The mesh is then spun around an axis perpendicular to the viewplane. You want to spin around a vertical axis, so press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num7}} to switch to top view.

==Spinning the Hat==

[[Image:Blender3DNoobToPro-SimpleHat-HatSpun.png|thumb|The spun hat, drawn as wireframe in orthographic front view.]]
Now, let's actually spin the hat:
# Move the 3D cursor to the vertex you want to spin around by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on it. You can also use the snapping tool for positioning the cursor more precisely by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift+S}} after selecting that specific vertex. ''Cursor to selected'' positions the cursor.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to select all the vertices. The Spin control only spins vertices that are selected. 
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt+R}} to activate the Spin tool.
#* The Spin tool is also available in the Tool Shelf under ''Add''&lt;br /&gt;

You should now see 90° of a generatrix! To spin your hat all the way round, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F6}} or look in the Operator Panel just below the Tool Shelf. There should be an input slider named ''Angle'', change this value from 90 to 360. There should also be a slider called ''Steps'', increase the value from 9 to 15.

If your hat has a large hole in the center, you must have accidentally moved the 3D cursor away from the vertex you picked in step 1. Try again.

Remember that if you spin an object 360° there will be a double row of vertices at the row of vertices you spun. To fix this, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to select all vertices, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} and select ''Remove Doubles''. Note that this will only work in vertex select mode.

You may also want to merge the vertices at the top of the hat. Do this by selecting all the vertices at the top with {{B3D:N2P/Do|C}} and pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|M}} &amp;rarr; ''At Center''. You may have to do this twice as some vertices might be beneath each other.

{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Hidden begin|title=If the mouse pointer changes to a question-mark (?)...}}
You have more than one 3D View window, so Blender is asking which window to perform the spin in.  
Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the window that is showing top view.
{{Hidden end}}

==Smoothing Your Hat==
[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_hat.png|thumb|400px|The finished product!]]

You'll probably have noticed that normal hats aren't usually as faceted as yours! To change this, first press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} to go back to Object mode then change the shading to ''Smooth'' (available on the Tool Shelf). If there are unexpected black marks, try recalculating the normals.
#Switch to Edit mode and open the Mesh menu in the 3D View Header. 
#''Normals &amp;rarr; Recalculate Outside''.

Next, add a Subsurf modifier to the hat and set the subdivisions to two, as you did in {{B3D:N2P/Module|Detailing Your Simple Person 1}}.
#Click on the modifiers tab (wrench icon) in a Properties window.
#''Add Modifier &amp;rarr; Subdivision Surface''.


Save your work.  You'll need this scene for the next module.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.70}}

Once you're satisfied with the shapes of individual objects, you'll want to combine them into a coherent scene.  You do this in Object Mode.

In this module, you'll learn how to use move objects to and from layers. You'll also learn how to rename and parent objects, and you'll get an introduction to Outliner Windows.

__TOC__

You'll need the person-and-hat scene from the previous module.  If you haven't done it, either go back and do it now or else download the pre-made model from {{B3D:N2P/Web|Yosun Chang's website|www.nusoy.com/blender}}.

==Adjusting an Object's Median Point==

[[Image:blender-2.5_simple_person_geometric_center.png|thumb|The person that you (yeah you!) made with the origin in his geometric center.]]

# Load the person-and-hat scene.
# Make sure Blender is in Object Mode.
# Switch to Layer 2, select the hat and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|M}}. A dialog box will pop up for you to choose which layer to move it to. Either press ''1'' (the number on top of the keyboard, '''not''' the numberpad) or select the first box in the popup.
# Select the person you made earlier.&lt;br /&gt;

Just as you did in Edit Mode, you can specify the pivot for rotating and scaling objects in Object Mode. If you just finished the previous module, the pivot is probably set to &quot;3D Cursor&quot;.  If so, change it back to &quot;Median Point&quot;.

In Edit Mode, the &quot;Median Point&quot; for pivoting is the geometric center of all selected vertices, edges, or faces.  In Object Mode, however, it's the origin of the selected object's local coordinates, indicated by an orange dot.  In other words, the origin might lie far from the object's geometric center.

You can use buttons in the Tools Shelf to reunify an object's origin with its geometric center:
#With Blender in Object Mode, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on ''Set Origin'' in the Tool Shelf (under the &quot;Edit&quot; sub menu of ''Tools'') and select ''Origin To Geometry'' (Blender 2.70: &quot;Object&quot; -&gt; &quot;Transform&quot; -&gt; &quot;Origin to Geometry&quot;) to move the selected object's origin to its geometric center (without changing the object's appearance).&lt;br /&gt;

{{B3D:N2P/Note|When more than one object is selected, Blender uses the average of their median points as the median point for pivoting.}}

This can be useful when you want a better picture of your object. With the origin set to the person's geometric center, you can now snap the object with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift+S}} to the 3D cursor. This will let you view more of the model at one time and make for a faster editing workflow.

== Positioning the Hat ==

[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_hat.png|thumb|Positioning the hat]]
Once you have the hat properly oriented, move it into position on the person's head.   The grab tool enables you to position objects in Object Mode in the same way you positioned vertices, edges, and faces in Edit Mode.
 
# Make sure Blender is in Object Mode.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the hat object to select it.
# Activate the grab tool by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Gkey}}.

As you move the mouse pointer, the hat will move around in the viewport. By default, the movement plane is perpendicular to the view axis, so the hat will move differently depending on which viewpoint you're working in.

Just as in the Edit Mode grab tool, you can:
* Restrict the direction of motion by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Xkey}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ykey}}, or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Zkey}}.  Press once to move parallel to a global axis, twice to use a local axis.  (Press the same key a third time to return to view-plane motion.)
* To restrict motion to the global X-Y plane, lock the global Z by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Zkey}}.
* Hold down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}} to restrict motion to discrete steps (typically one Blender unit).
* Hold down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}} to get finer control over the motion.
* Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}} to finalize the position and exit the tool.
* Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}} to return the object to its previous position and exit.&lt;br /&gt;

Use two different orthographic views to position the hat on the person's head. You will probably want to scale the hat to make it fit the person's head better. When you are doing this along the X or Y axis, make the changes symmetrical by specifying the axes you want scaling to be constrained to. This option is available in the Operator panel (just below the Tool Shelf) and also by pressing F6.

== Parenting the Hat to the Person ==

[[Image:Blender-2.5_parenting_objects.png|thumb|The parenting menu.]]

Once you have the hat properly sized and positioned on the person's head, you'll want it to stay there.  In order to maintain such a cozy relationship between two objects, you'd have to remember to select them both before rotating, moving, or scaling.  A drastic solution might be to join them into a single object using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|J}}.

A better compromise is to {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Parent}} the hat to the person.  Parenting creates a relationship between two objects, such that certain changes to one object (called the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Parent object}}) automatically affect the other (called the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Child object}}).  Changes to the child, however, do not affect the parent.

Note that an object can have many children, but only one parent.

Since the person is bigger than the hat, it's logical to parent the hat to the person (meaning: parent = person, child = hat) instead of vice versa.

# Make sure Blender is in Object Mode.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the hat object to select it.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}} on the person object.
#: Both the person and the hat should now be selected.  The order of selection is important here.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Pkey}} to parent the hat to the person.
# Select ''Object''. The most recently selected object becomes the parent of all other selected objects.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Pkey}} in the object mode instead of {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Pkey}} will start the Blender game engine.  To stop the game engine, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Esc}}.}}

Now when you move the hat you will see a line from the hat to the person, indicating that the person is the hat's parent.  And if you move the person, the hat will move with it.

You may get an error saying something like ''Loop to Parents'', fix this by clearing all previous parents with {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|P}}.

== Renaming Objects ==

[[Image:Blender-2.5_renaming_hat.png|thumb|The renaming dialog]]

When you have multiple objects in a scene, it helps to give each one a name.

Click on the ''Objects'' tab in the Properties panel (the one with a box icon).
# Now select the hat by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on it.
# At the very top of the tab you should see a dialog box with the name of your object
#* The hat's name might be something like &quot;Circle&quot; depending on which mesh primitive you first built the hat from.
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the dialog box and type in a more descriptive name like &quot;Hat&quot;.

You have now changed the name of the hat's object datablock.  This name change will be reflected in the Outliner, which we will look at shortly.

Now select your person by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on it and repeat the process, changing the name to something like &quot;Person&quot;.

== Outliner Windows ==

[[Image:Blender-2.5_outliner.png|thumb|The Outliner window.]]

Once you give objects names, it helps to have a way to find objects by their name and parent. This is exactly what the Outliner is for and it comes in very handy when you are working with a large scene. The Outliner is usually just above the Properties panel, you may want to pull it down a bit to see it more clearly.

You'll notice that all the objects in your scene (Person, camera etc) are listed and that you can select these objects by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on them. And if you click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on an object, a menu will pop up with options like ''Select'', ''Deselect'', ''Delete'' etc. If you select the Person and then click the &quot;+&quot; sign to its left, you will see that the Hat is listed below the person. This is because Blender lists all children objects beneath their parents.

On the right of each object there are a series of icons which represent the state of the object. For example, the eye icon means that your object is visible in the 3D viewport. You can turn off its visibility by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the eye, which will turn grey; click again on the eye to make it visible. If you hover the mouse over the icons a text box will pop up with a description of what that particular icon does.

== Good on ya' mate! ==

Congratulations!! You have now finished your simple character. Pat yourself on the back, and have a celebratory coffee! (Or pop!)&lt;br /&gt;

== Blender 2.36 HotKeys ==

Ok, I converted this Hotkeys from official [http://www.blender.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=documentation&amp;file=index Blender PDF] file. Please use official Hotkeys names in your articles! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 14:21, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

== The name of this page ==

Shouldn't it be &quot;'''Modeling''' Hot Keys&quot;?  To distinguish between modeling hot keys and other hot keys?  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 20:21, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

: What do you mean? This HotKeys aren't just about modeling. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 09:35, 6 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Hmmm... good point.  I figured we'd have a hotkeys page for modeling, and separate pages for hotkeys for other things, such as animation, etc.  If we're going to have one master page for hotkeys, it should be moved out of the modeling section.  Having a page full of hotkeys that are not specific to modeling should not be in the modeling section.  But here's another thought.  Maybe we don't do the hotkeys page at all, because I have planned (though I've done nothing about it yet) to create a keyboard shortcuts Blender reference here [[Blender_3D:_Hotkeys_Reference]].  We could then link to the appropriate sections of the hotkey book from the noob to pro book for the user to look over.  What do you think?  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:30, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

: Probably is good to have somewhere all collected HotKeys, but if you need specific HotKeys for sections then just make proper link name and copy right part from collected HotKeys... Maybe this collected HotKeys need to be WikiBook on it's own: [[Blender 3D: Hotkeys]]. What do you think? --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 09:47, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:: I agree, let's create a hotkeys wikibook, either called [[Blender_3D:_Hotkeys_Reference]] or [[Blender 3D: Hotkeys]].  Lets make sure we link to it via the [[Blender_3D]] page.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:13, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

: Ok, did it. Blender HotKeys is official Blender name so I have put it under [[Blender 3D: Hotkeys]], now you can cut and move this page, because I don't how you will name it now. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 18:51, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

== Confusing &quot;key&quot; names ==

Formatting of &quot;keys&quot; is confusing when initially coming to this documentation. 
RMB = Right mouse button
MMB = Left
LMB = Middle
When you see these in the middle of documentation there is no context to flag them as &quot;keys&quot; and therefore it is confusing. Even on the &quot;keys&quot; page it is initially confusing because the average user isn't going to understand mouse buttons as &quot;keys&quot;.

Not as confusing is the inconsistency in documenting letter keys:
When a single letter is the &quot;key&quot; it is documented as  &quot;LetterKEY&quot;. When a combination of keys are pressed its labeled as &quot;Key + Letter&quot;.</text>

==Ingredients==
*1 small [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] pinch, to taste
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]] pinch, to taste
*[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]] tablespoon or so, to taste

==Procedure==
#Clean your pumpkin well, being careful to remove manure, dirt, etc. Chop off the stem.
#Cook the cleaned pumpkin in a 375 °F oven for approx 45 minutes per 250g. A small pumpkin of less than 500g works best. 
#Remove pumpkin and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes.
#During this time, take out sea salt, butter, and your pepper mill.
#Chop pumpkin in half with cleaver, butcher knife, or kitchen hatchet.
#Remove seeds and guts; roast seeds and discard the rest.
#Separate the skin from the flesh.
#Place hot pumpkin flesh in a food processor, along with salt, pepper, and butter to taste.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*If pumpkin is not soft when removed from oven, place back in for 10-15 minutes each time.
*An alternative if you have no food processor is to mash the pumpkin flesh by hand until nearly smooth.

:No - there will be no stoning here. :) --[[User:maveric149|mav]]

Some of these points (not all) contain list of options that people might express support for.
So I listed my support for some.
I also listed support from mav and Karl for options that they themselves proposed, but since I don't speak for them, these votes should not be construed as correct until they corroborate them here:
* mav: Y (I agree with Toby's changes)
* Karl: Y/N
Finally, although I've listed my support for various options, I do not in any way mean to stifle further discussion, and I expect people to revise their selections over time.
Nor do I support making final decisions by ''counting the votes'' and interpreting those data statistically (say, by applying [[en:approval voting|approval voting]]), unless consensus is reached that we'll need to do such a thing.

Suggestions go here?

Is it possible to be able to print a whole chapter at a time?  From my own experiences of doing tutorials on the web, I like to have a hard copy to read &quot;on the road&quot; but hate having to waste paper and ink to print the same header information multiple times and sometimes have a page almost completely blank except for a single paragraph.

The option to &quot;Print this article only | Print whole chapter&quot; would be good, and articles should flow on from one another without pagebreaks between them.

Any thoughts?

[[User:Neolux|Neolux]] 15:17 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:Advanced printing options would be very useful. Oh, BTW, the Wikibooks project works with modules, not articles. Somebody needs to update the interface... --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 01:05 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)

==Manuals vs. Textbooks?==

Hi, I was planning on converting the manual for one of my free software projects (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/mpb/) into a wiki, and someone suggested Wikibooks to me.  However, I'm confused over whether Wikibooks is appropriate for my purpose.

The front page used to say &quot;textbooks, manuals, articles and other texts&quot;.  Now it says only &quot;textbooks and classroom texts&quot;.  On the other hand, Wikibooks already contains &quot;books&quot; on lots of things, like OsiriX and Vi, that look awfully like manuals to me.

The [[Textbook planning]] page says that manuals &quot;Should be textbook-oriented in presentation.&quot;  This confuses me.  Can you give me an example of a manual that is ''not'' &quot;textbook-oriented&quot;?

If you simply mean that the manual should be long, well-written, and contain tutorials as well as bare-bones reference materials, then I would suggest that this is equivalent to saying &quot;the manual should be good.&quot; Being good is, of course, a goal for all manuals and texts, and one they will hopefully attain in time on a wiki.

Can you please clarify?  This is in the [[Help:FAQ/Contributing#I_.28and_a_community.29_have_created_a_open_source_software._We_want_to_write_the_documentation.2C_user_help_and_etc_with_wiki._Could_I_do_it_in_wikibooks.2C_or_should_I_install_a_wiki_in_my_own_website.3F|FAQ]], but it only says &quot;no answer yet&quot;.

==Comments on proposal to increase user and contributions==

IMHO, here are some reasons why Wikibooks is not more successfull. First, I agree on all points of the main page. Second, I think that those points are importants:
* Books are not like encyclopedia articles ([[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Attracting_contributors_to_a_textbook%3A_Differences_from_the_.27pedia]]). It is much more easier to contribute on a Wikipedia article then to write a book. Writing a book requires deep knowledge of the target field, as well as a good writing style and a lot of time.
* Authorship ([[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Author_page_in_Books.3F]]). Scientists and teachers should be the primary source of textbooks contributors. Unfortunatly, often, scientists are judged from the number of publications they produce. It is thus very important to keep track of who did what. It could be cool to have wikimedia's engine giving stats on pages, such has the actual and the total content each contributor has edited, both in absolute and in percentage. This would help to cite the authors correctly.

=== Additional comments on Wikibooks success ===

While I will admit that Wikibooks doesn't have quite the same impact that Wikipedia has had, it certainly is doing better than Wikispecies or some of the truly failed projects that have occured.

I have also noticed a significant increase in activity lately, although it does come in fits and starts.  One of the things is that each book seems to be an independent &quot;wikipedia&quot; of its own, and seems to form its own separate community.

I don't think that is a bad thing either.

As pointed out above, books require a slightly different mindset than simply writing a few things down like a typical wikipedia article.  You need to spend a little more time trying to research out the content of modules, and more importantly, try to keep a vision of how the whole book is going to come together.  It is this holistic view of modules that distinguishes Wikibooks from Wikipedia.

Growing pains will happen here with Wikibooks, and I think that some truly remarkable things will come from this project.

== Standard for WikiBooks ==

Hi, I would suggest to set up a page that provides guidelines for WikiBooks. Particularly, I'd suggest, that all pages belonging to a book should start with &quot;bookname:...&quot; so that they are easily recognized as part of the book. This policy is already beeing used in many books, like [[Cookbook]], [[Wiki Science]], etc..., but there should be a page for setting up new books, that mentiones this. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 15:12, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Separate column==
I just had a suggestion for this page: I thought it would be nice to have the annotations done in a separate column, as is often done in textbooks. I know the markup for this would be pretty hard to do nicely, and it wouldn't print very well, so there are some cons to this idea as well. Anyway, thanks! -[[User:Deicidus|Deicidus]] 03:30, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I agree -- the text is very difficult to read as it is, especially on high-res screens, where the text goes a lot further to the right before wrapping around. --[[User:Buggi22|Buggi22]] 17:39, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::Seems like the markup shouldn't be that difficult to implement as a template in a way that makes it quick and easy for editors to use. Here's the beginnings of [[Template:Annotation right|one attempt]], which just floats the annotation to the right in a 25%-width box. - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] 17:00, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

==Copyright==
This is a published document of the United States Government (not the Constitution itself, but the annotations and commentary).  Does it have copyright restrictions? [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 17:55, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

::Nothing the US Government produces has ANY Copyright, EXCEPT in the case of Commercial Use, and the only caveat there is the fact that you have to get the specific department's permission to make money off their production. The reasoning behind this system is the fact that all US Government productions are prepared making use of Federal Tax Money, which comes from the People. Thus, the people of the USA paid for the manufacture, publish, etc., of whatever it is the Government has made, and therefore they already own it, and should not have to pay twice for their right to make use of it. When you buy something that contains material produced by the US Government, and it is in a cover, say, with a new introduction by the person preparint the new publication, he can only copyright the work he did preparing the covfer and the introduction. He can't squawk if someone makes use of the original material from his publication, but he can squawk if you copy the whole shebang to make it look like he prepared it. - [[User:CORNELIUSSEON|CORNELIUSSEON]] 00:36, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikisource ==

If this is a document originally published by the US Gov its probably better off at Wikisource. Wikibooks is for developing original material. --[[User:75.65.208.142|75.65.208.142]] 06:48, 10 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Stock''', '''broth''' or '''bouillon''' is used as the basis for most soups, and in many dishes as a flavouring or base (e.g. [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]]). Stock is made by cooking ingredients such as meat, poultry, fish or vegetables in water to flavor the water. The ingredients are removed at the end. Because the flavour of the ingredients is the only thing that matters, stock is often made with left over-ingredients and by-products such as bones, that couldn't be used elsewhere.

Stock can be made with a stock cube or extract, but for best results, make your own. If you cannot, a jar of fond (condensed stock) is the next best thing.

== Vegetable Stock == 

This article starts with vegetable stock because most non-vegetarian stocks will use some amount of vegetables as well, to add depth to the flavor, so this information is useful for all stocks. Home-made vegetable stock will have a relatively weak flavor, but a strong aroma.

The basic ingredients for a vegetable stock are [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]], and [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]. It is perfectly possible to make a good stock without any of these, but they are the classic 'backbone' of making stock and almost all vegetable stocks will contain at least two. Other ideas for vegetables are:
* [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
* [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]]. Be careful, fennel can easily overpower a stock.
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
* any kind of [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]] will greatly enhance the aroma and flavor.
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

Keep the following in mind when choosing ingredients:
* Do not use [[Cookbook:Beet|beet]] roots, because they will turn your stock black.

About 750 grams/26 ounces of vegetables per liter of stock should suffice. 

To 'round off' the flavour of the stock some [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] and [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] are usually added. Some of these will dissolve (like [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]), for others it's best to create a little 'bag' - for example by wrapping the herbs in a leek-leaf with a bit of string - so you can easily fish them out later. Such a bag is called a 'bouquet garni'. Some good herbs to use are:
* [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]] (about 3 per liter of stock)
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]] (about 6 per liter of stock)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (a pinch, you can add salt to taste later, this is essential for most stocks)
* [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]
* [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]

Preparing stock is as simple as putting the ingredients in a pot (preferably large and thick, like a Dutch oven). Pouring over cold water (it needs to be cold). Bringing the water to a simmer and waiting anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how much stock you're making, and how strong you want it to be. Do not let vegetables simmer for more than an hour or the flavour will become wilted and sour.
Some additional notes:
* Do not chop your ingredients too finely. Just halve or quarter them, so the water can reach the inside of the vegetable as well as the outside.
* Put the peels of onion and garlic in the stock as well. This will help with the color of the stock.
* It's a very good idea, especially with vegetable stock, to caramelize your ingredients first. This can be done by pan frying them lightly in oil or butter, until they turn brown, but the oil will coat the ingredients, which will keep the water out and you'll have to defat the stock later to get the fat out again (if you want a perfect stock). The best way to caramelize your ingredients is to put them in the oven, on a tray, until they start to brown.

The stock should be tasted to see if it's ready. When it is, pass it through a sieve to get rid of the large ingredients. If the sieved stock isn't clear yet, put a ''wet'' tea towel in the sieve (or a cheesecloth if you have one) and pass the stock through it again. Instructions for clarifying the stock further and getting rid of the fat are given below.

== Fish ==
Fish stock should generally be made using &quot;white&quot; fish bones like haddock, flounder, cod or snapper, although some Japanese recipes use tuna or similar species for a highly flavored specialized stock.
Shellfish stock is generally made the same way as fish stock.
Combine fish bones or shellfish shells with cold water to cover and add some diced mirepoix (carrots, celery and onion).  Bring to a simmer, skimming as necessary and simmer for 40 minutes.  Strain the stock and cool it.  There are many options:
*  Sweat (cook in hot oil and/or butter without browning, often covered) the bones or shells and mirepoix before adding the cold water. This is called fish &quot;fumet&quot;.
*  Replace part of the water with dry white wine or vintage dry cider.
*  Use white mirepoix (no carrots, add white part of leeks, mushroom trimmings and, optionally, parsnips)
*  Add aromatics such as herbs and spices (thyme, bay leaf, peppercorn, parsley stems).  These may be added directly to the stock or tied in a cheesecloth (known as sachet d'épices).  Add any other aromatics to impart a particular flavor.
*  Salt is usually necessary, add toward or at the end, to taste

== Poultry ==

Here's the basic method for [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] stock, which you can adapt for other poultry.

After you've eaten a chicken, don't throw away the carcass. Put it in a pressure cooker or a large saucepan, and add enough cold water to cover. Add some fresh herbs (basically, whatever is to hand, and whatever you like, but I tend to use [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]] and [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], because they're always in the garden) maybe a roughly chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], a [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and a stick of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]], and bring to the boil. Pan drippings are very good to add, as long as they are not too burned.

If you use a pressure cooker cook at pressure for 30-40 minutes, in a saucepan let the stock [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] very gently for at least three hours (but no longer than four lest the bones cloud the stock and overpower the flavour). Drain the liquid through a sieve into another pan. You can use the stock immediately, or cool it as quickly as possible (stand the pan in a bowl of cold water) and refrigerate or freeze it.

A pressure cooker is ideal for stock making - the cooking time comes down from several hours to about 30-40 minutes, with considerable saving of time and energy (= less carbon emissions).

==Meat ==

Beef, mutton and pork broths are made by slowly simmering meat (do not remove gristle - it contains collagen) with vegetables and flavourings. Do not add salt at this stage, it should only be added when the stock is being used in a recipe. Use cold water and warm slowly - this prevents the meat from sealing.

If bones are used in stock they may be roasted and cracked before simmering.

In a pressure cooker broth takes 45-60 minutes, stock with bones 75-120 minutes. If an open pan is used the liquid should barely be moving, and certainly not boiling fast, and times of several hours for broth and 7-10 hours for bone stock are not excessive.

== Defatting and Clarifying ==

To get most of the fat out of a stock, you can simply chill it. The fat will harden and float on top of the stock where it can be scooped off easily. One can also use a fat separator, which is like a big measuring cup with a siphon from the bottom, which allows you to pour the stock out while trapping the fat.

To completely clarify stock, use the following method:
* Beat egg whites to soft peaks, one for each quart/liter of stock.
* Crumple the eggs-shells and mix them through the egg whites.
* Stir the mixture in to the stock and bring it to a simmer, do not let it boil. The egg-whites will coagulate, rise, and take any particles and cloudiness out of the stock.
* Keep a close eye on the simmer (push the coagulated egg-whites to the side a bit to see) and let it simmer for about ten minutes.
* Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for another ten minutes.
* Finally, sieve the stock again through a tea towel.

== Fond and Consommé ==

A fond is made by reducing a stock down (gently, stocks shouldn't boil) to  about half of its original volume. Fonds can be used as a basis for sauces, or simply to facilitate storage, and turned in to stock again by adding water.

A consommé is made by flavouring stock again with more ingredients and condensing it greatly. Consommé is almost always made with meat. It will usually become gelatinous in substance, because of the collagen in the meat.

== Storage ==

Stock will keep for about a week in the refrigerator. Frozen stock will keep for around six months.

== Notes, Tips and Variations ==

* A note on terminology: Stock is the result of cooking bones, or bones with meat, with water. Broth and Bouillon are the result of cooking any food-items with water to obtain a flavoured liquid. This distinction, however, is rarely made any more, and the terms are often used interchangeably.
* Though mushrooms are good for enriching a stock, it is also possible to make the mushroom the main or even the only ingredient of a stock. For this you would need about 200 grams/0.4 lb of mushrooms and an onion per liter of stock.

Excerpt from Homepage [http://libre.act-europe.fr/polyorb].

[[wikipedia:PolyORB|PolyORB]] aims at providing a uniform solution to build distributed applications; relying either on industrial-strength middleware standards such as [[wikipedia:CORBA|CORBA]], the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-E.html Distributed System Annex of Ada 95], distribution programming paradigms such as Web Services, Message Oriented Middleware (MOM), or to implement application-specific middleware.

== Sample Code ==

If you are interested in some samples look over at the [[Programming:CORBA]] wikibook.

== Compile and Install PolyORB ==

First you should read the INSTALL file which is provided with PolyORB. Most informations needed for compiling PolyORB are contained there.

== Linux ==

TODO

== Windows ==

=== Preconditions ===

==== MinGW ====

You will need to [http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml download] and install a complete set of [http://www.mingw.org MinGW] tools. Including a [http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=409091 current] version of the GNAT compiler.

Refer to [[Ada Programming/Installing|Installing]] chapter so see how to [[Ada Programming/Installing#MinGW|install MinGW]].

==== Python ====

You need to [http://www.python.org/windows/ download] and install a version of [http://www.python.org Python].

==== XML/Ada ====

To use all functionality you should also install [[Ada Programming/Libraries/IO/XML/Ada|XML/Ada]]

=== Pitfalls ===

==== Release Version ====

There is a bug in the makefiles of the release 1.1r &lt;small&gt;(incorrect use of '/' and '\' in filenames)&lt;/small&gt; so this version will not compile with Windows.

==== FIND.EXE ====

The configure script needs the GNU find utility. The problem is that there is a find utility in &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32&lt;/code&gt; as well. You have to make sure that configure will use the right version of &lt;code&gt;FIND.EXE&lt;/code&gt; by making a local change to your &lt;var&gt;PATH&lt;/var&gt; environment variable. It is not a good idea to make that change in your Windows setup.

==== Shared Library Support ====

Shared library support is much used from the team as static library. So if you compile from cvs you might be better off without &lt;code&gt;--enable-shared&lt;/code&gt;.

__NOTOC__
This is a recipe I like to make on the weekend and bring to work with me during the week. I've also prepared it for friends and family when I want to entertain on a budget (you can feed 5 or 6 people for less than ten dollars!). People consistently ask me for the recipe, which is one I've modified from my family's cajun beans and rice recipe to make it vegan, so I thought it would be a good idea to add to the cookbook.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 package (16 oz.) dry beans (kidney or black beans preferred)
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 green pepper, chopped
* 1 celery stalk, sliced thin
* 1 bulb garlic, minced
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp. cumin
* 1 tsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. basil
* olive oil
* salt and pepper, to taste
* optional, 1-2 whole dried or fresh hot peppers
* 1-2 cups rice

== Procedure ==
=== Beans ===
#Soak beans overnight, or, bring to a boil and let sit for one hour.
#In a Dutch oven or large pot, sauté onions and garlic in olive oil on medium heat until onions are translucent.
#Add green pepper and celery, and sauté for a few minutes more.
#Add beans and enough water to cover all ingredients.
#Add spices, bring to a boil, then lower heat and cover, stirring occasionally until done, (1-2 hours, depending on the age of your beans).

=== Rice ===
#Add rice and twice as much water to pot. (i.e. 1 cup rice =2 cups water, 1 1/2 cups rice = 3 cups water)
#Bring to a rolling boil until the water has boiled down to the level of the rice.
#Reduce heat to a light simmer and cover for 20 min.

Serve the beans over the rice and enjoy!!! Also very tasty with cornbread.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
*Use canned beans instead of dry. (greatly reduces cooking time, but doesn't allow for the flavor to soak into the beans as well.)
*Use a crockpot.
**Sauté vegetables in a skillet, then add all ingredients (except rice) to the crockpot before you leave for work, go to school, whatever. When you come home it's ready!

'''Dredging''' - Coat with dry ingredients.  An example of this is [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] on [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]. Dipping the ingredient in milk before dredging is a good way to improve the way the dry coating(s) stick to the ingredient being dredged.

'''Creaming''' combines sugar with solid fat.  The sugar's sharp particles cut into the butter, introducing air bubbles.  It is the most important step for cookies and cakes because it allows them to rise.

== By Hand ==
#Fill a large bowl to half volume with hot water from the tap.  Use a smaller bowl to hold butter, and sugar.  
#Put the smaller bowl into the large one and let butter soften for a minute, mixing constantly with a wooden spoon.  Do not allow the butter to melt. After the mixture seems easier to mix, remove the smaller bowl and empty the larger bowl.  
#Fill the larger bowl with cold water until the outside of the bowl is cold.  
#Put the bowls back together, and beat with the wooden spoon until the mixture has changed colour and texture.

:''Tip: Wrap a wet towel around the base of the larger bowl when stirring to stop it from moving. ''

== Mechanical ==

Use hand beaters to soften the butter first on low, then increase to medium.  Add in sugar, eggs, and vanilla or cream of tartar in this order.  Scrape the sides often.  Beat until the mixture has changed colour and texture (don't overbeat!)

Quechua doesn't have the same vowels as in Spanish!
The best book for Anglophones is &quot;The language of the Inka&quot; from Bruce Mannheim.

Quechua has rather many allophones.
The basic Phonemes are:

i =  like /I/  more like the y in posh brittish lovely
u = like the u in put, but longer.
a = like in arab. somewhat like the a in brittisch 'man' 

when in contact with uvular sounds, there is change:

i = E like in american english 'get' 
u = O like in french bonne, or New yorkish: Boss
a = A like in father



Linacha, i presume it was you who put in &quot;Ayqey - to escape&quot;, i took that out and replaced it with &quot;Ayqena&quot;, because i am trying to keep all of the examples as nouns, since they are the most basic part of speech. Do you think that is a good idea or not? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 03:29, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== IPA ==

all of the IPA symbols are currently uploaded to [[w:wikipedia|wikipedia]], so when i have the time i will make a copy of them on commons, and then put them into the table. Also, i think that a paragraph or two is required to introduce the concept of phonetics, the IPA, X-SAMPA and to say, that while it may be useful you dont need to know these things for the course. I think quite a bit of that could be copied from the wikipedia articles on [[w:Phonetics|Phonetics]], [[w:IPA|the IPA]] and [[w:X-SAMPA|X-SAMPA]]. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 05:20, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==Consonents==
I think we really need to put in some of the information about aspirated and glottalized consonents, possibly starting with what's below.
[[User:dannya222|dannya222]] 00:12, 04 May 2005 (UTC)

These freaking consonents are confusing the hell out of me, due to conflicting sources. My sources are: http://www.zompist.com/quechua.html http://www.omniglot.com/writing/quechua.htm and the lonely planet quechua phrasebook. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 05:20, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:The quechua consonant system has a fairly regular structure and it shouldn't be difficult to grasp if properly explained. I'm reordering the chart and adding the missing consonants to make things clear. I'm also correcting the vowel part: there aren't five basic vowels, just three (as reflected in the orthography devised by linguists), because [e] and [o] are merely allophonic, that is, they are not used to distinguish words, which means if you pronounce [i] and [u] before [q] the word is unchanged, although it won't sound as &quot;natural&quot; to native speakers to pronounce it that way. Including them as &quot;basic vowel sounds&quot; is like saying that in English there are two basic t sounds: the one in &quot;take&quot; (aspirated [t_h]) and the one in &quot;stake&quot; (unaspirated [t]). Of course, there is just one ''phone'''m'''ic'' t in English, regardless of how many ''phone'''t'''ic'' allophones it features. The choice between phonetic [t_h]/[t] in English is determined purely by the phonetic environment and if you pronounce a [t_h] in &quot;stake&quot; or a [t] in &quot;take&quot; the word is unchanged, although it won't sound as &quot;natural&quot; to native speakers, just like the choice between [i]/[e] and between [u]/[o] in Quechua. Note that in Quechua those two types of t sound (aspirated [t_h] and unaspirated [t]) are considered completely different consonants and if you use one instead of the other the word '''''is''''' changed, that is, those two sounds belong to different consonant phonemes in Quechua, unlike in English (viceversa, a word is changed in English if you use [i] instead of [e] or [u] instead of [o], because those sounds belong to different vowel phonemes in English, unlike in Quechua). [[User:Uaxuctum|Uaxuctum]] 00:12, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== /q/ or /x/? ==

The current module says that the IPA /q/ / Quechua &lt;q&gt; is pronounced as in the Scottish Lo'''ch'''. The last time I checked, &lt;loch&gt; is pronounced /lɒx/, not */lɒq/. [[User:Mga|Mga]] 04:23, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

:It's both right and wrong. In Quechua, the sounds fricative velar [x] and uvular [X] are merely positional allophones of the corresponding plosives (/k/ and /q/). [[User:Uaxuctum|Uaxuctum]] 20:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

| Notes:
|-
| 1. the letters ι, α, and υ  can represent short and long vowels.
|-
| 2. This is called a gamma nasal. (e.g. αγγελος)
|- 
| 3. the letters ξ, ζ, and ψ all represent double consonant sounds (ks, zd, ps).
|-
| 4. While many pronounce these characters according to the English sounds &quot;th&quot; (as in ''this'') and &quot;ph&quot; (as in ''photo''), scholars suggest that this is not the correct ancient pronunciation. This is due to a contraction that occurs in Coptic, a language closely related to Greek. Coptic, unlike Greek, has a letter that corresponds to the English letter &quot;H&quot;, which is ϩ or ''hori'' (Greek only has the rough breathing mark). When one word ends with either τ, π, or κ, and the word directly following begins with ϩ , the last letter of the first word will often contract with the first letter of the second word, resulting in θ, φ, and χ, respectively (e.g. πετ ϩοογ &gt;&gt; πε''θ''οογ). While this affected the spelling it did not affect pronunciation, resulting in two pronounced sounds (t-h, p-h, k-h). The following &quot;H&quot; sound is called aspiration, see the section on Aspirates below. 
|-
| 5. the letter σ is written ς at the end of words, e.g. βασις (but ΒΑΣΙΣ). In some texts, the letter is written like an English c (this form is called ''lunate''). 
|}

=== Breathing Marks ===
More important than accents are the breathing marks. Breathings normally occur only at the beginning of a word, though they will, at times, be present in the middle - where two words have been joined together. Greek has two types of breathing, the smooth breathing, ᾿, and the rough breathing, ῾. Unlike accents, these are quite important, and you should try to learn them. A word that begins with a rough breathing on a vowel should be pronounced with an 'h'. So the Greek word ὅρος, meaning 'boundary', should be read 'horos', while ὄρος, a mountain, should be read 'oros'. Be careful never to confuse breathings with quotation marks or accents; when you write or quote Greek, the breathings should look like half-rings to clearly distinguish them from other marks. When rho occurs at the beginning of a word, it too takes a rough breathing mark and is transliterated ''rh'', whereas when two rhos occur consecutively, the first takes a smooth breathing and the second a rough, although these breathing marks are not always indicated. Whenever upsilon occurs at the beginning of a word, it takes a rough breathing, except in the name of the letter itself. As with accent marks, breathing marks are written on the second of the two characters of a diphthong. Accents and breathings are often written to the left of capital letters: Ἇ for ἇ.

=== Vowel length ===
In Ancient Greek, vowels may be long or short. The vowels ε and ο are always short, whereas η and ω are always long. The vowels α, ι, and υ, on the other hand, may be either short or long. It is often taught in grade school that, ''e.g.'', the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;rat&quot; is short, whereas the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;rate&quot; is long. This is not at all like vowel length in Ancient Greek. In Ancient Greek, a long vowel is literally &quot;longer&quot; than a short vowel, that is, its sound lasts for twice as long as the sound of a short vowel. Originally, this was the only difference between short and long vowels, but as the language evolved, the short and long vowels began to differ not only in quantity (length) but also in quality (kind).

It is not always possible to tell whether an alpha, iota, or upsilon is short or long. In dictionaries and textbooks, as here, long alphas, iotas, and upsilons are marked with a macron (¯), whereas short vowels are usually unmarked, but occasionally marked with a breve (˘). If an alpha, iota, or upsilon takes a circumflex, one may conclude that it is definitely long (see the following section), so it is not marked with a macron. If an alpha, iota, or upsilon takes an acute or a grave and it is long, there are typographic difficulties and thus it might not carry a macron even though it is supposed to (although one might occasionally see an attempt, ''e.g.'', ἀγορᾱ́, which might not render correctly in your browser).

In practice, alpha, iota, and upsilon are usually short in the word stems of Classical Greek (although the same might not be true of all Ancient Greek dialects); most long alphas in Classical Greek occur in grammatical endings, which makes it easier for the learner to remember which vowels are short and which are long. Developing a habit of pronouncing Ancient Greek words, in reading and in memorization, with full attention to vowel length, will aid the learner in remembering vowel length as well.

=== Diphthongs ===
{| 
| Greek Diphthong||IPA (Homeric)||IPA (Classical)||English
|- 
| αι||[aι]||[aι]||''eye''
|- 
| ᾳ||[a:ι]||[ɑ:]||—
|- 
| ει||[eι]||[e:]||h''ay''
|- 
| ῃ||[a:ι]||[ε:]||h''ay''/h''ai''r
|- 
| οι||[οι]||[οι]||b''oy''
|- 
| ῳ||[o:ι]||[ɔ:]||—
|- 
| αυ||[aʊ]||[ɑʊ]||l''ou''d
|- 
| ευ||[eʊ]||[ju:]||—/''you''
|- 
| ηυ||[ɑ:ʊ]||[ε:ʊ]||—
|- 
| ου||[u:]||[ο:]||s''oo''n
|}
Notice the short line under the long vowels α, η, ω in three instances: this is the iota subscript. It indicates that there was originally an iota after the vowel, i.e. ῳ = ωι. Some texts simply print an iota after the vowel: this is known as an iota adscript, and some texts mix the two, using a subscript with lowercase letters, and an adscript for capitals (Ωιομην for ῳομην). By Classical times, these had become monophthongs (one vowel sound) equivalent to their non-iotized counterparts, and can simply be pronounced as such. Note that when alpha takes the iota subscript, one can infer that the alpha was originally long, whereas the diphthong αι is formed from short alpha.

=== Diaeresis ===
The diaeresis, ¨, is not strictly an accent, nor is it an umlaut, as used in German. It is mainly found on iotas to indicate that the letter should be pronounced separately from the vowel before it. For example, Verdi's opera Aïda is not pronounced 'eye-da', but 'a-yee-da'. Likewise, whereas αι is a diphthong, αϊ is two separate vowels.

=== Aspirates ===
The letters θ, φ, χ are not fricatives: they are not the same as the sounds th, f, ch in ''th''in, ''f''oot, and lo''ch'' (although these are the sounds they have become in Modern Greek). These letters have hard sounds, but are pronounced with an exhalation, like an ''h'' sound. Listen hard to your voice when you pronounce the examples above: you'll find that there is a difference between the ''p'' in ''pot'' and in ''spot''. Don't worry if you have too much difficulty making this distinction; many teachers and students prefer to use the fricative versions (''th, f, kh'') so that they are easier to distinguish for speakers and listeners.

*Much of the information provided in this section came from the article on pronunciation for Ancient (classical) Greek: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek/Alphabet#Pronunciation.

==Modern Greek Pronunciation==

The Modern Greek pronunciation is preferred within Greece and Cyprus and by the Orthodox Church.  It differs from the classical prunuciation in that 'γ' is like a 'y' preceeding 'ε', 'η', 'ι'. 'ω' and 'ο' are pronounced the same, as are 'η' and 'ι',  'χ' is pronounced like 'ch' or similar to a Spanish 'jota' (hi'''j'''o), 'β' is pronounced [v], δ is pronounced like 'th' in the word 'this', π becomes 'b' following a nasal, with the nasal frequently not being pronounced (especially at the beginning of words).  The diphthongs 'ει' 'οι' and 'υι' are pronounced like 'i', and αι is pronounced like 'ε'. The 'υ' in the diphthongs αυ, ευ, ηυ is pronounced as [v] exept before unvoiced consonants and at the end of the word, when it is pronounced [f].  In Modern Greek pronunciation, all accents are treated like acute accents (similar to how Katharevousa Greek was pronounced). Aspirates are not pronounced.

==Punctuation==

[[Image:modern_greek_alexandrinus.jpg|right|caption|thumbnail|300px|A section of the Codex Alexandrinus containing Luke 12:54-13:4.]]
The comma (,) and full-stop (.) are used as in English.  The colon or semicolon is a point above the line (·).  The Greek question mark (;) looks like the English semicolon.

Inverted commas are often used to denote speech.  Capital letters are used at the beginning of paragraphs, sentences (depending on publisher), proper names, and the beginning of quotations. 

In actual Greek texts from the era when Koine Greek was used as a day-to-day language, Greek was written with no punctuation*.  The words ran together completely, with no spacing or markup.  Accents, breathing marks, spaces, and other punctuation are added at a much later time, making texts easier to read.

* This is actually not entirely accurate, as many of the earliest partial manuscripts of the New Testament do have punctuation. Due to the high cost of the factors of input (ink, paper), punctuation was quickly excluded, to be re-included later by textual scholars (not unlike the adding of vowel-markers to the Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic texts by the Masoretes).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oh, if only I had the resources available to talk at length about various notational systems, putting across the encouraging idea that they are constantly evolving and not set in stone and interpretation can be just as creative as creation. I like putting fermatas over measures. I'm not sure how useful this comment is, but I've never made an edit so I'm sort of nervous to just go ahead and do it.

== Expanding notation ==

One might want to add the 8va and 8ba, as well as examples of changing clefs in the middle of a piece, in order to avoid the ledger lines.

== What is the intended scope of this book? ==

This has got off to a rather shaky start. It is addressed as a &quot;how-to&quot; kind of text, but it is getting so chatty and full of sidelines that it threatens to become unusably long.

I have tried (a while back) to simplify some of the material in an article on solmization: http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1339337

Accessibility is a major problem, because a certain familiarity with some music theory is required, to make any sense of the terms used. What level of knowledge is to be expected?

I would be against introducing the word &quot;confusingly&quot; so early, or indeed at all. It is our job ''not'' to be confusing.

== chant ==

Gregorian chant uses a 4-line staff.

== why was this *after* the rhythm section? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maybe I'm naive but does a whole cooked chicken mean the chicken has to be in one peice?  I ask because it makes a difference in what kind of dish is used to cook this in.  Should it be done in a big deep pot or a frying pan? The directions seem to indicate a frying pan but that wouldn't do much good with a whole cooked chicken. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 17:36, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I think that there are some spices missing in this recipe.  I attempted it tonight and it was incredibly bland.  Using some salt, pepper, chili powder, and a few other spices made it taste better, but I'm not sure what should be used during cooking to make sure the finished product comes out well. -- KeplerNiko [[User:84.85.0.110|84.85.0.110]] 23:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumb|250px|Two cheetahs together.]]
'''Cheetahs''' are built for speed, with a whip-like spine, long legs, and a long tail that acts as a rudder for sudden turns.  They are the world's fastest land animal. The cheetah can chase its prey for 274 meters (almost a sixth of a mile) at the speed of 114 kilometers (almost 71 miles per hour) per hour. Both the male and the female of the species are referred to as 'cheetahs' unlike in the case of other animals. Cheetahs can generally live up to 7 years.
==Where do cheetahs live?==
[[Image:cheetah range.png|thumb|left|Places where cheetahs live are colored green.]]
Today, most cheetahs are found in sub-Saharan Africa, though a few are still seen in Iran.  In the past, they used to be found throughout northern India and Iran. They prefer to live in semi-deserts, savannah, prairies, and thick brush.  As they rely upon speed to hunt, they avoid dense forests. Conservation efforts are required in order to avoid the cheetah becoming an entry on the endangered species list. In India, the forests in which many cheetahs live are not secured and they can leave the forests and travel into cities or villages. In the last 2-3 years, cheetahs have been found in these urban areas.

==What do cheetahs look like?==
[[Image:Huntcheetah.jpg|thumb|right|Cheetahs used as hunters, Persia, early 1560s]]

Cheetahs are rather dog-like, medium-sized spotted cats with long legs and slender, but muscular, bodies. They have a white belly, and a dark stripe that looks like a tear on both sides of their faces. In contrast to leopards, which have palmette shaped spots, cheetahs have round dark spots on their fur. Adult cheetahs weigh from 90 to 140 pounds (40-65 kg), and are around 4 to 5 feet (112-135 cm) in length. Cheetahs are built to do what they do--run! Their long tail provides them with balance. They have a big chest, a narrow waist, and powerful muscles in their hind legs. They have small heads and muzzles; large nostrils for increased oxygen intake; and small, round ears. All of this makes the cheetah very sleek and aerodynamic when it runs.
==What do they eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Cheetahs mostly eat mammals like gazelles, impala, gnu calves, and hares, which are all about the same size as, or smaller than an adult cheetah.

Cheetahs stalk their prey until they are within about thirty meters, and then give chase. The chase is usually over in less than a minute, and if the cheetah doesn't catch its prey quickly, it will often give up rather than waste energy. This is because cheetahs use a lot of energy when chasing prey at such high speed. They are very fast runners due to the build of their legs and about half of the chases are successful.

Cheetahs must eat their catch quickly or risk losing their food to other stronger predators. They will not usually fight with a larger animal over food as risking an injury would mean certain starvation.

Cheetahs are well-adapted to living in arid environments. In the Kalahari desert, they have been estimated to travel an average of 82 km between drinks of water. They have been seen getting their water from the blood or urine of their prey or by eating Tsamma melons.


==Fun facts==
See how much you know about the world's fastest land mammal:
*After running at full speed, a cheetah must rest at least 15 minutes before running again.
*Cheetahs do not roar, but they make a number of very un-catlike sounds, many of which resemble bird chirps.
*Cheetah sounds include purrs, bleats, barks, growls, hisses and chirps but the chirp can be heard at a distance of a mile away!
*Cheetahs were called leopards before leopards were! Earlier the word for Cheetah was &quot;leopard&quot;, and the word for leopard was simply &quot;pard&quot;. Cheetahs were called leo-pards then as a mix between &quot;leo&quot; - Latin for lion, and &quot;pard&quot;, then the name of leopards. 
*Apart from [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Puma|pumas]], cheetahs are the only big cats that purr.
*Many cheetah cubs are killed by a lack of food or their natural enemies - lions, leopards, and hyenas. An old African legend says the tear stain marks on the cheetah's face are from the mother weeping for her lost cubs.
*Cheetahs do not usually eat the skin or bones of their prey.
*Hyenas, leopards, and lions steal the cheetah's prey after the cheetah has killed it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introducing Compilers and Interpreters ==
A '''compiler''' is a computer program that implements a programming language specification to &quot;translate&quot; programs, usually as a set of files which constitute the ''source code'' written in ''source language'', into their equivalent machine readable instructions '''(the target language, often having a binary form known as object code)'''. This translation process is called ''compilation''. We ''compile'' the source program to create the ''compiled program''. The compiled program can then be run (or executed) to do what was specified in the original source program.

The '''source language''' is always a higher-level language in comparison to machine code, written using some mixture of English words and mathematical notation, assembly language being the lowest compilable language (an ''assembler'' being a special case of a compiler that translates ''assembly language'' into machine code). Higher-level languages are the most complex to support in a compiler/interpreter, not only because they increase the level of abstraction between the source code and the resulting machine code, but because increased complexity is required to formalize those abstract structures. 

The '''target language''' is normally a low-level language such as assembly, written with somewhat cryptic abbreviations for machine instructions, in these cases it will also run an assembler to generate the final machine code. But some compilers can directly generate machine code for some actual or virtual computer e.g. byte-code for the Java Virtual Machine.

Another common approach to the resulting compilation effort is to target a ''virtual machine''. That will do just-in-time compilation and byte-code interpretation and blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters.

For example, C and C++ will generally be compiled for a target `architecture'. The draw-back is that because there are many types of processor there will need to be as many distinct compilations. In contrast Java will target a Java Virtual Machine, which is an independent layer above the 'architecture'. The difference is that the generated byte-code, not true machine code, brings the possibility of portability, but will need a Java Virtual Machine (the byte-code interpreter) for each platform. The extra overhead of this byte-code interpreter means slower execution speed.

An '''interpreter''' is a computer program which executes the translation of the source program at run-time. It will not generate independent executable programs nor object libraries ready to be included in other programs.  

A program which does a lot of calculation or internal data manipulation will generally run faster in compiled form than when interpreted. But a program which does a lot of input/output and very little calculation or data manipulation may well run at about the same speed in either case.

Being themselves computer programs, both compilers and interpreters must be written in some ''implementation language''. Up until the early 1970's, most compilers were written in assembly language for some particular type of computer. The advent of C and Pascal compilers, each written in their own source language, led to the more general use of high-level languages for writing compilers. Today, operating systems will provide at least a free C compiler to the user and some will even include it as part of the OS distribution.

Compiler construction is normally considered as an advanced rather than a novice programming task, mainly due to the quantity of code needed (and the difficulties of grokking this amount of code) rather than the difficulty of any particular coding constructs. To this most books about compilers have some blame. The large gap between production compilers and educational exercises promotes this defeatist view.

For the first version of a compiler written in its own source language you have a [[w:Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] problem. Once you get a simple version working, you can then use it to improve itself.

{{NOTE|A compiler is a non-trivial computer program; when written completely by hand a non-optimizing compiler for a simple source language is likely to be upwards of 3000 lines long. Some compiler-writing tools are available which can reduce this size, but will add the corresponding dependencies.}}

;The compilation process
At the highest level, compilation is broken into a number of parts:
# Lexical analysis (tokenizing)
# Syntax analysis (parsing)
# Type checking
# Code generation

{{NOTE|You should read most of this chapter, since the rest of the book will assume it as background information.}}

=== Requirements ===
Any compiler has some essential requirements, which are perhaps more stringent than for most programs:
* Any valid program must be translated correctly, i.e. no incorrect translation is allowed.
* Any invalid program must be rejected and not translated.

There will inevitably be some valid programs which can't be translated due to their size or complexity in relation to the hardware available, for example problems due to memory size. The compiler may also have some fixed-size tables which place limits on what can be compiled (some language definitions place explicit lower bounds on the sizes of certain tables, to ensure that programs of reasonable size/complexity can be compiled).

There are also some desirable requirements, some of which may be mutually exclusive:
* Errors should be reported in terms of the source language or program.
* The position at which an error was detected should be indicated; if the actual error probably occurred somewhat earlier then some indication of possible cause(s) should also be provided.
* Compilation should be fast.
* The translated program should be fast.
* The translated program should be small.
* If the source language has some national or international standard:
** Ideally the entire standard should be implemented.
** Any restrictions or limits should be well and clearly documented.
** If extensions to the standard have been implemented:
*** These extensions should be documented as such.
*** There should be some way of turning these extensions off.

There are also some possibly controversial requirements to consider (see chapter on [[Compiler Construction/Dealing with errors|dealing with errors]]):
* Errors detected when the translated program is running should still be reported in relation to the original source program e.g. line number.
* Errors detected when the translated program is running should include division by 0, running out of memory, use of an array subscript/index which is too big or too small, attempted use of an undefined variable, incorrect use of pointers, etc.

=== Overall Structure ===
For ease of exposition we will divide the compiler into a front end and a back end. These need not even be written in the same implementation language, providing they can communicate effectively via some intermediate representation.

The following list itemizes the tasks carried out by the front end and the back end. Note that the tasks are not carried out in any particular order, as outlined below, and discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters.

*'''Front end'''
** lexical analysis - convert characters to tokens
** syntax analysis - check for valid sequence of tokens
** semantic analysis - check for meaning
** some global/high-level optimization

*'''Back end'''
** some local optimization
** register allocation
** peep-hole optimization
** code generation
** instruction scheduling

Almost all the source-language aspects are handled by the front end. It is possible to have different front ends for different high-level languages, and a common back end which does most of the optimization.

Almost all the machine-dependent aspects are handled by the back end. It is possible to have different back ends for different computers so that the compiler can produce code for different computers.

The front end is normally controlled by the syntax analysis processing. As necessary, the syntax analysis code will call a routine
which performs some lexical analysis and returns the next token. At selected points during syntax analysis, appropriate semantic routines are called which perform any relevant semantic checks and/or add information to the internal representation.

==The opportunity==

Most of the software process engineering tools today are proprietary and expensive, affordable only by large corporations.

The following table shows sales figures for the proprietary project management tools business.  Even without considering free and pirated software usage, sales more than double over a five year period from 2001.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Year || Sales in millions USD 
|-
|2001 || 250
|-
|2002 || 350
|-
|2003 || 420
|-
|2004 || 390
|-
|2005 || 520
|}

The growth of project management during the past decade has contributed markedly to project success rates. When 31% of the projects failed in 1994 , only 15% failed in 2002. Total cost of financial waste and budget overruns from challenged and failed projects is down. When $140 billion was wasted out of $250 billion spent in 1994 , only $55 billion out of $255 billion was wasted in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Chaos Chronicles, Standish Group, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

For mid size organizations involved in project management, buying and maintaining the standard proprietary tools available is very expensive and  there is no full fledged software engineering  tool available in the open source space. . Whatever is available is confined to just scheduling, leaving out  the other activities like estimation, WBS, dependency management, risk management, reviews, quality management, requirements management, design, testing  wide open. 

‘NorthStar’ the  project management and software engineering tool, fills up this gap, and provides the users with  the state of the art project management and software engineering tool , covering all facets of project management.  

'''The Vision''' Provide the global software engineering community an open tool, which supports end to end  software engineering   project management which is easy to customize and affordable..

'''Scope of work''' - Develop a requirements capture module 

* Develop a work break down structure generation / capture module, which can be traced back to 
requirements 
* Against the work breakdown structure capture planned completion date, revised completion date, actual completion date, planned effort, revised effort, actual effort, primary owner, dependent task (one only) 
* Compute earned value depending on 50-50 rule, that is when the task starts give 50% weightage and when the task ends give the balance 50% weightage 
* Compute and display critical path 
* Compute and display loading chart 
* Generate variance metrics for effort , schedule 
* Integrate with Bugzilla for defect details and generate one metrics on effort in testing  Vs number of defects 
* Develop a risk management module which can capture risks, provide rating against each risk item based on the probability of occurrence and impact  along with risk mitigation plan and status. Provide a facility to see the risks for a module , a project and for all my projects

==The project execution strategy==
There will be a core team defining the roadmap for the project and at any point in time, the roadmap for the next 1 year will be defined

The roadmap is broken down into schedules of 3 months each, and at any point in time, the schedules for the next 3 months will be available (wave planning/scheduling) 

The project will have a project manager 

The project will follow  water fall model, and the duration of every waterfall cycle will be 3 months at the end of which there will be  releasable code with additional functionality available for release 

The core functionality will be developed by a dedicated in house team  and  the not so core functionality will be offered to university students to develop, with support from the core team 

The project will use as many reusable code as possible

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a project? ==

The main characteristics of a project are:
* It is a temporary endeavor
* It has fixed start and end dates 
* It is unique – no two projects are exactly the same, and it is not a routine operation
* It is performed by a team of people - teams are temporary in nature. Will be dispersed at the end of the project.
* It has a defined budget.
* It has a sponsor - someone who wants the project done and will guide and fight for it.
* It has a defined objective/endpoint such that you can measure when it is complete.

== What is project management? ==
Application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements in addition.

== What is a program? ==
Collection of '''Activities''' executed together in such a way that the cumulative benefit is higher than when they are executed one at a time.

== What is program management? ==
Overall management of a program and is not the individual management of the constituent projects in the program. The focus is on the program objectives achievement, rather than individual project progress.

== What is an operation? ==
An operation is also performed by people. The major difference between an operation and a project is that , operations are repetitive in nature, where as projects are temporary in nature.

== What are the similarities between a project and an operation? ==
* Both are performed by people 
* Both have deliverables 
* Both have limited resources
* Both are Planned, Executed and Controlled

== What are the differences between a project and an operation? ==
* Project is temporary in nature , whereas an operation is ongoing
* Projects have temporary teams , whereas operations have permanent teams (relatively)
* Each project is unique in nature, whereas operation steps are identical

== Who is a stakeholder? ==
Any person , community impacted by the project execution or project outcome or by non-execution of the project.

== What is a PMO? ==
PMO, Project Management Office, is an organization within an organization supporting the project management practice within the organization. PMO will aid in:

* Making available critical project management related knowledge to the projects within the organization
* Providing tools and templates for project management 
* Supporting the tools and templates usage 
* Making available critical resources to the projects on time 

=== The PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE (PMO) concept ===

An organization conducting several projects on an ongoing basis should consider the creation of a central functional unit to supply project management resources and tools; to develop a methodology and procedures; and to look after systems. All these resources can be regrouped in a special unit to be called one of several names depending upon its intent and staffing. Such a unit is commonly called a Project Management Office (PMO), Project Support Office or Project Information Office. The specific roles and responsibilities assigned to the unit can influence the selection of its name

Depending upon its importance, there are several roles and responsibilities that can be assigned to a project office. They can be broken into the following major categories:

* Management of Project Environment 
* Project Information 
* Project Support 

The organization that wishes to focus primarily on the project management process will usually assign a senior manager to lead the process. This manager, who could be a vice president or director of project management, would assume the following responsibilities:
 
* Ensure the Transition
Once an organization has decided to carry out a corporate or departmental project management approach, the complete venture should be organized as a major project. The Project Management Office (PMO) would play a key role in leading this project.

* Provide Senior Project Managers
The PMO could be the functional organization responsible for supplying senior project managers to major corporate initiatives involving many operational functional groups and requiring unbiased management. It should not be, however, the PMO's responsibility to provide all project managers.

* Coaching Project Teams
The PMO could provide coaching services to project teams across the organization in both project planning and execution. These services could be offered to divisions that are starting to run their own projects with managers and teams who are still lacking the required project planning and management abilities. The coaching could include: (1) planning facilitation to help the project team develop a good project plan in line with the organization's project management methodology and procedures; (2) setting up the monitoring and control processes; and (3) facilitating team building and conflict resolution.

* Risk Assessment
The PMO can provide two major functions for risk assessment for the organization:  to have risk assessment tools available with coaching support for project managers to be used upon request; and upon direction of the Project Review Committee or other competent authority, conduct risk assessment against specified projects for corporate management. 

* Project Post Evaluation
The PMO could provide post evaluation of selected projects if desired by the organization.

* Career Development
In cooperation with the Human Resources Branch, the PMO could take the lead in defining the career paths and training requirements for the project management field within the organization. This task should include:
** The development of job categories and descriptions, 
** The selection of personnel to enter the project management field, 
** The development of a training curriculum for project management and 
** The development and delivery of training materials.

== What is project portfolio management? ==
Project portfolio management is all about choosing the right projects to execute--those which align with the organizational strategy and will give the organization the maximum return on investment.
The projects to execute are determined by techniques such as:
* NPV – net present value of investments 
* ROI – Return on investments 
* Payback period 
* Opportunity cost, etc.

== What are the different types organizational structures? How do they impact PM role? ==

* Functional organization 
* Projectized organization 
* Matrix organization 

Functional organization is the most common form of organization. The organization is grouped by area of specialization within different functional areas (sales, manufacturing, purchase, quality control etc). In a functional organization, maximum power rests with the functional manager and the project manager’s role in decision making is minimal. Project managers play a coordinator / facilitator role. Control over the team by project manager is minimal. (Glorified secretary) 

Advantages of a functional organization;
In a projectized organization, the team gets dismantled, once the project is over, hence the ownership of the career path of the project team members are not fully owned by any. This can be the situation in matrix organizations too, since there are two bosses. Whereas in a typical functional organization, the career progression of the team member is fully owned by the functional manager.

Team members report to only one boss, hence avoidance of conflict of interest.
Easier management of specialists. Fully under the control of the functional manager.
Similar resources are centralized, hence better synergy within groups

Disadvantages of functional organization;

* Preference for functional specialization, at the cost of the project 
* No career path in project management 
* Project manager has no authority 

Projectized organization 

In projectized organization, all the work is considered as a project (construction companies, software project organizations). The project manager has total control over the projects. Personnel are assigned to and report to a project manager. 

In the projectized  organization approach, all project staff reports to the project manager or to someone within the project team structure. The staff is either seconded or hired/contracted specifically for the project and will remain on the team as long as required. In a pure  projectized organization, the project receives all necessary staff, including administrative support. On a larger project, the projectized organization has the appearance of a small company, in that it is a self-contained unit with all the resources necessary to do the job. It is the ideal situation for a project manager. 

Advantages of a projectized organization&quot;
* Team members will be more committed to the project 
* Availability of career paths within the project management stream 
* More effective project related communication 

Disadvantages of projectized organization;
* When the project gets over, the team gets dismantled, hence lack of security leading short term commitments 
* Duplication of facilities and job functions eg:- administrative officer for each project, HR coordinator for each project, seating arrangements for each projects, team outings for each projects etc. 
* Less efficient use of resources. Project teams tend to hang on to resources both material and human, even after the need for them. (Some project manager’s take pride in their team size or develop fear when the team size shrinks).
 
Matrix organization 

Matrix organization is a hybrid of both functional and projectized organization, trying to leverage the strength of both. The team members report to two bosses, the project manager and the functional manager.

In a strong matrix, the power rests with the project manager. In a weak matrix, the power rests with the functional manager. In a balanced matrix, the power is shared between the project manager and the functional manager. 

The structure of a matrix project organization, when used properly, can be quite effective. When misused, however, it can be quite disastrous. The matrix is a highly complex structure from an organizational point of view and management must constantly work at good communications to make it work properly. 

Advantages of matrix organization;
* More support from functional organizations
* Maximum utilization of scarce resources, since they are easily accessible to the projects.
Better horizontal and vertical communication (better than functional) 
* Team members have a place to go, at the completion of the project 

Disadvantages of matrix organization
* More than one boss for project teams, leaving the team members between devil and deep sea, due to conflicts between the project manager and the functional manager 
* More complex to monitor and control, if it spans different locations


== Roles and responsibilities of a project manager? ==
Roles and responsibilities vary from organization to organization. Project manager is ultimately responsible for the success of the project (cost, schedule and quality). The other responsibilities include:
* Development of a project plan 
* Executing the project as per the project plan
* Maintaining the project plan 
* Project tracking
* Scope management 
* Risk management 
* Project integration management 
* People management 
* Communications management 
* Procurement management
* Quality management 
* Causal analysis and corrective actions 
* Stakeholder management 

== Roles and responsibilities of a project sponsor == 
Project sponsor’s primary role is to make the needed resources available to the project. This includes;
* Approval for starting the project
* Approval to the cost budgets of the project 
* Approval to the product road maps , if it is a product development project 
* Decision to short close the projects, if the project deliverables are not viable or do not add value in changed scenarios. 
* Decisions to progress into the subsequent phases 
* Decisions not to progress into the subsequent phases 

== What is a project management lifecycle? == 
Project management life cycle is different from project life cycles and product management lifecycles. 
Project management lifecycle comprises of initiation, planning, execution, control phases. (Hint : It is easy to remember it as IPECC) 
The following table depicts the project activities grouped under initiation, planning, execution and control (project management lifecycle) 

Initiating 
Planning 
Executing 
Control 
Closing 
Select project, which will give maximum benefit
Create scope statement 
Execute the project plan 
Integrated change control 
Procurement audits 
Product verification 
Financial closure 
Lessons learned 
Update records 
End of project performance reporting 
Formal acceptance 

== Project archives == 
Determine project team 
Refer to historical information, already available within the organization 
Create WBS 
Manage project progress 
Project performance measuring 
Finalize the team 
Determine project goals 
Create WBS dictionary 
Complete work packages

Risk monitoring and control 
Determine business need 
Determine communication requirements 
Identify changes 
Schedule control 
Overall 

== Influencing the organization == 
Leading 
Solving problems 
Negotiating 
Communicating 
Holding meetings 

== Stakeholder management == 
Develop product description. 
Determine quality standards. 
Use work authorization system. 
Cost control. 
Define responsibilities of the project manager. 
Risk identification, qualification, quantification and response planning. 
Manage by objectives to the project plan. 
Scope verification.
Iterations – go back.
Ensure compliance with plans. 
Determine high level resource requirements. 
Create other management plans : scope, schedule, cost, quality, staffing, communications, procurement, dependency management etc.

== Project plan updates == 
Corrective action 
Finalize the project charter 
Create project control system 

== Final project plan development == 
Gain formal project plan approval 
Hold kick off meeting 

==  What is a product management lifecycle?== 
A product management life cycle scope is much wider than project scope. A typical product management lifecycle have the following phases:
Idea generation.
Idea validation.
Feasibility.
Commit.
Development. 
Beta.
Packaging. 
Release.

== What is the difference between product management and project management? == 
Product management consists of product idea conception to final product launch and after sales support, where as project management primarily focuses on the development phase.
What is a project life cycle?
Logical phases , within a project. Example : Requirements , design , coding , testing and maintenance phases in a software project.

== What is PDCA? == 
PDCA – By Edward Deming. Talks about Plan – Do – Check –Act cycle, which is applicable for any work/project. Primarily the work to be done is planned first, then it is performed , the out come is checked , if any variations from plan , then corrective actions are taken. It is also known as PDSA – Plan , Do, Study and Act.
Steps for continuous improvement. 

== What is MBO? == 
MBO, stands for management by objectives. Again MBO can be visualized from the PDCA angle. 
In MBO, the objectives for performance are set first, then the team performs to meet the objectives, the progress is checked and corrective actions are taken if necessary. 
What is management by projects?
Some organizations perform all their work as projects. Eg : Construction companies , application software development companies. When an organization performs all their work as projects , it is called management by projects.
Is there any relationship between organizational structure and project manager’s role / authority?
Yes. Depicted in the following table 


== Functional organization == 
1-Weak matrix, 
2-Balanced Matrix,
3-Strong Matrix, 
4-Projectized.
Project manager’s authority: 
1-Little or none, 
2-Limited,
3-Low to moderate, 
4-Moderate to high, 
5-High to almost total.
Project manager’s role: 
1-Part time, 
2-Part time, 
3-Full time, 
4-Full time, 
5-Full time.

== Common titles for project managers == 
Project coordinator / leader 
Project coordinator /leader 
Project manager /officer 
Project manager/
Program manager 
Project manager/
Program manager

== What is the difference between leading and managing? == 
Managing is primarily concerned with ‘consistently producing key results expected by key stakeholders where as leading involves:
# Establishing direction 
# Aligning people 
# Motivating and inspiring 

==What is communication? And typically how much time a project manager spends in communication?== 
*Involves exchange of information 
*Sender is responsible for making information clear, unambiguous and complete 
*The receiver is responsible for making sure that the information is received in its entirety and understood correctly
*Can be internal or external to the project 
*Can be horizontal or vertical 
*Can be written or oral 
*Involves media 
*Consumes around 90% of project manager’s time

==What is the difference between a project plan and a project schedule?==
Project schedule is part of the project plan. Apart from the project schedule, a typical project plan have scope, risk management plan, schedule management plan, communications plan, procurement plan, team structure, tracking mechanisms , assumptions, dependencies, major milestones etc...

==What is project size estimate?==
In every engineering discipline, the size of the work to be performed is estimated first, prior to developing a cost budget. 

Examples of size budgets: Building – 2000 sq ft, Ship – tonnes, Software – Lines of code or function points.

==What is a project effort estimate?==
Once the size estimates are arrived at, they are converted into effort estimates, by applying the productivity factor. 
E.g.: If a wall of 2000 sq ft size is to built and if the productivity of the mason/day is 200 sq ft , then the effort required to construct the wall is 2000/200 = 10 person days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Transatheism is a branch of atheism that acknowledges the commonality of superstitions around the world and their usefulness in human psychological well being, self awareness, and motivation for the individual.

Transatheism down-plays the usefulness of religion, beyond its transitory and sometimes revolutionary social side effects and religions use of alliances to create local social cohesion. Personal explorations directed toward understanding the true biological, physiological and psychochemical responses associated with the historical methodologies of spirituallity are favoured over traditional mysticism. Transatheism further explains the overwhelming prevalence of mythology and superstition among humankind by noting the common physiological processes inherent in the human species as a whole. Hence the presence of 'God' or deities in transatheism is not thought of in terms of religion but in terms of existing and measurable biochemical mechanisms linked to the processes of the various methods of spirituality and the response of the human organism to those. Individual perceptions of supernatural beings tend to reflect the subconcious ego of the individual. These perceptions tend to be further moulded by structural social mores and doctrine.

Personal spirituality is promoted and encouraged by transatheists as a means of developing the stimulus-response mechanisms of the brain associated with such practices. Exactly what techniques the individual uses to attain spiritual stimulation are left to the individual. It is the net holistic result that is considered most important in the development of a balanced human psyche.

Religion in transatheism is categorised with clan or tribal behaviours and hierarchal social organisation. These are not considered part of spirituality but rather mere social alliances based on common social and physical practice, possibly resulting in spiritual stimulation.

==Simple transatheist exercises==

===How to Make Yourself Happy===

The complete body is a connected organism. Nothing can happen to one part of the body without affecting another part of the body. The facial muscles are directly connected to the emotional centres of the brain. Changing your facial muscles changes your brain chemistry.

To modify ones personal feeling of well being one can hold a smile for a period of several minutes. Practicing this two or three times throughout the day may improve ones long term sense of well being. Select a quiet spot away from distractions and disruptions to practice smiling. Smile for a few minutes just before sleep to improve restfulness. Smile in the morning for a few minutes after waking to set the emotional tone for the day.

Human beings are social organisms. Volunteer or join a club or community group to meet people with similar interests. Concentrate on developing long term friends for chatting. Listen to what others have experienced and how they feel. Listening to others stimulates the brain and can provide experiential information and perspective.

===How to Calm Anxiety===

The brain perceives a fake laugh in the same way as it perceives a real laugh. Use laughter to combat anxiety. When anxiety begins to appear, force a big fake laugh. Repeat this for several minutes, or if inspired use real laughter. 

Use daily physical exercise to calm anxiety. Cardiovascular exercise stimulates endorphens, and can help balance other hormones in the body and brain. Physical exercise also reduces excess glycogen in the body and stimulates the internal organs which is beneficial for the brain. Smiling while exercising may provide additional benefits.

Reduce exposure to visual strobes such as television, and computers. High frequency strobing lights may have effects on natural brain wave rythmns.

Get a change of scenery and learn new things. Stimulating your brain to think of other things by learning or helping out in the community may help to break the biochemical cycle of anxiety. 

Contemplate, appreciate, and verbalize the goodness of others, the world and yourself. This can be percieved or performed as praying or singing if one lacks a learned mental reference for contemplation.

{{WikiProject Languages|french=yes|quality=C|french-priority=High}} 

One thing I noticed was That there was no forward button on the bottom of the page. Other then that good Job [[User:Bawolff|Bawolff]] 05:23, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Navigational template ==
I also say good job. I noticed that your navigation system was makeshift, and I couldn't find a better one, so here's an idea: use the template that I created specifically for this: {{bad link|NextPrev}}.

For example, you currently use this:&lt;br&gt;
[[French | ^ French ^]] | [[French/Contents|&lt;&lt; Table of Contents]] | Introduction | [[French/Lessons/Alphabet| Alphabet &gt;&gt;]]

I propose this:

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#ccccff;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Up:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Back:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Current:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Next:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[French]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[French/Contents|Table of Contents]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;French/Lessons/Introduction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[French/Lessons/Alphabet|Alphabet]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As far as I care, the template is free to be changed. I just wanted something that I knew would perform this function. Let me know what you think.

Actually, the &quot;back&quot; in this case shouldn't even exist, and the &quot;up&quot; should be the ToC. But my template as it is doesn't allow for nonexistent &quot;back&quot; or &quot;next.&quot; Maybe someone can change that. -- [[User:D. F. Schmidt|D. F. Schmidt]] 05:55, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

== Deletions ==

I've deleted the stuff about French having invaded England and modified the bit about 1/3 of English being French.  The invasion was a Norman one, not a French one (the French had no say in the matter).  William was Norman, the chroniclers of the event were Norman, and Wace, writing about it in the 12th century, was a Norman who wrote positively of the Normans, and quite negatively of the French.  Moreover, the dialects were distinct then, and are separate languages now.  Moreover, the French fought against the Normans and conquered much of their territory in 1204.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 01:26, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

== Links for definitions ==

I've noticed the expression ''&quot;Allons-y&quot;'' here (that now[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/French/Lessons/Weather#Idioms]] I know it means &quot;let's go!&quot;) and thought that maybe we could include links for these definitions (wiktionary, wikibooks, whatever works), when expressions that were not introduced yet appear. Is this practice allowed, or there is a style guide telling us not to? Thanks for any clarification! --[[User:MirianBruckschen|MirianBruckschen]] ([[User talk:MirianBruckschen|talk]]) 14:32, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
:As a book, it is better to not use links, as in the other wikis, as these books also have a printed version. Thus, it would be better to make your definitions in-place.  There is a guide on this, but damned if I can find it :-) [[User:Coupe|Coupe]] ([[User talk:Coupe|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Coupe|contribs]]) 11:23, 25 February 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic liberal-libertarian debate is between [[Wikipedia:John Rawls|John Rawls]] (the famous advocate of Liberalism) and [[Wikipedia:Robert Nozick|Robert Nozick]] (pertaining to Libertarianism).  Rawls argues that what should motivate an optimal political society is placing ourselves from the point of view outside that society.  In other words, in order to find out what kind of government would be the best, one must ask what one would desire if one did not know what role he/she was going to play in that particular society (Rawls calls this the Veil of Ignorance).  From behind this Veil of Ignorance, one should not have any knowledge of any of the particular aspects of the social institutions or distributions in the state.  Rawls thinks that given this objective disposition, one would come up with a government whose principles were such that all people in the society would have equal opportunities for everything (and inequalities would be allowed, but only if they maintained to benefit the worst off).

In contrast, Nozick argues against Rawls that, when pertaining to [[Wikipedia:Distributive Justice|Distributive Justice]], one must not take an ahistorical, patterned view of distribution, but rather look at the situation historically.  That is, a distribution is just if it satisfies the principles of justice in attainment and of justice in transfer.  For Nozick, one can acquire (own) something in two ways: either that thing was previously unowned, and the person acquired it while leaving enough and as good of it left for others, or that thing was transfered to him/her by an act of legitimately freely informed consent on the part of the previous owner.  He allows also for some principles of retribution if an act is unjust, and allows here for there to be some orientations of patterned redistribution.  However, at base, Nozick's point is that when trying to decide whether an ownership is just, we must decide whether the individual acquired it legitimately, not whether it brings about the greatest overall happiness (read: [[Utilitarianism]]) or benefits the worst off.

Thomas Nagel would give a third opinion to try and reconcile these claims by pointing out that the problem in this debate and subsequently in all of political theory is the delicate balancing and often asymmetry between concerns of personal politics (the individual's concerns) and collective politics (the concerns for others).  This is a bit of an echoing of Rousseau's theory of the General Will, where he tries to account for individuals acting in one way to support their private, personal desires, and in another way to act according to concerns of the whole.  John Stuart Mill also deals with this dichotomy by claiming that societies need to promote the greatest overall happiness for the greatest number of people (his principle of Utilitarianism) while still maintaining that it (the Government) enables the possibility for its citizens to individually pursue the betterment of their own lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[The Wrong Way To Learn Spanish|^ The Wrong Way To Learn Spanish ^]] - Part Two. In this section , we'll be looking at some paragraphs given below and translate them into Spanish.

Dorothy lived in Kansas with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em.  Their house was small. It had one room and a cellar.

'''Dorothy vivia en Kansas con Tío Henry y Tía Em. Su casa era pequeña. Estuvo un habatacion y una sotano.'''

The land around the house was very flat.  The soil was dry and the grass was dead.  The sun had turned everything dull and gray.

'''La tierra alrededor de la casa era muy plana.  El suelo era seco y la hierba era muerta. El sol '''had turned '''todo embotado y gris.'''

Aunt Em was once young and pretty. The sun and wind withered her. They made her sad, too.  When the orphan Dorothy came, her laughter made Aunt Em scream in surprise.

'''Tía Em fue joven y bonita. El sol y el viento le marchitaban. La hicieron triste, demasiado. Cuando llegó la huérfana Dorothy, su risa hizo tía Em grito de sorpresa.'''

Uncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night.  He was sad and gray also. He looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.

'''Tío Henry nunca se rió. Trabajó duro desde la mañana hasta la noche. Estaba triste y gris también. Miró austero y solemne y raramente hablaba.'''

Toto made Dorothy laugh. He saved her from growing sad and gray.  Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog. He was very cute.  Toto and Dorothy played all day. She loved him very much.

'''Toto reír a Dorothy. Le salvó de creciente triste y gris. Toto no era gris; era un pequeño perro negro. Era muy guapo. Totó y Dorothy jugaron todo el día. Ella lo amaba mucho.'''

Today, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry looked at the sky. It was very grey today.  Uncle Henry was anxious. Dorothy held Toto. She looked at the sky, too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes.

'''Hoy en día, no estaban jugando. Tío Henry miró al cielo. Hoy ha sido muy gris. Tío Henry estaba impaciente. Dorothy sostuvo Toto. Ella miró el cielo, también. Tía Em estaba lavando los platos.'''

नमस्ते


Namaste is hindi's universal greeting, as well as goodbye. It is common to hold ones hands together in front of the chest as praying and bow slightly when saying it. 

The 'e' is like the'é'in Café.It will always be like this. In Hindi every letter is pronounced the same in every word. In fact the script used to write hindi is the most phonetic script. This makes learning Hindi very easy compared to english and other languages. In this lesson i will cover the vowels and the difference between dental, retroflex, aspirated and non aspirated consonants. Devanagari is important to know but too lengthy discussion for this, if you do not know it you should learn. But it is not necessary for this lesson.

In hindi, consonants in which you touch the tongue to the back of your teeth are called 'dental' those which the tongue curls slightly and touches the roof of the mouth just behind the gums are called 'retroflex'. Dentals will be lowercase and retroflex will be uppercase letters in my translations. 

Aspirated consonants are ones in which a puff of air is released with the saying of the letter. Put your hand to your mouth and say 'pit' with a good amount of force, feel the air? now say 'spit' with less force. not as much air right? The first p in pit is aspirated and in hindi it is important that you do not mix the two. 

Vowels in hindi are as follows. 

'a' is the schwa and the short a of the language. It is like the 'a' in 'alive', 'about', 'america' and 'associate'. More of an 'uh' sound.

'aa' is long a and like 'a' in 'father'.

'i' is short i and like that in 'liter of coke'.

'ee' is long i and like the two ee's in 'seek'.

'u' is short u and like the 'oo' in 'soot' (NOT as in poo =)

'uu' is the long u like in 'poo' =)

'e' has already been explained

'ai' this is like the 'a' in 'mad' 'dad' 'sad'

'o' is like long o in bolt, and bowl. though remember PURE vowel. no movement.

'au' this is like in caw. but dont move your tongue or mouth to produce the w at the end. remember &quot;pure vowels&quot;.
    
Another important matter, 'c' in hindi is not 'k' or 's' as in english. it is always 'ch' like in church. careful not to aspirate it too much because theres a difference between 'c' and 'ch' in hindi.

Finally, in hindi there is nasalation of vowels. this just means that the vowel is pronounced more through the nose than usual. Say while holding your nose to approximate the sound. In my transliteration it is ~ after the letter.

Now, i think were ready for some script. You should read this aloud as this will help implant it in your brain, you may not notice but you will learn alot just by reading it to yourself even if you do not understand most of it! At the end i will explain most of it and you should read it again.

Hindi Lesson.

Man: hello, how are you?

Woman: I am well, and you?

Man: I too am well.

Woman: Good!

Man: Do you speak english?

Woman: No, i do not speak english. Where are you from?

Man: I'm from america.

Woman: Really? And you speak hindi?

Man: Yes, i speak a little, but i don't understand very much.

Woman: I see, your hindi is very good!

Man: Thank you. Goodbye!

Woman: Goodbye! 

look at this.

mai~ hoo~ - I am.

aap hai~ - you are   

yah hai - this is

Now, i will explain something very important in hindi. Look at the sentence 'aap kaisi hai~?' It is translated as 'how are you?' in english. Now as an english speaking person you would look at this and say 'aap = how, kaisi = are, you = hai~'. But this is incorrect. In hindi the word order is very different. the verb comes at the end of the sentence! so the auxillary verb 'hai~' (are) is at the end while 'aap' (you) is at the beginning. So it is really 'you how are?'. In english this sounds strange but in hindi it feels quiet natural! So the word order is Subject + object + verb. 'mai~ hindi bolta hoon~' (i speak hindi). 

You may also notice that 'acchaa' is translated as 3 phrases/words. 'i see' 'good' and 'really?'. this is because the word is a sort of catchall for these types of things. It's a very useful word to know.

In 'mai~ amrika se hoo~' the word 'se' means 'from' but in hindi its not from america but america from! they are postpositions and not prepositions as in english. 

Ajectives come before the noun they describe. but something very important is that they agree with their noun in gender. all nouns in hindi have gender. this is too much to explain here but just know that 'bolti' and 'bolta' both mean 'speaks' but 'yah aurat boltee' and 'yah aadmee boltaa' mean this woman speaks, this man speaks. the difference is the ending sound. this is not for all words but a majority of words. some do not change at all.

Questions. in english a question can be formed by changing the word order, or simply indicated in tone. ie. 'you speak hindi.' as opposed to 'you speak hindi?'. This is similar in hindi but you do not change the word order. you simply place 'kya' in front of the sentence. 'kya aap hindi boltaa hai~?'

and finally some vocabulary to help you get through the proper Hindi lesson.

nahee - no/not

haa~ - yes

acchaa - good, really?, i see, ect.

aadmee - man

aurat - woman

bhi - too

Well, thats all and I hope this introduces you to the language of Hindi and encourages you to learn more! Hindi is a beautiful language and has been called the language of songs because it is very musical. Many people speak Hindi and a widely unknown fact is that it is 3rd or 4th most spoken language in the world behind English and Chinese. It is spoken in India. =)</text>

Just when you thought that you were getting the hang of the Buttons window and the 3D Viewport window, there are several more windows to learn about.  Have no fear; we will gently guide you through this book and teach you about these windows as the need arises.  For now, you only need to know one of them to be aware of your many options.

[[Image:Blender3D window type selector.png|right]]

In the 3D viewport window, you'll see a button on the header all the way to the left that has a grid on it (if not, click on a window separator with the '''RMB''' or '''MMB''' and choose &quot;Add Header&quot;). That button allows you to switch window types.  Click on it with the '''LMB''' and you will see a number of different window types to which you can change.  Try some of the different window types; you will learn about their relevance in time.

Change the window back to the 3-Dimensional Viewport before moving on to the next tutorial.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Glossary ==
The glossary is intended to provide definitions of words or phrases which relate particularly to compiling, not to provide definitions of general computing jargon, for which a reference to Wikipedia may be more appropriate.

If the word or phrase you want is not here:
# Try looking it up on Wikipedia.
# Try searching the World Wide Web using Google or similar.

If you find the word or phrase, consider adding it to this glossary
with explanation and/or references.

If you don't find the word or phrase,
or can't understand what you did find,
add the word or phrase itself to this glossary without an explanation,
and leave it for someone else to explain.

=== When adding an item ===
When adding a word or phrase,
please keep things more or less in alphabetical order
to make it easier for others to find things.

The following guidelines will keep this glossary consistent (just follow the same style as some existing entry):
* The key word or phrase should be:
** preceded by a blank line,
** in '''bold''',
** on a line by itself.
* The actual definition/description should be indented.
* Any cross-references to other items in this glossary should be in ''italic''.
* The alphabetical splits can be refined as required to try and keep the number of entries in each section below about 20.

=== A to I ===
'''checking for meaning'''
: This is an alternative phrase for ''semantic analysis''.

'''comment'''
: Part of a source program which is intended for a human reader and which is ignored by the compiler.  As a minimum, all variables and all routines should have explanatory comments.  A comment may attempt to explain nearby code, but problems ensue if the code is updated and the comment is not. Ideally, comments should tell WHAT code does, not HOW; the code should be self-explanatory.

'''compilation'''
: The act of translation performed by a ''compiler''.

'''compiler'''
: A computer program that translates a computer program written in one computer language (called the ''source language'') into an equivalent program written in another computer language (called the ''target language'').

'''compile-time'''
: The period during which a program is being compiled, as distinct from ''run-time'' when a program is actually running.  Certain errors can be detected at compile-time (e.g. misspelt identifier) while other errors may not be detectable until run-time (e.g. division by 0).

''' GNU '''
: A recursive acronym &quot;GNU's Not Unix&quot;.  Independently written Unix lookalike, which can be combined with Linux kernel to produce GNU/Linux - a useful free operating system.

'''GPL'''
: GNU General Public Licence. Much copyrighted free software, including GNU/Linux, is available under [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html this licence]. The general intention is to ensure that such software remains freely available for anyone to use and/or modify.

'''identifier'''
: A name used in a program.  Normally some (possibly unpronouncable) combination of letters and digits which starts with a letter.  Some programming languages may allow other characters such as underline '_' or hash '#'.  Identifiers may be defined by the programmer or they may be pre-defined by the language (e.g. 'sqrt' is often a pre-defined identifier for referring to a 'square-root' function).  Older programming languages used to limit identifiers to a maximum of 6 characters - the resulting abbreviations tended to make programs more difficult to understand.  Many programming languages allow identifiers of almost any length, though some may only take the first 32 characters into account.  There are two main styles of writing long identifiers: either  now_for_some_long_name  or  NowForSomeLongName.

'''implementation language'''
: This is the programming language in which the compiler or interpreter is written.  It might be the same as either the ''source language'' or the ''target language''.

'''intermediate language'''
: Some moderately low-level language used as an interface between the front-end and the back-end of a compiler.

'''interpreter'''
: A computer program which examines a computer program written in some ''source language'' and carries out the actions required by that program more or less directly, without translating it into some other language.  May well be slower than a compiled program, especially if there is a lot of calculation.

=== J to R ===
'''just-in-time compilation'''
: A cross between a compiler and an interpreter. The ''source language'' is parsed in real-time and translated to ''machine language'' which is run immediately. The underlying machine runs the code whereas with an interpreter, it does the work itself.

'''keyword'''
: Many programming languages reserve some identifiers as keywords for use when indicating the structure of a program, e.g. '''if''' is often used to indicate some conditional code.  Languages such as Pascal/C/C++ have around 50 reserved keywords, Fortran doesn't have any, COBOL has around 300.

'''lexical analysis'''
: This is an alternative name for ''scanning'' or ''tokenisation''.  The function of lexical analysis is to scan the source program (a sequence of characters arranged on lines) and convert it to a sequence of valid ''token''s.  Any ''comment''s are usually removed at this stage as well.  ''Syntax analysis'' is responsible for checking that it is a valid sequence.

'''machine language'''
: This is the lowest level language. It consists of just binary digits. It was only ever used when computers were first invented to create the first compilers.

'''parsing'''
: This is an alternative name for ''syntax analysis''.

'''pass'''
: The number of times that the source text has to be scanned or rescanned in order to compile the program.  Due to limited main memory, some early compilers had a large number of passes (about 60).

'''pragma'''
: This is sometimes referred to as a significant ''comment''.  The intention is that of passing directives to the ''compiler'' or the ''preprocessor'' at various points in the source program.  Such directives might indicate whether speed or space is more important, or if certain checks should be suppressed, or if a particular routine is to be timed, etc.

'''preprocessor'''
: A program that takes text and performs lexical conversions on it. The conversions may include macro substitution, conditional inclusion, and inclusion of other files. This can be used to  write platform-independent code by excluding source files that are not necessary on certain platforms without changing the build instructions.

'''reserved word'''
: This is an alternative phrase for ''keyword''.

'''run-time'''
: The period when a program is running/being executed/doing some hopefully useful work, as distinct from ''compile-time'' when the program is being translated.

=== S to Z ===
'''scanning'''
: This is an alternative word for ''lexical analysis'' or ''tokenisation''.

'''semantic analysis'''
: The function of semantic analysis is to check that the source program is meaningful.  Note that a program can have a valid meaning and still be incorrect if it doesn't do what was really intended.

'''source language'''
: The language accepted as input by a ''compiler'', and translated/compiled into a ''target language''. It is normally a high-level language, written using some mixture of English words and mathematical notation.

'''syntax analysis'''
: This is an alternative name for ''parsing''.  The function of syntax analysis is to check that the source program is grammatically correct, i.e. that we have a valid sequence of ''token''s.  Checking that the source program actually means something is the job of ''semantic analysis''.

'''target language'''
: The language in which the output of a ''compiler'' is written. It is normally a low-level language such as assembler, written with somewhat cryptic abbreviations for machine instructions, but may instead be machine code for some actual or virtual computer.

'''token'''
: A fundamental symbol as processed by ''syntax analysis''.  A token may be an ''identifier'' 'Result', a reserved keyword '''if''', a compound symbol '&lt;=', or a single character '+'.

'''tokenisation'''
: This is an alternative word for ''lexical analysis'' or ''scanning''.  It means 'conversion to tokens'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Paediatric assessment =

The important thing to remember when assessing a very young child is that they probably don't want to be there (especially if they're in hospital).  In fact, most adults don't want to be there either but at least they're able to recognise that it's probably in their best interests to attend.  A child attends because somebody made them.

Play is going to be an important aspect of your assessment (as well as your treatment).  If you can distract them with balls, trampolines, toys and wedges you'll get a lot further than with instructions, commands and regimes.  Children want to climb up onto things.  They want to throw balls and hang from beams.  If you can make their trip to you a little more fun and a little less scary, you'll end up not only getting a better response to your treatment, but you may find yourself ''enjoying your job!''

== Equipment ==

=== Balls ===
''(Keywords)''Throwing, kicking, rolling, sitting, bouncing.  Postural control, strengthening, co-ordination.

=== Wedges ===
''(Keywords)''Wedges are good for stretching muscles, placing limbs into normal positions and props for climbing over, under and around.

=== Trampolines ===
There is some controversy over the use of mini-trompolines (Rebound therapy) in rehabilitation programmes for children.  Research in the US, UK and New Zealand has shown that the number of A&amp;E admissions after trompoline-related injury is staggeringly high.  Most conclude with a statement calling for a complete ban on the sale of recreational trampolines.  However, they also found that most injuries came about as a result of unsupervised activity, which hopefully would never occur in a physio gym.  The use of trampolines has (perhaps surprisingly) been shown to be effective in assisting with sputum clearance, among other, more well-documented effects.

=== Mats ===
''(Keywords)''Rolling, tumbling, falling safely, clean.

A tuple in Python is much like a list except that it is immutable (unchangeable) once created, and hashable and thus suitable as a key in a [[../Dictionaries|dictionary]].

==Tuple notation==
Tuples may be created directly or converted from lists.
Generally, tuples are enclosed in parentheses.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1, 'a', [6, 3.14]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (1, 'a', [6, 3.14])
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(1, 'a', [6, 3.14])
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(l)
(1, 'a', [6, 3.14])
&gt;&gt;&gt; t == tuple(l)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; t == l
False
&lt;/source&gt;

A one item tuple is created by an item in parentheses followed by a comma:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = ('A single item tuple',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
('A single item tuple',)
&lt;/source&gt;

Also, tuples will be created from items separated by commas.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = 'A', 'tuple', 'needs', 'no', 'parens'
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
('A', 'tuple', 'needs', 'no', 'parens')
&lt;/source&gt;

==Packing and Unpacking==

You can also perform multiple assignment using tuples.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; article, noun, verb, adjective, direct_object = t   #t is defined above
&gt;&gt;&gt; noun
'tuple'
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that either, or both sides of an assignment operator can consist of tuples.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b = 1, 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
2
&lt;/source&gt;

The example above: article, noun, verb, adjective, direct_object = t is called &quot;tuple unpacking&quot; because the tuple ''t'' was unpacked and its values assigned to each of the variables on the left. &quot;Tuple packing&quot; is the reverse: t=article, noun, verb, adjective, direct_object.  When unpacking a tuple, or performing multiple assignment, you must have the same number of variables being assigned to as values being assigned.

==Operations on tuples==
These are the same as for lists except that we may not assign to indices or slices, and there is no &quot;append&quot; operator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = (1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = (3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a + b
(1, 2, 3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.append(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] = 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
TypeError: object does not support item assignment
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(1, 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

For lists we would have had:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a + b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.append(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 2, 3]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Tuple Attributes ===

Length:
Finding the length of a tuple is the same as with lists; use the built in len() method.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; len( ( 1, 2, 3) )
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
&gt;&gt;&gt; len( a )
4
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Conversions ===
Convert list to tuples using the built in tuple() method.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(l)
(4, 5, 6)
&lt;/source&gt;

Converting a tuple into a list using the built in list() method to cast as a list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (4, 5, 6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(t)
[4, 5, 6]
&lt;/source&gt;

Dictionaries can also be converted to tuples of tuples using the items method of dictionaries:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(d.items())
(('a', 1), ('b', 2))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Uses of Tuples ==

Tuples can be used in place of lists where the number of items is known and small, for example when returning multiple values from a function. Many other languages require creating an object or container to return, but with Python 's tuple assignment, multiple-value returns are easy:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def func(x,y):
    # code to compute x and y
    return x,y
&lt;/source&gt;

This resulting tuple can be easily unpacked with the tuple assignment technique explained above:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x,y = func(1,2)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using List Comprehension to process Tuple elements ==

Occasionally, there is a need to manipulate the values contained within a tuple in order to create a new tuple.  For example, if we wanted a way to double all of the values within a tuple, we can combine some of the above information in addition to [[Python Programming/Lists#List_comprehensions|list comprehension]] like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def double(T):
    'double() - return a tuple with each tuple element (e) doubled.'
    return tuple( [ e * 2 for e in T ] )
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
#Create the list ['a', 'b', 'c'], then create a tuple from that list.
#Create the tuple ('a', 'b', 'c'), then create a list from that tuple. (Hint: the material needed to do this has been covered, but it's not entirely obvious)
#Make the following instantiations simultaneously: a = 'a', b=2, c='gamma'. (That is, in one line of code).
#Create a tuple containing just a single element which in turn contains the three elements 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Verify that the length is actually 1 by using the len() function.

A dictionary in Python is a collection of unordered values accessed by key rather than by index. The keys have to be hashable: integers, floating point numbers, strings, tuples, and frozensets are hashable, while lists, dictionaries, and sets other than frozensets are not. Dictionaries were available as early as in Python 1.4.

==Overview==
Dictionaries in Python at a glance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
dict1 = {}                     # Create an empty dictionary
dict2 = dict()                 # Create an empty dictionary 2
dict2 = {&quot;r&quot;: 34, &quot;i&quot;: 56}     # Initialize to non-empty value
dict3 = dict([(&quot;r&quot;, 34), (&quot;i&quot;, 56)])      # Init from a list of tuples
dict4 = dict(r=34, i=56)       # Initialize to non-empty value 3
dict1[&quot;temperature&quot;] = 32      # Assign value to a key
if &quot;temperature&quot; in dict1:     # Membership test of a key AKA key exists
  del dict1[&quot;temperature&quot;]     # Delete AKA remove
equalbyvalue = dict2 == dict3
itemcount2 = len(dict2)        # Length AKA size AKA item count
isempty2 = len(dict2) == 0     # Emptiness test
for key in dict2:              # Iterate via keys
  print key, dict2[key]        # Print key and the associated value
  dict2[key] += 10             # Modify-access to the key-value pair
for value in dict2.values():   # Iterate via values
  print value
dict5 = {} # {x: dict2[x] + 1 for x in dict2 } # Dictionary comprehension in Python 2.7 or later
dict6 = dict2.copy()             # A shallow copy
dict6.update({&quot;i&quot;: 60, &quot;j&quot;: 30}) # Add or overwrite
dict7 = dict2.copy()
dict7.clear()                  # Clear AKA empty AKA erase
print dict1, dict2, dict3, dict4, dict5, dict6, dict7, equalbyvalue, itemcount2 
&lt;/source&gt;

==Dictionary notation==
Dictionaries may be created directly or converted from sequences.
Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, &lt;tt&gt;{}&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'city':'Paris', 'age':38, (102,1650,1601):'A matrix coordinate'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq = [('city','Paris'), ('age', 38), ((102,1650,1601),'A matrix coordinate')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'city': 'Paris', 'age': 38, (102, 1650, 1601): 'A matrix coordinate'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(seq)
{'city': 'Paris', 'age': 38, (102, 1650, 1601): 'A matrix coordinate'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d == dict(seq)
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Also, dictionaries can be easily created by zipping two sequences.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq1 = ('a','b','c','d')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq2 = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(zip(seq1,seq2))
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'd': 4}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Operations on Dictionaries==
The operations on dictionaries are somewhat unique. Slicing is not supported, since the items have no intrinsic order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'a':1,'b':2, 'cat':'Fluffers'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.keys()
['a', 'b', 'cat']
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.values()
[1, 2, 'Fluffers']
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['a']
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['cat'] = 'Mr. Whiskers'
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['cat']
'Mr. Whiskers'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'cat' in d
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'dog' in d
False
&lt;/source&gt;

==Combining two Dictionaries==
You can combine two dictionaries by using the update method of the primary dictionary. Note that the update method will merge existing elements if they conflict.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'apples': 1, 'oranges': 3, 'pears': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; ud = {'pears': 4, 'grapes': 5, 'lemons': 6}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(ud)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'grapes': 5, 'pears': 4, 'lemons': 6, 'apples': 1, 'oranges': 3}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Deleting from dictionary==
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
del dictionaryName[membername]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
Write a program that:
#Asks the user for a string, then creates the following dictionary. The values are the letters in the string, with the corresponding key being the place in the string. 
#Replaces the entry whose key is the integer 3, with the value &quot;Pie&quot;.
#Asks the user for a string of digits, then prints out the values corresponding to those digits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Integration management is a collection of processes required to ensure that the various elements of the projects are properly coordinated. It involves making trade-offs among competing objectives and alternatives to meet or exceed stakeholder needs and expectations.

Comprised of:

;Project plan development 
:Integrating and coordinating all project plans to create a consistent, coherent document

;Project plan execution
:Carrying out the project plan, according to the strategy, plan and activities as per the plan

What is  a plan?
 A scheme, program, or method worked out beforehand for the accomplishment of an objective: a plan of attack.
 A proposed or tentative project or course of action: had no plans for the evening.
 A systematic arrangement of elements or important parts; a configuration or outline: a seating plan; the plan of a story.

Planned, Planning, Plans 
 To formulate a scheme or program for the accomplishment, enactment, or attainment of: plan a campaign.
 To have as a specific aim or purpose; intend: They plan to buy a house.
 To draw or make a graphic representation of.
What  are the main purposes of a project plan?

Top 10 Reasons Projects Fail 
 Inadequately trained and /or inexperienced project managers 
 Failure to set and manage expectations 
 Poor leadership at any and all levels 
 Failure to adequately identify , document and track requirements 
 Poor plans and planning processes 
 Poor effort estimation 
 Cultural and ethical misalignment
 Misalignment between the project team and the business or other organizations it serves
 Inadequate or misused methods 
 Inadequate communication , including progress tracking and reporting

In any project, the good things for the project do not happen just like that, where as bad things can. For a project to progress and get over  on time, within budget and with required quality, the project steps need to be planned well in advance, and who will do, what, when should be decided well in advance. For any team to be successful, the following 14 points are very important;

Application of Q12 practices in project planning  

If the clan can assure the meeting of the following objectives, then it can be termed as a good plan 
Bring clarity into the work of each team member (Do I know what is expected me?) 
Ensure material, equipment, skills, knowledge availability to the team, to do their work properly (Do I have the material and equipment I need to do my work right?) 
Ensure that, as far as possible, the work allocated is matching to the team members liking and skill set (Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?) 
Ensure better communication within the team, so that good work gets the recognition it deserves (In the last 7 days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?) 
Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
Ensure , while doing the project work, the team member develops as a professional (Is there someone at work who encourages my development?) 
Ensure, a culture of open communication and every body gets their turn to share (At work do my opinions seem to count?) 
Ensure that the road-map is clear to all (Does the charter of my project make me feel, my job is important?)
Facilitate individual excellence along with team excellence (Are my co-workers, committed to doing quality work?) 
Create an environment of trust (Do I have a best friend at work?) 
Ensure that, everyone gets proper feedback on their performance and the teams performance (In the last six months, has someone talked with me about my progress?) 
Ensure that every one advances in their career (This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?)

Constraints 

Factors that limit the project team's options 

Most of the projects are operated under the triple constraints of scope / schedule / cost. when the scope increases the schedule increases along with cost. Hence there is always a tradeoff between these constraints.  Other examples of constraints can be;
legal policies of the land in which the project is executed 
geographical conditions 
cultural issues  etc..

Assumptions 
Some of the examples of assumptions are;
It is assumed that the test team is available to test the product, when the development is completed 
It is assumed that, training will be provided to those who are new to the technology, within two weeks of the start of the project 
It is assumed that the schools are closed during winter, hence the buildings can be utilized by the project team 

Baseline 
Original project plan with the approved changes. A baseline is required to track the progress of the project from the approved plan. Can there be multiple baselines?  the answer is 'yes'. Project baselines may be changed by formally approved changes, but the evolution of the baseline should be documented.

What is a change control system? 
A typical change control system will have the following components;
change request form 
change approval process 
capture of change implementation information
change control boards 
change communication system 
What is configuration management?
In  projects different work products gets generated during the course of the project and these evolve as the project progresses. One of the critical challenges in projects (especially product development) is to keep track of  the versions of the work products going into any release.  This is accomplished by a configuration management system. Typical components of a configuration management system are;
Version numbering system 
Repository for storing / pointing to the work products and their interdependencies 
Check in forms / system 
Check out forms / systems 
What are the triggers for project plan updation? 
It can be anything under the sun!  Some of the  major causes are listed below;
Project work deviates drastically from planned work due to;
Improper requirements / changing requirements 
Improper design 
Insufficient skill sets 
Insufficient scheduling knowledge 
Insufficient tracking  etc 
Project scope changes 
Non availability of critical resources on time 
Organizational priority changes 
Project plan updates require approval from sponsor  and is normally done immediately after a project review (It is not something a project manager can do as and when he/she feels so. In that case it will affect project tracking due to  moving dates and the team also can take the planned completion dates casually, eventually making the project a bleeding project.
What  do you mean by lessons learned in project management?
The meaning of lessons learned is 'lessons learned'  in project management also. Since projects are temporary endeavors, it brings with it additional challenges like;
The same individual contributor repeating the same mistake in the next project also
The issues got addressed in one project, continue to happen in another project due to lack of communication 
The lessons learned forgotten by the time the team moves on to the next phase of the project

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene expression is the first stage of a process that decodes what the DNA holds in a cell. It is the expression of a gene that gives rise to a protein. 

'''How does gene expression occur?'''

Genetic expression is a wide complex process. It must be regulated by a series of mechanisms. 

It starts off with transcription that gives rise to the RNA messenger (RNAm) from DNA. The RNAm in prokariotes is coupled with several ribosomes which are responsibles of translating proteins. 

In eukariotes RNAm that is made from DNA is immature, and it is called preRNAm. PreRNAm loses non-coding sections (called exons), becoming into an RNAm mature. RNAm is coupled to ribosomes on Rough Endoplasmatic Reticle (RER) where translation happens. Translation is made when a new polypeptide is formed. The genetic code indeed says the order of pe polypeptides, but it doesn't give us a clue about it's tridimensional structure. Tridimensional structure is given by post-translational processes.

Translation occurs following transcription wherein the protein synthesis machinery gets into action and  uses its tools to read out the message that the RNA holds.

There are some genes known to be without coding proteins. Yet, they work as regulation sequences in a cell. In this case, the sequences can enhance coding (called &quot;enhancers&quot;) or they can inhibit (called &quot;repressors&quot;). When a protein is coupled with these genes, a substrate or hormone, they join together.

In pluricellular organisms only few cells are allowed to produce a certain type of protein; e.g.: Haemoglobin is encoded in every cell of a mammal organism (it includes humans), but only precursors of red blood cells are allowed to express it (red blood cells are not allowed to express it, because they lose their nucleus). However, the enhancers and repressors are present in every cell of a mammal


'''Genetic Information'''

In nature, there is information found in all living cells. Different cultures have often studied this information and used various forms of recording techniques to display it. Ancient Egyptians, in particular, referred to this information and its records as &quot;provider of attributes&quot; and determined it ||| to mean several, and that was earlier in human history of recording something that was known about nature. 

There were often other signs as well that accompanied Egyptian writings on the source of this &quot;information key of life&quot;. Among them were double, water and wick of twisted flax. But the most central one, for modern science, of course, was the snake like determinative that meant a worm or serpent in the limit of life. This limit, water, was &quot;N&quot; meaning that something or someone is, the essence which would be referred to by the Greeks as &quot;esse&quot; or &quot;ens&quot;, and in today's English terms, the &quot;essence&quot;.
  
In anthropology, the language of gene expression is rooted in the sources of knowledge that Odhiambo Siangla of Kenya has called &quot;rieko&quot; and Jeremy Narby of Switzeland has termed the &quot;cosmic serpent&quot;. Both Siangla and Narby are not only experts in cultures but are trained in communication and expression. And from both the key has been the &quot;three letter word&quot;. 
 
In the alphabet of the three letter word found in cell biology are the organic bases, which are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). It is the triplet recipe of these bases that make up the ‘dictionary’ we call in molecular biology genetic code.

The codal system enables the transmission of genetic information to be codified, which at the molecular level, is conveyed through genes. 

What is gene ? A gene is a region of DNA that produces a functional RNA molecule. If a region of DNA is not functional, that region is not a transmissible form of information for protein synthesis. And because the information is not transmissible, it is not readily functional. There are various sizes of gene. The first recorded attempts to imagine the very small was the Horus Eye, which is also a pristine idea of limit. Today we talk about bases. The insulin gene, for example, has 1.7 x &lt;math&gt;10^3&lt;/math&gt;, about 1700 nucleotides. There exists a receptor gene known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This protein has 4.5 x&lt;math&gt;10^4&lt;/math&gt; nucleotides.  In terms of nucleotides this (LDL) approximates to 45,000 nucleotides. Now, with the dystrophic gene as another example, we find the nucleotides to be around 2.0 x&lt;math&gt;10^8&lt;/math&gt;, approximately 200,000,000 nucleotides in number.

Now, the introns. It is the noncoding regions of DNA that are called introns meaning the “intervening sequences”. Introns make up a greater part of the nucleotide sequences of a gene. The coding regions are called exons to mean “expression sequences”. They constitute a minority of the nucleotide progression of a DNA and they instruct cellular workshops for the formation of proteins via amino acids.

Through proteins, the expression of genetic information is achieved. In particular are the enzymes. Even during the ancient time the enzymes were understood and utilized well. The enzymes catalyze the chemical reactions of anabolic kind, that is, the building of cellular food and those of catabolic type, the braking down of food. The two processes are collectively termed metabolism. What, further, can we add about proteins?

We can further say that proteins are concentration of heteropolymers manufactured from amino acids. There are 20 amino acids used in synthesizing natural proteins. It is clear that a protein may consist of many, in fact, several hundred amino acid sediments. It is essentially unlimited in number to speak about how many different proteins we can make from combinations of amino acids. Mathematics explains it well. There is therefore a diverse set of proteins whose forms and functions can be achieved by means of a coding system explained below.

Genetic information flows unidirectional, from DNA to protein and with messenger RNA (mRNA) as intermediate. First, DNA encodes genetic information into an RNA molecule. This is called transcription (TC) of the information. Then the information gets converted into proteins, being named here translation (TL). It is this concept of information current that is called the Central Dogma of molecular biology. The Central Dogma is the fundamental theme in our exploration on gene articulation.

In order to complete the picture, we can add two further aspects of information flow. We can add duplication of the genetic material, which occurs prior to cell division. And that a DNA, in this case, represents duplication process, —DNA transfer. Wherefore in this case it is known as DNA replication. But where some viruses have RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material, we speak about reverse transcription (RT). With this transcription, we get a DNA molecule as a copy of the viral RNA genome.

In other words, genetic information, whether historically traced world wide (Narby,1998) or particularly assigned to ancient Africa (Siangla,1997) involves gene expression. Both DNA and RNA are polynucleotides, where nucleotides are the monomer—building units, which are composed of three basic subunits called nitrogenous base, sugar, and phosphoric acid. Genetic information is contained in DNA. The genetic code in DNA expresses the connection between the polynucleotide alphabet of four bases and 20 amino acids. In one strand of the parental DNA molecule, there is a dictated amino acid sequence strictly for protein production.

We will discuss in the next few postings, a relatively detailed understanding of the polymerization of amino acids sequence as directed by base sequences of messenger RNA.

At the moment, though, let us note that protein synthesis is an expression of genetic information. Protein synthesis is the cellular procedure, as we have said, of making proteins and involves two main processes: Transcription and Translation. The two processes mean that the direction of the synthesis is from DNA to RNA and then from RNA to protein respectively. Is this true to all organisms?

Yes. With a few exceptions, which are in mitochondria, and as stated above, some viruses become exceptions to this order because in their genetic material, they have RNA instead of DNA as their initial information source. However it is true that in all organisms, methods that relate the nucleotide sequence in messenger RNA to the amino acid sequence in proteins (genetic code proper) are the same. For in the given exceptions there occurs reverse transcription (RT). With that viral example of transcription noted, we get DNA molecular information being copied from the genome of viral RNA.

Building on this clue that is provided by transcription processes, we can readily see that a three-nucleotide sense codon denotes each amino acid. For example, UUU specifies phenylalanine, UCU specifies serine and GCA specifies alanine. But UAC and UAU both specify tyrosine. We will speak more about this tyrosine when expanding cell biology in the study of melanin. 

Here now are other ways to see the remaining three properties of the genetic code. One is the contiguous property. With this property the codons do not overlap and at the same time they do not separated by spacers. The other is degenerate property in which there is more than one codon for some amino acids as exemplified by tyrosine in the above paragraph. And finally, there is the unambiguous property. With this genetic code of unambiguity, each codon specifies only one amino acid.

'''Hypothetical'''&lt;br /&gt;

The science of Astronomy relies on universality of Physical laws. &quot;Same in the heavens as on earth&quot;. The world of stellar objects presents us with stupendously larger scales of agglomeration of matter and energy, at which to appy the known laws. Thus we are led to new predictions of entities that have never been observed before.  Likewise some species of elementary particles and certain states of matter never observed on Earth need to be postulated in order to accord with observations. Some objects and phenomena falling in such categories and awaiting confirmation or further observational details are in this list. Eventually we expect them to be confirmed in all detail. If they contradict our predictions or conflict with phenomena known on Earth, well that would be even more exciting because that would be a new discovery awaiting explanation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added a concrete example of a nonlinear transformation S early on:

&quot;For example, the transformation ''S'' (whose input and output are both vetors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) defined by

&lt;math&gt;S\mathbf{x} = S\begin{pmatrix} x \\
                                     y  \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}  xy\\
                                                                        cos(y)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is non-linear (for example, it does not fix the origin). Linear transformations are easy to study, and ''any'' transformation is nearly linear if one looks at it closely enough, i.e. zooms in on it. Hence one can shed light on complicated nonlinear transformations by studying easier, linear ones.&quot;

hopefully this is a good idea? i found that when i first learned about linear transformations i had little motivation as to why we study them. do apologise if i'm messing someone's book up! rmijic

== Some TODOs ==

This page needs some notes on null space/column space and rank/nullity.  (Nullity is already briefly mentioned.)

== The Point ==
The thing that makes this article so important is that it describes in relatively readable terms why matrices exist and what matrix multiply is for. Prior to reading this I had wondered for years why anyone would invent something as convoluted as matrix math, despite having taken a course in linear algebra. One of the major problems with math articles in wiki* and elsewhere is that the articles are almost always written on a level far higher than the subject matter. They are written by people familiar with the material for people who have already learned it and just need a refresher (undoubtedly this is usually unintentional). Thus it is a very steep learning curve for those trying to learn new material.

My point is simply this: If you are going to edit or add onto this sort of article, please remember to make your additions couched in the simplest terms you can without diluting the material.
As Einstein said:
&quot;Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.&quot;
[[User:Anuran|Anuran]] 15:44, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

== preserves identity ==

&quot;preserves identity: T0 = 0&quot; .... um surely this is preserving the null vector?  non-trivial linear transformations do not preserve the identity, this might be confusing?  Sorry, too far out of my field to correct personally.

==  Isomorphism ==
It has been written that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism if it is bijective and an inverse exists (among other conditions).

But if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is bijective, then its inverse does exist, doesn't it?</text>

Celestia's source code is freely available on [http://celestia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/celestia/  SourceForge].
Only official Celestia developers can upload modified code to the SourceForge server, but anyone can download the code and modify it for their own purposes. If you would like to contribute code to the project, please discuss it on the [http://shatters.net/forum/  Celestia Web Forum] in its [http://shatters.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=4  Development Forum].


The following pages describe how to obtain the code and modify it for specific operating systems.

* [[Celestia/Development/Linux platform|Linux]]

* [[Celestia/Development/MacOS platform|MacOS X]]

* [[Celestia/Development/Windows Vista platform|Windows Vista]]

* [[Celestia/Development/Win32 platform|Windows XP 32bit]] &amp; Win7 64bit

* [[Celestia/Development/Qt4|Qt4 Cross-platform Gui for Celestia v1.7+]] {{stage short|00%}}

A sociological comment: 
:As with most software projects with established developer communities and protocols, a potential contributor to Celestia will have to undergo a form of apprenticeship. The program is large and complex and its underlying design philosophy has to be understood. It also takes a while to gain the trust of the people currently working on the program. By themselves, programming skills aren't enough. Too often individuals unfamiliar with the program or with the people involved have suggested significant changes and have become discouraged because their ideas weren't incorporated immediately. Don't let this happen to you. Read the forum. Read the developers mailing list. Participate in discussions. Contribute ideas. Try out things with the code on your own. Be patient. It'll take a while.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Celestia development options using Windows-32 software packages:

==Subversion (svn)==

Celestia's source code is available on a Subversion (SVN) repository hosted on [http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=21302 SourceForge]. 

Several Subversion clients are available for Windows. A very popular one is [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN], a Windows shell extension that lets you use SVN commands right from Windows Explorer. A command line version is available with [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin].

To get the latest Celestia source using the command line client, cd to the desired directory and then issue the command

 svn co https://celestia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/celestia/trunk

With Tortoise SVN, select 'Checkout' from the Windows Explorer popup menu, and then enter this URL:

 https://celestia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/celestia/trunk

==Microsoft C++ &amp;amp; SDK tools for Windows XP and Windows 7==

In order to build software for Windows, you need both an SDK (Software Development Kit) and a compiler. The SDK provides libraries and include files needed for building for a particular version of Windows. The compiler converts text files into binary programs, linking them to the SDK libraries. Microsoft provides free versions of their SDKs and compilers, although with limited features, in order to encourage development of software for use with their operating systems. They also sell enhanced versions for use by commercial software development organizations.

===VS2010===

Currently, there is no Visual Studio 2010 solution checked into the subversion repository. If you have VS2010, you will have several unsupported steps to perform, in addition to the steps outlined for previous versions of Visual Studio.
* First, VS2010 will convert the previous version's project files into VS2010 format. These converted versions will have mismatching $(TargetFile) and linker output file definitions. These will have to be manually reconciled. One choice is to set the General project property &quot;Target Name&quot; to &quot;$(ProjectName)&quot; and the linker property &quot;Output File&quot; to &quot;$(OutDir)$(TargetName)$(TargetExt)&quot;. This will allow you to build, but it will not run. 
* Second, and most significantly, the static libraries zlib and libpng in the repository are compiled to work only with the redistributable runtime dlls for VS2008, namely msvcm90.dll, msvcp90.dll and msvcr90.dll. These runtimes are incompatible with VS2010, so you will have to obtain zlib and libpng (and the debug versions) that will run with 2010. The easiest way to do this may be to grab the sources from sourceforge, build them yourself, put the new libs in windows\lib\x86, and change the entries in the linker's &quot;Additional Dependencies&quot; property.
* Finally, you must ensure that the celestia.exe and the dlls in windows\dll are copied into $(ProjectDir), and that the Debugging &quot;Command&quot; property is set to &quot;$(ProjectDir)\$(TargetFileName)&quot; and the &quot;Working Directory&quot; property is set to $(ProjectDir).

There may be other steps to perform, depending upon the versions of zlib and libpng that you obtain.

===VS2008===

In December 2007, Microsoft released Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition. As of Celestia version 1.6.0, this is the only version of the compiler recommended for building Celestia. Note that Visual C++ 2008 will not run on Windows 98. ''For this reason only'', you may want to use Visual Studio 2005. If you have Windows 2000, XP, Vista or 7, compiling is much easier with Visual C++ 2008.

* If you do not already have Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, you may download it for free from here:

: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/express/future/bb421473

When installing VS C++ 2008 SP1 using the Web installation , it automatically downloads and installs all of the correct SDK libraries, too. This happens under both Windows XP, 32bit, and Windows 7, 64bit. The SDK does not need to be downloaded or installed separately.

* If you also need the Windows SDK, it is a free download from Microsoft:

:http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6E1C3DF-A74F-4207-8586-711EBE331CDC&amp;displaylang=en

===Step by step instructions for Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition===

These instructions work for both Windows XP and Windows 7.

This process assumes that you've followed the steps above, checked out the source from SVN, and installed the Visual C++ compiler and Windows SDK.

# Copy iconv.dll, intl.dll and lua5.1.dll from trunk\celestia\windows\dll\x86 into  trunk\celestia
#* Celestia is a 32bit x86 application. There are no x64 libraries.
# Open celestia.sln in Microsoft Visual C++.Net 2008 and allow the updater to work.
#* In other words, select (double-click on) celestia.sln in the directory trunk\celestia
# Set the build type to &quot;Release&quot;. (The project provided from svn has it set to &quot;Debug&quot;)
#* Specifically, in the line of icons across the top of the VisualStudio window, where it initially says &quot;Debug&quot;, open its dropdown menu and select &quot;Release&quot;
# Build!
#* Open the menu &quot;Build&quot; and select &quot;Rebuild Solution&quot;

===VS2005===

''Recommended only for users of Windows 98/ME, where the Visual C++ 2008 is not supported. If you are running XP, Vista or 7, you should use the much easier process described in the previous section.''

* Windows Platform SDK: Web Install

:http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0BAF2B35-C656-4969-ACE8-E4C0C0716ADB&amp;displaylang=en

* Windows Platform SDK: disk image

:http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e15438ac-60be-41bd-aa14-7f1e0f19ca0d&amp;DisplayLang=en

* Visual Studio 2005 Express C++: Web install

* Visual Studio 2005 Express C++: disk image

:http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/express/aa718401.aspx

===Celestia libraries for VS2005 ===

The libraries in the Celestia repository were built with VS2008, and will not work on Windows 98/ME:

Celestia Libraries for Visual Studio 2005 Express:

:http://www.shatters.net/~claurel/celestia/winbuild/

* As of October, 2007, use 
** cspice.lib
** winbuild-2.zip
** winlibs-2.zip

:Several source code files have been added to Celestia's svn repository since winbuild-2.zip was created. Insert these lines into the OBJS section of celestia/src/celengine/engine.mak if you're using makerelease.bat to build from the current subversion repository:
 
        $(INTDIR)\axisarrow.obj \
        $(INTDIR)\customrotation.obj \
        $(INTDIR)\frametree.obj \
        $(INTDIR)\precession.obj \
        $(INTDIR)\scriptrotation.obj \ 
        $(INTDIR)\timeline.obj \
        $(INTDIR)\timelinephase.obj \

:The SPICE include files are included in winlibs-2.zip. 

:No binary DLLs (Dynamically Loaded Libraries) are included in these Zip files, so you'll have to get them from one of the precompiled Celestia installation kits. As of January 26, 2008, use the DLLs which are included in Celestia v1.5.0. The official release of Celestia v1.5.0 is available on [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21302 SourceForge].


The version of Celestia that's included in the Windows Celestia distribution kits is compiled using the script makerelease.bat. The older VS2003 versions of the build scripts are still what are in the cvs archive on SourceForge. The makefiles and .bat scripts which have been updated for VS2005/VS2008 are included in winbuild-2.zip &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow&quot;&gt;[Remark: There is no makerelease.bat in winbuild-2.zip]&lt;/span&gt;, which is in the VS2005 winbuild directory shown above.

Don't forget that you'll have to configure the PATH, LIB and INCLUDE environment variables according to your particular development environment so that the build scripts will find the Visual Studio and Celestia programs, include files and libraries.

Here's one example .BAT script for defining the search lists. It probably won't work for you: you probably have put the files in different directories. Change it appropriately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't like this writing style very much. The content seems empty and little more than little thought-provoking limericks you might expect to find in a &quot;deep thoughts&quot; calendar. This is not what logic is. It seems more like a college students attempt to convince the world that he has accomplished something in his life.

Celestia code development now uses Subversion (SVN). CVS no longer works.
For details of building Celestia under Windows, please read the page [[Celestia/Development/Win32 platform|Windows XP 32bit &amp; Windows 7, 64bit]]



Acquiring Celestia CVS with TortoiseCVS (by Wcomer)

'''Celestia no longer uses CVS. Use ToroiseSVN instead.'''

# Download the latest version here: (1-2 min, 3.7 MB) http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml 
# Follow the TortoiseCVS installation instructions. Note – you may be asked to reboot your machine but in my experience this wasn’t necessary. 
# Create a new folder on your hard drive. Mine is called “C:\TortoiseCVS”. This will be your CVS repository 
# Right-click your CVS repository folder and select “CVS Checkout”. If you do not see this option, then you must reboot your machine and try again. 
# Enter “:pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/celestia” as your CVSROOT. This should cause several other fields to fill in: 
## Protocol - “Password server (:pserver:)”;
## Server – “celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net”; 
## Repository folder – “/cvsroot/celestia”; 
## User name – “anonymous”. 
# Enter “celestia” as your Module. 
# Press OK. Now the CVS client will attempt to download the Celestia source code. Expect the download time to be about 20 minutes mostly because the CVS server is a bit slow. If it is successful then there will be a subfolder called “celestia” within your CVS repository which will contain the current Celestia CVS archive.
## The checkout process may timeout, especially if you started it during a time of heavy traffic (that's late in the evening if accessing from Europe). You can continue the checkout at any time. Tortoise will restart with the incompletely checked out directory. 
## If you normally use a dialup modem, you may safely do the initial checkout at an external broadband access and then copy the complete CVS directory to your local computer. Tortoise marks all CVS directories and will recognize the copied one instantly. Subsequent checkouts are usually only some dozen kB in size, and can be easily accessed from a dialup line.


Also, download the Windows-specific shared libraries that aren't
included with Celestia on SourcForge. The libraries for use with Visual Studio 2003 are at http://shatters.net/celestia/files/winlibs-new.zip
Unzip these files and put them in a directory with the other
library files.

==Before we begin==
{{TOC right}}
Before we discuss topological spaces in their full generality, we will first turn our attention to a special type of topological space, a  metric space.  This abstraction has a huge and useful family of special cases, and it therefore deserves special attention.  Also, the abstraction is picturesque and accessible; it will subsequently lead us to the full abstraction of a topological space.

==Metric Space==
===Definition===
A [[w:Metric_space|metric space]] is a [[w:Ordered_pair|Cartesian pair]] &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty [[w:set|set]] and &lt;math&gt;d: X \times X \rightarrow [0, \infty) &lt;/math&gt;,  is a function which is called the ''metric'' which satisfies the requirement that  for all &lt;math&gt;a, b, c \in X&lt;/math&gt;:

#&lt;math&gt;\ d(a, b) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\ d(a, b) = d(b, a)&lt;/math&gt; (symmetry)
#&lt;math&gt;\ d(a, c) \le d(a, b) + d(b, c)&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Triangle_inequality|''triangle inequality'']])

Note that some authors do not require metric spaces to be non-empty. We annotate &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; when we talk of a metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples===
* An important example is the discrete metric. It may be defined on any non-empty set X as follows &lt;math&gt;
d(x,y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
 1 &amp; \text{if } x \neq y\\
 0 &amp; \text{if } x = y\\
  \end{array} \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

* On the set of  real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = |x-y|\,&lt;/math&gt; (The absolute distance between x and y). &lt;BR&gt; To prove that this is indeed a metric space, we must show that ''d'' is really a metric.  To begin with, &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = |x - y| \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for any 
real numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
** &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = |x - y| = 0 \iff (x - y) = 0 \or -(x - y) = 0 \iff x = y&lt;/math&gt;.
** &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = |x - y| = |y - x| = d(y,x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;d(x,z) = |x - z| = |x - y + y - z| = |(x - y) + (y - z)| \le |x - y| + |y - z| = d(x,y) + d(y,z)&lt;/math&gt;

* On the plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; as the space, and let &lt;math&gt;d((x_{1}, y_1),(x_{2}, y_2)) = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt; 

This is the euclidean distance between &lt;math&gt;(x_{1}, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_{2}, y_{2})&lt;/math&gt;).

* We can generalize the two preceding examples.  Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a [[w:Normed vector space|normed vector space]] (over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;). We can define the metric to be: &lt;math&gt; d(x, y) = || x - y ||\,&lt;/math&gt;. Thus every normed vector space is a metric space.

* For the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; we have an interesting norm. Let &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = (y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n)&lt;/math&gt; two vectors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  We define the ''[[w:Norm (mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]]'': &lt;math&gt;||x||_p = (\sum_{i=1}^n {|x_i|^p})^{\frac{1}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;. For each ''p''-norm there is a metric based on it. Interesting cases of ''p'' are:
** &lt;math&gt;p = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. The metric is &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = ||x - y||_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n {|x_i-y_i|}&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;p = 2\,&lt;/math&gt;. The metric is good-old Euclid metric &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = ||x - y||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n {|x_i-y_i|^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;p = \infty&lt;/math&gt;. This is a bit surprising: &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = ||x - y||_\infty = \max_{i=1\ldots n}\{|x_i-y_i|\}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an exercise, you can prove that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}{||x||_p} = \max_{i=1\ldots n}\{|x_i|\}&lt;/math&gt; thus justifying the definition of &lt;math&gt;||\cdot||_\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

* The [[w:great-circle distance|great-circle distance]] between two points on a sphere is a metric.

* The Hilbert space is a metric space on the space of infinite sequences {a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;} such that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_k^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; converges, with a metric d({a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}, {b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;})=&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (a_i-b_i)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

* The concept of the [[w:Erdős number|Erdős number]] suggests a metric on the set of all mathematicians.  Take ''x'' and ''y'' to be two mathematicians, and define ''d(x, y)'' as 0 if ''x'' and ''y'' are the same person; 1 if ''x'' and ''y'' have co-authored a paper; ''n'' if the shortest sequence &lt;math&gt;(\{x, a_1\}, \{a_1, a_2\}, ..., \{a_{n-1}, y\})&lt;/math&gt;, where each step pairs two people who have co-authored a paper, is of length ''n''; or ∞ if ''x &amp;ne; y'' and no such sequence exists.  &lt;p&gt;This metric is easily generalized to any reflexive relation (or undirected graph, which is the same thing).  &lt;p&gt;Note that if we instead defined ''d(x, y)'' as the sum of the Erdős numbers of ''x'' and ''y'', then ''d'' would not be a metric, as it would not satisfy &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if ''x'' = ''y'' = Stanisław Ulam, then ''d(x, y) = 2''.

=== Note ===
Throughout this chapter we will be referring to metric spaces. Every metric space comes with a metric function. Because of this, the metric function might not be mentioned explicitly. There are several reasons:
* We don't want to make the text too blurry.
* We don't have anything special to say about it.
* The space has a &quot;natural&quot; metric. E.g. the &quot;natural&quot; metric for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the euclidean metric &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;.

As this is a wiki, if for some reason you think the metric is worth mentioning, you can alter the text if it seems unclear (if you are sure you know what you are doing) or report it in the talk page.

== Open Ball ==
=== Motivation ===
The open ball is the building block of metric space topology. We shall define intuitive topological definitions through it (that will later be converted to the real topological definition), and convert (again, intuitively) calculus definitions of properties (like convergence and  continuity) to their topological definition. We shall try to show how many of the definitions of metric spaces can be written also in the &quot;language of open balls&quot;. Then we can instantly transform the definitions to topological definitions.

=== Definition ===
Given a metric space &lt;math&gt; (X, d) &lt;/math&gt; an &lt;b&gt;open [[w:Ball_(mathematics)|ball]]&lt;/b&gt; with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the set
:&lt;math&gt;B_r(p) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,p) &lt; r \}, (r \in \mathbb{R}^{+})&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively it is all the points in the space, that are less than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; distance from a certain point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Examples ===
Why is this called a [[w:Ball_(mathematics)|ball]]? Let's look at the case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;d ((x_1,x_2,x_3),(y_1,y_2,y_3)) = \sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2 + (x_2-y_2)^2 + (x_3-y_3)^2}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Therefore &lt;math&gt;B_r ((0,0,0))&lt;/math&gt; is exactly &lt;math&gt;{x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + {x_3}^2 &lt; r^2 &lt;/math&gt; - The [[w:Ball_(mathematics)|ball]] with &lt;math&gt;(0,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; at center, of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt; the ball is called ''open'', because it does not contain the [[w:Sphere|sphere]] (&lt;math&gt;{x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + {x_3}^2 = r^2 &lt;/math&gt;).

The '''Unit ball''' is a ball of radius 1. Lets view some examples of the &lt;math&gt;B_1((0, 0))&lt;/math&gt; unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with different p-norm induced metrics. The unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with the norm &lt;math&gt;||\cdot ||_p&lt;/math&gt; is:  &lt;math&gt;B_1((0, 0)) = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid d((x,y),(0,0)) &lt; 1 \} &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \{(x,y) \mid ||(x,y)-(0,0)||_p &lt; 1 \} = \{(x,y) \mid ||(x,y)||_p &lt; 1 \} &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \{(x,y) \mid \sqrt[p]{|x|^p + |y|^p} &lt; 1\} &lt;/math&gt;
* The metric induced by &lt;math&gt;||\cdot ||_1&lt;/math&gt; in that case, the unit ball is: &lt;math&gt;|x| + |y| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:D1-unitball.svg]]
* The metric induced by &lt;math&gt;||\cdot ||_2&lt;/math&gt; in that case, the unit ball is: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:D2-unitball.svg]]
* The metric induced by &lt;math&gt;||\cdot ||_\infty&lt;/math&gt; in that case, the unit ball is: &lt;math&gt;\max\{|x| , |y|\} &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Dmax-unitball.svg]]

As we have just seen, the unit ball does not have to look like a real ball. In fact sometimes the unit ball can be one dot:
* The discrete metric, The unit ball is &lt;math&gt;B_1((0, 0)) = \{d((0,0),(x,y)) &lt; 1\} = \{d((0,0),(x,y))  = 0 \} = \{(0,0)\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Interior of a Set ==
=== Definitions ===
'''Definition''': We say that x is an &lt;U&gt;interior point&lt;/U&gt; of A [[w:iff|iff]] there is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that: &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. 
This intuitively means, that x is really 'inside' A - because it is contained in a ball inside A - it is not near the boundary of A.

'''Definition''': The &lt;U&gt;[[w:Interior_(topology)|'''interior''']]&lt;/U&gt; of a set A is the set of all the interior points of A. The interior of a set A is marked &lt;math&gt;int(A)&lt;/math&gt;. 
Useful notations: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}(S)=\{x\in S|x\text{ is an interior point of }S\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{int}(S)=\cup \{A\subseteq S|A\text{ is open }\!\!\}\!\!\text{ }&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Properties ===
Some basic properties of int (For any sets A,B):
* &lt;math&gt;int(A) \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;int(int(A)) = int(A)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;int(A \cap B) = int(A) \cap int(B)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \Rightarrow int(A) \subseteq int(B)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;U&gt;Proof of the first:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
We need to show that: &lt;math&gt; x\in int(A) \Rightarrow x \in A&lt;/math&gt;. But that's easy! by definition, we have that &lt;math&gt;x\in B_\epsilon(x)\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;U&gt;Proof of the second:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
In order to show that  &lt;math&gt;int(int(A)) = int(A)\,&lt;/math&gt;, we need to show that  &lt;math&gt;int(int(A)) \subseteq int(A)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;int(int(A)) \supseteq int(A)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR&gt;
The &quot; &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;&quot; direction is already proved: if for any set A, &lt;math&gt;int(A) \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, then by taking &lt;math&gt;int(A)&lt;/math&gt; as the set in question, we get  &lt;math&gt;int(int(A)) \subseteq int(A)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;
The &quot; &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt;&quot; direction:&lt;BR&gt;
let &lt;math&gt;x \in int(A)&lt;/math&gt;. We need to show that &lt;math&gt;x \in int(int(A))&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;x\in int(A)&lt;/math&gt; then there is a ball &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Now, every point y, in the ball &lt;math&gt;B_\frac{\epsilon}{2}(x) &lt;/math&gt; an internal point to A (inside &lt;math&gt;int(A)&lt;/math&gt;), because there is a ball around it, inside A: &lt;math&gt;y \in 
B_\frac{\epsilon}{2}(x) \Rightarrow B_\frac{\epsilon}{2}(y) \subset B_\epsilon(x) \subset A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;
We have that &lt;math&gt;x\in B_\frac{\epsilon}{2}(x) \subset int(A)&lt;/math&gt; (because every point in it is inside &lt;math&gt;int(A)&lt;/math&gt;) and by definition &lt;math&gt;x \in int(int(A))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;
Hint: To understand better, draw to yourself &lt;math&gt;x, B_\epsilon(x), B_\frac{\epsilon}{2}(x), y, B_\frac{\epsilon}{2}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof of the rest is left to the reader.

=== Reminder ===
* [a, b] : all the points x, such that &lt;math&gt;a \leq x \leq b &lt;/math&gt;
* (a, b) : all the points x, such that &lt;math&gt;a &lt; x &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===
For the metric space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (the line), we have:
* &lt;math&gt;int([a,b]) = (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;int((a,b]) = (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;int([a,b)) = (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;int((a,b)) = (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

Let's prove the first example (&lt;math&gt;int([a,b]) = (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;x\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; (that is: &lt;math&gt;a &lt; x &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;) we'll show that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an internal point.&lt;BR&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \min\{x - a , b - x \}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;x + \epsilon \leq x + b - x = b&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;x - \epsilon \geq x - x + a = a&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt; B_\epsilon(x) = (x - \epsilon, x + \epsilon) \subset (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;
We have shown now that every point '''x''' in &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is an internal point. Now what about the points &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; ? let's show that they are '''not''' internal points. If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; was an internal point of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, there would be a ball &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(a) \subset [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. But that would mean, that the point &lt;math&gt; a - \frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;U&gt;inside&lt;/U&gt; &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;. but because &lt;math&gt;  a - \frac{\epsilon}{2} &lt; a &lt;/math&gt; that is a contradiction. We show similarly that '''b''' is not an internal point.&lt;BR&gt;
To conclude, the set &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; contains '''all''' the internal points of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. And we can mark &lt;math&gt;int([a,b]) = (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

A set is said to be '''open''' in a metric space if it equals its interior (&lt;math&gt; A = Int(A)&lt;/math&gt;).  When we encounter topological spaces, we will generalize this definition of open.
However, this definition of open in metric spaces is the same as that as if we regard our
metric space as a topological space.  

'''Properties:'''
# The empty-set is an open set (by definition: &lt;math&gt;int(\emptyset)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;).
# An open ball is an open set.
# For any set B, int(B) is an open set. This is easy to see because: int(int(B))=int(B).
# If A,B are open, then &lt;math&gt;A\cap B&lt;/math&gt; is open.  Hence finite intersections of open sets are open.
# If &lt;math&gt;{A_i: i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; (for any set if indexes I) are open, then their union &lt;math&gt;\cup_{i\in I} A_i&lt;/math&gt; is open.

&lt;U&gt;Proof of 2:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt; be an open ball. Let &lt;math&gt;y \in B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;y \in B_{r-d(x,y)}(y) \subseteq B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;BR/&gt;
In the following drawing, the green line is &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and the brown line is &lt;math&gt;r-d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. We have found a ball to contain &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; inside &lt;math&gt;B_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Image:Openball_is_open.svg]]

&lt;U&gt;Proof of 4:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
A, B are open. we need to prove that &lt;math&gt;int(A \cap B) = A\cap B&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the first propriety of int, we only need to show that &lt;math&gt;int(A \cap B) \supseteq A\cap B&lt;/math&gt;, which means &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in A\cap B:x\in int(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x \in  A \cap B&lt;/math&gt;. We know also, that &lt;math&gt;x \in  int(A), x \in int(B)&lt;/math&gt; from the premises A, B are open and &lt;math&gt;x \in A, x \in B&lt;/math&gt; . That means that there
are balls: &lt;math&gt;B_{{\epsilon}_1}(x) \subset A, B_{{\epsilon}_2}(x) \subset B&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \min\{{\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2}\}&lt;/math&gt;, we have that  &lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon}(x) \subset A, B_{\epsilon}(x) \subset B \Rightarrow  B_{\epsilon}(x) \subset A\cap B &lt;/math&gt;. 
By the definition of an internal point we have that &lt;math&gt;x\in int(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the required ball).

Interestingly, this property does not hold necessarily for an infinite intersection of open sets. To see an example on the real line, let &lt;math&gt;A_n=\{(-1/n,1/n)\}&lt;/math&gt;. We then see that &lt;math&gt;\cap^\infty_{i=1}A_i=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; which is closed.

&lt;U&gt;Proof of 5:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
Proving that the union of open sets is open, is rather trivial: let &lt;math&gt;{A_i: i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; (for any set if indexes I) be a set of open sets.
we need to prove that  &lt;math&gt;int(\cup_{i\in I} A_i) \supseteq \cup_{i\in I} A_i&lt;/math&gt;: If &lt;math&gt;x\in A_i&lt;/math&gt; then it has a ball &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(x) \subset A_i \subseteq \cup_{i\in I} A_i&lt;/math&gt;. The same ball that made a point an internal point in &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; will make it internal in 
&lt;math&gt;\cup_{i\in I} A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proposition''': A set is open, if and only if it is a union of open-balls.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Proof:''' Let A be an open set. by definition, if &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; there there a ball &lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon_x}(x) \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. We can then compose A: &lt;math&gt;A = \cup_{x\in A}B_{\epsilon_x}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The equality is true because:  &lt;math&gt; \cup_{x\in A}B_{\epsilon_x}(x) \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A: B_{\epsilon_x}(x) \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \cup_{x\in A}B_{\epsilon_x}(x) \supseteq A&lt;/math&gt; in each ball we have the element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and we unite balls of all the elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR&gt;
On the other hand, a union of open balls is an open set, because ''every'' union of open sets is open.

===Examples===
* As we have seen, every open ball is an open set.
* For every space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the discrete metric, every set is open. 
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; be a set. we need to show, that if &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an internal point. Lets use the ball around &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with radius &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;B_\frac{1}{2}(x) = \{y\mid d(x,y) &lt; \frac{1}{2}\} = \{x\} \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an internal point.
* The space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with the regular metric. Every open segment &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is an open set. The proof of that is similar to the proof that &lt;math&gt;int([a,b]) = (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, that we have already seen.

===Theorem===
In any metric space &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, the following three statements hold:&lt;br&gt;
:1) The union of any number of open sets is open.&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;b&gt;Proof:&lt;/b&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of open sets, and let 
:::&lt;math&gt;x \in \cup C&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a &lt;math&gt;U \in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;. 
:::So there exists an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore 
:::&lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq \cup C&lt;/math&gt;. 
:2) The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open.&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;b&gt;Proof:&lt;/b&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \cap C&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a finite collection of open sets.
:::So &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;U \in C&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;C = {U_1,U_2,...,U_n}&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,3,...,n&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq U_i&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = min_i&lt;/math&gt;{&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;}. Therefore &lt;math&gt; \epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq \cap C&lt;/math&gt;. 
:3) The empty set and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; are both open.&lt;br&gt;

===Theorem===
In any metric space &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, the following statements hold:&lt;br&gt;
:1) The intersection of any number of closed sets is closed.&lt;br&gt;
:2) The union of a finite number of closed sets is closed.&lt;br&gt;

== Convergence  ==
=== Definition ===
First, Lets translate the calculus definition of convergence, to the &quot;language&quot; of metric spaces:
We say that a sequence  &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; that for each &lt;math&gt; n^* &gt; N&lt;/math&gt; the following holds: &lt;math&gt;d(x_{n^*},x) &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR/&gt;
Equivalently, we can define converges using Open-balls: A sequence  &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; If for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; that for each &lt;math&gt; n^* &gt; N&lt;/math&gt; the following holds: &lt;math&gt;x_{n^*} \in B_\epsilon(x)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The latter definition uses the &quot;language&quot; of open-balls, But we can do better - We can remove the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; from the definition of convergence, thus making the definition more topological. Let's ''define'' that &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; '''converges''' to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (and mark &lt;math&gt;x_n \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt;) , if for '''every ball''' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; , exists &lt;math&gt;N_B&lt;/math&gt; that for each &lt;math&gt; n^* &gt; N_B&lt;/math&gt; the following holds: &lt;math&gt;x_{n^*} \in B(x)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''limit'' of the sequence.

The definitions are all the same, but the latter uses topological terms, and can be easily converted to a topological definition later.

=== Properties ===
* If a sequence has a limit, it has only one limit.&lt;br/&gt;''Proof'' Let a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; have two limits, &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. If they are not the same, we must have &lt;math&gt;0&lt;d(x,x^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; be smaller than this distance. Now for some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, it must be the case that both &lt;math&gt;x_n \in B_{\epsilon / 2}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n \in B_{\epsilon / 2}(x^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; by virtue of the fact &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt; are limits. But this is impossible; the two balls are separate. Therefore the limits are coincident, that is, the sequence has only one limit.
* If &lt;math&gt;x_n \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt;, then almost by definition we get that &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, x) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;. (&lt;math&gt;d(x_n, x)&lt;/math&gt; Is the sequence of distances).

===Examples===
* In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with the natural metric, The series &lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. And we note it as follows: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
* Any space, with the discrete metric. A series &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, only if it is eventually constant. In other words: &lt;math&gt;x_n\rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt; If and only if, We can find &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; that for each &lt;math&gt; n^* &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_{n^*} = x&lt;/math&gt;
* An example you might already know:&lt;BR/&gt;
The space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; For any p-norm induced metric, when &lt;math&gt;p\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\vec{x_n} =  (x_{n,1},x_{n,2},\cdots, x_{n,k})&lt;/math&gt;. and let &lt;math&gt;\vec{x} =  (x_{1},x_{2},\cdots, x_{k})&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR/&gt; Then, &lt;math&gt;\vec{x_n} \rightarrow \vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; If and only if &lt;math&gt; \forall i, 1\leq i \leq k: x_{n,i} \rightarrow x_{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Uniform Convergence===
A sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;\{ f_n \}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be uniformly convergent on a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that when &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are both greater than &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;d(f_a(x),f_b(x)) &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;.

== Closed Sets ==
=== Closure ===
'''Definition''': The point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;U&gt;point of closure&lt;/U&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n, \forall n, a_n \in A&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;a_n \rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;

An equivalent '''definition''' using balls: The point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;U&gt;point of closure&lt;/U&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if for every open ball &lt;math&gt;B, p \in B&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;B \cap A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR/&gt;
The proof is left as an exercise.

Intuitively, a point of closure is arbitrarily  &quot;close&quot; to the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. It is so close, that we can find a sequence in the set that converges to any point of closure of the set.

'''Example''': Let A be the segment &lt;math&gt;[0,1) \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, The point &lt;math&gt;p = 1&lt;/math&gt; is not in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, but it is a point of closure: Let &lt;math&gt;a_n = 1 - \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;a_n \in A&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;a_n = 1 - \frac{1}{n} &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt; a_n \rightarrow 1 &lt;/math&gt; (that's because &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Definition''': The &lt;U&gt;closure&lt;/U&gt; of a  set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;({X},d)&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all points of closure. The closure of a set A is marked &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;. a quick proof: For every &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt;, Let &lt;math&gt;(a_n = x)\forall n&lt;/math&gt;.
==== Examples ====
For the metric space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (the line), and let &lt;math&gt;a,b \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; we have:
* &lt;math&gt;Cl([a,b]) = [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Cl((a,b]) = [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Cl([a,b)) = [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Cl((a,b)) = [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Closed set ===
'''Definition''': A set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;u&gt;closed&lt;/u&gt; in &lt;math&gt;{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A = Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;BR/&gt;
Meaning: A set is closed, if it contains all its point of closure.


An equivalent '''definition''' is: A set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;u&gt;closed&lt;/u&gt; in &lt;math&gt;{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; If for every point &lt;math&gt;p \in A&lt;/math&gt;, and for every Ball &lt;math&gt;B, p \in B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B \cap A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR/&gt;
The proof of this definition comes directly from the former definition and the definition of convergence.

=== Properties ===
Some basic properties of Cl (For any sets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt;):

* &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;Cl(Cl(A))=Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Cl(A \cup B) = Cl(A)\cup Cl(B)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A &lt;/math&gt; is closed iff &lt;math&gt;A = Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt;
* While the above implies that the union of finitely many closed sets is also a closed set, the same does not necessarily hold true for the union of infinitely many closed sets. To see an example on the real line, let &lt;math&gt;A_n=\{[-1+\frac{1}{n},1-\frac{1}{n}]\}&lt;/math&gt;. We see that &lt;math&gt;\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i=(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; fails to contain its points of closure, &lt;math&gt;\pm 1.&lt;/math&gt;
This union can therefore not be a closed subset of the real numbers.

The proofs are left to the reader as exercises. Hint for number 5: recall that 
&lt;math&gt;Cl(A)=\cap \{A\subseteq S|S\text{ is closed }\!\!\}\!\!\text{ }&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Open vs Closed ===
That is, an open set approaches its boundary but does not include it; whereas a closed set includes every point it approaches.  These two properties may seem mutually exclusive, but they are not:

* In any metric space &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is both open and closed.

* In any space with a discrete metric, every set is both open and closed.

* In &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;, under the regular metric, the only sets that are both open and closed are &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.  However, some sets are neither open nor closed.  For example, a half-open range like &lt;math&gt;[0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is neither open nor closed.  As another example, the set of rationals is not open because an open ball around a rational number contains irrationals; and it is not closed because there are sequences of rational numbers that converge to irrational numbers (such as the various infinite series that converge to &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;).

==== Complementary set ====
A Reminder/Definition: Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set in the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. We define the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.

A Quick example: let &lt;math&gt;X = [0,1]; A = [0,\frac{1}{2}]&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A^c = (\frac{1}{2},1]&lt;/math&gt;.

==== The plot continues... ====
A very important '''Proposition''': Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set in the space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, A is open iff &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; is closed.&lt;BR/&gt;
'''Proof:'''  (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) For the first part, we assume that A is an open set. We shall show that &lt;math&gt; A^c = Cl(A^c)&lt;/math&gt;. It is enough to show that &lt;math&gt;Cl(A^c) \subseteq A^c&lt;/math&gt; because of the properties of closure. Let &lt;math&gt;p \in Cl(A^c)&lt;/math&gt; (we will show that &lt;math&gt;p \in A^c&lt;/math&gt;). &lt;BR/&gt;
for every ball &lt;math&gt;B, p\in B&lt;/math&gt; we have, by definition that (*)&lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. If the point is not in &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \in A&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is open and therefore, there is a ball &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, such that: &lt;math&gt;p \in B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, that means that &lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting (*). &lt;BR/&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) On the other hand, Lets a assume that &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; is closed, and show that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is open. Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a point in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (we will show that &lt;math&gt;p \in int(A)&lt;/math&gt;). If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is not in &lt;math&gt;int(A)&lt;/math&gt; then for every ball &lt;math&gt;B, p \in B&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;B \nsubseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. That means that &lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. And by definition of closure point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a closure point of &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; so we can say that &lt;math&gt;p \in Cl(A^c)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; is closed, and therefore &lt;math&gt;p \in A^c = Cl(A^c)&lt;/math&gt; That contradicts the assumption that &lt;math&gt;p \in A&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, as mentioned earlier, a set can still be '''both''' open and closed!

=== On &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^1&lt;/math&gt; ===
The following is an important theorem characterizing open and closed sets on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Theorem''': An open set O in R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a countable union of disjoint open intervals.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x\in O&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a=\sup\{t|t\notin O, t&lt;x\}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;b=\inf\{t|t\notin O, t&gt;x\}&lt;/math&gt;. There exists an open ball (x-ε,x+ε) such that (x-ε,x+ε) ⊆ O because O is open. Thus, a≤x-ε and b≥x+ε. Thus, x ∈(a,b). The set O contains all elements of (a,b) since if a number is greater than a, and less than x but is not within O, then a would not be the supremum of {t|t∉O, t&lt;x}. Similarly, if there is a number is less than b and greater than x, but is not within O, then b would not be the infimum of {t|t∉O, t&gt;x}. Thus, O also contains (a,x) and (x,b) and so O contains (a,b). If y≠x and y∈(a,b), then the interval constructed from this element as above would be the same. If y&lt;a, then inf{t|t∉O, t&gt;y} would also be less than a because there is a number between y and a which is not within O. Similarly if y&gt;b, then sup{t|t∉O, t&lt;y} would also be greater than b because there is a number between y and b which is not within O. Thus, all possible open intervals constructed from the above process are disjoint. The union of all such open intervals constructed from an element x is thus O, and so O is a union of disjoint open intervals. Because the rational numbers is dense in R, there is a rational number within each open interval, and since the rational numbers is countable, the open intervals themselves are also countable.

=== Examples of closed sets ===
#In any metric space, a singleton &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. To see why, consider the open set, &lt;math&gt;\{x\}^c&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;y \in \{x\}^c&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;y \neq x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;d(y,x) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}d(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon(y) \subseteq \{x\}^c&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;\{x\}^c&lt;/math&gt; is open, and hence &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed.
#In any metric space, every finite set &lt;math&gt;T = \{x_1,x_2,...,x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. To see why, observe that &lt;math&gt;T^c = \Big[\bigcup\{x_i\}\Big]^c = \bigcap\{x_i\}^c&lt;/math&gt; is open, so &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is closed.
#Closed intervals [a,b] are closed.
#'''Cantor Set''' Consider the interval [0,1] and call it C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Let A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be equal {0, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;} and let d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;(\tfrac{1}{3})^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Let A&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; be equal to the set A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;∪{x|x=a+2d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, a∈A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}. Let C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bigcup_{a\in A_n}&lt;/math&gt;{[a,a+d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]}, which is the finite union of closed sets, and is thus closed. Then the intersection &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^\infty {C_i}&lt;/math&gt; is called the Cantor set and is closed.

=== Exercises ===
# Prove that a point x has a sequence of points within X converging to x if and only if all balls containing x contain at least one element within X.
# In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; the only sets that are both open and closed are the empty set, and the entire set. This is not the case when you look at &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Give an example of a set which is both open and closed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set in the space &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Prove the following: 
## &lt;math&gt;Cl(A) = Int(A^c)^c&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;Int(A) = Cl(A^c)^c&lt;/math&gt;

==Continuity==
===Definition ===
Let's recall the idea of continuity of functions. Continuity means, intuitively, that you can draw a function on a paper, without lifting your pen from it. Continuity is important in topology. But let's start in the beginning:

The classic delta-epsilon definition: Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d),(Y,e)&lt;/math&gt; be spaces. A function &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; is '''continuous''' at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; if for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\epsilon_x} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that:
for all  &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,x_1) &lt; \delta_{\epsilon_x} &lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;e(f(x), f(x_1)) &lt; \epsilon_x&lt;/math&gt;.

Let's rephrase the definition to use balls: A function &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; is continuous at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; if for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\epsilon_x} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the following holds:
for every  &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_1 \in B_{\delta_{\epsilon_x}} (x) &lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt; f(x_1) \in B_{\epsilon_{x}}(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. Or more simply: 
&lt;math&gt; f(B_{\delta_{\epsilon_x}}(x)) \subseteq B_{\epsilon_{x}}(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;

Looks better already! But we can do more.

'''Definitions:'''
*A function is continuous in a set S if it is continuous at every point in S.
*A function is continuous if it is continuous in its entire domain.

'''Proposition:'''
A function &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; is continuous, by the definition above &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; for every open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, The [[w:Inverse image|inverse image]] of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, is open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR/&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does not have to be surjective or bijective for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to be well defined. The notation  &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; simply means &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U) = \{x \in X: f(x) \in U\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
First, let's assume that a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous by definition (The &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; direction). We need to show that for every open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open.

Let &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; be an open set.  Let &lt;math&gt;x \in f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and because &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is open, we can find and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon_x}(f(x)) \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;. Because f is continuous, for that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x&lt;/math&gt;, we can find a &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\epsilon_x} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f(B_{\delta_{\epsilon_x}}(x)) \subseteq B_{\epsilon_{x}}(f(x)) \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;. that means that &lt;math&gt;B_{\delta_{\epsilon_x}}(x) \subseteq f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore,  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an internal point. This is true for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  - meaning that all the points in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; are internal points, and by definition, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open.

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;U&gt;On the other hand&lt;/U&gt;, let's assume that for a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for every open set &lt;math&gt;U \in Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  We need to show that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

For every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, The set &lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon_x}(f(x))&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the set &lt;math&gt;V = f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon_x}(f(x)))&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is open, that means that we can find a &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\epsilon_x}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B_{\delta_{\epsilon_x}}(x) \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;, and we have that &lt;math&gt; f(B_{\delta_{\epsilon_x}}(x)) \subseteq B_{\epsilon_{x}}(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

The last proof gave us '''an additional definition we will use for continuity for the rest of this book'''. The beauty of this new definition is that it only uses open-sets, and there for can be applied to spaces without a metric, so we now have two equivalent definitions which we can use for continuity.

=== Examples ===
* Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be any function from any space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, to any space &lt;math&gt;(Y,e)&lt;/math&gt;, were &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the discrete metric. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Why? For every open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open, because every set is open in a space with the discrete metric.
* Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}; f(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; The identity function. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous: The source of every open set is itself, and therefore open.
=== Exercise ===
# Prove that a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; is continuous &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; for every closed set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, The [[w:Inverse image|inverse image]] of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, is closed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;BR/&gt;

=== Uniform Continuity ===
In a metric space X, function from X to a metric space Y is '''uniformly continuous''' if for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(x_1,x_2)&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;d(f(x_1),f(x_2))&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Isometry==
An isometry is a [[w:surjective|surjective]] mapping &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(X , \delta )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Y , \rho )&lt;/math&gt; are metric spaces and for all &lt;math&gt;a, b \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta (a, b) = \rho (f(a), f(b))&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, &lt;math&gt;(X, \delta )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Y, \rho )&lt;/math&gt; are said to be isometric.

Note that the [[w:Injective function|injectivity]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; follows from the property of preserving distance:

:&lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\implies\rho(f(a),f(b))=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\implies\delta(a,b)=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\implies a=b&lt;/math&gt;

So an isometry is necessarily [[w:Bijective_function|bijective]].

==Exercises==
#Show that a set is a metric open set [[w:iff|iff]] it is a (possibly infinite) union of  open balls.
#Show that the discrete metric is in fact a metric.

'''Berkeley Software Distribution''' or '''BSD''' is a flavor of UNIX that was developed at the University of California, Berkeley. Today, the '''BSD''' or '''*BSD''' systems are free Unix-like operating systems based on the university's distribution. To honor this, these systems put BSD at the end of their names. The *BSD systems are DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Accounting is the process by which financial information about a business is recorded, classified, summarized, interpreted, and communicated. Accounting is the language of business.

==Categories==
#[[/Financial Accounting|Financial accounting]] is a major branch of accounting that describes the collection, recording, and extraction of financial information, in order to periodically summarize profit and loss, the balance sheet, and cash flow in accordance with legal, professional, and capital market [[/Accounting Standards|requirements]]. The main task is to prepare regular financial reports. 
#[[/Management Accounting|Managerial accounting]] is the branch of accounting for internal use, to which end an organization provides information only accessible to its insiders in order to assist decision-makers. The mission of managerial accounting is to utilize, inform, and control the functions of management.

thought this section would be better under opn source?
[[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 04:06, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)
===============
First and foremost you need to find software that will run on your computer.  All software will only run on a limited number of computer systems, and you do not want to waste time on software you cannot use (see Determining system hardware below).  Most freeware packages come with a listing of basic system requirements, you should review that listing before downloading any software.

Secondly, you want to find software that will do the job you are trying to do.  If you are looking for software to do a large important job you should spend a little time thinking about what features are important to you.  You should also consider the speed of software and its reliability. 'Great software' that crashes is not as good as simple working programs.  Sometimes it is better to use a smaller piece of software that a few things well rather then struggle with a larger package that is unstable, even if you loose some features.  Know what features are important to you, and which you can live without.

Thirdly, it is important to know your source.  Most of the time you can download and run software and everything will be wonderful, but there are people who may attempt to trick you into downloading and running their software, in order to take advantage of you. (You must particularly watch out for this if you run a version of Microsoft Windows.)  One good way to avoid problems is to find reviews of the software from sources other then the site you are planning to download the software from (for instance if you can find a message board where the product is discussed at length and no one seems to have major problems that is often a good sign).  Also make sure you have a good virus scanner (again this is more important on Windows) and scan for viruses after every installation.  Some open source projects also use a type of encryption to ensure the software you download is the same as the software they published (insurance against a 3rd party tempering with the software), you should take advantage of  these digital signatures whenever possible.

One common additional criteria is trying to use software that works on more then one operating system. While this by no means is a rule that must be followed it assures the user of maximum future software skills empowerment, and generally indicates a larger support community behind the software. some people consider programs written in [[wikipedia:Java|Java]] a plus as they will also run on all major operating systems along with some mobile phones and PDA's. [[wikipedia:Sun Microsystems|Sun]] has concentrated on improving Java and it is likely to find itself embedded in more consumer products). Programs written in C or other languages rely on someone recompiling and setting up for a new environment.

Probably can just be junked altogether.  It doesn't belong in [[Open Source]], but it's not really really written well enough to fit into [[Freeware].--[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 03:02, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I apreciate your work on Freeware, especialy the tables/graphics. Maybe you would like to comment on my new project, [[Wikisolutions]] and maybe contribute. It should be nice to have tables and pictures for solutions, and make it to look nicer. [[User:Moa3333|Moa3333]] 21:45, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ahc. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ahc~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Pasta|Pasta]]

==Recipe 1==

===Ingredients===
*3 whole [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/2 cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*1 Tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*3 cups (700g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

===Procedure===

#In a bowl beat together eggs, salt, olive oil, and wine.
#Stir in 1 cup flour with fork.
#Gently add 2nd cup of flour after 1st is mixed thoroughly.
#Remove mixture from bowl and place on a lightly floured work surface.
#Knead in the last cup of flour a bit at a time.  If the dough becomes too dry, add a bit of cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]].
#Continue kneading until the dough is uniform and satinny in appearance.
#Roll into a large ball and cut into quarters.  Overturn the mixing bowl over the cut pieces to protect from dust.
#Let dough relax for approx. 30 minutes.

===Notes, tips, and variations===

This dough can be rolled and used for Lasagne, cut and used for Fettucinni, or rolled out for Ravioli.  One quarter cut into fettucinni will feed four.  Store any remaining dough lightly floured in a bag in the refrigerator for up to two weeks, or dried and stored in a cool dry place for up to a month.

Generally speaking, one small egg to one cup of flour is what is expected.  For a lean dough increase the flour to egg ratio (you really can't go too far, the poor use  no egg at all). For a rich dough omit the whites and use two or three yolks per cup up flour. 

'''When Kneading:''' It may get tough to knead the flour into the dough when you are down to the last 1/4 cup (60g).  Be careful not to add too much water to the dough after you have begun kneading.  lightly dipping your fingers into the water and coating the outside of the dough should be enough.  Kneading is hard work and it takes the better part of 20 minutes for proper consistency.  If you have the time, bring the dough together in a shaggy ball and allow it to sit tightly wrapped in saran, over night in refrigerator; this will allow the gluten to fully hydrate, alleviating some of the time and work of the kneading job. 

'''To Cook:''' Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil.  Add rolled and cut noodles to the water and cook to al dente.

'''To Store:'''  In order to prevent sticking it is helpful to blanch the pasta for a second or two in boiling salted water, then air dry on a sheet.  Finally, dust the noodles with rice flour or corn starch to store. Refrigerator for 5-7 days, or freeze 6 mos. to a year.  

*Non-Alcoholic Variation - 1/2 cup (120ml) of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] can be used in place of the [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*Egg Noodles - 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] can be substituted for 1/2 cup (120ml) of white wine to make egg noodles.

There are a number of different recipes for egg noodles, below are two of the most commonly used ones.

==Recipe 2==
===Ingredients===
*3 [[Cookbook:egg yolk|egg yolk]]s
*1 whole [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*dash of [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
*80ml (1/4 cup) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*580ml (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1-2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]

===Procedure===

*In a bowl beat together egg yolks, egg, salt, and pepper.
*Stir in water.
*Stir in flour.
*Knead into ball.
*Roll out on a floured surface until 2 mm to 4 mm (1/16&quot; to 1/8&quot;) thick.
*Cut into noodles 6 mm (1/4&quot;) wide.
*Bring water to a boil in a pot, add oil.
*Add noodles to a boiling water, and cook until done.

==Recipe 4==
===Ingredients===
*4 large [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*400g [[Cookbook:flour|plain flour]]
*Extra flour for kneading

===Procedure===

*Sift the flour onto a large work surface, and create a well in the centre
*Break the eggs into the well
*Slowly draw the flour into the eggs either using a spoon or your hands
*Knead into a smoooth, elastic dough
*Roll to desired thickness, using extra flour  and cut to desired shape
*Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil
*Add the noodles to the water and cook until ''[[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]]''

N.B:
*While this recipe says that 400 grams of flour should be sufficient for creating the dough more may be necessary depending upon the size of the eggs
*This recipe usually makes enough noodles for four people, however depending on the shape of pasta more may be needed. A good rule of thumb is one large egg per person.

==Recipe 3==

===Ingredients===
*1 whole [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
*1 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 to 6 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*1-2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]] (optional)

===Procedure===

On a smooth surface, heap flour. Push a hole in the center of the flour (it should look like a volcano). Break egg into flour (add oil now if you choose to do so - it will change the flavor and texture). Either knead with hands or mix with a fork. Slowly add water one teaspoon at a time while kneading the dough. You probably will not need all six tablespoons of water (though you may possibly need more). Knead dough until it has a consistent texture.

===Manually===
Divide dough into manageable sections. Select one section at a time and keep the rest covered. Roll each section to desired thickness and cut into noodles with a knife.

===Pasta Machine===
Divide dough into manageable sections. Select one section at a time and keep the rest covered. Roll dough through smooth rollers repeatedly at progressively thinner settings. When the dough reaches desired thickness, cut with grooved rollers.

===Use===
These noodles can be laid out to dry for later use or dropped immediately into a boiling pot of water. Cook to taste. They are good with a variety of sauces.

===Notes===
I would recommend using a pasta machine as it drastically speeds up the process. Ingredients can be multiplied without changing the instructions. One tip for success, the drier you can keep the dough, the better it will come out. If the dough gets too wet it will stick to itself and cook down to one blob.

To stop pasta sticking to itself as it cooks, toss the freshly made pasta in flour first, and keep the pan of water at a rolling boil to keep the water moving.

To make the dough more easily, ingredients can be put in a food processor.  They will form a breadcrumb texture. These 'breadcrumbs' can then be pressed together to make the dough. This means the dough can be made more quickly.

==Notes==

* The homemade noodles made using any of these recipes can be served with a variety of pasta sauces, such as [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]] sauce.

The '''[[w:fermions|fermions]]''' are the particles that ''obey Pauli's exclusion principle'', which states that two particles can not have the same quantic numbers. They also have non integer spin. Some common fermions are: the electron, the proton, the neutron and the He 3 nuclei; barions and leptons are included here. They are described by the statistical laws stated by Fermi and Dirac.

The '''[[w:bosons|bosons]]''' do not obey Pauli's exclusion principle. They have integer spin (or zero). Some common bosons are: the photon, the graviton and the He 4 nuclei; mesons are included here. Bosons are described by statistical laws stated by Bose and Einstein.


=== Identical Particles ===

Fermions and bosons arise from the theory of identical particles.  Consider two cars.  Even if they are the same make and model, you can be fairly sure that there are tiny differences that make each car unique.  If even that fails, you know which car is which based on which car is where.  But electrons have no similar identifying marks.  They only have simple properties, such as intrinsic spin, intrinsic parity, electric charge, and the like.  To make it worse, they also may lack well-defined positions.  If the wave functions of two electrons mix, when you force those functions to collapse through direct observation, which electron is which?

For a two particle system, if the two particles are not identical (i.e., are of different types), and their Hamiltonian is separable, we can write down their wave function simply.  Let us assume that we have one particle in state a, and the other particle in state b.  Since the particles are distinguishable, we can tell which particle is which.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_1)\Psi_b (\mathbf{r}_2)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a simple enough exercise.  But what if we have the same situation with identical particles?  Then we can't tell the difference between having particle 1 in state a, or having it in state b.  All we know is that there are two particles, one is in state a and one is in state b.  To account for both of those states, we have to write the total state as a superposition of those two states.

The easiest way to write this, of course would be to write:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_{+}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{2}}[\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_1)\Psi_b (\mathbf{r}_2) {+} \Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_2)\Psi_b (\mathbf{r}_1)]
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


But as we should know from our study of Quantum Mechanics so far, things are not quite this easy.  There are actually two different final states that we can end up in, and this is only the first one.  The second one is actually:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_{-}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{2}}[\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_1)\Psi_b (\mathbf{r}_2) - \Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_2)\Psi_b (\mathbf{r}_1)]
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The first expression is the ''symmetric'' expression, and the second is the ''anti-symmetric'' expression.  That difference between + and - looks fairly insignificant, but it is perhaps the fundamental difference between elementary particles.  To illustrate this, let us examine the peculiar case when we have two particles in the same state.  If a and b are identical, then the symmetric expression is written as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_{+}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{2}}[\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_1)\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_2) + \Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_2)\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_1)]
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

an expression that is fairly easy to simplify.  However, the anti-symmetric expression simplifies to something completely different:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_{-}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \frac{1} {\sqrt{2}}[\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_1)\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_2) - \Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_2)\Psi_a (\mathbf{r}_1)] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Because those two wave function expressions cancel out, the anti-symmetric wave function obeys a fundamental rule, no two identical, anti-symmetric particles can be in the same state.  If they were, their wave functions would cancel out to zero, a physical impossibility!  This is a theoretical derivation of the famed [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]], whose effect on the world of Chemistry and Particle Physics has been tremendous.

Particles that are symmetric are referred to as bosons.  If you examine [[Modern_Physics:Fermi and Bose statistics|Fermi and Bose statistics]], you will find that bosons tend to congregate in the ground state, because there are no barriers to this accumulations.  Anti-symmetric particles are known as fermions, and their inability to stay in the same state as their neighbors has lead to the intricate structure of electron valence orbitals.

Practically speaking, the difference between fermions and bosons is greatest when dealing with elementary particles.  There bosons are the force carriers, particles like the graviton and the photon that are the mechanism by which particles interact.  Fermions become the building blocks, out of which all matter is made.  This distinction is one of the foundations of the Standard Model, a major topic which will be covered later in this book.</text>

An [[Cookbook:Omelet Recipes|omelet]] with a [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] filling.

==Ingredients==
*5 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1/2 cup of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (125ml)
*1-2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] (optional)

Filling:
*1 [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]], chopped into 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot; cubes (approximately 1cm)
*1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], minced or chopped
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (50g), shredded

Makes 2 omelettes.

==Procedure==
#In a bowl beat together eggs, sugar, salt and pepper. 
#Mix in milk. 
#Heat up two [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]]s to a medium temperature.
#Use butter, margarine, or cooking spray on each pan.
#Add chopped potatoes to one pan. 
#Cook potatoes until light brown, then add onions. 
#Add half of egg mixture to the other pan.
#Cook omelet mixture until it starts to set (about 1 minute). 
#Add onions, potatoes, and cheese on top of partially set omelet.
#Fold plain side of omelet over the filling and cook for an additional 30 seconds  

The goal is to get the filling cooked at about the same time the omelette is ready to be folded.

[[Image:Lightmatter snowleopard.jpg|thumb|200px|A snow leopard's coat protects it from the cold]]
'''Snow leopards''' dare to live where icy gales would freeze a human's blood in minutes.  Their bodies are adapted to survive and thrive in an icy wilderness of breathtaking beauty and great danger.  Until recently, no one had photographed a snow leopard in the wild.The first ever close-up pictures taken by humans were made by program ''Planet Earth'', although very few people have had the privilege of seeing a snow leopard in its native habitat, much less taking its picture.  The snow leopards seem to like it that way -- they avoid humans with amazing skill.  Their fur contains swirls of gray and black, much like the colors of the rocky outcrops where they live. This coloration provides such good camouflage that a snow leopard can seem to disappear just by staying still.

== Where do snow leopards live? ==
[[Image:snow leopard range.png|thumb|180px|left|Places colored green are where snow leopards live]]
Snow leopards live in the high mountains of China and Central Asia, particularly throughout the Himalayas. They typically have a hunting range or territory of 100 square miles (260 square km), because very few prey animals live in the harsh, mountain habitat that is home to the snow leopard.

==What do snow leopards look like?==
[[Image:Uncia uncia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Note the intense gaze]]

Snow leopards have grey-and-white fur with long tails and rosettes on the flanks and spots on the head and neck, like jaguars. This color resembles the rocks and snow of their environment and helps them stalk their prey.  Their tails are unusually long, thickly furred, and striped. Their paws are covered in fur to keep them warm and to act like snowshoes.  During blizzards, they wrap their tail around their face, using it like a muff, to keep warm.  Their eyes are round in shape, ranging from pale green to grey in colour. Male snow leopards weigh between 90-115 pounds (40-52 kg), and females weigh between 75-90 pounds (34-40 kg).

==What do snow leopards eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
[[Image:Uncia uncia 2.jpg|thumb|left|Snow leopards are masters of vertical space]]
Snow leopards eat almost anything they can catch, often hunting animals three times their size. Their main sources of food include wild sheep and goats, pikas, hares, and game birds. In the summer, they eat mostly smaller prey, such as marmots. At other times their prey includes wild boars, gazelles, markhor, bobak, tahr, ibex, bharal, mice, and deer. They stalk their prey and usually begin their attack when they are 20 to 50 feet (6-15 m) away.

The snow leopard's broad paws act as snow shoes and give them traction as they chase their prey across stone, snow, and icy surfaces.  They are at their best when they can run across the hard, icy crusts that form above banks of deep snow  while their hooved prey breaks through the crust, getting mired in the soft, underlying snow.

==Fun facts==
* The snow leopard has the longest tail of any cat.
* Snow leopards will attack prey weighing four times as much as themselves.
* The large, thickly furred paws of the snow leopard act as built-in snowshoes.
* Snow leopards have the thickest fur of all cats
* Unlike most other big cats such as the lion, snow leopards cannot roar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'Removed the question about anti-matter rocket. After thinking about it for a while, I realized that energy conservation is of NO CONSEQUENCE in rocket propulsion--the type of &quot;collision&quot; occuring in rocket propulsion is exactly the kind of collision (i.e. completely inelastic collision, in reverse, of course) that does not conserve energy (unless we include thermal energy, that is). Besides, having antimatter as &quot;energy source&quot; will give no propulsion as annihilation reaction will give off two photons, going in opposite direction (so that momentum is conserved), and no propulsion for the rocket unless there's a way to redirect those photons (and since annihilation reaction gives gamma rays, I'm not sure how those photons will be redirected--it goes right through most materials).

I know it was only a hypothetical question, but since it is unsolvable without more assumptions, please make sure that it can be solved (and is consistent with conservation of momentum) before reposting it.
[[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 13:23, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)
: I don't know what I was smoking there, but energy is ''always conserved'', even in inelastic collisions. It's &quot;inelastic&quot; because it fails to conserve ''kinetic'' energy, but if we include energy in all its forms (including as rest masses), energy is always conserved. Looking at the date, I probably said that loooong before I understood relativity better. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 07:57, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

For the question ''What is the average density of a planet if an orbital period of a spacecraft on a low orbit is N minutes ?'' I tried doing it, but I don't think it can be solved unless we are told what &quot;low orbit&quot; is. Is there a definition of &quot;low orbit&quot; or should we add that information as given (at a distance R or something like that)? [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 10:49, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

The term low orbit generally refers to an orbit whose radius is approximately R (from the centre of the earth). This is the standard assumption that many courses make in finding orbital velocity, &lt;math&gt; \sqrt(gR) &lt;/math&gt;. I think it can be given though.

== all questions merged in ==

I merged in all &quot;relevant&quot; questions to appropriate sections in Physics Exercises and therefore am turning the module into a redirect. For future reference, these are the questions I did not merge in and why (feel free to add them in, if you can resolve issues I brought up here):

# What devices are affected by 0 gravity: common electric bulb, candle, mercury thermometer, spirit thermometer, minimum thermometer, hair hygrometer, psychrometer, mercury barometer, aneroid barometer, hypsometer, absorption refrigerator ?
#* Because this question didn't seem to be ... very quantitative, and it is very vague. To some degree, all these things are affected: electric bulb, when it burns out, it'll probably have blackened marking that's different from if it burned out under gravity; mercury barometer is obviously affected... on the whole, this question does not require much physical insight---more of a bunch of memorization of trivial objects that does not help the student understand the important matter. On the whole, this looks like one of those questions that is easier to come up with than it is to answer (I consider those to be a bad question, because it also means that the question-maker did not really work it through herself).
# What is the minimum height of a shot tower for a given shot size ?
# What is the maximum size of a shot that can be produced in a shot tower ?
#* Above two problems are excluded for the same reason, as follows: not enough information. The student has to look up a lot of information (like ... heat conductivity and emittivity of lead, assuming lead is used), and the essential physics is really &quot;how long does it take for a shot to fall&quot; (the other part, of how fast a spherical object would cool down under a &quot;wind&quot; is too complicated a problem for the student to calculate and should be stated far more clearly, rather than hidden in the term &quot;shot tower&quot;).
# A simple lead-acid battery charger consists of a variable transformer, a rectifier, an ammeter, and a fuse. Why the fuse blows well before the current according to the ammeter reaches its rated value?
#* &lt;p&gt;Again, not enough information. Questions such as &quot;How are these elements connected? What does ammeter read?&quot; should have been answered on the question. Also, the question seems to essentially shooting for the fact that most ammeters would read the average value, and assuming the rectifier hasn't been connected with a capacitor to smooth out the ripple, the maximum current would be higher than what ammeter reads. But if that's the case, the question-maker missed a far more practical fact of ... that there are such things as &quot;slow-blow&quot; fuses. And even assuming slow-blow fuses are not used, fuses essentially work by thermal heating, so if it's anything like 60 Hz input voltage, essential current that fuse &quot;feels&quot; would be the averaged current that is felt by the ammeter. On the whole, it's a sloppy question that requires more work by student than the questioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case that this question was being asked by an actual mechanic who is wondering why this happens ... a simpler answer might be that the averaging time of the ammeter is far too long. Suppose the averaging time for the ammeter is 30 seconds and the current rises faster than that time scale---in that case, when th ammeter &quot;reads&quot; 10 A, actual current (say, averaged over 1 s) may be 15 A. In any case, this is a bad question; offers no physical insight at all.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

__TOC__

{{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Unbounded|Text_IO}} is a GNAT implementation-defined package that offers Get_Line and Put_Line functions which work directly on unbounded strings. They are more efficient and easier to use than the standard {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}} functions.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_Line {{Ada/kw|return}} Unbounded_String;
 
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_Line (File : {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}.File_Type) {{Ada/kw|return}} Unbounded_String;

Reads up to the end of the current line, returning the result as an unbounded string of appropriate length. If no File parameter is present, input is from Current_Input.
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put      (U    : Unbounded_String); 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put      (File : {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}.File_Type;  U : Unbounded_String); 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put_Line (U    : Unbounded_String); 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put_Line (File : {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}.File_Type;  U : Unbounded_String);

These are equivalent to the standard Text_IO routines passed the value To_String (U), but operate more efficiently, because the extra copy of the argument is avoided.

In [[Ada Programming/Ada 2005|Ada 2005]] the standard equivalent to this package is {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Unbounded_IO}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Actuation devices are the components of the robot that make it move (excluding your feet). Best known actuators are electric motors, servos and stepper motors and also pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders. Today there are new alternatives, some which wouldn't be out of place in a good SF-movie. One of the new types of actuators are Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). These are metal alloys that shrink or enlarge depending on how warm they are. Another new technique is the use of air-muscles.

I have added a warning, originally added Eadmund about hot oil. I'm kind of neutral as to whether we should have warnings and you're welcome to remove it if you feel we shouldn't. However given this recipe does involve deep frying I felt it might be fair enough to include it. The reason it was removed was AFAIK because Eadmund's edits were mostly disruptive, removing metric measurements. This should be a lesson, to people, if you want to add constructive edits, don't be disruptive because you risk having all your edits reverted...

Okay, so the invitation: Whoever is speaking Serbian please contribute to this article. --[[User:ThomasK|ThomasK]] 17:04, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

This is a great start, but it is my understanding that the Ijekavica dialect is used in Croatia, the Ekavica dialect is used in Serbia, while both are used in Bosnia.  Maybe then it would be better to reserve Ekavski for Serbian and Ijekavski for Croatian.  This is an [[Wikipedia:talk:Serbo-Croatian language|ongoing debate]], though there should probably at least be an explanation and distinction between the two dialects.
:
Also, it would be more useful to write in the accents and to distinguish between long and short vowels, as that is the only differnce between words such as gràd (short vowel: hail) and grád (long vowel: city).   --[[User:Mitchconquer|MitchC]] 15:55, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

== Dialect and other things ==

I'm studying Serbian in the Republika Srpska of Bosnia where the ijekavski dialect is used, but with mostly Serbian grammar and vocabulary.  That's why the vocab is in that dialect.  Maybe a good solution would be to add the ekavski version, where different, in italics or in brackets next to the ijekavski word.

Also, I think the page is getting too long and should be broken up into a few different pages:  maybe one for grammar and one for vocab, to start with.

In fact, I want to break up the vocab further into separate lessons, which would be much more useful for someone trying to learn Serbian. [[User:Dannya222]] 12:32, 11 August 2005

I believe that Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian should be merged into ONE article (Serbo-Croatian) as they are the SAME language, separated by only a few minimal regional vocabulary differences. Having three is absolutely inefficient
----
I agree 100%, the page is too long.  It'd be great to have real lessons with manageable chunks of vocab and grammar, but breaking it up into seperate grammar and vocabulary sections would be a great start.

As for the dialects, I think it is generally accepted that Ekavski is the main dialect of Serbian (and Serbia) while Ijekavski is that of Croatian; Serbian newspapers and websites use the Ekavica dialect, for example.  So as this is an online book for Serbian, I think most students would want to learn the main and most common dialect of Serbian (in Serbia): Ekavski.  But Ijekavski should also be included along with an explanation of the usage of different dialects in different regions.  Thoughts? --[[User:Mitchconquer|MitchC]] 17:52, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
----
That's no true, Ekavski isn't the main Serbian dialect. Both Ekavski and Ijekavski are equal, although ''Ijekavski'' is older are ''more correct to use'', since Serbian epic poems and other folk literature is written in it, Ijekavica is the language of Serbs from Montenegro, including Montenegrins, who speak Serbian, too (there's no &quot;Montenegrin&quot; language), Serbs from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbs from Croatia and Western Serbia. Only the people of the Southern, Eastern, Central, and Northern Serbia uses the Ekavica dialect. Plus, [[w:en:Vuk Stefanović Karadžić|Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], the most famous Serbian linguist, creator of the Modern Serbian language, was using Ijekavski dialect. When modern Serbian literary language was normed, Ijekavica (also spelled Jekavica) was adopted as the only dialect. Ekavica was accepted later, since the most of the Serbian cultural centres were in Ekavski region, the Northern Serbia (Belgrade, Novi Sad, Subotica...). Croatian language, however, was Ekavski at first, but later Croatian linguists ([[w:en:Ljudevit Gaj|Ljudevit Gaj]] was the famous one) accepted Ijekavica. It's also not true that both Ekavica and Ijekavica are used in Bosnia. The whole Bosnia and Herzegovina is Ijekavski region. Difference between Serbian and Croatian isn't dialect, it's the script (of course, there are some words and phrases characteristic only for Croatian). While Serbian uses both Cyrillic and Latin script, Croatian language uses Latin executively. Bosnian uses both scripts, too, and it's more similar to Serbian than Croatian is. These three languages are very, very similar, and they have the same origin. A Serb, a Bosniak, a Montenegrin, and a Croat (native speakers of Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian languages) could always understand each other without any translating. That's why many linguists considered these languages as one single, called ''Serbo-Croatian'' or ''Croato-Serbian''.--[[User:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|Ђорђе Д. Божовић]] 17:42, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''''Organic food''''' has both a popular meaning, and in some countries, a legal definition. In everyday conversation, it usually refers to all &quot;naturally produced&quot; foods, or the product of organic farming. As a legal and marketing term, it means certified organic. The distinction is important, as the two definitions can represent quite different products.

==Types of organic food==

Organic foods, like food in general, can be grouped into two categories, ''fresh'' and ''processed'', based on production methods, availability and consumer perception.

'''Fresh food''' is seasonal and highly perishable. Fresh [[cookbook:produce|produce]] &amp;mdash; [[cookbook:vegetable|vegetables]] and [[cookbook:fruit|fruits]] &amp;mdash; is the most available type of organic food, and closely associated with organic farming. It is often purchased directly from the growers, at [[cookbook:farmers' market|farmers' markets]], from on-farm stands, through speciality food stores, and through community-supported agriculture (CSA) projects.

Unprocessed animal products &amp;mdash; organic [[cookook:meat|meat]], [[cookbook:egg|eggs]], [[cookbook:dairy|dairy]] &amp;mdash; are less common. Prices can be higher than for conventional food, and availability is usually lower.

For fresh food, &quot;organic&quot; usually means: 
* produced without synthetic chemicals (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, hormones)
* free of genetically modified organisms
* (often, but not necessarily) locally grown

'''Processed organic food''' products are rarely available, and prices are often higher. The majority of processed organics comes from large food conglomerates, as producing and marketing products like canned goods, frozen vegetables, prepared dishes and other convenience foods is often beyond the scope of small organic producers.

For ''processed'' organic food, the general definition is:  
*contains only (or at least a certain specified percentage of) organic ingredients
*contains no artificial food additives
*processed without artificial methods, materials and conditions (e.g., no chemical ripening, no food irradiation)

==Identifying organic food==

Organic consumers are generally looking for chemical-free, fresh or minimally processed food, and originally they had to buy directly from growers: ''Know your farmer, know your food'' was a practical reality. Organic food at first comprised mainly fresh vegetables. Personal definitions of what exactly constituted &quot;organic&quot; could be developed and verified through first-hand experience: talking to farmers and directly observing farm conditions and farming activities. Small farms could grow vegetables (and raise livestock) using organic farming practices, with or without certification, and this was more or less something the individual  consumer could monitor.

As consumer demand for organic foods continues to increase, high volume sales through mass outlets, typically supermarkets, is rapidly replacing the direct farmer connection. For supermarket consumers, food production is not easily observable. Product labelling, like &quot;certified organic&quot;, is relied on. Government regulations and third-party inspectors are looked to for assurance.

Modern food processing is complex and complicated. Commercial preparation methods, the use of food additives, the effects of packaging and storage, and the like are outside the first-hand experience of most people (including organic farmers). Traditional and minimally processed products, [[cookbook:baked goods|baked goods]]; and [[cookbook:canning|canned]], frozen, and [[cookbook:pickling|pickled]] fruits and vegetables, are somewhat easier for consumers to understand by comparison with home preparation methods, although home and mass-production techniques are quite different. For convenience foods, like frozen prepared foods, cooked breakfast cereals, and so forth, ingredients and methods are quite a mystery to most consumers. A &quot;certified organic&quot; label is usually the only way for consumers to  trust that a processed product is &quot;organic&quot;.

==Organic food and preservatives==

Unfortunately, there are no natural models for preserving food the way it's found in supermarkets. Today, food with a long shelf life is the cornerstone of the food industry, providing most of the revenue and profits. In wealthier locales, an impressive array of technologies is used to make food &quot;last&quot; longer: home refrigerators and freezers at the consumer end, and industrial and chemical practices applied along the food production chain, from seed to field to fridge or table.

In general, organic standards cover in detail this entire process, specifying what is an &quot;organic&quot; ingredient or practice. However, since there is little natural reference for preparing, for example, a precooked, frozen dinner, a &quot;certified organic&quot; label on such an item may be hard to understand. The main ingredients are one thing, the processes and additives used to assemble and preserve them are quite another.

==Differences in Organic Food==

Some of the differences that have been claimed for organic food are:
*'''tastier:''' Organic advocates claim organic food tastes better because of the way it is produced, and because there is generally a greater variety to choose from. There is no body of scientific taste testing to consult.
*'''more nutritious:''' Food produced under organic conditions are somehow structurally different from chemically-raised and processed products. This pro-organic claim is so far beyond the scope of modern science to prove or disprove. The complex make-up of food, the effect of growing and processing methods, and the internal interactions between people and their nutrients are largely unknown. Measurements of some food components &amp;mdash; protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins and minerals, and so on &amp;mdash; only account for the most obvious factors that have been identified so far, and research is minimal. However, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded, resulting in less nutritious food. A study published in the ''Journal of the American College of Nutrition'' in 2004, entitled ''Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999'', compared nutritional analysis of vegetables done in 1950 and in 1999, and found substantial decreases in six of 13 nutrients examined. Percentage reductions included 6% of [[cookbook:protein|protein]] and 38% of [[cookbook:riboflavin|riboflavin]]. Reductions in calcium, phosphorus, iron and ascorbic acid were also found. The study, conducted at the Biochemical Institute, University of Texas, concluded that the most likely cause was the breeding of crops to maximize yield. Although not on the surface a strictly organic issue, plant breeding objectives for commercial production is completely integrated with industrialized, chemical-based farming.
*'''non-toxic:''' Organic proponents point to potential problems with toxic residues from agricultural chemicals like pesticides. There is no argument that traces do not exist; however, it is widely held that: (a) they are well in &quot;safe&quot; limits (as established by government regulations); (b) washing and other recommended preparation methods eliminate any risk. One potentially relevant new areas is the principle of hormesis, an emerging outlook on the extreme low level effects of substances, that might suggest that exposure to minute quantities of toxic residues on foods may have as specific effects on humans.
*'''better for the environment:''' By this argument, every food purchase supports the system that delivers it: if the large-scale chemical production methods are damaging to the environment, then people who buy these products are directly contributing to the problem. A recent UK study concluded that local food is best for the environment, and recommended food produced within a few miles radius as being the most advantageous. Insofar as organic food is often imported from long distances, local organics would seem environmentally to be the better bet. 

To the consumer looking for self-education, a basic awareness of recent food history provides a useful context. Chemical agriculture and mass production of supermarket food have only been big business for about 50 years. During that period, radical changes in the way food is produced have been justified by quoting scientific studies and conducting large-scale advertising and publicity campaigns. In recent years, the negative longer-term effects of many chemical agriculture practices have become increasingly hard to deny, however, the lack of balanced agricultural and food research is still overwhelming. It is unlikely that anything near definitive scientific conclusions will be drawn for years, possibly decades. In the meantime, consumers have to either trust the existing standards and claims, or come to their own common sense conclusions.

==Organic Standards==
Various alternative organic standards are emerging. They generally bypass formal certification, and provide their own definition of organic food. One such, the Authentic Food standard, proposed by leading US organic farmer Eliot Coleman, includes criteria that are incompatible with current agribusiness:
*All foods are produced by the growers who sell them.
*Fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, eggs and meat products are produced within a 50-mile radius of their place of their final sale.
*The seed and storage crops (grains, beans, nuts, potatoes, etc.) are produced within a 300-mile radius of their final sale.
*Only traditional processed foods such as cheese, wine, bread and lactofermented products may claim, &quot;Made with Authentic ingredients.&quot;[http://fourseasonfarm.com/main/authentic/authentic.html]

Particularly in developed nations, it is difficult to imagine not having the majority of products found in today's supermarkets. On the other hand, most of those products did not exist 100 years ago, and many of them are only a few decades old.

==Legal definition of &quot;Certified Organic&quot;==

In the United States, agricultural products that claim to be &quot;organic&quot; must adhere to the requirements of the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (found in 7 U.S.C.A. § 6501-22) and the regulations (found in 7 C.F.R. Part 205) promulgated by the USDA through the National Organic Program (&quot;NOP&quot;) under this act. These laws essential require that any product that claims to be organic must have been manufactured and handled according to specific NOP requirements.

Products that bear the Organic label come from farms and processing facilities that have been certified by a third party certifying organization to meet the USDA National Organic Standards.  

The Standards are based on the following rule: any &quot;natural&quot; product may be used in organic production, except for a list of exemptions; and no &quot;synthetic&quot; products can be used in organic production, except for a list of exceptions.  Organic farmers are required to have a working management plan, including crop rotation and integrated pest management strategies.  They must show that the farm has been organic for at least 3 years before they receive certification.  

Defining &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot; and creating those lists of exemptions has been contentious. An important example of the exemptions that are allowed in organic production despite ''not'' being natural is synthetically produced insect pharamones used for management of insect pests, which are allowed provided that they are applied passively (allowed to dissipate from on sponges) rather than sprayed. These exemptions are justified in that they are extremely useful and completely non-toxic.  An example of the &quot;natural&quot; products that are disallowed is lead arsenic, a naturally occurring compound that was widely used as an insecticide before DDT was invented. It is disallowed because it is highly toxic to all animals, including humans; it persists in the environment almost forever, and causes even more environmental damage than almost any synthetic insecticide.

Wow, KKS. Good job! [[User:Moonlightembrace|Moonlightembrace]] 07:40, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)

What are the specific goals of the &quot;simplification process&quot; to be performed on the english text? Will the simplified text be stripped down to single-clause sentences, or will the vocabulary be simplified?

What exactly is intended here? I'd love to assist in any way possible. I've never wiki'ed before, though.


-KKS

== Oh, I see. ==

I just did a diff on the 2 most recent versions and it was pretty clear what is being done. Cool.

-KKS

== I gave it a go. ==

I gave it the &quot;old college try&quot;. I ''hope'' my efforts are sufficient.

-KKS

== Added next 3 paragraphs ==

My translation skills are poor at this point, but I'm eager to help with the english. Where will this be archived since the stated goal is to save server space?

Thanks,

-Kevin (KKS)

__NOTOC__
'''Elli's veal or chicken with walnuts''', '''''Gjellë me arra të Ellit''''', is an Albanian dish. 

==Ingredients== 
*2 tablespoons flour
*15 finely crushed shelled walnuts 
*2 beaten egg yolks
*1 minced garlic clove
*1/4 lb. (one stick) butter
*2-3 lbs of veal or chicken meat cut into 1&quot; cubes 

==Procedure==
# Place the meat or chicken in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until tender. 
#Remove the meat and set it aside in a dish while leaving the remaining juices in the saucepan. 
#In another saucepan, add the flour and stir over heat until it becomes light brown in color (do not overcook!) and add half the butter. 
#Add the walnuts, garlic, and egg yolks, stirring constantly.

== Recommendation for deletion ==

I have split this page, it now has only one recipe, and a very simple one at that.

It is only linked to by one cookbook article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Usenet''' is a &quot;network&quot; of newsgroup servers (often run by ISPs) working together.
Once connected to Usenet one can find everything from logical conversation to porn.
One bad thing about Usenet is that it is often used to distribute warez, or illegal digital content like mp3s, Screeners, or cracked video games.  In most cases Usenet is the first step in the life of warez.  Unfortunately this has caused many newsgroup servers to block access to known warez newsgroups.

Usenet providers normally charge money for access but many ISPs have newsgroup servers running that their customers can access for free. So if you would like to check out Usenet first call your ISP and find out if they have a newsgroup server running.

'''Note: Until a more complete in-house guide is made for this, see the external tutorials and resources at the bottom of the page.'''

See the directions under your operating system to quickly get your web browser to display Chinese characters.
==Cross Platform==
* Make sure you have a Chinese font available. Find somewhere to look at the font lists, and see if you can see something like Chinese characters. If you have one, make it the default in your browser and check.
* If you don't have a Chinese font:
# Download A font as in [[#Programs]].
# Install the font. Use right-click install on Windows, the ''Font Book'' in Mac OS, or the method provided by your desktop environment in Linux. 
# Make it the default selection in your browser. Just choose your favourite.


==Windows==
===Windows Vista===
Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista displays Chinese characters properly without any configuration.

For program written in non-Unicode, go to Control Panel --&gt; Regional and Language Options --&gt; Administrative tab --&gt; Language for non-Unicode programs, set it to whatever Chinese language you want.

===Windows XP===
If Chinese character't display properly for you, first check if you need to install East Asian  language support files. To do this:

# Click '''Start &gt; Control Panel'''. Select the '''Date, Time, Regional and Language Options''' category, then click '''Regional and Language Options'''.
# On the '''Languages''' tab, select the checkbox labeled '''Install files for East Asian languages'''.
# Click OK when a dialog box appears informing you of the storage requirements for the language files (230 MB).
# Click OK on the Languages tab.
# Another dialog box appears requesting a Windows XP installation disk or network share location where the language support files are located. Insert a Windows XP installation CD or browse to the appropriate network location, and click OK. Windows may not always ask for a installation CD. Microsoft Windows installs the necessary files and prompts for you to restart the computer.
# Click Yes to restart the computer.

===Windows 95, 98 or ME===
In order to display Chinese characters properly, you need to download two packages from Microsoft.

If you '''don't''' have Office XP:
# Go to [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/downloads/recommended/ime/install.mspx this] Microsoft site.
# Select '''Chinese (Simplified) - with Language Pack''' in the dropdown box.
# Click '''Go'''.
# Download the file '''scmondo.exe''', open it and follow the instructions.
# Do the same for '''Chinese (Traditional) - with Language Pack''' and then '''tcmondo.exe'''.

If you '''do''' have Office XP:
# Download [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=B91AC197-FFA7-45A7-B1E1-C3457E1B0C1F&amp;displaylang=en this] file and [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=959EB2A2-FAC3-4443-999B-8BE12734A596&amp;displaylang=en this] one from Microsoft.
# Execute '''imechs.exe'''.
# Follow the instructions.
# Do the same for '''imecht.exe'''.

==Mac OS==
Mac OS (X) should support displaying Chinese characters natively. If it doesn't work, refer to [[#Cross Platform]].
===Input===
#Click the '''Apple icon''' on top left corner.
#Click '''System Preferences'''
#Click '''Language and Text''' icon
#Click '''Input Sources''' tab
#Tick '''Chinese Simplified, Pinyin and/or Trackpad Handwriting'''

(Handwriting feature only available in Snow Leopard or above)

To set up keyboard shortcuts for changing input language
#Click the '''Apple icon''' on top left corner.
#Click '''System Preferences'''
#Click '''Keyboard''' icon
#Click '''Keyboard shortcuts''' tab
#Click '''Keyboard &amp; Text Input''' in the column
#Check &quot;Select next source in input menu&quot;.  
(Typical: command + space)

==Linux==

Linux supports Sinitic fonts in a number of formats. in particular LaTeX CJK, and True Type among others.

Just make sure you are using a UTF-8 locale.
==Tutorials==
* [http://depts.washington.edu/eacenter/cjk/ Univ. of Washington guide to CJK internet/email/word processing for Windows and Mac]
* [http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/faq/index.php Excellent guide to displaying Chinese characters for Windows, Mac and Linux.]
* [http://dev.gentoo.org/~liquidx/chinesehowto2/ Gentoo Linux Chinese Localisation Guide. ('emerge arphicfonts' to get characters showing in firefox!)]

== Proprietary process ==

Tilly/[[User:61.9.214.113|61.9.214.113]] has replaced the process with their own proprietary one, [http://www.localb100.com/cbt/makingasmallbatch/ the Dr Pepper Technique]. This introduces potential licensing problems.

*Agreed. What good is a patented, proprietary howto for the community? I say nix the article.

== minor rewrite ==

How about fixing capitalization?  There are quite a few places in this work where capitalization would indicate proper nouns, but context would hint otherwise.

==deletion==

where did this go??
I'm very confused!!! Wikipedia user Bonus Onus</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the hardest needs to satisfy well on the road is keeping clean. 

'''Important Health Note''':whenever you use public facilities, make sure you wear foot protection and touch as little of anything as possible. The recent outbreaks of antibiotic resistant staph and skin infections were all acquired in public facilities. 

==Gym club==

If you can afford it, get a membership at a gym.  For between $20 - $50.00/month, you'll have daily access to a hot shower and gym equipment.

==Truck Stops==

Flying J, Pilot, T/A, and other truck stops offer showers for $7 - $9 (current prices in 2007).  


==McDonald's/Grocery store==

These are good for occasional use, but I always felt uncomfortable using them.  It's pretty obvious what you're doing in the bathroom if you go in there bleary-eyed and unshaven, and come out clean, shaved, and well-coiffed.  If you can 

  
==&quot;Dundo&quot;/ Sponge Bath method==

This is the least water consuming method, and is the easiest method for keeping clean if you're living in a car or other small space. 

You can keep reasonably clean at  minimum, you will need about 1 quart of water.  Heat half the water to boiling on a camp stove.  Pour about a 2 cups of water into a bowl, and add a enough cold water to make the temperature comfortable.  Wet a small dishrag or sponge with the water.   Take off your top, and drape a towel over your shoulders.  Wet your hair with the dishrag.  Pour a small droplet of soap into your palm and work it into your hair.  Repeat until you have a lather.  Use as little soap as necessary, so that you don't have to use much water to rinse it out.  Leave the soap in your hair to soak while you lather up your face and torso.  Bend over a bowl, and pour water over your hair so it drains into the bowl.

==Camping shower==

A plastic bladder which is clear on one side and black on the other.  It can be placed on the dashboard or anywhere in the sun to warm the water.  Hang it from something(a tree or part of your van) and the water flows through a tube and out through a shower head.  If you prefer to shower outside of your van be sure to find a secluded spot such as behind a grocery store or strip mall.  Showering inside a plastic rain poncho can prevent indecent exposure.  Fast drying travel towels composed of synthetic materials are available and often preferable over slow to dry cotton towels.  Nearly identical towels are available for a much lower price in the automotive or housecleaning section of most grocery and big-box stores.

==Built-in Heat Exchanger==

Several systems exist for hooking up a hot water heater to your automobile's cooling system.

==Truck Shower==

There is a commercial product for showering in a vehicle.  Its a little expensive at $300.  You can find it at http://www.truckshower.com

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you're trying to repair your auto, then it's very likely that something is wrong!  The first step is diagnosing the problem.  Once you figure out what's wrong, the next step is to remedy the problem.  This may or may not involve replacing a part.  The final step is putting everything back together.

In [[Persian/Lesson 1|lesson 1]], you learned some greetings, the first nine letters of the Persian Alphabet, and how to spell several words with those letters from right to left.  You also learned that short vowels are usually not written, and that many letters change their shape depending on whether they connect with letters before or after them.

In this lesson, you will learn more formal greetings, the next eleven Persian letters and syllable stress.

== Dialogue: ‹'''hâl'''-e šo'''mâ''' ce'''tor''' e?› ==
Arash sees Peyman:

{{Persian/dialogue-top}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Arash | |sa'''lâm''', '''â'''qâ-ye '''pey'''mân. '''hâl'''-e šo'''mâ''' ce'''tor''' e?|Hello, Mr. Peyman.  How are you?| audio=&lt;!-- fa-سلام، آقای پیمان. حال شما چطور است؟.ogg --&gt;}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Peyman | |sa'''lâm''', '''â'''raš. '''xub'''am, '''mer'''si. šo'''mâ''' ce'''tor'''in?|Hello Arash. I am well, thank you.  How are you?| audio=&lt;!--fa-سلام، آرش .خوبم، مرسی. شما چطورین؟.ogg --&gt;}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Arash | |man '''xub'''am, '''mer'''si.  xo'''dâ''' hâ'''fez''', '''â'''qâ-ye '''pey'''mân.|I am well, thanks.  Goodbye, Mr. Peyman!| audio=&lt;!--fa-من خوبم، مرسی. خدا حافظ، آقای پیمان.ogg--&gt;}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Peyman | |xo'''dâ''' hâ'''fez'''.|Goodbye.| audio=&lt;!-- fa-خدا حافظ.ogg --&gt;}}
|}

'''Explanation'''
:Arash and Peyman are using a more formal style of speech typically used to show respect.  That is why they use the formal pronoun {{term-fa|شما|hide Arab=yes|šo'''mâ'''}} instead of the informal {{term-fa|تو|hide Arab=yes|tow}} used in [[Persian/Lesson 1|lesson 1]].

'''Vocabulary'''
{{Persian/vocab-list|hide Arab=yes
|آقا|'''â'''qâ|/ˈɒːɣɒː/|Mr.|
|حال|'''hâl'''|/ˈhɒːl/|health|
|شما|šo'''mâ'''|/ʃoˈmɒː/|you|(formal, shows speaker's respect for listener)
|چطور|ce'''tor'''|/t͡ʃeˈtoɾ/|how|&lt;small&gt;(the endings ‹e› and ‹-in› will be explained in [[Persian/Lesson 5|Lesson 5]])&lt;/small&gt;
|خدا حافظ|xo'''dâ''' hâ'''fez'''|/xoˈdɒː hɒːˈfez/|May God keep you|(similar to the literal meaning of “goodbye”, i.e. “May God be with you”)
}}

{{Persian linguistics note
| Culture Point: Titles
| Titles like {{term-fa|آقا|âqâ|sir, Mr.}} are used before or after the first name, before or after a last name, or before or after both names. In the dialogue above, it is used before the first name {{Persian/text|پيمان|peyman}}.

The feminine version of {{Persian/text|آقا|âqâ|sir, Mr.}} is {{Persian/text|آغا|âqâ|madam, Miss}}.  The two words are pronounced the same way and are sometimes confused for each other as a misspelling, but {{Persian/text|آقا}} is the proper spelling for use with male names and {{Persian/text|آغا}} for female names.

Family names are a relatively new aspect of Persian culture, having been introduced in Iran in 1912.
}}

{{Persian linguistics note
| Syllable stress
| In most Persian words, the stress falls on the last syllable of the stem.

For example, in the following words from the dialogue, the stress is on the last syllable:
* ‹šo'''mâ'''›
* ‹ce'''tor'''›
* ‹mam'''nun'''›
* ‹xo'''dâ'''›
* ‹hâ'''fez'''›

When suffixes and [[w:Clitic|enclitics]] are added to Persian words and word stems, the stress usually does not move:
* ‹ce'''tor'''› + ‹-in› → ‹ce'''tor'''in›
* ‹'''hast'''› + ‹-am› → ‹'''hast'''am›
* ‹'''hâl'''› + ‹-e› → ‹'''hâl'''-e›

A few prefixes and suffixes are stressed.  Those details will be explained in the lessons for those suffixes and prefixes.

A limited set of Persian words (interjections, conjunctions and vocatives), however, has the stress on the first syllable:
* ‹'''mer'''si› — First syllable is stressed when used as in the conversation above, &quot;Thanks!&quot;
* ‹'''â'''qâ-ye› — First syllable is stressed when addressing someone by title as in the conversation above, but not when talking with someone else about ‹â'''qâ'''-ye› so-and-so.
* ‹'''â'''raš› — First syllable is stressed when addressing Arash as in the conversation above, but the last syllable is stressed ‹â'''raš'''› when talking about him.
* ‹'''pey'''mân› — First syllable is stressed when addressing Peyman as in the conversation above, but the last syllable is stressed ‹pey'''man'''› when talking with someone else about him.

The next two Persian letters, shown on the right, have the same basic form, but only second one has a dot.  Like &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; ‹alef›, these two letters do '''not''' connect with the letter that follows them.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=&amp;zwnj;د&amp;zwnj;| Latn=dâl| audio=fa-د.ogg | key=does not connect with the following letter}}
The letter {{term-fa|د|dâl}} represents the /d/ sound.  It sits on the baseline and is written beginning at the top, ending at the bottom left. Its name sounds like the English word “doll”.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=داد| Latn=dâd| audio= fa-آب.ogg |د|d|ا|â|د|d}}
The Persian word {{term-fa|داد|dâd|(he/she/it) gave}} is shown on the right.  As shown, &lt;big&gt;د&lt;/big&gt; does '''not''' join with the letter that follows it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=&amp;zwnj;ذ&amp;zwnj;| Latn=zâl | key=does not connect with the following letter}}
The letter {{term-fa|ذ|zâl}} is one of the “foreign” letters in Persian.  In Arabic, it represents the consonant [[w:Voiced dental fricative|[ð]]], but Persian does not have that sound, so it is pronounced as the closest Persian sound.  Thus, &lt;big&gt;ذ&lt;/big&gt; ‹zâl› is one of four Persian letters pronounced /z/.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ذات|Latn=zât|ذ|z|ا|â|ت|t}}
As shown in {{term-fa|ذات|zât|essence}} on the right, the letter &lt;big&gt;ذ&lt;/big&gt; also does '''not''' join with the letter that follows it.

|  ر || ز || ژ
|-
| ‹re› || ‹ze› || ‹že›
|}
The next three Persian letters, also have the same basic form except for the dots.  They are all written with a tail that drops well below the baseline.  Like &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; ‹alef›, &lt;big&gt;د&lt;/big&gt; ‹dâl›, and &lt;big&gt;ذ&lt;/big&gt; ‹zâl›, these three letters do '''not''' connect with the letter that follows them.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=&amp;zwnj;ر&amp;zwnj;|audio=fa-ر.ogg|Latn=re| key=does not connect with the following letter}}
The letter {{term-fa|ر|re}} is pronounced as [[w:Alveolar tap|[ɾ]]], that is, it is produced by striking the tongue against the roof of the mouth just behind the teeth, then expelling air over the middle of the tongue, similar to the ''r'' in the Scottish English pronunciation of ''f'''r'''ee'' or the ''tt'' in the American English and Australian English ''be'''tt'''er''. Between vowels, it is often [[w:Trill consonant|trilled]] like ''rr'' in the Spanish word ''[[wikt:perro#Spanish|pe'''rr'''o]]''.  Its name, ‹re›, sounds similar to a quick pronunciation of the English word &quot;ray&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=در|Latn=dar|د|d|ر|r| audio=fa-در.ogg }}
As shown below the word {{term-fa|در|dar|door}}, the letter &lt;big&gt;ر &lt;/big&gt; does not join with the letter that follows it. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=چرا|Latn=cerâ|چ&amp;zwj;|c|&amp;zwj;ر|r|ا|â}}
&lt;big&gt;چ&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ر&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|چرا|cerâ|why}}.  Recall that ‹e›, like other short vowels, is not usually written in Persian.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=&amp;zwnj;ز&amp;zwnj;|audio=fa-ز.ogg|Latn=ze| key=does not connect with the following letter}}
The letter {{term-fa|ز|ze}} is the most common of the four ‹z› letters in Persian. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=رز| Latn=roz|ر|r|ز|z}}
The word {{term-fa|رز|roz|rose}} is shown on the right.  Recall that ‹o› is usually not spelled in Persian words.  Like &lt;big&gt;ر&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;ز &lt;/big&gt; does not join with the letter that follows it. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=&amp;zwnj;ژ&amp;zwnj;| audio=fa-ژ.ogg |Latn=že| key=does not connect with the following letter}}
The letter {{term-fa|ژ|že}} is transcribed in [[w:Romanization of Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] and here as ‹ž› and is pronounced as [[w:Voiced postalveolar fricative|[ʒ]]], i.e. like the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;mira'''g'''e&quot; or the ''s'' in ''mea'''s'''ure'' and ''Per'''s'''ian''. If you open your Persian-English dictionary at the letter &lt;big&gt;ژ&lt;/big&gt; , you can see that it is not used in very many words. It occurs in many loanwords of French origin.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ژخ|Latn=žax|ژ|ž|خ|x}}
As shown in the word {{term-fa| ژخ |zhakh|wart}}, &lt;big&gt;ژ &lt;/big&gt; does not join with the letter that follows it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=س| audio=fa-س.ogg| Latn=sin}}
The letter {{term-fa|س|sin}} is the usual Persian letter for /s/.  Its name sounds like the English word &quot;seen&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ش| audio=fa-ش.ogg|Latn=šin}}
The letter {{term-fa|ش|šin}} is pronounced as [[w:Voiceless postalveolar fricative|[ʃ]]], that is, like &quot;sh&quot; in English.  It is transcribed in [[w:Romanization of Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] as ‹š›, but in other literature it may be transcribed as ''sh'', ''sch'', ''ʃ'', or ''ş''.  Its name sounds like the English word “sheen”.

== Review ==
In this lesson, you learned some greetings, the first nine letters of the Persian Alphabet, and how to spell several words with those letters from right to left.  You also learned that short vowels are usually not written, and that many letters change their shape depending on whether they connect with letters before or after them.

In [[Persian/Lesson 1|lessons 1]] and [[Persian/Lesson 2|2]], you learned some greetings, the first fourteen letters of the Persian Alphabet, and how to spell several words with those letters.  You also learned syllable stress in Persian words.

In this lesson, you will learn more about casual and formal speech, the next nine Persian letters, and more about short vowels in Persian.

== Dialogue: ‹'''sobh''' be'''xeyr'''› ==
Hassan drops by to see his good friend Mohamad:

{{Persian/dialogue-top}}
{{Persian/dialogue| &lt;!-- حسن --&gt; | Hassan |&lt;!--صبح بخیر، ممد!--&gt;|sobh be'''xeyr''', '''ma'''mad!|Good morning, Mamad!| audio=}}
{{Persian/dialogue| &lt;!-- محمد --&gt; | Mohamad |&lt;!--صبح بخیر، حسنی. حالت چطور است؟--&gt;|sobh be'''xeyr''', hasani. '''hâl'''et ce'''tor''' e?|Good morning, Hassani. How’s your health?| audio=}}
{{Persian/dialogue| &lt;!-- حسن --&gt; | Hassan |&lt;!--بد نیستم، مرسی. و تو؟--&gt;|bad '''ni'''stam, '''mer'''si. va to?|Not bad, thanks. And you?| audio=}}
{{Persian/dialogue| &lt;!-- محمد --&gt; | Mohamad |&lt;!--من خیلی خوب است.--&gt;|man '''xey'''li '''xub'''am.|I'm very good.| audio=}}
|}

'''Explanation'''
:Mohamad and Hassan are using a very casual style of speech because they are close friends.  “Mamad” is a common nickname for people named Mohamad.  “Hassani” is a common nickname for people named “Hassan”.

{{Persian/linguistics note
| Familiarity and formality
| In any language, speakers use various levels of formality in various social settings. For example, an English speaker in a formal setting may use proper grammar, pronounce ''-ing'' clearly (i.e., so that &quot;walking&quot; does not sound like &quot;walkin'&quot;), may choose formal or technical words (e.g. ''sodium chloride'' rather than ''salt'' and ''child'' rather than ''kid''), and refrain from saying ''ain't'', but the same person could violate some or all of those rules in an informal setting.

In Persian, several speech patterns are used to raise or lower the level of formality.  One general rule in the Persian formality system is that referring to an individual with a plural pronoun and/or plural verb indicates respect for that individual.  In polite Persian conversations, it is therefore customary to use the plural pronoun {{Persian/text|شما|šomâ}} to when speaking with a superior or someone whom one has just met, and to use the singular pronoun {{Persian/text|تو|to}} only when talking to friends, family members, and the like.

The next two letters have the same form except only one has a dot over it. The bottom hook in these letters is a tail that only appears in isolated and final position.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=ع|audio=fa-ع.ogg|Latn=’eyn}}
The Persian letter {{term-fa|ﻉ|’eyn}} represents the sound [[w:Glottal stop|[ʔ]]], i.e. the glottal stop in the middle of “uh-oh” in English.  Traditionally, as well as in [[w:Romanization of Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] it is transcribed as ‹’›.   Its name sounds something like the English word “main”, but beginning with a glottal stop instead of an ''m''.  The top loop sits on the baseline.  When it is the last (or only) letter in a word, its lower loop hangs below the baseline.  When another letter follows it, it has a different form.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=رعد|audio=fa-ع.ogg|Latn=ra'd|ر |r|ع&amp;zwj;|’|&amp;zwj;د|d}}
As shown on the right, the letter &lt;big&gt;ﻉ&lt;/big&gt; ‹’eyn› combines with the letter that follows it, e.g. with &lt;big&gt;د&lt;/big&gt; in the word {{term-fa|رعد|ra’d|thunder}}.  

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=غ|audio=fa-غ.ogg|Latn=qeyn}}
The Persian letter {{term-fa|غ|qeyn}} represents the sound [[w:Voiced velar fricative|[ɣ]]], that is, it is produced by placing the back part of the tongue against the soft palate and vibrating the vocal cords while pushing air from the lungs over the middle of the tongue.

The top loop sits on the baseline.  When it is the last (or only) letter in a word, its lower loop hangs below the baseline.  When another letter follows it, it has a different form.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=باغ|audio=Fa-باغ.ogg |Latn=bâq|ب&amp;zwj;|b|&amp;zwj;ا|â|غ|q}}
As shown on the right, the letter &lt;big&gt;ﻍ&lt;/big&gt; ‹qeyn› is used to spell {{term-fa|باغ|bâq|garden}}.

The next two letters are shown on the right.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=ف|audio=fa-ف.ogg|Latn=fe}}
The Persian letter {{term-fa|ف|fe}} sits on the baseline.  Its name sounds like a quick pronunciation of &quot;Faye&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=فردا|Latn=fardâ|ف&amp;zwj;|f|&amp;zwj;ر|r|د|d|ا|â}}
As shown on the right, the letter &lt;big&gt;ف&lt;/big&gt; ‹fe› combines with the letter that follows it, e.g. as the first letter in the word {{term-fa|فردا|fardâ|tomorrow}}.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=ق|audio=fa-ق.ogg|Latn=qaf}}
The Persian letter {{term-fa|ق|qaf}} is pronounced like &lt;big&gt;غ&lt;/big&gt; ‹qeyn›, i.e. like [[w:Voiced velar fricative|[ɣ]]].  The small loop sits on the baseline and the tail, when present, hangs below the baseline.  Like other Persian letters with tails, the tail is only written when no other letter follows.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=آقا|Latn=âqâ|آ |â|ق&amp;zwj;|q|&amp;zwj;ا|â}}

{{Persian/connecting letters box |  Arab=ک| Latn=kaf| audio =fa-ک.ogg}}
The Persian letter {{term-fa|ک|kaf}} sits on the baseline.  The slash on top (&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) is written after the connected strokes of the word, along with the dots in any of the word’s dotted letters.  Its name sounds a bit like the English word “cough”.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box |  Arab=کتاب| Latn=ke'''tâb'''| audio =fa-سگ.ogg |ک&amp;zwj;|k|&amp;zwj;ت&amp;zwj;|t|&amp;zwj;ا|â|ب|b}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box |  Arab=گ| Latn=gaf| audio =fa-گ.ogg }}

The Persian letter {{term-fa|گ|gaf}} sits on the baseline.  The two slashes on top (&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;//&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) are written after the connected strokes of the word, along with the dots in any of the word’s dotted letters.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box |  Arab=بزرگ| Latn=bozorg| audio =fa-بزرگ.ogg |ب&amp;zwj;|b|&amp;zwj;ز|z|ر|r|گ|g}}

{{Persian/connecting letters box| Arab=اسم|ا|audio=fa-اسم.ogg|Latn=esm|e|س&amp;zwj;|s|&amp;zwj;م|m}}
The Persian word {{term-fa|اسم|esm|name}}, shown on the right, is an example of an initial alef without a “hat” ( &lt;big&gt; ا &lt;/big&gt; ) used to indicate that the word begins with a short vowel, in this case, with ‹e›.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=نان|Latn=nun|ن&amp;zwj;|n|&amp;zwj;ا|â|ن|n}}
The Persian word {{term-fa|نان|nun|bread}} is shown on the right.  Note that the written form uses {{Persian/text|ا|â}}, indicating that the word should be pronounced as ‹nân›, but in standard Persian, {{Persian/text|ان|ân}} is usually pronounced ‹un›, including the word {{term-fa|آن|un|that}}.

In [[Persian/Lesson 1|lessons 1]], [[Persian/Lesson 2|2]], and [[Persian/Lesson 3|3]], you learned some greetings, the first twenty-nine letters of the Persian Alphabet, and how to spell and pronounce several words with those letters.

In this lesson, you will learn the final three letters (ﻭ ‹vâv›, ﻩ ‹he› and ى ‹ye›), diacritics, and the remaining rules for reading and writing Persian vowels.  You will also learn about a Persian tradition called ‹haft sin›.

== Dialogue: ‹'''esm'''-e šo'''mâ''' '''ci''' e?› ==

Reza meets Shirin:
: &lt;small&gt;The dialogue below and those in subsequent lessons are shown in both Persian script and [[w:Romanization of Persian#UniPers|UniPers]].  Some of the Persian letters used below are explained later in this lesson, so read the UniPers transcription for now, then come back to read the Persian script version after completing this lesson.&lt;/small&gt;

== و ‹vâv› ==
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=&amp;zwnj;و|Latn=vâv|audio=fa-و.ogg| key=does not connect with the following letter}}
The letter و does '''not''' connect with the following letter.  It is pronounced in different ways, depending on the word: ‹v›, ‹u›, or ‹o›.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab= آواز |Latn=âvâz|آ|â|و|v|ا|â|ز|z}}
The word {{term-fa|آواز|âvâz|voice, song|IPA=/ɒːˈvɒːz/}} is shown on the right, demonstrating that &lt;big&gt;و&lt;/big&gt; ‹vâv› is pronounced as the consonant ‹v› in some words.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab= چوب |Latn=cub| چ&amp;zwj;|c|&amp;zwj;و|u|ب|b}}
The word {{term-fa| چوب |cub|wood|IPA=/tʃuːb/}} is shown on the right, demonstrating that &lt;big&gt;و&lt;/big&gt; ‹vâv› is pronounced as the long vowel ‹u› in some words.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab= اوت |Latn=ut| ا |-&lt;!-- no sound --&gt;|و|u|ت|t}}
The long vowel sound ‹u› may also occur at the beginning of a word, in which case it is spelled with initial &lt;big&gt;او&lt;/big&gt;, as demonstrated on the right in {{term-fa|اوت|ut|August}}. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab= تو |Latn=to| ت&amp;zwj;|t|&amp;zwj;و|o}}
Some Persian words that were originally pronounced with the long vowel sound ‹u› are pronounced today with the sound ‹o›, but their spelling has not changed.  So &lt;big&gt;و&lt;/big&gt; sometimes represents the sound ‹o› in Modern Persian:
* {{term-fa|تو|to|you (informal)}}
* {{term-fa|دو|do|two}}

== ه ‹he› ==
{{Persian/connecting letters box| Arab=ه| Latn=he| audio= fa-ﻩ.ogg }}
The letter {{term-fa|ه|he}} is often pronounced like ‹h›, just like the Persian letter {{term-fa|ح|he}}.  To distinguish between them, a Persian speaker may specify {{Persian/text|ح}} by saying ‹he-ye jimi›, in reference to the similar form shared with {{Persian/text|ج|jim}}.  Or, because of the traditional arrangements of letters in chronograms, they may be distinguished as {{Persian/text|حاء حطّی|he-ye hotti}} for {{Persian/text|ح}} and {{Persian/text|هاء هوّز|he-ye havvaz}} for {{Persian/text|ه}}.

{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=جوجه|Latn= jojeh|ج&amp;zwj;|j|&amp;zwj;و|o|ج&amp;zwj;|j|&amp;zwj;ه|h}}
The connecting forms of &lt;big&gt;ه&lt;/big&gt; ‹he› are shown on the right in a typical Persian style.  There are several variations, though, so you may run across any of the following:
* {{term-fa|راه|râh|road, path}}
* {{term-fa|جوجه|jojeh|chicken}}

At the end of a word, {{Persian/text|ه}} often is not pronounced as ‹h›, but just indicates that the word ends in the sound ‹e›: {{Persian/text|خانه|xâne|house}}

{{Persian/linguistics note
| Duplicate Letters
| In Persian there is more than one letter available for some sounds because words imported from Arabic are spelled using their Arabic spelling, but with Persian pronunciation. So, there are three letters for ‹s›, four for ‹z›, two for ‹t›, two for ‹q›, two for ‹h›, and two for ‹'›. They are not all used equally, for example &lt;big&gt;ز&lt;/big&gt; is more common than the other ‹z› letters.

* ‹s›:
** &lt;big&gt;س&lt;/big&gt;
** &lt;big&gt;ص &lt;/big&gt;, e.g. {{term-fa|صد|sad|hundred}}
** &lt;big&gt;ث&lt;/big&gt;
* ‹z›:
** &lt;big&gt;ز&lt;/big&gt;
** &lt;big&gt;ذ&lt;/big&gt;
** &lt;big&gt;ظ&lt;/big&gt;
** &lt;big&gt;ض&lt;/big&gt;, e.g. {{term-fa|راضی|râzi|satisfied}}
* ‹t›:
** &lt;big&gt;ت&lt;/big&gt;
** &lt;big&gt;ط&lt;/big&gt;, e.g. {{term-fa|طور|towr|method}}
* ‹q›:
** &lt;big&gt;ق&lt;/big&gt;, e.g. {{term-fa|آقا|âqâ|sir}}
** &lt;big&gt;غ&lt;/big&gt;, e.g. {{term-fa|آغا|âqâ|madam}}
* ‹h›:
** &lt;big&gt;ه&lt;/big&gt;
** &lt;big&gt;ح&lt;/big&gt;
* &lt;'&gt;:
*: In Arabic, a symbol known as ''hamza'' (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ء&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;) is used to separate two vowels. This convention only used in Persian for words of Arabic origin.
** &lt;big&gt;ء&lt;/big&gt;, e.g. {{term-fa|رأس|râ's|head}}
** &lt;big&gt;ع&lt;/big&gt;, e.g. {{term-fa|رعد|ra'd|thunder}}
}}

&lt;span id=&quot;ی&quot; /&gt;

== ی ‹ye› ==
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=ی|audio=fa-ی.ogg|Latn=ye}}
The last Persian letter, {{term-fa|ى|ye}}, has a few different pronunciations: ‹y›, ‹i›, or ‹ey›. Its isolated and final forms vary significantly from its initial and medial forms:  It has a tail and no dots in the isolated and final forms, but it has two dots and no tail in the initial and medial forms,.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=یک|Latn=yek|ی&amp;zwj;|y|&amp;zwj;ک|k}}
In {{term-fa|یک|yek|one}}, &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; as the first letter of the word is pronounced ‹y›.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=سیب|Latn=sib| س&amp;zwj; |s|&amp;zwj;ی&amp;zwj;|i|&amp;zwj;ب|b}}

{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=این|Latn=in|ا|-&lt;!-- alef has no pronunciation here --&gt;|ی&amp;zwj;|i|&amp;zwj;ن|n}}
As the examples {{Persian/text|این|in|this}} and {{term-fa|سیب|sib|apple}} show on the right, &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; as the second letter of the word is pronounced as ‹i›.

{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab= فارسی |Latn=fârsi|ف&amp;zwj;|f|&amp;zwj;ا|â|ر|r|س&amp;zwj;|s|&amp;zwj;ی|i}}
In {{term-fa|فارسی|fârsi|Persian (language)}}, &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; as the last letter of the word is pronounced as ‹i›.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian linguistics note
| Vowels at the beginning of words
| 2=When a Persian word begins with any vowel sound, it is spelled with an initial &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt;.   If that initial sound is a short vowel, the specific vowel is not indicated, but if it is a long vowel, the corresponding long vowel letter is written (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; for ‹â›, &lt;big&gt;و&lt;/big&gt; for ‹o›, or &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; for ‹i›). So, &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; is the first letter in Persian words that begin with a long ‹i› sound, such as {{term-fa|ایران|irân|Iran}} and {{term-fa|اين|in|this}}. 

Remember from [[Persian/Lesson 1#ا|lesson 1]], though, the long ‹â› sound at the beginning of a word is not spelled with two &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; letters in a row, but with &lt;big&gt;آ&lt;/big&gt;, ''alef madde''.

==Ligatures==
Certain combinations of letters are written in a combined form known as a ligature.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=لا|Latn=lâ|ل&amp;zwj;|l|&amp;zwj;ا|â}}
When {{Persian/text|ل|lâm}} is followed by {{Persian/text|ا|alef}}, they combine to form the ligature {{Persian/text|لا|lâ}}, as shown on the right.

{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=سلام|Latn=salâm|س&amp;zwj;|s|&amp;zwj;ل&amp;zwj;|l|&amp;zwj;ا|â|م|m}}
The lâm-alef ligature appears in the greeting {{Persian/text|سلام|salâm}}.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box | Arab=ۀ|Latn=he-ye|ه&amp;zwnj;|he|&amp;zwnj;ی|ye}}
In an ezafe construction after a word ending in ‹he›, the &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; is sometimes written in a small form over the &lt;big&gt;ه&lt;/big&gt;, i.e. as {{Persian/text|ۀ|he-ye}}.  It looks like a hamze, and is considered such by some, but others consider this a ligature of &lt;big&gt;ه‌ی&lt;/big&gt;.

==Diacritics==
Like the accent mark over the ''e'' in ''[[wikt:café|café]]'', Persian diacritics (symbols written above or below the letters) are not actual letters in the Persian alphabet.

* {{Persian/text|ّ |tašdid|strengthening}}

Tashdid is a mark that looks like a small, curly ''w'', placed above a consonant to double or strengthen it. It may be omitted, but is used in many situations for clarity.

=== {{Persian/text|ء|hamze}} ===
{| align=right class=PrettyTextBox style=&quot;background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);&quot; dir=rtl
|-
| colspan=2 dir=ltr | The diacritic ‹hamze›, isolated and over ‹he›:
|- style=&quot;font-size:200%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot;
| ء || هٔ
|-
| colspan=2 dir=ltr | {{Audio|fa-هٔ.ogg|‹’›, ‹ye›}}
|}
The symbol on the right is called {{Persian/text|همزه|hamze}}. It is never at the beginning of a word and has different pronunciations, depending on whether it is in a native Persian word or one borrowed from Arabic.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box|Arab=خانهٔ|Latn=xuneye| خ|x|ا|â|ن|n|هٔ|e-ye}}
In Persian words, hamze may be written over silent final ‹he› (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;هٔ&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;), as shown on the right, to represent the sound ‹ye› in a construction called ‹ezâfe› that will be explained in [[Persian/Lesson 6|Lesson 6]].  The hamze for this purpose is usually left unwritten and is only added for extra clarity.  Rarely, it is used in the same way with words ending in &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; (that is, &lt;big&gt;ئ&lt;/big&gt;).

{| align=right
! Historically !! &amp;nbsp; !! Modern
|-

|-
| {{Persian/text|بگوئید}} || || {{Persian/text|بگویید|beguid|say}}
|}
Historically, Persian words with the sounds ‹âi› or ‹ui› were written with a hamze (that is, with &lt;big&gt;ائی&lt;/big&gt; or &lt;big&gt;وئی&lt;/big&gt;) to show that the vowel sounds were separate, but today such words are usually written with a doubled &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; (that is, ‹âi› is written as &lt;big&gt;ایی&lt;/big&gt; and ‹ui› as &lt;big&gt;ویی&lt;/big&gt;) instead.  Similarly, words ending with ‹ei› were once written as &lt;big&gt;هٔ&lt;/big&gt;, but today that ending is written as &lt;big&gt;ه‌ای&lt;/big&gt;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box|Arab=ژوئن|Latn=žuan|ژ|ž|و|u|ئ&amp;zwj;|-|&amp;zwj;ن|n}}
As shown on the right, &lt;big&gt;ئـ&lt;/big&gt; is used in some foreign words, like {{term-fa|ژوئن|žuan|June}} (from French ''[[wikt:juin#French|juin]]''), to show a transition between vowels.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{| align=right
| أ ‹a’›/‹’a›
|
* {{Persian/text|متأسف|mota’assef|sorry}}
* {{Persian/text|تأسیس|ta’sis|foundation}}
|-
| ؤ ‹o’›

* {{Persian/text|مسئول|mas’ul|responsible}}
|-
| ئو ‹’u›, ئـ ‹’›
|
* {{Persian/text|مسأله\مسئله|mas’ale|problem}}
|}
In words taken from Arabic, like the ones on the right, hamze may appear anywhere after the first letter of a word to represent a [[w:Glottal stop|glottal stop]] [ʔ], i.e. the same ‹’› sound that {{Persian/text|ع|’eyn}} represents.  Usually, though, &lt;big&gt;أ&lt;/big&gt; is written without the hamze, e.g. {{Persian/text|متاسف|mota’assef}}, {{Persian/text|مساله|masale}}.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/connecting letters box|Arab=جزء|Latn=joz|ج&amp;zwj;|j|&amp;zwj;زء|z}}
At the end of an Arabic word, &lt;big&gt;ء&lt;/big&gt; is usually silent and written by itself, e.g. {{Persian/text|جزء|joz|part}}.

Arabic loanwords ending with a final {{Persian/text|اء}} are sometimes still spelled that way, but the final hamze in such words is silent, so the hamze is usually omitted.  For example, {{Persian/text|ابتداء|ebtedâ|beginning}} is now usually written {{Persian/text|ابتدا}}.

=== Short vowel marks ===
In children's books and some other learning resources, short vowel are marked using the following symbols:
* {{Persian/text|َ}}, called {{Persian/text|زَبَر|zabar|above}} or  {{term-fa|فتحه‎‎|fatha|opening}}, is used to represent short ‹a›. E.g. {{term-fa|دَر|lemma=در|dar|door, at}}
* {{Persian/text|ِ}}, called {{Persian/text|زير|zir|below}} or {{term-fa|كَسره|kasra|breaking}}, is used to represent ‹e›.
* {{Persian/text|ُ }}, called {{Persian/text|پيش|piš|before}} or {{term-fa|ضَمّه|zamah}}, is used to represent ‹o›.

The short vowel diacritics may be doubled at the end of an Arabic loanword to indicate that the vowel is followed by ‹-n›, known as {{Persian/text|تنوين|tanvin|nunation}} (also, {{Persian/text|تنوين نصب |tanvin nasb|marking a consonant with tanvin}}). In Arabic, the signs indicate grammatical case endings: {{Persian/text|ـً|-un}} (nominative), {{Persian/text|ـٍ|-en}} (accusative), and {{Persian/text|ـٌ|-an}} (genitive).

A related mark is {{Persian/text|سُكون|sokun}}, also called {{Persian/text|جَزْم|jazm|amputation}}.  It is used to indicate the absence of a vowel and is written as a superscripted ''o'': {{Persian/text| ْ}}

'''Explanation'''
:Shirin and Reza have just met.
:While &quot;'''âqâ'''&quot; is an honorific used in Persian before Male given names, it is not translated to &quot;Mr.&quot; in English.

== Subjects ==
In both English and Persian, sentences have '''subjects''' and '''verbs'''.  In a sentence that expresses an action, the subject is usually the main actor or agent.  In a sentence that makes a comment about a topic, the subject is usually that topic.  A verb is a word like ''talk'' that expresses an action, or one like ''is'' that links the subject to the words that comment about it:
{| class=wikitable
|-
! Sentence !! Subject !! Verb
|-
| “I am a student.” || “I” || “am”
|-
| “Did you complete the assignment?” || “you” || “Did complete”
|-
| “Study this grammar topic!” || “(you)”&lt;ref&gt;The word “you” does not usually appear in English commands, but the grammatical subject “you” is implied.&lt;/ref&gt; || “Study”
|}
Each sentence above, like all complete sentences in English and Persian, has a '''subject''' and a '''verb''', even if the subject is only implied.  Subjects have grammatical “number” and “person”:
* First, second, or third person: indicates whether the speaker or addressee is included
* Singular or plural number: indicates how many people or things are included &lt;ref name=&quot;plural_semantic_vs_grammar&quot;&gt;The grammatical number may be different from the semantic number.  E.g., in “These scissors are dull”, the subject and verb are grammatically plural but semantically indicate a single item.  In Persian, there are similar constructions, and both plural pronouns and plural verb forms are often used as a polite version of the singular.  More about this will be explained in later lessons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatical person and number may be represented by the following pronouns:

In colloquial speech, for example, the ending {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;ید|-id}} is often pronounced as ‹-in› and the word {{Persian/text|است|ast|is}} is pronounced as ‹e› after a consonant or as ‹s› after a vowel.  Other differences between spoken and written Persian will be given in the lessons that follow.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|}
Persian verbs are conjugated by adding suffixes, similar to the way English verbs like ''talk'' take the suffixes ''-s'', ''-ed'', and ''-ing'' to make verb forms like ''talk'''s''''', ''talk'''ed''''', and ''talk'''ing'''''.  In Persian, though, the verb’s suffix clearly indicates its grammatical person and number.  For example, the table on the right shows the simple present tense “full” forms of the Persian verb {{term-fa|بودن|budan|to be}}, consisting of the stem {{Persian/text|هست&amp;zwj;|hast-}} and various suffixes to indicate the person and number:

{{Persian/exercises-top|Conjugation
|show-answers=no}}
| Say each of the personal pronouns from the table above.  While saying each one, imagine and point to the people to whom the pronoun might refer.  For example, while saying {{term-fa|ما|mâ|we, us}}, imagine another person next to you and point to that person and yourself.
|-
| Repeat the personal pronouns as above, but after each one, say the corresponding simple present tense full forms of {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}} from the table above.  For example, when saying {{term-fa|شما|šomâ|you (plural)}}, point to two imaginary addressees and then say {{Persian/text|هستید|hastin}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|}

The full simple present tense of {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}} appeared as {{Persian/text|هستید|hastin}} and {{Persian/text|هستم|hastam}} in the first and third lines of the dialogue above.

{{Persian/text|بودن|budan}} also appears in abbreviated form above, once as the word {{Persian/text|است|e}} &lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt; and once as the suffix {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;م|-am}} following {{Persian/text|ایرانی|irâniy|Iranian}}.  That's because the verb {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}} has both a full form using the stem {{Persian/text|هست&amp;zwj;|hast-}} and a short form.  The long form is a bit more formal in tone and often carries the sense of “exists”.

The short form is used more often than the long form, especially in casual speech.  As shown below, most of the short form is written as suffixes (technically [[w:Clitic|clitics]] since they attach to phrases rather than just words) like {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;ید|-in}}&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt; in  {{Persian/text|چطورید|cetorin|how are you}}, but the third person singular form is written as a separate word: {{Persian/text|است|e|is}}&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;:

|-

|}

{{Persian/text|است|ast}} can be used with singular or plural subjects to express existence, like &quot;there is&quot; or &quot;there are&quot; in English.

For plural “animate” subjects (one that refers to multiple people or to a thing that might be thought to behave figuratively like multiple people), existence can also be expressed with the plural form {{Persian/text|هستند|hastan}}.

Some sources disagree with this and say {{Persian/text|است}} is only used as a copula, never used for existence.

Colloquially, {{Persian/text|هستند|hastand}} may be a suffix pronounced ‹an› after consonant or ‹n› after vowel.

== Word order ==

As the previous dialogues have shown, the verb usually comes last in a simple Persian sentence.  For example, the last word in each Persian sentence below is a form of the verb {{term-fa|بودن|budan|to be}}:

{{Persian/sentence translation
|fa=من خوب هستم.
|من|man|I|
|خوب|xub|fine|
|هستم|'''hast'''am|am|
|en=I am fine.}}

{{Persian/sentence translation
|fa=تو دانشجو هستی.
|تو|to|you|&lt;!--&lt;small&gt;(informal)&lt;/small&gt;--&gt;
|دانشجو|danešju|student|
|هستی|'''hast'''i|are|
|en=You are a student.}}

{{Persian/sentence translation
|fa=دانشگاه بزرگ است.
|دانشگاه|dânešgâh|university|
|بزرگ|bozorg|big|
|است|e|is|
|en=The university is big.}}
Grammatically, subjects are optional in Persian.  Since the suffix of a conjugated verb clearly indicates the number and person of the subject, subject pronouns are often omitted from Persian sentences, except when used for emphasis.

My name is Gerard, I am from the Netherlands. I am intrested in cacti and succulent plants and have created a database on them. The information is largely based on info from [[IPNI]], ([http://www.ipni.org IPNI website]), created in Microsoft Access and is open source.

Because of this work I am interested in things like taxonomy. I am interested in ecology, have written some articles about area's that are important like the &quot;Oostvaarderplassen&quot; and the &quot;Gelderse poort&quot;. (both are in the GOOGLE top 5). My MO is to have a topic and make sure that it relates to a lot of additional pages; the &quot;Gelderse poort&quot; is about rivers and fish, so I started my native fish project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes a single µcontroller isn't sufficient to control your robot. Then you'll be needing a way to connect all those µcontrollers, preferably without sacrificing too many pins or expensive ICs. Of course this problem has been solved a long time ago and there are quite a number of different standards each having their own advantages and disadvantages.

===Standards===
There are many different standards on connecting 2 or more µcontrollers (or computers), but here are the most used standards:

''(See [[Serial communications bookshelf]] for more detailed information about serial communication standards)''

====I²C====

Inter-Integrated-Circuit-bus or Two-wire serial bus: Used to connect ICs on a single board. The bus has one clock and one data line. Both the clock and data line are pulled high and device only drives the lines low.  There are plenty of ICs available with build-in I²C interface including many of the modern µcontrollers.

µcontrollers with build in I²C support:
*ATMEGA8          
*ATMEGA16
*ATMEGA32
*ATMEGA64
*ATMEGA128
*ATMEGA8535

Some I²C ICs:
*MAX5380/5381/5382:    8Bit DAC
*PCF8574:              8bit I/O-expander for I²C-bus
*LM75:                 digital temperature sensor

The I²C protocol can also be performed in software and is usually referred to as bit-banged I²C.

See:[http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/markets/mms/protocols/i2c/ Philips Semiconductors]

====RS232====

Recommended Standard 232: Better known as the serial port on a PC. Used to connect two devices.

See: [http://www.beyondlogic.org/ Further down the page]

====RS422====

Recommended Standard 422: industrial version of RS232. Much better than RS-232 at resisting interference.

See: [http://www.arcelect.com/rs422.htm RS422 tutorial]

====RS485====

Recommended Standard 485: Better version of RS422: allows more than 2 devices to be connected together. (usually up to 32 devices)

RS232 &lt;-&gt; RS485 converters:
*LTC485CN8:    DIL8
*SN75LBC176D:  SOIC8

See: [http://www.arcelect.com/RS485_info_Tutorial.htm RS485 tutorial]

====CAN====

Acronym stands for &quot;Controller Area Network.&quot; More complicated network. Used in automotive and domotica. Originally developed by Bosch in Germany. Limited to 1 Mbps in theory; with required overhead, protocol is slower than 1 Mbps. Data is delivered in packets of 8 bytes. CAN is frequently referred to as CANbus.

See: [http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/markets/mms/protocols/can/ Philips Semiconductors]

====1wire====

This bus uses 1 wire to supply power and communication to a IC. Used for temperature sensors and other low-power ICs. Despite the name, a second wire, ground, is used to complete the circuit.
Data is sent to the IC by switching the wire between high and low. A built-in capacitor provides the IC with power during the low parts of the signal. This bus is intended for low-power devices, like temperature sensors. 

See: [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/1796 Maxim-IC]

====SPI====

SPI(Serial peripheral interface) is a 4-wire full duplex bus.  The bus has a clock, transmit, receive, and select line.  One device controls communication on the bus. When connecting multiple devices, each device is connected to the master with a separate select line and the master selects only one device at a time.

Even though cookies are not harmful some people do not permit cookies due to concerns about their privacy. In this case you have to use [[Programming:PHP:sessions|Sessions]]. 

Cookies were first introduced by Netscape. PHP allows easy setting and retrieving of cookies.

===Setting a cookie===
Setting a cookie is extremely easy with ''setcookie()''&lt;ref&gt;http://php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php&lt;/ref&gt;.

;Syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 bool setcookie ( string name [, string value [, int expire [, string path [, string domain [, bool secure]]]]])
&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is the cookie name, &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; is the data to be contained in the cookie, &lt;code&gt;expire&lt;/code&gt; the time after which the cookie should expire, &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; the path on the server which can use the cookie, &lt;code&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt; can be used to set permissions for subdomains and secure if set true only transmits the cookie if a secure connection is present.

Since all cookies are sent by the server along with [[Communication Networks/HTTP Protocol|HTTP]] headers you need to set any cookie at the start of a page '''before''' any other code. You will normally only need to use the name, value and expire arguments. If expire not set the cookie will expire when the client closes the browser.

;Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
setcookie(&quot;wikibooks&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, time()+3600);
&lt;/source&gt;
The above code will set a cookie having the name wikibooks, value user and will expire an hour after it is set.


&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 setcookie(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;PHP-Hypertext-Preprocessor&quot;, time()+60, &quot;/location&quot;, 1);
&lt;/source&gt;
Here the setcookie function is being called with four arguments (setcookie has 1 more optional argument, not used here). In the above code, the first argument is the cookie name, the second argument is the cookie contents and the third argument is the time after which the cookie should expire in seconds (''time()'' returns current time in seconds, there time()+60 is one minute from now). The path, or location, element may be omitted, but it does allow you to easily set cookies for all pages within a directory, although using this is not generally recommended.

You should note that since cookies are sent with the HTTP headers the code has to be at the top of the page (Yes, even above the DOCTYPE declaration). Any other place will generate an error.

===Retrieving cookie data===

If a server has set a cookie on the user's computer, the user's browser sends it to the server each time a page loads. The name of each cookie sent by your server is stored in the superglobal array ''_COOKIE''. So in the above example the cookie would be retrieved by calling '''$_COOKIE['test']'''. To access data in the cookie we use ''explode()''&lt;ref&gt;http://php.net/explode/&lt;/ref&gt;. explode() turns a string into an array with a certain delimiter present in the string. That is why we used those dashes(- hyphens) in the cookie contents.
So to retrieve and print out the full form of PHP from the cookie we use the code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $array = explode(&quot;-&quot;, $_COOKIE['test']); //retrieve contents of cookie  
 print(&quot;PHP stands for &quot; . $array[0] . $array[1] . $array[2]); //display the content 
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Note: $_COOKIE was Introduced in 4.1.0. In earlier versions, use $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS.'''

===Where are cookies used?===
Cookies can be often used for:
* user preferences
* inventories
* quiz or poll results
* user authentication
* remembering data over a longer period

You should '''never''' store unencrypted passwords in cookies as cookies can be easily read by other users. 

You should '''never''' store critical data in cookies as cookies can be easily removed or modified by other users.

==Revolutionary France==
The monarchy failed to handle the economic crisis and social change before and during the Revolution. The systems of the Ancien Regieme proved ineffective at handling a society in which the middle class are the most productive group.
Absolutism was destroyed by Louis's indecision and cowardice, combined with the Enlightenment and destruction of Christianity
Absolutism had peaked during the reign of Louis XIV, whose numerous wars and palaces bankrupted the nation.
;National Constituent Assembly
:Served as a legislature and a body to draft a constitution
:Abolished feudalism 1789

* The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen was not a constitution, but a set of principles (like the US Declaration)
* Created a single unicameral house and the king would only have a suspensive veto
* In 1790, according to the Tennis Court Oath, they were required to have elections, but Mirabeau successfully argued for elections to be suspended until the constitution was finished

Amidst these intrigues, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organization made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trials started for criminal cases. The king would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers' organisations: any individual gained the right to practise a trade through the purchase of a license; strikes became illegal. 
===Causes of the French Revolution===
1. Seven Years' War (1756 - 1763) 	
A series of conflicts fought between France and her alliances against a coalition of Great Britain and her alliances in an attempt to gain greater territory in India, Germany and North America. However, these conflicts ended poorly for France, with great investment put into the war effort (money, troops), that resulted in a loss of land in the disputed areas. Furthermore, France assumed a massive debt through these wars, which contributed to the financial crisis during the 1780s. The Austrian War of Succession (1740-48) and the American War of Independence (1776-83) worsed the debt situation.

2. The War of Independence 
France's involvement in the American Revolution was not only costly on the French economy, it provided an example for revolution. Many French soldiers returned with 

3. The Three Estates and Taxation (c. 1700s)
The three estates in France were: the clergy, the nobility, and the peasants/bourgeoisie. The first two estates, the clergy and the nobility, were exempted from taxes, which laid the taxation burden on the Third Estate, the peasants. The peasants were the pooerest of the three estates and were forced to bear the burden of the taxes. This inequality led to a general resentment of the feudal system, which was especially dangerous given that 97% of France's populace belonged to the third estate.  

4. Emergence of the Bourgeoisie (c.1700s)
The men from the upper end of the Third Estate in France were known as the bourgeoisie. This emerging middle class was well educated and rich. However, they held no political power because they were still considered part of the Third Estate, the peasantry.

5. Louis XVI (King of France from 1774 - 1792)
Louis XVI was King of France before and during the French Revolution. He had no real interest in the political affairs of his country while he was the monarch of France. He was a weak leader at a time that required a strong monarch. He was also greatly influenced by his wife, Marie Antoinette, who was strong willed and ignorant of what the people of France needed.  

6. Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712 - 1778) 	Jean Jacques Rousseau was an Enlightenment philosopher from France who lobbied for the rights of the masses. He came from the lower classes of society and believed that equality, freedom and justice should be the foundations of a country.

7. Need for Economic Reform (c.1760s)
After the Seven Years' War, France faced severe financial difficulties. Not only was the Crown facing enormous debt from this war, but the method of collecting taxing was completely disorganized. Individuals appointed by Louis XVI attempted to reform taxation by including the Nobles and Clergy. His finance ministers, (ie. Turgot and Necker) were unsuccessful in addressing the deficit situation, largely because they faced fierce opposition from the first and second estate. Had Louis invoked the 'lit de justice' (which would force the reforms to pass), his finance minister may have stood a better chance. 

8. Bankruptcy of the Crown (c. 1760s - 1780s)
The expenditures of the French Crown during the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution ultimately led to the bankruptcy of the Crown. This event was also caused by standstill in economics; no reforms were successfully carried out. 

9. Revival of Parlements (c. 1774)
The Parlements were royal courts that could register laws from the King. They were abolished before the reign of Louis XVI, who revived them in order to gain popularity. They mainly consisted of 'nobles of the robe', who were lesser nobles, and would follow the king as long as he respected their privileges.

10. HIgh Prices and Famine (c. 1780s)
In Europe during the early sixteenth century, prices were rising. In France however, wages were not increasing to balance high prices. In addition to this deteriorating situation, harvest was destroyed by the weather in 1788. These two factors led to much starvation and the creation of a desperate mob in the streets of Paris.

===The Legislative Assembly===
A legislative assembly was formed, but it lasted less than a year.  It resembled early America - complete with  Articles of Confederation, military branches including an army and a navy (though weak at the time), and a treasury without any funds to substantiate its existance.

In 1792, The Paris Commune took control and took the ruling family as its prisoners.  A new republic was formed, and subsequently forced upon the nation.  The true power of the new government rested in the Committee on Public Safety, which was controlled by the Jacobins.

Eventually, a constitutional monarchy was formed as a moderate solution to handle the balance of power between the people, the king, and the nobles.  Apart from the obvious lack of any king, which eliminated the monarchist theory, the constitutional monarchy fell apart because external pressure from other countries (the Duke of Brunswick, the Brunswick Manifesto) - combined with an internal revolt - caused the nation to drift towards a more extremist, totalitarian government.

===Directory===
The new constitution installed the Directoire (English: Directory) and created the first bicameral legislature in French history. The parliament consisted of 500 representatives (the Conseil des Cinq-Cent (Council of the Five Hundred)) and 250 senators (the Conseil des Anciens (Council of Seniors)). Executive power went to five &quot;directors,&quot; named annually by the Conseil des Anciens from a list submitted by the Conseil des Cinq-Cent.
The new régime met with opposition from remaining Jacobins and royalists. The army suppressed riots and counter-revolutionary activities. In this way the army and its successful general, Napoleon Bonaparte gained much power.&lt;br&gt;
On November 9, 1799 (18 Brumaire of the Year VIII) Napoleon staged the coup which installed the Consulate; this effectively led to his dictatorship and eventually (in 1804) to his proclamation as emperor, which brought to a close the specifically republican phase of the French Revolution.

==Hitler's Effectiveness==
===Overview===
Hitler’s Nazism was a political philosophy bent on the creation of a stronger Germany, both militarily and economically, as well as an ethnically clean and superior Germanic race. Hitler’s rise was precipitated by a power vacuum, and the failure of the Weimar Republic to effectively address the needs of the people. The Weimar Republic’s ratification of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), the treaty that ended the First World War, was the cause of great embarrassment and anger throughout the land. The greatest cause for anger in the Treaty of Versailles was the Guilt Clause which placed all of the blame for the First World War on Germany and forced them to pay reparations. This anger and disgrace, mixed with a worsening economic situation as well as the use of propaganda, clearly aided in Hitler’s rise.

Not all of the goals that Hitler set out for himself were accomplished, but he did manage a great deal of success overall. His successes were mainly due to the intertwining of policies, such as his economic policy and his foreign policy.

During Lebensraum, Hitler enacted two different economic plans to support it, the first being &quot;Partial Fascism&quot; (from 1933 to 1936), which started a job creation program to reduce unemployment and curb union power. The second economic plan, the New Plan (enacted in 1934), called for greater exportation to increase Germany's liquid assets.  Later, he enacted the Four Year Plan, which called for autarky (self sufficiency) right before the war. Hitler also supported Lebensraum by masterfully orchestrating a string of agreements which he never wished to fully follow, such as the Non-Aggression Pact (1934), which pledged that Germany would not attack Russia; and the Munich Pact (1938), which said that Germany would stop attacking countries after taking the Sudetenland (Germanic part of Czechoslovakia).

===Rise to Power===
Hitler’s rise to power is partly due to an amazing upsurge in nationalistic feeling due to the failure of the Weimar Republic’s government to effectively address the worsening economic problems of the Republic. “Of all of the industrial states, Germany was undoubtedly the most vulnerable to a sudden downturn in economic conditions... As the depression deepened, foreign loans were withdrawn and the banking system eventually collapsed in 1931... The inevitable result was a rapid increase in unemployment, from 2 million in 1929 to 3.5 million in 1930, 4.4 million in 1931, and over 6 million in 1932.” (Lee 156)

Germany‘s current situation quickly connected with the already low national moral due to the indignation of the Guilt Clause in the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler appeared onto the national stage as a prominent and very appealing personality “The rise of Hitler involved distinct processes which, although connected, did not lead inevitably from one to the other… [One] was the emergence of an entirely new form of right wing movement which, under Hitler, eventually replaced this…system with a totalitarian regime.” (Lee 159)

The “new form of right wing movement” that Lee talks about is the Nazi’s extreme right wing nationalism (Nazi being a shortened name for Nazional Sozialismus - National Socialism). The basis of this nationalism was the belief of German, or Aryan, supremacy over all other Worldly societies, especially Judaism and Slavicism. According to Lee “Race was the fundamental rationale for all social developments” (Lee 203). This ‘Aryan society’, or dream of an Aryan society, was clearly part of Hitler’s propaganda campaign to bring in new followers.

===Foreign and Domestic Policy===
Hitler’s foreign and domestic policies were intertwined. This is most clearly seen in the policy of Lebensraum and its influence on economic policy. Lebensraum is an externally expansionist policy. According to Lee, pan-European expansionism is seen in Hiter’s ''Mein Kampf'' where “he argued that Germany should abandon her former pursuit of economic power through colonies or through attempts to dominate Western Europe. Instead, he advocated ‘turning our eyes towards the land in the east.’ “(Lee 193). Hitler saw the east as a large plot of land with innumerable resources waiting to be reaped, according to Lee, Hitler also speaks of visions of ‘new communities.’ “New communities would eventually be established on land carved out of Poland and Russia by the German army. Germany would have self sufficiency in raw materials and food, as well as guaranteed outlets for her manufactured goals.” This is where economic policy begins mixing in even more with foreign policy. 

Since Lebensraum called for expansion, it also called for military re armament. Since the Treaty of Versailles limited the number of troops that Germany could have at one-hundred thousand as well as forbade Germany of creating large caliber munitions such as those used in the Paris Gun, Hitler had to create a cloak of trust throughout Europe. He achieved this by combining every aggressive move he made with a symbolic appeasement move. This is best seen when Hitler proclaims to have an air force, according to Lee “The reaction of other powers posed a major diplomatic problem which Hitler needed to resolve.”(Lee 213) Hitler resolves this by creating a series of unilateral treaties, such as the Non Aggression Pact with Poland, and the Anglo-German Naval Pact, both of which served to quell the fears of European powers, as well as divide the Stresa Front (Britain, France and Italy). 

====Hitler’s economic policy had three main points====
=====The period of ‘Partial Fascism’=====
According to Lee during the period of ‘Partial Fascism’ “the state moved into a programme of job creation to reduce the level of unemployment while, at the same time, seeking to control wages and eliminate trade union power.” (Lee 194) There was of course a more militaristic side to this policy; this is seen in the fact that most of these jobs were created through the creation of civilian as well as military infrastructure. Some of these great projects include the ''Autobahn Projekt'' which were integral to the blitzkrieg, as well as the armament and tank factories used for weaponry.

=====The New Plan (1936)=====
The New Plan, under Schacht, “regulated imports and allocations of foreign exchange in key sectors of the German economy. Overall Schacht was convinced that it was essential to raise the level of exports if Hitler’s objective of increased military expenditure were to be realized.”(Lee 194). Also under Schacht Germany developed trade agreements with “underdeveloped areas” to gain new markets and resources (Lee 194). All of these were necessary steps for German rearmament.

=====The Four Year Plan=====
According to Lee “The basic purpose of the Four Year Plan was to achieve self sufficiency, or autarky, in both industry and agriculture...” (Lee 194). According to Lee “The plan resulted in increased military expenditure.” (Lee 195). The epitome of policy intertwining is noted by Lee when he notes that the final economic step was the implementation of blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg is utilized as a economic strategy to war due to the fact that German oil reserves could not hold on much more after one month of fighting.

=====Degree of Success=====
Hitler’s success in implementing the party line can be called successful to an extent. This is due to the fact that most of his initial policies, such as his economic policies, served their purpose as he had planned them. This is seen in the methodical calculation of timing economic necessities with the introduction of war. The first of the three steps of economic preparation for war, and their military equivalents all go through flawlessly, it is in the fourth step that Hitler stumbles, the fourth step being total war. According to Lee, by the time that total war began “The German economy was now pushed to its limit.”(Lee 195). Germany’s final downfall was due to its inability to not be outproduced by the U.S.S.R and the United States. The verdict on Hitler’s economic policy is mixed, relatively successful for the original goals, yet failed to make it past the finish line. Due to the failure of his economic policy the failure of his foreign policy, Lebensraum and the Thousand Year Reich, also failed.

==Rise and Rule of Single Party States

==The USSR (1917 - 1953)==

====Russia Prior to Lenin - a resumé====
During the early 20th century, Russia was still governed by Tsars (Tsar Nicholas II at this point).  Though the peasants had been freed from serfdom by Tsar Alexander, they still suffered severe conditions and servitude to wealthy landowners and more advantaged peasants (kulaks).  

By 1905, tensions were growing until the situation overboiled into a mass movement of strikes in February.  They were caused by labor shortage, food shortage, an unsuccessful war against Japan and horrid working and living conditions.  These strikes were so violently repressed on order of the Tsar that it led other labor and intellectual sectors of Russia to rise in mass revolt.  The 'Bloody Sunday' took place on the 22 of January when Father Gapon and many other important figures (along with several thousand commoners) marched into the Palace Square of St. Petersburg with a petition, whereupon they were shot at by the guards and were attacked by the kossaks out of fear - unknowingly to the people, the Tsar was not even there.

Such was the violence and disorder of the state of affairs that the Tsar conceded to a setting up of a 'Duma' (a democratically elected parliament of sorts) to give democracy to Russia.  However, the Duma was dissolved so many times by the Tsar that it was ineffective. 

The onset of the Great War of 1914 and the ineffectiveness of the Duma leads to the planned revolt of February 1917 and Lenin's April Theses (also 1917).  A Provisional Government was created with a mixture of Soviets and Political Parties represented.  This was also ineffective and led to the seizure of power by Lenin with his Red Guards in October of 1917 (aka The Great October Revolution).

=====The End of the War=====
Lenin wanted peace and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 with Germany.  Russia lost Poland, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Ukraine, and parts of Belorussia and Transcaucasia.  This accounted for 1.3 million square miles of territory, 62 million people, 1/3 of Russia's railways, the most fertile land it possessed (accounting for over two thirds of its agricultural gross product), and much of her coal and iron resources.  However, the Bolsheviks did not have to appease discontented minorities, allowing for time to concentrate on revolutionizing Russia and putting down the counter-revolutionaries in the Civil War.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Lenin’s Aims=====
Lenin's primary goal in Russia was to destroy class barriers and establish a socialist republic, which would gradually transition from socialism to communism.  Through this process, he would establish a &quot;withering away of the state.&quot;  In order to speed the achievement of his goal, he wanted to redistribute the land to the peasants and give control of industry over to the Soviets of various industrial sectors.
&lt;br&gt;
However, these goals had to change, since the Bolsheviks had minor support inside Russia and since the Civil War was beginning.  The transition would be made more difficult by the fact that Russia was not an advanced industrial state and that it still relied largely on a relatively conservative peasantry.  Therefore, Lenin instituted an economic system now known as War Communism (see below) to provide for the workers and soldiers during the Civil War.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

=====War Communism and the Civil War=====
''1918 to 1922''

''The Civil War'' came as a result of the seizure of power and dissolving of the Provisional Government by Lenin and the Bolsheviks.  Many other parties and partisans of an ulterior political situation banded together to bring down the new socialist state.  As a result, three factions formed: (a)the Whites, a gathering of all types, from Monarchists, to Liberals to the angry moderate Socialists (b)the Greens, land-based angry people who generally consisted of anarchists, peasants and cultural/ethnic independentists (c)the Reds, Bolsheviks and many Mensheviks led by Lenin and other key players such as Leon Trotsky.
&lt;br&gt;
''War Communism'' was an economic policy of urgency (or perhaps created on purpose, see historical debates) so that the war effort could be supplied in order to win against the Whites (the Greens being fairly docile and often banding with Red Army troops).  The central policy of War Communism was the forced requisitioning of grain and the nationalization of all industry (large and small scale).  The effects by the end of the Civil War in 1922 were very bad.  Several million rurally based people had starved and several more million emigrated to the West or to the southern Middle-Eastern or Eastern countries in three major waves between 1918 and 1921.  Working and living conditions were horrid and the industrial and rural production levels had fallen very far below the 1913/1914 levels (pre-Communism). Figures:

1132 million linear meters of textile prodution in 1918 and 219 million by 1919
Decline in marketings from 9.5% in 1913 to 4.9% in 1926 as a result of reduced peasant taxes

&lt;br&gt;

=====New Economic Policy (aka NEP)=====
''1922 to ca.1926''

Lenin discovered that a policy revision was necessary to avoid a counter-revolution, even though it opposed communist ideals.  Former industrial managers were instated because they were the only ones with expertise.  A more lax attitude was also used in relation with the peasants so that they would reconciliate with the government.  For them, the land and selling taxes were lessened, they were allowed to sell on markets for profit, but had to cede a certain grain tax to the government which was low enough for even small peasants to afford (in theory).  Lenin eventually regained control of the economy, but many smaller enterprises were lost to private owners (even though the figures show that there were only approximately four thousand private managers in the USSR by 1925).  Lenin grouped state-controlled industries together for an easier transition towards socialism.  As a result of this action, food and industrial production increased.  Lenin also brought education under state control, introduced social security schemes, attacked the Church’s position, and purged opposing factions of the Party by mandating a law banning factionalism (eventually to the detriment of Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kemenev, Bukharin, Tomsky, etc.).

=====Death of Lenin=====
Lenin died of a stroke in 1924, leaving Russia poised on the brink of a major socialist movement and leaving the development of the NEP unattended to.  His death created a major competition for leadership of the country between several players: Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Tomsky, Ryutin and Josef Stalin.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Rise of Stalin====
The rise of Stalin can be accounted for by his new doctrine of “Socialism in One Country.”  Within that theory, Stalin placed the development of Russia before any world revolution.  By January of 1924 - following the death of Lenin - two conflicting ideologies competed for power in Russia.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ''Left Wing Militant Communists'', led by Trotsky, had a foreign policy that held that an immediate worldwide revolution was necessary to revolutionize a backwards Russia.  Additionally, their domestic policy favored the rapid development of the economy and the creation of a socialist society.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ''Right Wing Communists'', led by Stalin, had a foreign policy based in the belief that a worldwide revolution would be unlikely in the near future.  Their domestic policy relied on a gradual development through pragmatic programs such as the NEP.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A general agreement existed that Russia could not have a successful socialist program without help from more economically forward countries.  Stalin competed for leadership by aligning himself with two other powerful politicians: Kamenev and Zinoviev of the All-Union Communist Party (the former Bolshevik party).  In 1925, they removed Trotsky as Commissioner of War.  After Trotsky's removal, Stalin slowly consolidated power and eventually broke with Kamenev and Zinoviev to take power in Russia.  He then implemented his &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; doctrine, which called for the construction of a socialist society in Russia regardless of the international situation.  Finally, he exiled Trotsky in 1928, having ousted leaders of the left wing party in 1927.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Domestic Policy Under Stalin====
Stalin viewed Russia as too far behind in technology. He wanted Russia to rise above the Western powers and become an industrial world pillar.  To do so, he had to revolutionize the way Russia - a country of farmers - was organized internally. He collectivized agriculture, introduced new and cutting-edge technology with aid from the West, and further controlled what was being produced in Russia. His &quot;five year plans&quot; were also meant to rapidly revitalize various industrial sectors. Stalin revamped his government by conducting purges to wipe out opposition and introduce younger, more obedient officials.
&lt;br&gt;
=====Collectivization and the Five Year Plans=====
According to Stalin’s viewpoint, Russia had fallen too far behind in technological advances, and could either rise to power or be crushed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Do you want our Socialist fatherland to be beaten and to lose its independence? If you do not want this you must put an end to this backwardness as speedily as possible and develop genuine Bolshevik speed in building up the Socialist system of economy. There are no other ways……We are fifty to a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this lag in ten years. Either we do it or they crush us.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
======Collectivization (Agriculture)======
In 1924, oftentimes &quot;backwards&quot; methods were used by peasants who worked in agriculture (roughly 80% of the population), who lived in widespread poverty, and had to deal with primitive conditions and archaic farming methods.  Several problems were encountered because of the farmers' archaic methodology.  According to Stalin, the conservative attitude of the population held back progress and especially blamed the 'kulaks' (wealthy farmers) for it.  Industrial labor development was deemed impossible because of inefficient farming and unskilled peasant labor.  Additionally, the peasants would not allow for a surplus, which would pay for imported foodstuffs.  When Stalin collectivized farming by force, the peasants rebelled, destroying crops and animals.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The collectivization of agriculture had a number of advantages.  A majority of peasants were organized onto collective farms, allowing the government greater control over food production and allocation.  As a result, farming was modernized, and farmers were allowed access to modern machinery and methods.  A stable food supply became available for the industrial reforms (Stalin's five year plans) and for future wars.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, due to the peasant rebellion, the initial effect was a massive drop in net production when animals and crops were destroyed.  The peasantry had to pay heavy tariffs in order to maintain their way of life.  The uprising also resulted in a large human cost, as most of the rebels and many able farmers were killed or starved in the process.  Additionally, long-term agriculture collectivization was insufficient because it was not responsive to local needs.
&lt;br&gt;

======Five Year Plans (Industry)======
A central planning system was required to allow the government to control production and allocate resources.  Each sector was given a five year target.  The &quot;five year plans&quot; would - Stalin believed - eliminate waste and increase concentration upon vital areas of the economy.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first Five Year Plan, enacted from 1928 to 1932, aimed to create a solid industrial base.  It was designed to achieve the expansion of coal and steel production, transportation, electrical power, and other such industries.  However, its goal of a 20% per annum increase was  diversify Russia's industrial interests.  It had a more realistic aim of a 14% increase in production.  As a result of this plan, certain areas experienced rapid and large growth, particularly in the engineering and metal-working sectors.  The planners and workforce had more experience, and government control over labor increased.  The consumer goods and similar sectors were less successful, and weapon production increased during the rise of Hitler.  More resources were aimed towards weapon production, but no corresponding increase in wages occurred.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The third Five Year Plan, enacted from 1938 to 1941 (only lasting three years because of the onstart of World War II and the need to fund the war effort), had the central goal of strengthening Russia's economy.  It had what was perhaps the most realistic goal: 12% growth.  It resulted in the construction of new plants in Eastern Russia, but labour shortages and disorganization due to staff purges further hindered its adoption, as did Germany's invasion and armament plans in 1941.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ultimately, the Five Year Plans met with a degree of short term success, having turned the USSR into a major industrial power in fifteen years.  They allowed Russia to resist the German invasion in 1941.  The plans led to a higher degree of government control, and an overall improvement in the standard of living.  However, there was initially much error and waste, as well as an initial decline in living standards.  The plans were harshly enforced, and a new elite was formed as a result.  The plans also became increasingly complex, making them more difficult to organize and maintain.  By 1945, a major reform would be needed.

=====Stalin’s Purges=====
In 1932, Stalin began to attack his political opponents in a series of purges (chistka, the show trials and the Yezhovshina) aimed at destroying the vestiges of political opposition to him.  As a result, his opposition was eliminated, allowing for Stalin to become Russia's dictator.  However, most of the able, experienced members of Soviet society were eliminated - including politicians and military officers.  Millions of the population were executed, and fear grew within Soviet society to the point where the denouncement of others had become commonplace.  Society became scared to voice its opinions, thereby hindering whatever initiative it once had.

=====Conclusion=====

Stalin was successful in some theoretical areas - Russia's army grew in power, her industries were expanded, and she became a world power.  However, the costs of the improvements (purges, collectivization, and so on) proved an enormous burden on Russia as a whole.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

====Foreign Policy Under Stalin====

=====Overview=====
The foreign policy of Russia was dominated by expansionist nationalism and hostility towards the capitalist world under its Marxist ideology.  Stalin also had a distinct “Real Politik” ideology to all his foreign policies. This resulted in Russia adopting a variable political stance under his rule.

=====Bolshevik’s (revised)  Policy (pre - 1934)=====

The Bolshevik’s revised policy was enacted when it became clear that the capitalist western world would not be revolutionized.  It was founded in the belief that a revolution would eventually occur in the long run.  The policy was designed to help nations against western imperialism, to exploit capitalist state rivalries, and to use the Comintern to encourage labor unrest.

=====Stalin’s Foreign Policy (post - 1934)=====
The change in Russia's foreign policy came about because of Hitler’s rise in power, and the total control over state policy by Stalin - which was based on “cold-blooded realism.”

Russia joined the League of Nations in 1934 and adopted “collective security.”  An agreement of mutual assistance was signed with France, diplomatic relations were established with the United States, and Communist parties in other nations were urged by the Soviets to cooperate with left-wing groups against fascism.  However, Britain and France saw fascism as a greater threat than communism, and adopted a policy of appeasement towards Hitler.  As a result, the proposal for military cooperation against Germany failed, and collective security failed because of a severe lack of support.  Russia was ultimately excluded from the Munich Conference.

=====Nazi-Soviet Pact=====
This lead Stalin to sign the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939 with Hitler. Also called the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (named after the two foreign ministers). Stalin had to accept this pact because of his suspicion of Britain and France and their lack of support against Germany.  Additionally, he wanted to strengthen the Red Army and hoped that the pact would delay military conflict with Germany.  Hitler promised Polish territory and the Baltic states to Russia, and promised to stay out of Russia's sphere of interest.

======German Invasion (1941)======
The Nazis eventually became more aggressive in Western Europe, and Stalin realized that there was no controlling Hitler.  He moved his army into the Baltic states for protection, but still had trust in Hitler instead of his generals and decided to purge them.  The military was weakened by his purges, a fact that was taken advantage of by Hitler.  He did not accept the British proposal for Polish protection in exchange for help against Russia, and Stalin - according to traditional views - did not listen to his generals about the impending German invasion.

In May of 1941, the German army invaded Russia (Operation Barbarossa), overtaking it within kilometers of Moscow.  Due to the cold harsh winter, and effective Soviet war industry and German unpreparedness for the environment, the Soviet army began to push the Germans back.

=====WWII and Russia (1941-1945)=====

Now that Stalin was in the war, he began to make his first post-war moves.  He demanded that Britain accept all of his annexations, but Britain refused him.  He demanded that the United States and Britain send troops to the second front, but Britain and the U.S. delayed entering the second front until a year later, which resulted in increased tensions.  At the Conference of Tehran (between Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill) Stalin asked for the warm water ports of Dairen, and Roosevelt and Churchill acquiesced to this demand.  Stalin’s new boundaries and territorial divisions are also accepted under the condition that democracy be instigated in Eastern Europe.  Soviet troops were sent to Eastern Countries to establish a Russian rule in place of a Nazi one.  To placate the West, Stalin signed the Declaration of Liberated Europe, though elections only occurred in Hungary.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Cold War and Russia (post - 1945): Berlin Crisis=====

The divided Germany and divided Berlin led to increased tensions between the U.S. (who controlled West Germany and West Berlin along with France and Britain) and Russia (who controlled East Germany and East Berlin).  In June of 1948, Stalin ordered the blockade of West Berlin, allowing no entry into or out of the city aside from a small airspace.  The U.S. sent planes full of resources to the West Berliners.  Not wanting to risk an all-out conflict, Stalin does nothing, and - on May 12, 1949 - Stalin backs down and stops the blockade.

=====World Revolution and the Comintern=====

The U.S.S.R. used the Comintern to promote a world revolution, with Russia - and therefore Stalin - as its leader.  In 1927, it was used in the suppression of Trotskyism and Stalin’s subsequent concentration on building socialism in Russia, at which point the Comintern’s actions were moderated.  In 1935, fascist dictators threatened the Comintern, which was taken as an act of aggression against all communist parties.  In 1943, the Comintern is abolished as a action of goodwill towards Britain and the U.S.; however, Russia remains the leader of all parts of the Communist Party.

=====The Fall Of Stalin=====
On March 6, 1953, Stalin - now 73 - died in his sleep after a lengthy illness, according to Russian reports.  Many theories circulated about the death of Stalin, including one that theorized that his top generals assassinated him, fearful of another purge.  He was supplanted as dictator by Nikita Khrushchev.

===Castro (1958 - present)===
----
====Cuba Prior to Castro====
=====The First United States Occupation (1899 - 1902)=====
The Occupation had three major goals, primary of which was the desire of the U.S. to make Cuba into a self-governing protectorate.  Additionally, the U.S. wanted to repair the damage caused by war.  Finally, the United States wanted to absorb Cuba into the American economic sphere.
&lt;br&gt;
=====The Politics of Corruption (1902 - 1953)=====
'''The Revolution of 1933'''&lt;br&gt;
The provisional government under Carlos Manuel de Cespedes could not stop the escalating violence in Cuba.  On September 4th, 1933, a group of army sergeants and the Student Directory overthrew the government - Fulgencio Batista was a part of this overthrow.  The new government had no political backing, and views differed within the regime; whereas the army wanted to defend the new order, the students sought genuine reforms.  The reigns of power were ultimately handed over to Dr. Ramón Grau San Martín.  He was forced out of office in January 1934, fled to exile, and was replaced by Carlos Mendieta.
&lt;br&gt;
=====The Era of Batista (1934 - 1944) =====
Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar led Cuba  - first through puppet presidents, from 1934 to 1940 - then as president from 1940 to 1944.  Batista was alienated from the &quot;respectable&quot; elements of the upper and middle classes, but was nevertheless extremely popular with the masses.  He presided over a mild reform program, eventually moving openly leftward in 1937 to support labour unions and communists.
&lt;br&gt;
=====The Auténtico Interlude (1944 - 1952)=====
Batista allowed an election for the constituent assembly, and Grau - who represented the Auténtico party - won.  After many different presidents took control of Cuba, and the corruption continued unabated, Batista staged a coup with the help of low officers just prior to the election in March of 1952.  
&lt;br&gt;

=====The Return of Batista as Dictator (1952 - 1959)=====
Batista abandoned the Cuban constitution and gave himself the title of Dictator; from this point on, all elections would be staged.  Batista was on good terms with the U.S. government, and allowed large American corporations to enter Cuba and use Cuba’s resources for their own profit.  However, the Cuban people remained poor; and no education or health care system was in place for the country’s people.
&lt;br&gt;

====Rise to Power====

=====1st Coup (1956 - 1958)=====
Castro opposed Batista’s unfair regime, and staged an unsuccessful coup.  He was part of the M-26-7 - which included Che Guevara - which trained in Mexico.  At this time, Castro believed in the cooperation of capital and labour, and was a true Marxist who told people to gain their support.  He returned to Cuba and staged an unsuccessful coup on July, 26, 1953; he was caught and imprisoned, but eventually released.

=====2nd Coup (1959)=====
Castro’s movement gained support and eventually toppled Batista.  The movement had grown to over 800 men (including army deserters), and - although outnumbered by Batista’s army - Castro won many military victories, especially against Batista in Operation Verano.  On December 31, 1959, Batista fled the country to the Dominican Republic, and on January 8, 1959, Castro took Havana.
&lt;br&gt;

====Domestic Policy Under Castro====
In the beginning of Castro’s dictatorship, he implemented many reforms.  He created social services, improved life for the rural masses, and endorsed public health and literacy.  However, his economic failures and dictatorship rule would eventually eclipse these reforms.  Under his Nationalization of Multinational Business policy, American corporate investments and land holdings in Cuba were seized.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the mid-1990’s came the breakup of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance and the USSR.  The need to establish a basis for growth without changing the regime were concerns for Castro, and the economy of Cuba began to free-fall.  In the economic crisis, Cuba’s GDP dropped by half, and her already low living standards took a plunge.  The economic conditions on the island - in addition to the re-emergence of small, isolated pockets of domestic opposition - caused the government to resort to a dual policy of liberalization of the external economic sectors and heightened repression in an effort to head off an impending political crisis.
&lt;br&gt;

====Foreign Policy Under Castro====
Cuba became dependant on the USSR for economic aid, as well as the trade of sugar and oil.  She participated in the &quot;world revolution&quot; movement (Marxist-Leninist) by championing over the revolution in Latin America, and tried to end dependence on the U.S. - though she failed because of the collapse of the USSR and all benefits from the former Soviet Union.  The new economic policy required Cuba to open up to foreign investment and ownership of select parts of the economy, as well as the legalization of the circulation of the U.S. dollar.

===Hitler (1930 - 1945)===
----
====Germany Prior to Hitler====
Germany remained vengeful, friendless, and threatened because of the Treaty of Versailles.  The German people were in search of a leader who would return them to their former glory.
&lt;br&gt;
=====Treaty of Versailles=====
''We agree to sign under compulsion, a dishonourable peace.'' --German Parliament
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The terms of the Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to demilitarize the Rhineland, and to abdicate Alsace and Lorraine.  In additon, it had to accept full responsibility for the war, and pay large reparations to other nations.  The army was reduced to 100,000 units; the navy, to 15,000; and the air force was completely eliminated.  The terms of the treaty were humiliating to the German public, and sentiments of anger and revenge began to grow.  Germany was left poor and under a devastating debt roughly equivalent to what is US$35 million by today's standards.  After it could not repay its reparations in full, France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr; Germany went through a period of hyperinflation which destroyed any of her economy left, leaving her people defenseless, threatened, and isolated.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Weimar Republic=====
Germany became a democracy after the revolution, during which the Kaiser was overthrown.  The Germans, however, did not know how to run an effective democracy due to lack of experience. After the Kaiser stepped down, a power vacuum ensued, which pitted opposing ideologies and parties against one another.  Ultimately, too many new ideas and too many people led to widespread fighting and brawling.
&lt;br&gt;

=====Soviet-German Relations=====
The Treaty of Rapallo was signed in 1922, formalizing an alliance with Russia.  Extensive trade agreements were made - specifically in weapons - and Russia and Germany renounce all war claims. It was in this way that Germany was able to breach the agreements made at the Versailles treaty through a technicality.  In the Treaty of Locarno (signed in 1925), Germany agreed to France’s possession of Alsace and Lorraine, and made the concession that the Rhineland would stay demilitarized.  Additionally, Germany consented to the inviolability of France and Belgium, and gained admittance to League of Nations.
&lt;br&gt;

=====German Domestic Situation=====
A global depression kept Germany’s economy down, and unemployment soared following the Great Depression in the United States. Many European countries were reliant on American loans, most of all Germany, and the failure of the US economy meant a subsequent failure of the Weimar Republic.  Jewish land owners demanded rent during the depression, which added to the economic crisis as well as growing ill-sentiment towards the Jewish people.
&lt;br&gt;

====Account for Rise to Power====
Hitler rose to power during a time of depression in both the industrial and political sectors.  He used the general public sentiment to further his cause.  Bavaria became the epicenter of many different ideological societies -  including antirepublican, antidemocratic, antisocialist, and anticommunist societies - which had corresponding organizations led by officers that were left disgruntled by the Weimar democracy.  Hitler was part of the political instruction program, which was against socialist and democratic propaganda.  He eventually joined the German Worker’s party, where he quickly rose the ranks to become the leader of the party.

=====Birth of Nazism=====
In 1920, Nazism was born when Hitler announced the program (25 points) of the National Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (NSDAP).  The party adopted the swastika as a symbol of white supremacy and German values, and the red flag bearing it as the party symbol.  On November 9th, 1923, the Beer Hall Revolution occurred, interrupting a meeting between Bavarian Prime Minister Kahr and General von-Lossow, who had earlier declared that he had taken over the Bavarian Reichswehr.  On November 8th, Hitler called for a march on Berlin and - on November 9th - he attempted his Putsch, but due to lack of support from Kahr and the Reichswehr, he is quickly arrested by the Bavarian police force and sentenced to a five-year jail sentence by a reactionary judge.  The judge later reduced the sentence considerably.  During the nine months Hitler spent in jail, he wrote Mein Kampf, in which he outlined his ideology and philosophy.  He expounded his views of racism, nationalism, collectivization, history, anti-Semitism, and politics within the tome; he summarily condemned the treaty of Versailles, called the Weimar Republic a humiliation and weakness, and denounced Marxists, Bolsheviks, communists, and socialists.

=====Hitler Takes Control=====
Nazis had never won a majority in the government; however, on January 30, 1933, after many attempts to gain the position of Chancellor, Hitler is appointed.  He immediately calls for an election, but one week prior the Reichstag is set on fire and destroyed.  After declaring a state of emergency, Hitler is given dictatorial powers and begins his Nazi revolution, calling it the Third Reich.

=====Historiography=====
* Marxist: Nazi victory last manifestation of capitalism before socialist revolution
* Shirer: Nazism a continuation in German evolution, natural development
* Others: Weakness in Weimar republic, and positive values of Nazis attractive after Versailles Humiliation

====Domestic Policy Under Hitler====
The domestic policy instantiated in Germany under Hitler's dictatorship centered on indoctrinating the German people using propaganda, race ideology, and anti-Semitism.

=====Propaganda=====
The Nazi party was successful in imposing its ideals upon the people of Germany using effective propaganda tools including posters, newspaper articles, movies, books, and film among others.  Additionally, the Hitler Youth program was created, with the ulterior motive of indoctrinating the youth.  It was successful to a failing point; in fact, the children became so indoctrinated that as they grew older they were programmed to think that they were superior to all others, which caused them to become disobedient, violent, and irresponsible.

=====Race Inferiority/Superiority Ideology=====
The Nazi party promoted the ideology that the Germanic peoples represented the Aryan race, and believed that the Teutons were the purest of the Aryan race.  To that end, the party worked to strengthen, develop, and expand the Teuton bloodlines.  The Slavic people were considered to be inferior to Germanic peoples, as were Jews; in fact, Hitler believed that the Jews were the opposite of the Aryans, and were meant to destroy the race by interbreeding and thus contaminating German genetics.  Hitler experimented with breeding men and women trained to fight - whom he considered genetically &quot;perfect&quot; - with the aim of creating a perfect race.

=====Anti-Semitism=====
Since the Nazis considered Jews to be inferior to Germans, they took measures against Jewish people living in Germany.  On April 01, 1933, Jewish officials were dismissed from their government ranks, and a boycott of Jewish shops began.  On April 07, 1933, the newly-passed Civil Service Law forced the retirement of non-Aryan officials in any government position, including teachers.  From this point on, a pseudo-science was taught in schools, which worked to spread the belief that the Jews were an inferior race compared to Aryans.  On September 15, 1939, the Nuremberg Laws were passed, removing German citizenship from Jewish people and forbidding them to marry Germans.  On November 09, 1938, Kristalnacht began; Jewish-owned shops were broken into and looted and destroyed, as were synagogues, schools and houses.  This led to Jewish children being banned from schools with German children.  During World War II, 90% of all the Jews in Germany were killed in concentration camps.

=====Economic Development=====
In 1932, the first Four Year Plan was passed, which aimed at the reduction of unemployment.  It met with success, and five million jobs were created.  In 1936, the second Four Year Plan was penned, which aimed at economic self sufficiency.  It did not meet with the same success as the first plan. This is perhaps because the initial boom of jobs came largely from the expulsion or migration of the Jewish population, which opened up hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Whereas independence from foreign trade was established, production and industrialization reached less than half of expectations.

====Foreign Policy Under Hitler====
Germany's foreign policy under Hitler concentrated on the expansion of Nazism, revising the Versailles treaty, uniting all German speaking peoples, and the concept of Lebensraum.

=====Expand Nazism=====
The central concept of the expansion was to spread the influence of Nazism to more industrial, political, educational, and similar areas.  Additionally, the Nazi party focused on establishing more independent governments adhering to Nazi principles (they met with success in Austria, Sudetenland, and Czechoslovakia).  In 1934, Germany signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with Poland.  In 1936, they joined in the anti-Comintern Pact with Japan and Italy.  In 1939, the party took part in the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact.

=====Revise Versailles Treaty=====
In 1933, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and Disarmament Conference.  In March of 1935, conscription was introduced, and the Saar Basin was repossessed; and, in 1936, the Rhineland was remilitarized.  Germany had succeeded in revising the Versailles treaty, and were allowed to do so under the pretense of appeasement.

=====Unite All German-speaking Peoples in a Greater Reich=====
Hitler succeeded in uniting German-speaking peoples in the Third Reich, which included Austria, Suetenland, and Czechoslovkia.

=====Lebensraum=====
The idea behind Lebensraum was to take control of Russia and border states for &quot;living space.&quot;  Germany met with initial success, having conquered Poland and one-half of Russia.  However, Germany ultimately failed, as Operation Barbarossa was unsuccessful and they ultimately lost World War II.

====Account for Fall====
*Turning point in war: Operation Barbarossa
* War was essentially lost
* 1944: Russians defeated German forces in the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Baltic states and Poland
* 1945: Russian troops 40 miles from Berlin, Americans 60 miles away
* June, 06, 1944: British, Canadian and American troops invade Europe successfully in D-day (operation Overlord), took Normandy
* April, 30, 1945: Hitler commits suicide
* May, 07, 1945: German troops surrender. Fighting stops at 11:00am. Germany signs surrender the following day.

==Comparison of the Causes of World War I and II==

'''World War I'''
* The arms race
* Final Cause – The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo
# Ferdinand wanted to marry a lady-in-waiting but Franz-Josef would only allow him to if the relationship would end his power.
# Kaiser Wilhelm wanted to Austria to punish Serbia and he thought that Russia would back him.
# He assured Austria-Hungary that Germany would defend her even if Russia took punitive action. He assumed that the bond of monarchy would outrank Russia's connection to the Slavs.
&lt;br&gt;
** He misjudged the reaction of Russia, he didn't predict military involvement.
** Eventually, the Kaiser thought that the czar was using the telegram conversation to get a head start on military preparations
&lt;br&gt;
'''World War II'''
* The appeasement of Hitler
** Britain and France gave him a part of Czechoslovakia.
** They put up with his Lebensraum plans

* Hitler's personality
** He hated both the Jews and the Russians. He had a “mindless hatred” for the Slavic people.
** He was not globally aware

* Short term cause – Hitler's invasion of Poland
** He allies with Stalin so that the eastern front is eliminated and he can quickly crush Poland.
** Britain was obligated to protect Poland

'''Both WWI &amp; WWII'''
* Germany
** In the first, the Kaiser's ambitions and policies led to the outbreak
** In the second, it was Hitler's aggression

* Nationalism
** In the first, nationalism in the Balkans
** In the second, Hitler's desire for “living space”
*** The lack of a working international system
*** Alliances &amp; the failure of diplomacy
*** Neither side could fathom the actual size of the impending war
**** Only General von Moltke thought it would be a long war

'''Sockerdricka''' (Swedish for &quot;sugar drink&quot;) is a soft drink from the 19th century. It is traditionally a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] drink that contains ginger, but modern commercial versions consist of carbonated water, some sugar, and citric acid.

== Ingredients ==
* 20 litres of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* the peel of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 60 g [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 25 g [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

== Procedure ==
# Boil the sugar, water, lemon and crushed ginger for 15 minutes. 
# Strain the mixture and let it cool. 
# Mix in the yeast and let the mixture ferment for two days. 
# Put the drink in bottles and add a raisin to each bottle. 

After five days the sockerdricka is ready for drinking.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* The recipe above has '''lots''' of yeast, and not much ginger. It would work well with just 10g yeast. More ginger would be good, e.g. 100g of fresh ginger for 20 litres.

'''Kroppkakor''' is a traditional Swedish dish: potato [[Cookbook:dumpling|dumplings]] with a filling of pork or bacon. They are cooked and served with butter and lingonberry jam. There are some regional variations to the recipe.

== Ingredients == 
* 1 kg cooked potatoes
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 1 onion
* 100 g smoked [[Cookbook:ham|ham]]
* 100 g bacon
* salt, pepper
* optional [[Cookbook:allspice|allspice]]

== Procedure ==
# Mash the potatoes. Put this on a breadboard and make a small pit in the middle.
# Put eggs, flour and salt in the pit and work the potato dough fast together. Too much kneading will make the potato tough. 
# Chop the onion finely, cut the bacon and ham into small pieces and fry it until it gets coloured. Flavour it with white pepper.
# Form the dough into a thick roll. Cut it in thick slices and put a pile of bacon mix in a pit in a slice, then put another slice on top of it, press the edges together and roll it into a ball. 
# Lower the balls into boiling salted water and boil them approx. 10-12 minutes or until they float to the surface. Pick them up with a perforated ladle and put them on a hot serving plate. Don’t boil too many at a time, they will then have some difficulty floating to the surface. 
# Serve hot with melted butter and red whortleberry (lingonberry) jam or cranberry jam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lek Polygyny==

Lek polygyny is a mating system common in polygynous species of insects and birds in which the male provides no parental care to its offspring.  The lek mating system is uniquely driven by the females’ pursuit of their mate, rather than the males'. Males of lekking species do not hunt for receptive females.  Males form aggregates in neutral locations devoid any resources valuable to females.  The group of males performs intricate vocal, visual or chemical displays to lure receptive females to their lekking site.  In most lekking species, these group displays typically increase the ratio of visiting females per males.  At the lekking site, visiting females are able to compare the males’ physiques and courtship displays, picking the most attractive male as their mate (Alcock, 2001).  Thus, the few, most attractive males will do the majority of the mating (about 99%), while the subordinate males do no mating at all (Sherman, 1999).

==Alternative Hypothesis: Kin Selection Hypothesis==

The Lek Polygyny mating system promotes a heavily skewed mating success rate among lekking males.  Although most of the individuals in a lek never receive a mating opportunity, lek polygamy continues to flourish among various species of birds and insects (Sherman, 1999).  This suggests that the fitness of subordinate males must somehow be indirectly benefited by communal displays.  A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the reasons behind lekking behavior.  Widely recognized hypotheses include the Hotspot Hypothesis, the Hotshot Hypothesis, and the Female Preference Hypothesis (Alcock, 2001).  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) proposed an alternative hypothesis predicting that lekking behavior is driven by kin selection. 
	
In the kin selection hypothesis, Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) suggests that if all the males in a lek where genetically related, then the males (even the subordinate males) would receive fitness benefits.  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) demonstrated the kin selection hypothesis by determining the genetic structure of different lekking groups of the Whipsnade Park peacock population.  Peacocks, a typical lekking species, form aggregates at neutral display sites.  Peacocks use their calls to attract receptive peahens.  Upon the arrival of a peahen, the peacocks cease calling and perform intricate plumage displays.  As common in lekking species, the peacocks with the most appealing courtship displays have a high mating success while the subordinate peacocks have no mates.  The lekking sites of peacocks are carefully chosen and after a male’s fourth year of lekking, he will establish his permanent lekking site.  Peacocks will return to this same lekking site every mating season (Petrie ''et al.'', 1999).
	
Using multilocus fingerprinting, Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) compared the genetic similarity of within and between the lekking groups of Whipsnade Park’s peacocks.  The results supported the proposed kin selection hypothesis.  As predicted, the degree of band-sharing within the leks was substantially higher than the band-sharing between the leks.  The band sharing within the leks was indicative of that of half-siblings.  After this discovery, Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) proposed subsequent hypotheses of why these lekking groups consisted of related individuals.  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) suggested that related peacocks tended to display together because their dispersal was concentrated around their natal sites.  This hypothesis was rejected when peacocks of mixed relatedness were reared away from their natal sites but, upon reintroduction into the Whipsnade Park population, joined leks with closely related peacocks.  It was then suggested that peacocks’ tendency to congregate with relatives was due to a shared genetic preference for habitat-selection.  This was rejected due to the homogenous environmental features of the park.  Petrie ''et al.'' (1999) concluded that unique structure of the peacock leks was driven by kin selection based on self-referent phenotypic matching [[(“Armpit Effect”]]).  Petrie ''et al.'' (1994) predicted that peacocks match heritable similarities of their own phenotype with those of other males.  Because the authors believed that peacocks do not participate in the rearing of their offspring, they posit that a peafowl’s recognition of their father must be genetically innate.  The tendency to form leks with relatives, therefore, occurs in the absence of social cues to their identity.  By cooperatively forming leks with genetically related individuals, subordinate peacocks forfeit their chances of mating, but increase the chance that their genes will be passed on via successful relatives.  The indirect benefits of fitness seen in peacock lekking displays outweigh the costs of communal displays (Petrie ''et al.'', 1999).

There are four distinct genera of Peafowl: Pavo, Afropavo, Rheiinartia and Argusianus. Though it is frequently reported that male peafowl do not participate in nest defense or rearing paternal care of young has been observed in all four genera. Only the common Indian Peafowl Pavo cristatus is frequently kept in captivity. Its behaviors in zoo settings may not reflect its evolutionary history to the degree that wild populations of the species might.

==Hotspot Hypothesis==

According to the hotspot hypothesis, males form leks because females frequently visit certain &quot;hotspots&quot;.

==Hotshot Hypothesis==

The hotshot hypothesis predicts that males form leks because subordinate males congregate around highly attractive males to increase their chance of being noticed by receptive females.

==Female Preference Hypothesis==

The female preference hypothesis predicts that males form leks because female like to visit large clusters of males consisting of a variety of potential mates from which she can quickly and safely compare the quality of her mating choices.

[[File:Wikijunior Puma.jpg|thumb|A puma hiding behind a rock]]
The '''Puma''' or '''Mountain Lion''' is a rather large cat, though it is classified as a smaller cat by scientists.  Like smaller cats, pumas cannot roar though they can muster a very startling snarl or a piercing cry.  In some places, these cats are also called cougars, catamounts, painted cats, panthers or painters.  Scientists call them ''Puma concolor''.

According to an old Mayan legend, all the animals of the jungle once looked the same until the gods offered to make them look different.  The jaguar asked, &quot;Let me be spangled with stars,&quot; and it was so.  He was pleased with his gift and showed it to the puma.  Not to be outdone, the puma asked the gods that he be as splendid as the jaguar, and it was so.  Pleased with himself the puma went out to hunt.  Unfortunately, he fell and rolled in the dust which clung to his still-wet design.  For this foolishness he and all pumas thereafter went through life the color of the earth.

==Where do pumas live?==
[[Image:Puma range.png|thumb|left|Places pumas live are colored green]]
Pumas are widely spread in North, Central and South America.  They can be seen in a variety of habitats including deserts, swamps and forests from northern British Columbia all the way down to the southern end of the Andes mountain range.  Pumas were driven out of the eastern half of North America by human pressure; a small population remains in Florida and occasionally there are puma sightings in other eastern states.

==What do pumas look like?==
[[Image:MountainLion.jpg|thumb|right|A mountain lion in Arizona]]
Most pumas are a light brown color, with black-tipped ears and tail.  The pumas that live closest to the Equator are the smallest, and increase in size in populations closer to the poles. (This sort of size increase is seen in tigers too.  The smallest ones live in the tropics, the largest Siberian tigers live far to the north where winters are very cold.)  The endangered Florida Panther is the smallest of the Pumas. Like many other cats, they can retract their sharp claws into their paws, which have four toes.  The largest male pumas can be as big as eight feet (2.4 meters) long, and females can be as large as seven feet (2.1 meters).  The males weigh in a bit less than the average adult human at about 150 pounds (70 kilograms),  with females weighing even less at 75 pounds (35 kilograms) or less.

Although pumas do not have a bright pattern, there are distinct black &quot;tearstains&quot; on their upper lips and a vivid white fur around the mouth that emphasizes facial expressions.  Although cougars cannot roar, when they growl their &quot;business end&quot; looks rather intimidating, helped along by the markings.

==What do pumas eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
[[Image:Cougar closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Puma closeup.]]
Pumas mostly eat large animals like deer.  Because the puma can run very fast, as much as 45 mph (72.42 km/h), and because they can jump 30 ft (10 m) forward from a standing position, they can very easily catch slower animals. Pumas can jump 18 ft (6 m) straight up and can climb onto rocks and up trees to hunt. Their bite is very strong, much stronger than a strong dog's bite, and their largest teeth are about twice the size of a large dog's teeth. 

Pumas have a very powerful hunting instinct, and have sometimes been known to chase and catch humans on bicycles. A favorite food for pumas is the deer, but they will also eat smaller animals.  In areas where pumas and people live close together, pumas have hunted dogs and cats for food, but they usually do not hunt people for food. If you are around a puma, it is better not to run fast or to ride a bicycle, because their instinct is to chase, catch and kill running animals.

On January 8, 2004 a puma killed and partly ate a mountain biker in Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park, in Orange County, California, but attacks on humans are rare.

===Stay safe around pumas===
[[Image:Saguaro National Park1.JPG|right|350px]]
These are good safety ideas for areas where pumas live:

*Never hike alone, Pumas are more likely to attack people who are alone than in a group. 
 
*If you see a puma, do not run, because their instinct might make them chase you. Instead, stand and face the animal, and look into its eyes. Stand tall, raise your arms, and make yourself look large. The puma will think you are a giant and run away. If it comes toward you, scare it away by shouting, waving your arms, or throwing things.

*Do not turn away from the puma; do not crouch down or do anything that would make you seem like an animal.  If you or someone in your group is attacked, fight back by throwing stones, hitting or kicking. Pumas have been chased away by using rocks, sticks, garden tools and bare hands.  The best place to hit a puma is on the nose.

*Watch around you when in an area where pumas might be.  Like other cats, they like to spring out from a hiding place and attack their prey from behind.

*Don't go hiking with your pet in areas with pumas, because any animal (even a dog) can make a puma want to chase and kill it, because of the &quot;chase reflex&quot; that pumas have.  Also, the puma might be attracted to your pet's food.

==Fun facts==
* Female pumas call to potential mates with a piercing cry that sounds much like a high pitched scream. Every year some panicked people call the police to report an &quot;attack&quot; in progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Polyandry ==

Polyandry is defined as “the mating of one female with more than one male while each male mates with only one female.” Exclusive polyandry (as opposed to polyandry in concert with polygyny) is very rare, occurring in only about 1% of animal populations, most being shorebirds like the sandpiper. The basis of polyandry is a sex role reversal. The females compete for the males and are larger and more colorful, while the males take on the parental role. With the sex role reversal, a natural selection against older males evolves. This is accomplished by the females tending to select the males with the best sperm in order to give the female the most offspring possible. Younger males will more likely have fertile sperm; therefore impregnating the female on more instances than an older male with less fertile sperm. 

===Types===
There are two major [http://www.stanfordalumni.org/birdsite/text/essays/Polyandry.html types of polyandry]: simultaneous and sequential. Simultaneous polyandry is when the female controls a very large territory.  Inside this territory, the female has multiple smaller nesting territories with different males. The female mates with all males simultaneously, keeping control of the smaller territories. Another form of simultaneous polyandry, cooperative simultaneous polyandry, is when the female only has one nesting area where she mates with multiple males producing a clutch of eggs of mixed parentage with all males contributing to the eggs. Sequential polyandry, the most common form, is where the female mates and produces a clutch of eggs with one male, then leaves the male to incubate and rear the eggs while moving on to another male in a different nesting territory. Here, the female moves from one male to another, leaving the male in full responsibility of the eggs instead of sharing the responsibility.

===Benefits===
There are many genetic benefits of polyandry. The first being fertility insurance. This hypothesis suggests that by mating with multiple males, the female is guaranteed to fertilize all of her eggs. The multiple partners potentially make up for one male that may not be able to fertilize the eggs. The good genes hypothesis states that the females have multiple mates because she is in search of the male that will pass along the best genes to her offspring. By finding this male, the female is increasing the survival rate of her offspring. The genetic compatibility hypothesis is one that suggests that the female finds multiple mates in order to find the most compatible genetic match for her eggs. While looking for a good match, she is also eliminating the males that are least compatible with her eggs. 

	The material benefits of polyandry can be seen through three hypotheses. The more resource hypothesis suggests that the more mates the female has, the more males she has to care for her clutch. The better protection hypothesis states that by having multiple partners, the female is better protected from predators. The infanticide reduction hypothesis is one that claims that since the female has multiple males, she has a lower infanticide rate because the males do not know which progeny belong to them. This prevents the males from killing other male’s young. Although some infanticide occurs between females and other female’s eggs, it is minimal among males.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A DBQ is a document-based question.  It typically provides anywhere from 4 to 10 primary source documents and is primarily found on the European History, World History, and US History Advanced Placement classes.

==Analyze the Question==
1. Rask Words? - Analyze, compare, contrast, criticize, interpret, trace, etc.?

2. What are the key subjects and terms? - People, places and events?

3. What are the boundaries or limits? - Dates and periods

4. What is the source? (&lt;u&gt;Hint&lt;/u&gt;: In the source, look for anything that could have possibly influenced the author or documents' point of view)

==Prewrite==
1. Brainstorm a list of ideas to write about (i.e. P.O.V., frame of reference, credibility, bias, etc.)

2. Group your documents by category, which arouse you most?.

3. Practice writing a thesis sentence on scratch paper making sure to answer all parts of the question.

==Write==
1. The intro paragraph should include an introduction sentence, possibly including the historical setting, significance and/or history of the subject, and the thesis statement.

2. Each of the body paragraphs (2-3) SHOULD tie back to the categories in the thesis sentence.

3. Each of the body paragraphs (2-3) SHOULD explain the P.O.V. of at least 1 document, and what might have influenced this P.O.V. (i.e. frame of reference).

4. In each of the body paragraphs, explain what additional document P.O.V. would have helped you better answer the question and why.

5. Good essays have conclusions. Good writers will pick up one essay point in their conclusion. (&lt;u&gt;Hint&lt;/u&gt;: D.B.Q. conclusions could easily be used to discuss missing documents or “voices”) see #4.

===Sequencing===
In vitro studies showed that breast tumor cells are less sensitive to radiation in the presence of tamoxifen.  This is believed to be due to the fact that tamoxifen is cytostatic and thus places the cells in a radioresistant part of the cell cycle.  Clinical studies showed that chemotherapy + tamoxifen was less effective, and this was extrapolated to radiation.

One randomized study and two retrospective studies.

'''Retrospective studies:'''
&lt;br&gt; All 3 studies show no difference in any survival parameters.
*Yale-New Haven, 2005 (1976-99) - PMID 15545666 &amp;mdash; &quot;Sequence of radiotherapy with tamoxifen in conservatively managed breast cancer does not affect local relapse rates.&quot; Ahn PH et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jan 1;23(1):17-23.
**Retrospective. Stage I-II invasive breast cancer treated with breast conserving therapy + tamoxifen. 254 pts concurrent RT+TAM, 241 RT followed by TAM. Median f/u 10.4 yrs. No difference in OS, DM, LR. However, pt groups unbalanced--younger pts (58 vs 62 yrs) and more pts given chemo (38% vs 14%) in sequential group.

==Aromatase inhibitors==
'''Introduction:''' Aromatase converts androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens--estrone and estradiol.  In post-menopausal women, estrogen synthesis takes place in muscle, skin, fat, and breast by aromatase, leading to low levels of estrogen.  

Aromatase inhibitors produce a near-total blockade of aromatase activity and lead to an estrogen level of 1-10% of its pretreatment level.  '''Aromatase inhibitors have been ineffective in pre-menopausal women because of higher levels or ovarian aromatase.'''
Commercially available aromatase inhibitors: 
*''non-steroidals'' &amp;mdash; anastrozole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara)
*''steroidal'' &amp;mdash; exemestane (Aromasin)

'''Trials:'''
*'''ARNO 95''' (1996-2002) 
**Randomized. 979 patients, postmenopausal, pT1-3N0-2. Treated with Tamoxifen x2 years, then randomized to Arimidex x3 years vs. Tamoxifen x 3 yrs
**'''3-years, 2007''' PMID 17563395 -- &quot;Improved overall survival in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer after anastrozole initiated after treatment with tamoxifen compared with continued tamoxifen: the ARNO 95 Study.&quot; (Kaufmann M, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jul 1;25(19):2664-70.) Median F/U 2.5 years after randomization (which was after 2 years of TAM)
***3-year outcome: OS benefit (HR 0.53, SS); DFS anastrozole 93% vs. tamoxifen 89% (SS); contralateral incidence 1.4% vs. 1.0%
***Toxicity: anastrozole 23% vs. tamoxifen 31% (SS), mainly due to fewer endometrial events
***Conclusion: After 2 years of tamoxifen, switch to Arimidex better
***JCO Editorial: PMID 17563391

***9366 post-menopausal pts (3125 randomized to anastrozole, 3116 to tamoxifen, 3125 to combination). Treatment for 5 years. Arimidex 1 mg qd; tamoxifen 20 mg qd. Started within 8 weeks after finishing chemotherapy, but could start during XRT. Median F/U 33 months. 84% were hormone receptor positive, 8% negative, 8% unknown. 47% had mastectomy. 60% were N0.
***At 3-years, DFS 89.4%(A) vs 87.4%(T) vs 87.2%(C). 2% absolute risk reduction. Comparing A vs T: 317 vs 379 events, HR=0.83. Comparing A vs C, HR=0.81. Combination not significantly different than A alone. Time to recurrence hazard ratio = 0.79.   DFS improvement seen in hormone receptor positive patients but not receptor negative pts.  Decreased rate of contralateral breast cancer 58%.  Improved side effect profile (see below). No difference in ischemic heart disease. Further follow-up needed before reporting OS or DM.
***Initial results showed that a new cancer had developed in 317 women in the Arimidex group (10%), 379 women in the tamoxifen group (12%), and 383 women in the group of women taking both drugs (12%). This means that the relative risk of recurrence for everyone in the study was 17% less for the women taking Arimidex as compared to the women taking tamoxifen. (This analysis included both hormone-receptor-positive and hormone-receptor-negative cancers.)  After this publication, stopped randomization to the combination arm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Peppered Moth (''Biston betularia'') ==
[[Image:Biston.betularia.7200.jpg|thumb|260px|''Biston betularia f. typica'', the white-bodied peppered moth.]]

Within one hundred years (1850 to 1950); the dotted whitish form of the peppered moth (''Biston betularia'') was almost entirely replaced by the melanic (black) form. The melanic form appeared to be best suited for survival against the soot that had collected on forest tree trunks from pollution because the moths could camouflage with their resting area on the tree. The dotted whitish form of the peppered moth was no longer predominant in this environment because they were easily detected and predated on. How does this happen? Many animals have anti-predator adaptations. Adaptations are defined as “a heritable trait that either spread because of natural selection and has been maintained by selection to the present or is currently spreading relative to alternative traits because of natural selection (Alcock, 2001).” Anti-predator adaptations suggest that a heritable trait, which enables the organism to hide from predators by seeking cover against a background, has spread by natural selection because of reproductive success. H.B. D. Kettlewell’s experiments on the peppered moths, as well as, those conducted by R.J. Howlett and M.E.N. Majerus have proven that the peppered moth’s preference for their resting places on trees are anti-predator adaptations.

In 1955, H.B. D. Kettlewell published his study on pepper moths: ''Selection Experiments on Industrial Melanism in the Lepidoptera''. Kettlewell hypothesized that the dotted whitish form of the peppered moth were more likely to be eaten than the melanic form because they could be easily detected against the soot covered trees. His studies showed that the moths that were easily identified by humans were at a higher risk of predation from birds. The dotted whitish form was at higher risk of predation than the melanic form in the polluted environment.

Howlett and Majerus further examined this hypothesis in their study: ''The Understanding of Industrial Melanism in the Peppered Moth'', published in 1987.  They tested it by pinning 50 of both forms of the peppered moths on pale and dark tree trunks.

== Calculations ==
'''Moths in Polluted (dark) Woodland'''

Dotted Whitish Form: (30/50) x 100 = 60%
Melanic Form: (20/50) x 100 = 40%

60% - 40% = 20%  The Dotted Whitish form is predated on 20% more than the melanic form in the polluted woodland.

'''Moths in Non-polluted (pale) Woodland'''

Dotted Whitish Form: (15/50) x 100 = 30%
Melanic Form: approx. (30/50) x 100 = 60%

60% - 30% = 30% The Melanic form is predated on 30% more than the dotted whitish form in the nonpolluted woodland.
----
Their studies showed that the dotted whittish form was preyed on 20% more than the melanic form in the polluted woodland. The melanic form is predated on 30% more than the dotted whitish form in the nonpolluted woodland. 

In addition to the difference in predation, their studies also showed that in both the polluted and nonpolluted environments the moths that were located on the limb joints instead of the trunks were less likely to be preyed on. 

Howlett and Majerus showed that the dotted whitish form was at a higher risk of predation when resting against the polluted (dark) trees. The melanic form had a greater chance of survival and reproduction because they were less likely to be detected against the soot-covered trees, the same findings of Kettlewell years before. Their experiment proved that the melanic form was an anti-predator adaptation, which is why the dotted whitish form had become so rare. The melanic form had become the dominant trait for survival and reproduction in the polluted woodland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Antipredator Adaptations used by the Monarch Butterfly==

The relationship between prey and predators continually changes.  Prey need to find ways to outsmart predators in order to survive and reproduce.most monarch butterflies do not live very long. that's why they are endangered. One way monarch butterflies increase their fitness is by forming huge groups of up to ten million.  As their group size increases, the probability that any one monarch butterfly will be captured decreases.  Moreover, the butterflies located in the center of a large group are more likely to survive than those on the outside (Pike, 1999).  This is known as the “dilution effect (Alcock, 2001).”

Monarch butterflies that choose to migrate to closed-area overwintering sites are less likely to be attacked by a predator.  Also, by reacting as a group to the movement of a predator, monarch butterflies are better able to scare away predators (Pike, 1999).  This “mass startle effect” is thought to stun the predators and provide time for the butterfly to escape (true shock and awe indeed).

The aforementioned are collective ways in which the butterfly behaves in order to elude a predator.  There are, however, certain individual inherent features that the monarch butterflies possess that increase their probability of avoiding a predator.

Monarch butterflies contain chemicals that are toxic to many predators.  Evidently, this makes other similar but harmless species envious.  In Batesian mimicry, a palatable species attempts to mimic an unpalatable species in an attempt to increase its own fitness.  The monarch butterfly species is one that some Batesian mimics model themselves after perhaps because the monarch butterflies are so successful at avoiding predators (Mappes, 1997).  The Batesian mimics, although they are not harmful to predators, experience increased fitness because they model a potentially harmful species such as the monarch butterfly.  The viceroy butterfly (''Limenitis archippus'') is one such butterfly that models itself after the monarch (Pike, 1999).

Although monarch butterflies do not gain an increase in fitness as models of Batesian mimics, they do benefit from Müllerian mimicry.  In Müllerian mimicry, two unrelated, toxic species converge on a similar morphology.  If more than one unpalatable species has a similar morphological trait, then the predators may more easily recognize a Müllerian mimic as potentially harmful.  This saves both the mimics and the predators time and energy.

Lastly, monarch butterflies display aposematism or warning coloration.  This warning coloration is meant to be very conspicuous (Alcock, 2001).  Monarch butterflies make themselves conspicuous by having bright orange areas on its wings.  Predators quickly learn that prey containing these bright colors are potentially harmful.  For example, when a blue jay consumes a monarch butterfly, it vomits shortly after.  From that point on, the blue jay associates features of the monarch butterfly, such as its bright colors, as unpalatable (Alcock, 2001).  Because of their morphological features, Batesian mimics, Müllerian mimics, and many other aposematic species all gain from the monarch’s unpalatability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Say you have a surface charge plastered over a sphere's surface (which no charge within sphere).  Does Gauss' law suggest that E inside the sphere is 0 (since a Gaussian surface fully contained within the sphere will enclose no charge)?

===Answer===
Yes and no, Gauss's law does not say that there is no electric field flux through an empty area, it just says that the fluxes will all cancel out. 
But if you do have a spherical shell that is uniformly charged, there will indeed be no electric field inside it. --[[User:Frontier|Frontier]] 12:36, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Honeybee Foraging Behavioral Analysis ==

The common honeybee (''Apis mellifera'') forages around the hive in search of resources.
Usually this resource constitutes food in the form of pollinating flowers. Several landmark studies were performed in the middle of the 20th century to analyze how these social organisms communicated exact distances and direction to one another in order to effectively locate these resources. Karl von Frisch determined that honeybees perform two distinct dance routines that coincide with two different distance approximations made by the foraging bee. These two dances, the Round dance and the Waggle dance, communicate to the other the approximate distance from the hive to the new resource. Only the Waggle dance communicates direction (von Frisch 1967).

The Round dance is performed by the returning bee usually in complete darkness, vertically on a honeycomb. The circuitous motion attracts other foragers, which then learn that the resource is within approximately 50 meters of the hive. No direction is given by this routine (von Frisch). As a result, the newest foragers leave to search in all directions surrounding the hive. Behaviorally, this dance is energetically favorable due to the short distances travelled. In contrast, the Waggle dance is energetically unfavorable to the individual, but beneficial to the hive.

The Waggle dance is performed primarily when the resource is further than 50 meters. The
returning forager either performs the dance on a vertical surface or a horizontal one. To determine distance and direction, the bee orientates itself relative to the sun. Any deviation from this point gives the angle the new foragers should pursue. If vertical, the bee orientates itself to gravity. Perpendicular to the ground becomes the reference point (i.e. the sun). Deviations from such relay direction accordingly. Distance is communicated by the length of the abdomen shake that forms the middle of a figure eight dance (von Frisch).

Kirchner et al. determined that the Round dance does not convey direction. By tipping several
hives onto their horizontal axis and placed a resource 10 meters away, the reference heading was experimentally altered. Regardless of the hive orientation, the number of successful returning foragers was constant (1998). Once the distance crossed 50 meters, the success rate decreased for hives orientated horizontally, indicating direction is dependent on hive orientation for the waggle dance to be effective.

Honeybees foraging behavior can be interpreted from a historical or adaptationist view.
Lindauer performed historical analysis that reveals that distantly related bees might have evolved through 3 stages of development: First stage analysis reveals that the genus ''Trigona'' conveyed direction by buzzing to gain their hivemates attention. The odors trapped on the bee trigger others to forage in search of the odor. The secondary stage involves marking the path from the resource to the hive with mandibular pheromones. She then buzzes, and the bees follow the scent markers. The third stage involves an in-flight &quot;waggle dance&quot; in the direction of the resource (Lindauer 1961).

Seely et al. provides an adaptationist theory on bee dance evolution. The foragers seek new
resources to provide increased hive fitness. By dancing, the cost/benfit ratio is reduced to the individual level more so than a group of foragers expending energy searching in all directions all the time (Seely et al. 1998). Their study demonstrates that dancing has become an evolutionarily desirable trait because less time foraging allows for more time collecting the resource. Honeybee dancing provides an evolutionarily advantageous behavior which optimizes the hive's fitness.

===What Total Depravity Is Not===
*It does not mean that someone who is considered unregenerate has absolutely no concept of morality or conscience.
*It does not mean that someone is totally sinful - that is, as wicked as is possible.
*It does not mean engagement in every possible mode of sin.

===What Total Depravity Is===
*It does mean that sin affects each and every aspect of a person: the mind, body, will, and spirit.
*It does mean that acts thought to be altruistic will always contain at least a shade of improper motive - nothing one does is born totally and completely out of a perfect, flawless desire to serve God.
*It does mean that we as human beings are wholly incapable of eradicating our problem of sin by means of our own volition.

==''Ezâfe''==

{{Persian/translation |en=the door of the house|fa=در (دروازه) خانه |'''dar'''|door|
|در (دروازه)|e|of|
|خانه|xu'''ne'''|house|}}
An important part of Persian grammar is the handy little linking element called {{term-fa|اضافه|ezâfe|addition}}. It is used to extend a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase by adding an unstressed particle similar English “of”, followed by other words like adjectives, nouns, pronouns, and full phrases.

After a consonant, the ''ezâfe'' particle is pronounced as an unstressed ‹e› in standard Persian and is not usually written.  On the right, {{term-fa|در|dar|door}} is extended by the ''ezâfe'' particle and the noun {{term-fa|خانه|xune|house}}, making the Persian phrase {{Persian/text|در خانه|'''dar'''-e xu'''ne'''|the door of the house}}.  {{Persian/text|در|dar}} ends in a consonant, so the ''ezâfe'' particle is pronounced ‹e› and is not written.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=my house|fa=خانه (خانهٔ) من
|خانه|xu'''ne'''|house|
||ye|of|
|من|'''man'''|me|}}
After a vowel, the ''ezâfe'' particle is pronounced as unstressed ‹ye› and may be written as &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; or, after a silent &lt;big&gt;ه&lt;/big&gt;, it may be written as a miniature superscript &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; that looks like a ''hamze'' diacritic, i.e. as &lt;big&gt;هٔ&lt;/big&gt;.  Usually, though, it is only written after a vowel when extra clarity is wanted; otherwise it is often left unwritten.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=the woman’s scarf|fa=روسری زن
|روسری|rusa'''ri'''|scarf|
|ی|ye|of|
|زن|'''zan'''|woman|}}
When ''ezâfe'' extends one noun by adding another, it often indicates that the first noun’s referent belongs to the second one’s, as shown on the right in the Persian phrase {{Persian/text|روسری (چادر) زن|rusari-ye zan|the woman’s scarf}}.  In older texts, ''ezâfe'' after &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; is often represented by a small superscripted &lt;big&gt;ی&lt;/big&gt; that resembles ''hamze'' (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ء&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;), so you may see words like &lt;big&gt;{{Persian/text|روسرئ (چادر) زن}}&lt;/big&gt;, but today, &lt;big&gt;{{Persian/text|یی}}&lt;/big&gt; (and thus &lt;big&gt;{{Persian/text|روسری (چادر) زن}}&lt;/big&gt;) is more common.

Colloquially, short forms are used even after vowels.
{{Persian/stub|Is this correct in all dialects?}}

Adding a noun with ''ezâfe'' is not only used for ownership.  It may indicate a family relationship:
* {{Persian/text|ناصر خسرو|nâ'''ser'''-e xos'''row'''|Nasir, [son] of Khusraw}}
* {{Persian/text|پدر و مادر من و شما|pe'''dar''' o mâ'''dar''' e '''man''' o šo'''mâ'''|mother and father of me and you}}

It may indicate composition or purpose:
* {{Persian/text|کاسه مسی|kâ'''se'''-ye '''messey'''|the bowl [made] of copper, the copper bowl}}
* {{Persian/text|آب زندگی|'''âb'''-e zende'''gi'''|the water of life}}

It may also used for [[w:Apposition|apposition]]:
* {{Persian/text|آقای پیمان|â'''qâ'''-ye pey'''mân'''|the gentleman Peyman, Mr. Peyman}}
* {{Persian/text|روز جمعه|'''ruz'''-e jom'''’e'''|the day Friday}}
* {{Persian/text|شهر تهران|'''šahr'''-e teh'''rân'''|the city of Tehran}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=the big door |fa=در (دروازه) بزرک
| در|'''dar'''|door|
||e|[that is]|
|بزرک|bo'''zorg'''|big|}}
''Ezâfe'' is also used to add an adjective, as in the phrase {{Persian/text|در (دروازه) بزرک|'''dar''' e bo'''zorg'''|the big door}}, shown on the right.  The particle in such constructions is not usually translated into English as a separate word, but it may be thought of as “that is”.
* {{Persian/text|آب گرم|'''âb'''-e '''garm'''|water [that is] warm, warm water}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation | en=on (the face of) the wall|fa=بر روی دیوار
|بر|bar|on|
|روی|'''ruy'''|face|
||e|of|
|دیوار|di'''vâr'''|wall|}}
''Ezâfe'' is also used with certain nouns that have preposition-like meaning.  In the example on the right and the one below, the nouns {{term-fa|روی|ruy|face}} and {{term-fa|زیر|zir|underside}} are used like prepositions with the help of ''ezâfe'':
* {{Persian/text|از زیر میز|az '''zir'''-e '''miz'''|from the underside of the table}}

''Ezâfe'' is also used to add prepositional phrases, e.g. {{term-fa|بعد از|ba’d az ...|after ...}}:
* {{Persian/text|روز بعد از آن اتفاق|'''ruz'''-e '''ba’d''' az un ette'''fâq'''|the day after that accident}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation |en=the big door of my house|width=50%|fa=در بزرک خانه من
|در|'''dar'''|door|
||e|[that is]|
|بزرک|bo'''zorg'''|big|
||e|of|
|خانه|xu'''ne'''|house|
||ye|of|
|من|'''man'''|me|}}
A noun phrase created with ''ezâfe'' may be extended with ''ezâfe'' again, as shown on the right.
&lt;!--

The following examples are from Encyclopedia Iranica (http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v9f2/v9f209.html).  They are too advanced for introduction at this level since we haven't yet covered infinitives or participles:

* Reduced relative clause: ‹dânešjuyân-e az orupâ bargašta› (“students back from Europe”)
* Nominalized verb phrase with infinitives and participles: {{Persian/text|کشتن شیر|koš'''tan'''-e '''šir'''|the killing of the lion}}, {{Persian/text|کشنه شدن شیر|'''koš'''te šo'''dan'''-e '''šir'''|the lion’s being killed)
* Figurative association: ‹nâma-râ ba-dast-e adab gereft› (“he took the letter with the hand of deference”, i.e., deferentially)
* Modification by infinitive: ‹âb-e xordan› (“drinking water”)

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

== Demonstrative Adjectives ==
{{Persian/translation | fa=این کتاب|en=this book
|این|in|this|
|کتاب|ketâb|book|}}
{{Persian/translation | fa=آن پسر|en=that boy
|آن|un|that|
|پسر|pesar|boy|}}
As the dialogues in the previous lessons have shown, Persian does not have a word that corresponds to the English definite article “the”.  To say, “the book”, for example, the noun {{term-fa|کتاب|ketâb|book}} is normally used alone. Persian does, however, have the demonstrative adjectives {{term-fa|این|in|this}} and {{term-fa|آن|un|that}}.  These two words, unlike typical adjectives, are used before the noun with no intervening particle, as shown in the examples on the right.

Demonstrative contractions:
* {{term-fa|اینجا|injâ|here}}
* {{term-fa|آنجا|ânjâ|there}}, colloquially pronounced ‹unjâ›
* {{term-fa|چنین|conin|like this}}, colloquially pronounced ‹cenin›
* {{term-fa|چنین|conân|like that}}, colloquially pronounced ‹cenun›
* {{term-fa|همین|hamin|this [very] same}}
* {{term-fa|همان|hamân|that [very] same}}, colloquially ‹hamun›
* {{term-fa|کجا|kojâ|where}}

Demonstrative pronouns:
* {{term-fa|آنها|unhâ|those there}} or just &quot;those&quot;, special case where ها is always joined
* {{term-fa|اینها|inhâ|these here}}, second special case where ها ‹hâ› is always joined

== Plural nouns ==
{{Persian/connecting letters box|Arab=کتاب&amp;zwnj;ها|Latn=ketâbhâ
| کتاب&amp;zwnj;|ketâb|&amp;zwnj;ها|hâ}}
The usual way to make a plural in Persian is to add the suffix {{Persian/text|ها|ha}} to the noun.  The suffix is written immediately after the noun with no intervening space, but it is not normally joined to the last letter in the noun.

Colloquially, {{Persian/text|ها}} is pronounced ‹â›.

Many words have an alternative plural form that may be used instead of the normal Persian form.  In most cases, the alternative plural form comes from Arabic.  For example, animate nouns (those that denote humans or things with human-like characteristics) and nouns that denote paired body parts (e.g. eyes, ears, and hands) have an alternative plural form made with the suffix {{Persian/text|ان|ân}}:
* {{term-fa|پسر|pesar|boy}}  + {{Persian/text|ان|-an|-s}}
* {{term-fa|چشم|cešm|eye}} + {{Persian/text|ان|-an|-s}}

Many Arabic words have different plural forms that may be used in Persian.  Some are created by adding suffixes:
* {{term-fa|باغ|bâq|garden}} + {{Persian/text|ت|-at}} = {{Persian/text|باغت|bâqat|gardens}}
* {{term-fa|معلّم|mo’allem|teacher}} + {{Persian/text|ین|-in}} = {{Persian/text|معلّمین|mo’allemin|teachers}}

Others are called “broken plurals”:
* {{Persian/text|كِتاب|ketâb|book}}, {{Persian/text|كُتُب|kotob|books}},[http://www.zarsara.com/default.aspx  کتاب]
* {{Persian/text|وِقْت|vaqt|time}}, {{Persian/text|اوقات|owqat|times}}

* {{Persian/text|شاعر||poet}}, {{Persian/text|شُعَرا||poets}}
* {{Persian/text|عَرَب||Arab}}, {{Persian/text|اَعْراب||Arabs}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation | fa=این کتاب‌ها|en=these books
|این|in|this, these|
|کتاب|ketâb|book|
|ها|-hâ|-s|}}
To make a noun phrase plural, only the main noun is changed.  Adjectives and demonstrative adjectives are not, as shown on the right.

====Numbers====
{{Persian/translation|en=twenty-one (21)|fa=بیست و یک
|بیست|bist|twenty|
|و|o|and|
|یک|yek|one|}}
After 20, Persian numbers use {{term-fa|و|o|and}} between digit, as shown in the example on the right.

In [[Persian/Lesson 5|Lesson 5]], you learned how to conjugate the verb {{Persian/text|بودن|budan|to be}} in the simple present tense.

In this lesson, you will how to conjugate Persian verbs in the simple past tense.

== Simple past tense ==

In both English and Persian, verbs can be conjugated in the simple past tense to express that an event happened in the past or to comment about a past state of something.  For example, the English verb ''talk'' is conjugated into the simple past tense form ''talked'' by adding the suffix ''-ed''.

In colloquial speech, for example, the ending {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;ید|-id}} is often pronounced as ‹-in›.  Other differences between spoken and written Persian will be given in the lessons that follow.&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained in [[Persian/Lesson 5|Lesson 5]], Persian verbs suffixes clearly indicate grammatical person and number.  For example, the table on the right shows the simple past tense of {{term-fa|بودن|budan|to be}}, consisting of the stem {{Persian/text|بود|bud-}} and suffixes to indicate the person and number:

The past stem is identical with the third person singular. Thus the past stem of the verb budan 'to be' is bud, the past stem of the verb guftan 'to say' is guft.

Unlike the simple present tense of {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}}, which has both a full and short forms, the simple past tense only has the forms above.

{{Persian/exercises-top|Conjugation
|show-answers=no}}
| Say each of the personal pronouns from the table above.  While saying each one, imagine and point to the people to whom the pronoun might refer.  For example, while saying {{term-fa|ما|mâ|we, us}}, imagine another person next to you and point to that person and yourself.
|-
| Repeat the personal pronouns as above, but after each one, say the corresponding simple past tense forms of {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}} from the table above.  For example, when saying {{term-fa|شما|šomâ|you (plural)}}, point to two imaginary addressees and then say {{Persian/text|بودید|budin}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|}

To make the simple past tense form of any Persian verb, begin with the infinitive (the dictionary form), e.g. {{Persian/text|بودن|budan}}.  The infinitive of every Persian verb ends in the suffix {{Persian/text|ن|-an}}.   Remove the final {{Persian/text|ن|-an}} to get the past tense stem, e.g. {{Persian/text|بود|bud-}}.  Then add the appropriate past tense personal suffix from the table below to make the past tense verb form:

| past tense stem + Ø || past tense stem + ‹an›&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|-
| “he/she/it [did...]” || “they [did...]”
|}
The same suffixes are used for '''all''' simple past tense verbs, so it is important to memorize them.

{{Persian_Under_Construction}}

==Plurality and formality/deference==

plurality of verb with animate vs. inanimate subject

Plurality of subject reference, optional subject pronoun, and verb as it relates to formality and deference:
* Semantically plural human subject requires plural verb.
* 2nd person semantically singular addressee:
** Friendly, informal reference: (optional pronoun) تو /tow/, singular verb (ی ending)
** Semi-formal, respectful: (optional plural pronoun) شما /šomâ/, singular verb (ی ending)
** Formal, more respectful: plural verb, optional plural pronoun (شما), plural verb written with ید ending, pronounced colloquially as ین.
** Very formal conditions treating the addressee with deference: جناب عالی /jenâb âli/ (&quot;your excellency&quot;)

=== Third person ===
In the third person, the same pattern applies as with the second person.  The singular pronoun {{term-fa|او|u|he, he}} is the normal way to refer to an individual in the third person, but to show greater respect, the plural pronoun {{term-fa|ایشان|išân|they}} and/or a verb conjugated in the third person plural (i.e. with the personal suffix {{Persian/text|ند|-and}}, colloquially pronounced ‹-an›) may be used instead.

==Direct objects==
The word {{term-fa|را|râ}} marks definite direct objects in Persian.  That is, 

Colloquially, {{Persian/text|را}} is pronounced ‹ro› after a vowel or ‹o› after a consonant.

In written Persian, {{Persian/text|من را|man râ}} may contract to {{Persian/text|مارا|mârâ}}, but colloquially pronounced ‹mano›.  Similarly, written {{Persian/text|تو را|to râ}} can contract to {{Persian/text|تورا|torâ}} but colloquially pronounced ‹toro›.

==Direct objects==
Definite or human object enclitic {{term-fa|را|râ}}, colloquially pronounced or /o/ after consonant, /ro/ after vowel.

Persian doesn't have a direct article like “the”. In some situations {{Persian/text|را}} carries similar meaning, but is less used than &quot;the&quot;.

==Prepositions==
prepositions:
* {{term-fa|از|az|from, than, by}}
* {{term-fa|با|bâ|with}}
* {{term-fa|برای|barâye|for, in order to}}
* {{term-fa|بی|bi|without}}
* {{term-fa|بدون|bedun-e|without}}
* {{term-fa|به|be|to, in, at, on}}
* {{term-fa|دنبال|dombâl-e|behind}}
* {{term-fa|پشت|post-e|behind}}
* {{term-fa|نزدیک|nazdik-e|near}}
*‌ {{term-fa|پیش|pish-e|before, in front of}}
* {{term-fa|جلو|jelo-ye|before, in front of}}
* {{term-fa|روی|ruy-e|on, on the face of}}
* {{term-fa|تو|tu-ye|inside, into}}
* {{term-fa|در|dar|in}}
* {{term-fa|زیر|zir-e|under}}

Some Persian verbs often are accompanied by prepositional phrases that translate into English as transitive verbs with direct objects, especially common with {{Persian/text|از|az|from, than, by}} and {{Persian/text|بی|bi|without}}.

==Sentence structure==
(subject) (definite object را) (prep phrases) (adverbs) (predicate nominative/adjective) verb

== Simple present tense ==
{{Persian/translation|fa=هر روز کر می‌کنو.|en=I work everyday.
|هر|har|every|
|روز|ruz|day|
|کار|kar|work|
|می‌کنو|mikonam|I do|}}
The simple present tense is used to describe an event or to comment about the state of something without regard to a particular time, as shown in the example on the right.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

{| class=wikitable align=right style=&quot;margin-left:1em&quot;

|-

|-
| “(I) get” || “(we) get”
|-
! rowspan=3 | Second person

|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |(شما) می‌گیرید
|-
| (‹to›) ‹'''mi'''giri› || (‹šomâ›) ‹'''mi'''girin›&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;&gt;Note: The Persian script here uses formal spelling, but the transcriptions in angle brackets shows typical colloquial pronunciation.  In colloquial speech, for example, the ending {{Persian/text|&amp;zwj;ید|-id}} is often pronounced as ‹-in›.  Other differences between spoken and written Persian will be given in the lessons that follow.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| “(you) get” || “(you) get”
|-
! rowspan=3 | Third person
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |(او) می‌گیرد
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |(آنها) می‌گیرند
|-
| (‹u›) ‹'''mi'''girad› || (‹ânhâ›) ‹'''mi'''giran›&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|-
| “(he/she/it) gets” || “(they) get”
|}
The table on the right shows the simple present tense forms of {{term-fa|گرفتن|gereftan|to get}}, consisting of the present/imperfect&lt;ref&gt;Persian used to have a truly simple present tense with no prefix, distinct from the present imperfect tense with the prefix {{Persian/text|می|mi}}.  In modern Persian, though, the present imperfect tense has replaced the simple present tense for all verbs but {{term-fa|داشتن|dâštan|to have}} and {{term-fa|بودن|budan|to be}}.&lt;/ref&gt; prefix {{Persian/text|می|mi}}, the present stem {{Persian/text|گیر|gir}} and suffixes to indicate the person and number.

To make a simple present tense form of a Persian verb, begin with the prefix {{Persian/text|می|mi}}.  Then add the present tense stem (which can be looked up in most dictionaries), e.g. {{Persian/text|گیر|gir}}.  Finally, add the appropriate present tense personal suffix from the table below to make the simple present tense verb form:
{| class=wikitable
|-valign=top
! rowspan=2 | Simple present tense&lt;br/&gt;
Present stem +&lt;br/&gt;
personal suffix
! colspan=2 | Number
|-valign=top
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! rowspan=3 | First person
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;م
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;یم
|-
| present stem + ‹am› || present stem + ‹im›
|-
| “I [do...]” || “we [do...]”
|-
! rowspan=3 | Second person
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ی
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ید
|-
| present stem + ‹i› || present stem + ‹in›&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|-
| “you [do...]” || “you [do...]”
|-
! rowspan=3 | Third person
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;د
|dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:150%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot; |...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ند
|-
| present stem + ‹ad› || present stem + ‹an›&lt;ref name=&quot;formal_spelling_colloquial_transcription&quot;/&gt;
|-
| “he/she/it [does...]” || “they [do...]”
|}
As you can see, the present tense personal suffixes are the same as the past tense ones, except for the third person singular, which is {{Persian/text|د|ad}} in the present tense and nothing in the past.

Every Persian verb has two stems: the imperative/present stem and the past stem. In general, both stems of each verb must be learned because neither is not completely predictable from the other.  There are some common patterns, though.  For example, verbs whose infinitives end with {{Persian/text|تن|tan}}, {{Persian/text|دن|dan}}, or {{Persian/text|یدن|idan}} often form the present stem by dropping those endings:
{|
! Verb !! &amp;nbsp; !! Present stem
|-
| {{term-fa|کشتن|koštan|to kill}} || || {{Persian/text|کش|koš}}
|-
| {{term-fa|آوردن|âvardan|to bring}} || || {{Persian/text|آور|âvar}}
|-
| {{term-fa|رسیدن|residan|to arrive}} || || {{Persian/text|رس|res}}
|}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/translation|fa=فردا کر می‌کنم.|en=I work tomorrow.
|فردا|fardâ|tomorrow|
|کار|kar|work|
|می‌کنم|mikonam|I do}}
The simple present tense is also used to talk about a future event, as shown on the right.

The simple present tense can also be used to express that an event is occurring at the very moment that the speaker is speaking, but the present continuous tense is used more often for that purpose in both English and Persian.  The present continuous tense will be discussed in a later chapter.

== Personal clitics with noun phrases ==
Grammar: (bound) personal enclitics after (singular or plural) noun phrase:
* After consonant: /am/, /at/, /aš/, /emân/, /etân/, /ešân/
* After و or ا, /yam/, /yat/...
* After ه or ی, singular suffixes are spelled with leading zwnj+ا.

Often expresses possession /pedaram/ (&quot;my father&quot;), /dust-e xubam/ (&quot;my good friend&quot;)

alternative pronomial direct objects as enclitics

== Colloquial ==
Differences between spoken and written forms
* written را colloquially ‹o› or ‹ro›.  With possessive endings:
** {{Persian/text|کتابم را به او دادم|ketâbamow be u dâdam|I gave my book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابت را به او دادم|ketâbatow be u dâdam|I gave your book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابش را به او دادم|ketâbašow be u dâdam|I gave her book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابمان را به او دادم|ketâbemunow be u dâdam|I gave our book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابتان را به او دادم|ketâbetunow be u dâdam|I gave your book to him.}}
** {{Persian/text|کتابشان را به او دادم|ketâbašunow be u dâdam|I gave their book to him.}}
* colloquial ‹e›, ‹s› for است
* colloquial verb endings: ه ‹eh›
* written ان ‹ân› vs spoken ‹un›, but not in خانم ‹xânom›

Colloquially, when ‹â› comes before ‹a›, the latter elides:
* {{Persian/text|دست‌هایم|dasthâyam|my hands}} pronounced ‹dastâm›
* {{Persian/text|پایم|pâyam|my foot}} pronounced ‹pâm›

=Lesson 5: Measure words=

===Measure Words/量词(liàngcí)===
{| cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; rules=&quot;all&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px solid #000000;&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;white-space: wrap; background-color:#FFFFCC;&quot;| In Chinese, most specified or numbered nouns must be preceded by [[w:measure word|measure word]]s, also known as classifiers, according to the type of object. Consider the English phrase, &quot;two pairs of pants.&quot; Like the word &quot;pair,&quot; Chinese measure words are placed between the noun and the preceding number.

1.  这本书里没有一个汉字。
:Zhè bĕn shū lǐ méi yŏu yí gè Hànzì.
:''This book doesn’t contain one Chinese character.''

2.  那间宿舍有六十个学生。
:Nà jiān sùshè yŏu liùshí ge xuésheng.
:''That dorm has sixty students.''

The phrase 一朵花 (yī duǒ huā) means &quot;one flower,&quot; but how would you say &quot;a pile of flowers?&quot; It's simple: just change the classifier. The phrase 一堆花 (yī duī huā) means &quot;a pile of flowers.&quot; You could also say 一把花 (yī bǎ huā; a handful of flowers), 一桶花 (yī tǒng huā; a bucket of flowers), or 一种花 (yī zhǒng huā; a kind of flower). You can see that measure words act as adjectives.

In Chinese, like in English, you can omit the noun if it's already known, leaving only the classifier. 你看到那种（花）吗？ (Nǐ kàn dào nà zhǒng (huā) ma?) means &quot;Did you see that kind (of flower)?&quot; You can see that measure words also act as nouns.

Measure words are also used with [[w:demonstrative|demonstrative pronouns]] (this, that). For example, 这朵花 means &quot;this flower,&quot; and 那朵花 means &quot;that flower.&quot;

You might also encounter something like this: 书架上有书本。 (Shūjià shàng yǒu shūběn.) which means &quot;The bookshelf has books on it.&quot; Note that the classifier is after the noun. This signifies multiple books where the exact number is not important, here translated &quot;books.&quot; The sentence 书架上有书。, means the same as above, but is without the classifier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computer security has three main elements that can easily be remembered using the acronym CIA: '''C'''onfidentiality, '''I'''ntegrity, '''A'''vailability.

* '''Confidentiality''' is the task of ensuring that only those entities (persons or systems) cleared for access can read information.  Cryptography is a key element in ensuring confidentiality.

* '''Integrity''' is the task of ensuring that information is correct, and stays that way.

* '''Availability''' is the task of ensuring that systems responsible for delivering, storing and processing information are accessible when needed, by those who need them. This includes, for example, protection against denial of service (DoS) attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sexual selection, a subcategory of natural selection, was first recognized by Charles Darwin and &quot;occurs when individuals differ in their ability to compete with others for mates or to attract members of the opposite sex&quot; (Alcock 493). By heavy courtship, fighting, or large territorial possession, males heavily compete for females. Eventhough a male may win a fierce competition for the mate of his choice, it is ultimately the female who decides on a partner that she wants. The female is often successful in her attempts to control reproduction by being choosy and having particular preferences for a male mate.

Females choose mates based on many factors. One important factor is male adornments, or ornaments. For example, Marion Petrie and Tim Halliday concluded that the removal of eyespots from a peacock's tail significantly reduces his attractiveness to females. &quot;After 20 eyespots had been cut from their tails, males averaged two fewer mates in the following breeding season compared with their performance in the previous year&quot; (Alcock 348). Thus, females are extremely conscious of the visual stimuli provided by males. Elaborate sensory cues alert the female that the male is reproductively superior to others. &quot;Male adornments may more readily elicit the mating responses of some females who will thus mate preferentially in favour of the adorned males&quot; (Bateson 53). Other factors involved in female preference in mate selection include body coloration or the &quot;gift&quot; that the male may present to the female before copulation. 

Four theories are used to explain mate choice in females. The good parent theory suggests that &quot;choosy individuals select partners on the basis of how well they will care for their offspring&quot; (Alcock 491). 
This theory focuses on the female's search of a paternal male. The healthy mate theory occurs when females prefer &quot;males healthy enough to produce and maintain elaborate ornaments&quot; (Alcock 491). A good example of this is in female house finches, who choose male mates based on their bright coloration. Bright coloration tells the female that the male is more resistant to pathogens and parasites. The good genes theory &quot;argues that females exhibit mate choice in order to provide their offspring with a partner's genes that will advance their offspring's chances of survival or reproductive success&quot; (Alcock 491). A mother always wants the best for her child, even if it is a future child. Females select mates with certain traits, because they want their children to be healthy, viable, and reproductively successful. &quot;Females that mate with attractive males are compensated for reduced fecundity by bearing &quot;sexy sons&quot; with higher than average mating success&quot; (Andersson 45). The least obvious theory is the runaway selection theory. It states that by being choosy, females &quot;create a positive feedback loop favoring both males with these attributes and females that prefer them&quot; (Alcock 493). 

A direct benefit of mate choice by females is the assurance of bearing offspring that will survive well and display high general fitness. This is a heritable benefit. Nongenetic benefits of mate choice include fecundity advantages, food, parental care, or a good territory. All of the benefits, both heritable and nonheritable, ultimately lead to the greater survival of a female's offspring.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Territoriality is a type of intraspecific or interspecific competition that results from the behavioral exclusion of others from a specific space that is defended as territory. This well-defined behavior is exhibited through songs and calls, intimidation behavior, attack and chase, and marking with scents. This form of defense proves to be very costly for animals. So one is forced to ask, Why do animals take part in such interspecific competition?

In order to understand this question one must take a cost-benefit approach to territoriality. The proximate reasons for such defense vary. For some animals the reason for participating in such elaborate protective behavior is to acquire and protect food sources, nesting sites, mating areas, or to simply attract a mate. The ultimate cause of this behavior may be attributed to the increased probability of survival and reproductive successes. In defending a territory an animal is ultimately securing that it will have an habitat in which to forage for food and to successfully reproduce, thus increasing the animal's overall fitness. This ultimate theory is strengthened when one considers the instances in which territoriality increases; in times of depleted resources the presence of territoriality increases. The presence of territoriality often forces less fit animals to live in sub optimal habitats, thus reducing their reproductive success.

Though territoriality offers immense reproductive and nutritional benefits, it also comes at a cost. Defending territory is not easy. Territoriality cost time and energy and can often interfere with other fundamental activities as parenting, feeding, courting, and mating. For these reasons territoriality may not be seen as a benefit in all animals. Animals must be able to reap the fruits of territoriality, while expending the least amount of energy. For these reasons if resources are abundant and predictable it would be disadvantageous to defend the territory. On the other hand, if resources are scarce and undependable it would be advantageous to exhibit territoriality. 

An animal chooses its territory by deciding what part of its home range it would like to defend. In selecting a territory the size and the quality play a crucial role in determining an animals habitat. Territory size generally tends to be no larger than the organism than requires to survive, because with an increase in territory comes an increased in energy expenditure. For some animals the territory size is not the most important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of defended territory. The quality is considered to be fundamentally important due to amount of food availability and superior nesting sights. Animals depend on these features to ensure their superior fitness. 

Animals invest a lot of time and energy in defending their territories, and for this reason they fight vigorously to defend their territory at all cost. Researchers suggest for this reason that when a rival challenges a territory holder, the owner almost always wins the contest. This phenomenon could be attributed to an evolutionary stable strategy which assets that rules for behavior is controlled by an inherited proximate mechanism such that the differences between individuals in their strategies are liked to differences in their genes. 
Territory plays an important role as a mechanism of population regulation, insuring the success of fit animals, and aiding in the eradication of less fit animals. Territorially also plays a fundamental role as an indicator of carrying capacity; it also serves as an indicator of how much habitat is necessary to support viable populations. For these reasons researchers continue to examine the well-developed behavior of territoriality.

Was it for the purpose of having a collection of challenge problems for physics students, or was it for having a sort of &quot;Dr.Physics&quot; Q&amp;A thing? (i.e. Do you want the answers somewhere in the book? Or no? Or maybe in the talk page?) [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 19:13, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Re: Question about Physics questions ==

This is an attempt to create a list of fun problems for everybody who likes 
to solve them himself or ask poor students to do this.
Every contribution is welcome. Some of content can be later moved to 
a Remedial Physics Course for MBA. Answers are fine with me but let's
try to obfuscate them a little. How about two passes of rot13 encryption ?
:Er... two passes? I think I know what ROT13 encryption is, but I'm not familiar with....wait, won't that give back the original text? ROT26? :) [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 10:44, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reproduction is the sole method through which a species may continue, and reproduction manifests itself in numerous deviations throughout nature.  The ultimate goal of each species is to produce the maximum amount of offspring while exerting the least amount of energy.  Predation pressures, resource accessibility, and competition with the species for attracting mates greatly influence the likelihood of an individual within a species producing viable offspring and donating genes to subsequent generations.  Different fish species may be observed in order to learn the unique reproductive strategies employed throughout nature from fertilization tactics to parental care methods that have adapted these fish in continuing their species.

Females typically exert much more energy and time into reproduction than males, and therefore, females are usually more selective in choosing mates.  Females typically favor males that are larger in size, possess more elaborate physical traits than the other males, and display more energy in courtship activity &lt;ref&gt;[http://cetus.ucsd.edu/people/Ana/femalechoice.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, smaller and less desirable males must still be able to fertilize the eggs, or, according to natural selection, they would have been eliminated from the population.  Although slightly more unsettling, sexual coercion results in the fertilizing of eggs just as sexual courtship does.  The term “sneakers” refers to smaller males who opt to race into the nest more desired males and fertilize the eggs while the nesting male pursues the female &lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ipfw.edu/gillespi/BIOL%20598/Articles/Goncalves,%20et%20al.%202003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The term “satellites” describes cryptic males mimicking females in appearance and behavior so that they are able to fertilize the eggs while the unsuspecting couple spawn.

Although fish species exhibit both internal and external fertilization, fish also exemplify many unique strategies for parental care.  Most fish species utilize broadcast spawning, which is a method a releasing gametes into the water and providing no parental care.  The goal of this reproductive method is to produce the maximum amount of progeny in hopes that as many offspring as possible will survive.  Many fish species, however, opt to employ parental care in order to supply their smaller number of offspring a greater chance of survival.  Oral brooding and sex role reversal are two unique methods of parental care that have proved successful in certain fish species.

Oral brooding, although quite rare in nature, is a parenting method adopted by many fish in the Family Cichlidae &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cichlidae.com/articles/a133.php]&lt;/ref&gt;.  After the successful fertilization of the eggs, Cichlids, such as Tilapia, place the egg clutch into the mouth of the female.  The fecundity is significantly lower in oral brooders; however, the eggs tend to be larger and receive more nutrients.  By placing the eggs into the oral cavity, the female is able to provide protection for the eggs, and the churning ability of the female rotates the eggs so that each egg is exposed to oxygenated water.   

Similar to oral brooding, sex role reversal in fish is rare but is utilized in the Family Sygnathildae &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/seahorse/2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.  In sea horses, the female inseminates the male by inserting the oviduct into the male brooding pouch several times to ensure fertilization.  After fertilization is complete, the female departs, and the male attaches itself to a nearby object with its tail waiting for the eggs to mature.

Nature exhibits many alternatives that species have adapted in order to reproduce.  By utilizing these methods, these organisms are able to reproduce viable offspring and continue their kind.  Survival of the species is the ultimate goal for all organisms, and these organisms are constantly adapting to their environment in order to do so.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mimicry ==
A major concern of animals and other critters is to protect themselves from predators in order to survive and reproduce and pass their genes off to a new generation.  Many animals have evolved adaptations known as anti-predator devices such as camouflage and chemical toxins.  Animals use camouflage to blend in with their environments in an attempt to be unrecognizable by predators.  Other organisms such as the monarch butterfly contain chemical toxins that are secreted into the predator’s mouth when it attempts to eat the butterfly.  The monarch butterfly also has warning coloration that gives a warning sign to predators to remind them that the butterfly is toxic and should not be eaten.  

These anti-predator devices are so successful that other organisms have been known to mimic them.  The organism that is mimicked is known as the model and the third party that is deceived by the model and its mimic is known as the receiver.  The mimics have learned to take advantage of the color patterns and markings that predators have learned by experience to avoid.  The model is usually a species that has an abundant population and has successfully warded off predators with an anti-predator device.

Organisms have learned to mimic their surroundings or environment in an attempt to “hide” from predators.  For example, lizards have learned to mimic tree trunk color which proves to be very successful as predators will simply move past them as they believe that they are simply looking at a tree.  Another example of this type of mimicry can be seen with the Katydid who will mimic a leaf in both color and shape in an attempt to be hidden.  

Some prey animals have evolved certain patterns on their bodies that mimic other animals in an attempt to startle their predators.  The most common example of this type of mimicry can be found in some moths and butterflies who flash eye spots on their wings to predators.  These eye spots startle the predator who believes that the eyes belong to a much larger animal that may be a threat to them.

In one form of mimicry known as aggressive mimicry, an organism will mimic a signal that is either deceptive or attractive to its prey.  One example of this involves the praying mantis who will mimic flowers to attract insects that they can then capture and eat.  Organisms can also imitate the behaviors of other organisms.  Moth caterpillars, for example, will imitate the motion and body movements of a snake in order to scare off predators that are usually a prey item for snakes.

One of the most popular types of mimicry involves the warning coloration found on inedible or toxic organisms such as the monarch butterfly.  Once these toxic organisms have adapted this warning coloration which warns predators to stay away, other organisms may start to mimic this warning coloration in an attempt to stay alive.  Batesian mimics are those mimics that imitate unpalatable species even though they are palatable.  Therefore, one species is harmful while the other is harmless.  The wasp is a great example of Batesian mimicry.  The wasp is the model species in this example as it possesses a sting which enables it to escape from predators.  The bright warning coloration of the wasp has been mimicked by many other insects.  Even though the mimics are harmless, the predator will avoid them due to bad experiences with wasps with the same coloration.  With Müllerian mimicry, many unpalatable species share a similar color pattern.  Müllerian mimicry proves to be successful as the predator only has to be exposed to one of the species in order to learn to stay away from all the other species with the same warning color patterns.  The black and yellow striped bodies of social wasps, solitary digger wasps, and caterpillars of the cinnabar moths warn predators that the organism is inedible.  This is a great example of Müllerian mimicry as all of these unpalatable, unrelated species have a shared color pattern that keeps predators away.

Mimicry is a very successful anti-predator device that species have evolved over many generations. As one can see, organisms have come to mimic many different characteristics such as color patterns and behaviors.  However, selection only favors the mimics when they are less common than the model.  Therefore, the fitness of mimics is “negatively frequency-dependent.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the many ways in which organisms can communicate with each other is through the use of pheromones.  An organism generates and emits these hormonal chemicals in order to relay a message to another member of the same species.  Ants and bees demonstrate two prominent examples of pheromone usage, which acknowledges their incredible capability to organize the behaviors of the whole colony.

Ants produce numerous different pheromones, each with its own distinct purpose.  Ants secrete pheromones to attract mates, to signal danger to the colony, or to give directions about a location.  Other pheromones act as deterrents keeping out unwanted ants from foreign colonies or preying insectivores.  Still other pheromones communicate ants to congregate.  This explains how assiduous ants exercise remarkable cooperation in building a colony.  Pheromones maintain the cohesiveness and organization of the complex ant communities.
Certain types, such as alarm pheromones, produce a “releaser effect”, which induces a quick response and may be used to tell other ants to evacuate a dangerous area such as an approaching lawnmower.  For example, when a spider approaches an ant will release alarm pheromones that alert all the other ants.  Ants may also discharge alarm pheromones as a result from being diverted from their work, e.g. heavy human steps.  Releaser pheromones are also used to mark territory.  As the chemical deposited dries, it signals to other species members of the territory’s occupant.  

Other pheromones create a “primer effect” that entices other ants for actions.  Such pheromones are useful in mating rituals and only affect ants of the opposite sex.  Primer pheromones can send signals to the endocrine system, to make appropriate changes, for instance ovulation required for successful mating.  

Biologist E.O. Wilson discovered in the 1960’s that the organic chemical for each pheromone varies tremendously depending on what signal it entails.  Ants taste and smell a substance that evaporates off the chemical laid down by another ant.  Wilson observed in slow motion films that ants do this by moving their antennae from side to side.  For example, alarm pheromones are discharged into the air, and expand in a circle of smell.  Ants can determine the concentration of the pheromone, and thus determine the proximity of the source of danger.

Bees are also well known for communicating through the use of pheromones.  Like ants, bees have a variety of purposes associated with the pheromones, such as marking and behavior.  Honeybees release chemical signals for marking food sources, marking their hive, in scenting potential hive sites, and in assembling swarms for flight.  Although each hive has a particular scent, different colonies can be easily integrated during times when honey flow is heavy since the colony’s odor is inundated with the scent of nectar. Virgin queen bees emit a behavioral pheromone released with their feces.  When the new queen feels threatened by the workers she uses this pheromone as a repellent.  

Another widely identified chemical signal in bees is the Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP).  This pheromone ensures that the queen is the only reproductive female in the hive by compromising the reproductive systems of worker bees.  It also provides an attractant signal to the drones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Army Ants (Eciton burichelli)==

Army ant colony castes consist of queen ants, soldier ants, and multi-purpose worker ants.  In the army ant colony, the queen ant lays eggs, the soldiers focus their attention to the defense of the colony, and the worker ants are split between being foragers or tending to the queens brood. 

The Army ant is abundantly found in humid lowland forests or heavily forested areas of Central/South America.  The changes in temperature and precipitation have no effect on the life cycles or migration of these ants.

The social structure and life cycles of army ants have two distinct phases.  Army ant colonies go through a stationary phase and a migratory (nomadic) phase.  The phases are based on the ability of a queen to produce many eggs in a very short period of time (from 100 000 to 300 000 eggs in five to ten days); thus, the queen overpopulates a given area, which then triggers migration of the colony.

In the stationary phase, the army ant queen's abdomen swells to hold 55 000 to 66 000 eggs.  As the eggs develop into mature ants, tens of thousands of adult workers appear, triggering the nomadic phase:  colony activity increases exponentially, and &quot;swarm raids&quot; increase in size and intensity.  With a colony of this size, the army ant colony must emigrate daily.  The migration continues until &quot;larval pupation&quot; begins.  Once this occurs, the colony re-enters the stationary phase, and the cycle repeats. 

Due to their large colony sizes, army ants migrate in order to find food.  Most ants are &quot;column feeders.&quot;  Army ants are what are called &quot;swarm feeders.&quot;  The foraging workers form a fan-shaped swarm with a broad front.  Along with feeding, army ants also have a unique way of forming nests.  The army ant nest is made up of army ants themselves.  The ants form walls and fasten onto each other by using their mandibles.  The ant colony forms these walls almost anywhere in order to enclose the queen and her brood.  The nest is very structured, as it provides corridors within itself for transporting food and eggs throughout the many areas of the nest. 

Army ant colonies march and nest in different phases as well.  In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.  The colony begins a nomadic phase when available food has decreased.  During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed everyday.  Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts for approximately 17 days. 

Army ants are notorious for eating anything that gets in their path.  They can kill and eat up to 100 000 animals in a day!  They normally consume lizards, snakes, chickens, pigs, goats, scorpions, tarantulas, beetles and other ants.  Army ants can also climb trees, and feed on animals within its canopy.

Army ants communication is completely dependent on chemical messaging and trail pheromones.  These methods of communication act as a stimuli for changing behavior patterns.  Unlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes, but instead have single eyes.  Army ants are also blind and have to use their antennae to sense smell and touch.  The army ants use these senses to communicate in nesting and raiding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Human Cognitive Development==
Nature, Nurture, and Cognitive Development from 1 to 16 years: In a Parent-Offspring Adoption Study, Robert Plomin and his fellow researchers conclude that genetics, not environment, play a larger role in the development of the cognitive processes.  These researchers are interested in cognitive ability (the mental process of knowing, including aspects such as awareness, perception, reasoning, and judgment). Results for children aged 1-16 show that adoptees, although resembling their adoptive parents minimally at first, become more and more like their biological parents and less like their adoptive parents as they age. By adolescence, there is a strong resemblance to the cognitive functioning of the biological parents, to the same degree as in the control families, and no similarity to that of the adoptive parents. Despite the fact that the children do not spend any time with their biological parents, they are more similar, cognitively speaking. It suggests that the genes affecting cognitive ability are not all expressed until adolescence and, further, that whatever environmental factors may affect cognitive functioning are not at all correlated with the cognitive ability of the parents who raise the child. The research team conducted their 20-year longitudinal Colorado Adoption Project (CAP) in Denver, CO beginning in 1975. The CAP followed 245 adopted children and their biological and adoptive parents, as well as 245 matched nonadoptive children and their parents. They recruited pregnant mothers prior to labor.  A fifth of the biological fathers were tested, whereas previous studies had not tested the biological fathers.  The children were placed in homes at twenty-nine days, and in adopted homes at seven months. The researchers also had a control group of families. The children were matched to adopted families relatively similar to their own based on gender, the number of children in the family, age of the father, occupational status of the father, and father’s years of education. Also, the variability in socioeconomic status was representative of the U.S. population. The biological mothers were usually tested during their third trimester and the adoptive parents and control parents were usually tested during the child’s first year. Collectively, the thirteen tests lasted three hours long and tested the cognitive abilities of each individual. The tests were given periodically to the children throughout their development and maturation. CAP also presents a disclaimer stating that they do not believe that their examinations are fully accurate due to exceptions that they did not test, such as mental retardation.  They also only represent the middle ninety percent of the U.S. population at the time in which their study began (1975). This study shows that genetic effects on cognitive abilities are not manifested only in adulthood, but also to a considerable extent in adolescence to a lesser degree in childhood, and only slightly during infancy. The different degrees of manifestation attest to the fact that not all genes regarding cognitive ability come arise until the time of adolescence. It also shows that genetics, not environment, contribute to a individuals abilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Galapagos Islands finches have been used by Charles Darwin and many other scientist to study how “ random variation and natural selection can drive the production of organisms with novel features, adapted to new ways of life (Alberts 2004). The finches studied in the Galapagos Island are usually characterized by the great variance in beaks and the function of beaks. The finches beaks were first thought to change over many years because of local ecological condition, but many scientist devised a new hypothesis which stated, “As a consequence of beak evolution, there have been changes in the structure if finch vocal signals (Podos 2004).”
	This hypothesis was based the assumption that beaks have a direct correlation in effecting song production. The Galapagos Island finches displayed a wide variety phenotypes of beaks with different forms and functions caused by natural selection over many years. This phenotype variation was hypothesized by the Grants to be a result of natural selection because of ecological conditions. The new studies, however, tested to see if finch beaks have an affect on the acoustic structure of the songbird songs. The first experiment done to test this hypothesis involved first checking to see if beak movement indeed caused sound production, which in fact turned out to be true. Thus, one could imply that beak variations could cause a different song production. The goal of these researches is “ to show how research on the relationship between beaks and song is providing novel insights into the interplay of morphological adaptation and the evolution communication signals (Podos 2004).” The bird song is actually made in the birds syrinx, which is similar to the human larynx during speech production.  The scientist then addressed the question of how the birds are able to send pure tonal signals across such a long range and distance. The answer is that the birds are able to change their vocal tracts configurations, which in turn directly changes the frequency of their songs. The three generalizations, which these finches fall into describing their songs are, simple, variability, and cross-species overlap. If the beak is opened more wide then it creates a higher pitched sound.  So it could be hypothesized that a large beaked bird will have a large vocal tract and will in turn create a lower song frequency.  This hypothesis was backed up by the studies of Maria Palacious and Pablo Tubaro who tested the Neotropical Woodcreepers Pendrocolaptinae, which produced lower frequency songs with long beaks. These scientists tested, these highly protected finches, by video taping them and then determining the beak gapes for each song for the different finches. The two main reason male finches use their singing, like many other singing birds, is for territory defense and mate attraction, but the difference in beak size could affect both these characteristics, because some males with either small or large beaks could not produce the right song in other to perform these tasks.  This lead Nowick and colleagues to test to see if a beak changed its size for food collection, then would this have a direct affect on how fast or slow a finch could move its beak to produce its specific song. Nowick then concluded that there was a positive correlation between “divergences of beaks and its influence not only the feeding but also their singing behavior.” The scientist, however, plan to broaden their investigation by studying how wider beaks may influence songs and also study other birds with beak morphology such as the crossbills or the Hawaiian honeycreepers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Operant conditioning''', sometimes called instrumental conditioning or instrumental learning, was first extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874-1949). Thorndike's most famous work investigated the behavior of cats trying to escape from various home-made puzzle boxes. When first constrained in the boxes the cats took a long time to escape from each. With experience however, ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more quickly enabling the cats to escape in less and less time over successive trials (Wikipedia). 

B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) extended the theories proposed by Thorndike about 40 years after Thorndike published his works. Skinner's ideas of animals operating on the environment led him to analyze how behavior is affected by its consequences. The contraption that became known as the Skinner box measured whether a task was completed and how long it took for the task to be completed. The Skinner box consisted of a bar that, when pressed, triggered the release of a food pellet. Skinner believed that rewarding an animal when an appropriate action occurred would increase the likelihood that the behavior would be repeated. When a rat accidentally tapped on the bar, a food pellet was released, and Skinner observed the amount of time it took the rat to find the pellet. As the rat learned that a pellet released each time he happened to step on the bar, the rat learned to press the bar and to immediately find the food. This training became known as operant conditioning (Alcock). 

Today Skinners operant conditioning is still used to train animals. All animals that are part of Sea World programs have been trained using positive reinforcement operant conditioning. When an animal performs a desired behavior the trainer will reward the animal to encourage the action to be performed when signaled for at a later time. Positive reinforcers are stimuli that strengthen a response if they follow that response (How Animals). Negative reinforcers can also be used to encourage a certain behavior. It is important to distinguish the difference between negative reinforcement and the punishment theory. Negative reinforcement is simply the removal of an unpleasant stimulant or pain (Bernstein). For example: a person who uses an alarm that plays a pleasant song may oftentimes hit the snooze or linger in bed. To condition himself to get out of bed as soon as the alarm goes off the person may switch the alarm sound to something obnoxiously loud and unpleasant. To remove the unpleasant stimulant the person will immediately get out of bed and turn the alarm off. Knowing how to remove the unpleasant sound increases the likelihood that the person will get out of bed immediately after the alarm plays. The Punishment theory, on the other hand, introduces an aversive stimulus to reduce the likelihood of a certain behavior.

Operant conditioning is seen in the learning behavior of many animals, including humans. Oftentimes it goes completely unnoticed, but it can also be used as a deliberate tool in training. As young children explore their world and learn how to eliminate unpleasant stimuli and satisfy desires through proper behavior, they are learning through operant conditioning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bird Song and Human Speech==
To learn their language, humans and white crowned sparrows follow similar steps, recognition, practice, and clarity. The best time for a human to learn their language is from toddler to twelve years old (Macdonald) and the best time for a white crowned sparrow to learn its song is between 10-50 days from when they were born. Both genes and environment play roles in determining the way each communicate (Alcock 25). 

The first step for humans and white crowned species in learning their language can be considered recognition. White crowned sparrows and humans listen to a tutor before they begin to communicate their language. The tutor teaches the language and the particular dialect, according to the area. Just like humans, the sparrows also have a dialect depending on where they live. A white crowned sparrow has certain genes that only allow them to learn its own species’ songs. Experiments have been performed in which the sparrow was kept in isolation and played tapes of other song sparrows, the white crowned sparrow will not imitate the other species’ song, but will sing an odd song unlike either species’ song (Alcock 24-25). Humans also cannot communicate with each other using a different species’ language. A study was done in Avignon, France that observed children who were brought up by wolves. It was observed that the children spoke no language at all. Before studies of this kind were done it was thought that the children might learn to communicate with the wolves, just like the Tarzan story. This is not true, the children could not speak the human language nor the language of the wolves (Macdonald). It is a combination of environment and genes that tell white crowned sparrows and humans to learn their proper language. Genes tell the species to only learn the language of their own species and environment plays a factor in determining which dialect each will use. 

Once the white crowned sparrow or infant has recognized its species, song, they can begin to practice the language. Infants first communicate by making sounds. The sounds can range from grunts to sounds that mimic their surrounding environments. For example, before babies can say words, they might say moo- moo when looking at a cow. After sounds come words. By the time the infant reaches one year, they should be making sentences out of words (Macdonald). The white crowned sparrow also does not immediately master its song. The sparrow will first sing a short subsong derived from the tutor’s full song. The sparrows keep practicing their subsong just as infants practice their words. After the sparrow has mastered its subsong it can start to form a full song. In both species it is necessary for them to hear themselves in order to vocalize their language correctly (Alcock 26). 

In conclusion, both white crowned sparrows first listen and recognize their particular species’ language. A white crowned sparrow has a tutor to teach the song. Infants usually have parents that teach them their verbal language. Then they must practice the language, starting off slow with sounds and building up. Both species will continue to improve and clarify their language throughout their lives.

[[Image:Chef's Knife.jpg|thumb|right|A chef's knife]]

'''Chef's knife''' is a loose term for any very large general purpose knife used mainly for chopping and slicing food. 

A chef's knife is generally the most used and most versatile knife in the kitchen, used for all but the finest or most specialized tasks.  Selecting a chef's knife is therefore very important to comfortable and enjoyable cooking.  It should be the largest size which feels comfortable to use (typically 10 inches (254 mm) for reasonably tall cooks, 8 inches (200 mm) for shorter), as a smaller knife will not be able to accomplish as many tasks with ease (chopping large vegetables, halving tortillas, pizzas, and other large foods, and so forth).

Most high quality chef's knives are manufactured from high-gauge, (18/10), stainless steel. The stainless steel blade is either stamped or forged. A forged blade is heavier, usually hand-made, and will keep it's edge making it a popular choice for a professional chef. Stamped knives are cut from sheet metal by a machine, however, this process does not necessarily negate the quality.  Forged knives tend to be more expensive, and are seen by some as more reliable.  Regardless, a good chef's knife should consist of a single piece of steel, &quot;a full tang&quot;. In other words, the steel blade of the knife should extend through the entire length of the wood or plastic handle. A chef's knife containing a full tang is crucial for providing a balance point closer to the hand and a more durable product.

Keeping a knife sharp is very important. A dull knife requires more force from the user, thereby increasing the likelihood of injury. 
A [[Cookbook:Knife Sharpener|steel]] should be used to hone the edge of the blade. Honing with a steel before each use of the knife will keep the edge sharp. Occasionally a sharpening stone or high quality electric sharpener may be needed to bring a severely dulled blade back to life, followed by a few swipes on the steel.

The most important aspect of choosing a knife, however, is how it feels in your hand.  The best way to choose a knife is simply to go try the heft of several and see what suits you best. 

To purchase a high quality chef's knife, try a local restaurant equipment supplier, or a well known cooking enthusiast retailer. Stay away from the cheap imitations for sale at the grocery or chain discount stores.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called MG. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name MG~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

[[Image:PearPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|A pear]]
A '''pear''' is a [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] similar to an apple but often softer in flesh and with a sweeter taste. Pears can be eaten raw or used in various recipes. The juice can be drunk. The ripening of pears can be troublesome; some cultivars are at their best for a brief period of full ripeness. 

== Cultivars of pear ==
=== Beth ===
Small round pear with a gold/green skin. An early variety (ripe in late summer), which is sweet and juicy.
===Beurre Hardy ===
A fairly large green/gold pear, harvested from autumn to early winter. Has a firm skin and soft, juicy flesh.
===Concorde===
A cross between Conference and Comice, this pear has some of the easy keeping qualities of Conference with a sweetness from the Comice. It is large and yellow/green in colour.
=== Conference === 
Usually thin with a green skin, sometimes flecked with brown. Can be eaten when the flesh is firm or when fully ripe and the flesh yields to the touch. Flavour closer to apple than many pears, with a touch of earthiness and very firm. Keeps well and usually available throughout the winter.

=== Doyenne du Comice ===
Large, heart-shaped pear with a gold and green flecked skin. Flesh remains firm even when fully ripe. Flavour is sweet.
=== Rocha ===
A small pear with a skin varying from light green to pale gold flecked with brown. Originally from Portugal, this pear can be eaten firm or soft and has a distinct undertone of honey in the taste.

[[Image:Pfanne (Edelstahl).jpg|thumb|right|A frying pan made of stainless steel]]
A '''frying pan''' or '''skillet''' is a shallow cooking utensil generally used on top of a [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] food.

As with all pans, a thicker bottom allows more even heat distribution while reducing responsiveness to desired heat changes. See the [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pots and pans]] article for a discussion of the different materials that may be used.
