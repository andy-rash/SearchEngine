== Where are the values? ==

Looking into the structure you see modules, connected by wires. But there are no variables whose values you could check. If you know a little bit about programming you might wonder: Where are the values in Reaktor? 

Well, they're obviously travelling along the wires - and you can even see them doing that by pointing your mouse on a wire: If it's a primary level wire a small hint apears showing the actual value travelling along the wire (updated every second or so). In core level you have to activate the &quot;debug mode&quot; (within the context menu or by pressing the little bug in the header) to get these hints. 

This way you can get a first overview of what's going on. If you have to analyse the values in more details there are a lot of panel elements available you can insert into the structure to have the values displayed within the panel.

* You learn something about Reaktor every day you work with it. What you learned today may be very easy for you, but it may be very difficult for other users or Reaktor beginners. '''Share what you learned today here''', just add a sentence, or two. We will pick up these tips and build a larger tutorial based on it.
* [[Reaktor/Tutorials/Use_of_IC_Send_module_with_any_sequencer|Use of IC Send module with any sequencer]]
* On the PC use Ctrl to automatically create an additional input point for a Macro when you drag a wire towards it, on a Mac it's the Command key.  This also works with some Math modules and any other module that has '...' on the bottom left. 
* To modify instrument volume with an LFO, the LFO has to produce AUDIO output so as to avoid annoying sound artefacts (pitch modulation, in contrast, can safely be done by an event LFO signal). Also, it's a good idea to smoothen the LFO signal using an integrator that adjusts it to Reaktor's control rate´(I once found a &quot;Ramps CtrlRate&quot; macro in one of the User Library's instruments to do the job).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would like to try creating a &quot;minimal standard course&quot; of theoretical physics.
The emphasis is on a small amount of ''standard'' material and on ''understandability'' of all explanations.
I have started with [[Classical mechanics]] so far; the existing pages of that wikibook were almost empty and I think it would be okay to take over.
I am of course not sure how much time I will be able to devote to this project.

'''Kinpira''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] cooking term that roughly translates to ''[[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]]''. The aim is to cook root vegetables such as carrots and burdock root in a minimum amount of water so that they end up tenderly cooked and with none of their flavour or nutritional value lost into discarded cooking water.

==Ingredients==
*250g (½ lb) [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]s, [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienned]]
*1 Tbs [[cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]], preferably [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*Tamari or shoyu [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]], to taste

==Procedure==
# Cut the carrots into thin matchstick pieces (sen-giri, or julienned)
# Pour a small amount of oil into a [[cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]] and sauté the carrot pieces briefly
# Add only enough water to half-cover the carrot pieces
# Place the lid on the pot and let the carrots simmer briefly on medium-low heat
# Add a little tamari or shoyu to enhance flavour

The official language of Austria is German. The variety used is called Austrian German, which contains minor differences in vocabulary and pronunciation: it is much more mild, liberal and melodious unlike the German in Germany which is harsh, arrogant and even somewhat mastering. The varieties are mostly mutually intelligible. However, the native language of almost all Austrians is not German, but instead various local dialects of the Austro-Bavarian language, replaced by Alemannic in Vorarlberg. Both are closely related but not always mutually intelligible with each other and German, especially not the Southern Austro-Bavarian dialects and Alemannic. On the other hand, practically everyone except many people over 70 and rural people over 50 can also speak German, again using the Austrian variety, as a second language, and as the official language, it is also expected to be used in modern day schools.
Vienna is a special case. The original Austro-Bavarian (Wienerisch) dialects have practically disappeared (except among older people) and been replaced with a single Wienerisch/German mix language, which is the result of Wienerisch growing closer to German. And right now, among children, this is also disappearing, as the German language is in the process of taking over as the first language in Vienna, so most Viennese children today use German as their mother tongue and Wienerisch as a second language, and in fact, a few speak no Wienerisch at all. This Germanization has also been slightly noticed in other parts of the country, such as Salzburg and Graz, where Austro-Bavarian, however, for the moment, remains the mother tongue of the vast majority in these places.

== The differences - die Unterschiede - der Unterschied ==

Austro-Bavarian is closely related to German. But there are many differences between the two.

Where? a quick search doesn't even find the words &quot;profit&quot; &quot;sell&quot;, and every case of &quot;redistribute&quot; has no such condition.


== Public Domain ==
I think you will find that the notion of &quot;public domain&quot; is restricted to the US and a few other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How time passes! All the comments about the 'New Syllabus' are now superseded by the fact that there is an even newer syllabus published for first teaching in 2014 (August). Even the website of resources established for 2009 syllabus will be out of date from the end of the examination cycle in 2015.  

New syllabus can be found here: http://www.edu.pe.ca/rural/IB%20Biology/files/Biology2009IB.pdf
The following are NOT IB publications, but offer syllabus outcomes AND answers. They are not endorsed by the IBO.
http://www.ibguides.com/biology/notes/2.1-cell-theory (This is a site that basically has the same purpose as this study guide. I would recommend this site for IB students looking for a quick source of info about the syllabus outcomes.)
and
https://docs.google.com/a/i-biology.net/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AuVTjWxKuHifdDJEUFRuNy1oUVpuY19EZWpsWUhVU1E&amp;rm=full#gid=19 (This is an excellent source for the syllabus, as it divides the syllabus into HL and SL, with separate sheets for Options. I have communicated with Stephen Taylor, an IB teacher that created this spreadsheet, and he said that it was ok if users wanted to download it or make a copy to add to their Google Drive. It would be a good idea to thank him in the comments at the bottom here: http://i-biology.net/ibdpbio/command-terms/ )


If a new version of the sylabus is avalable, then why don't we retrofit the page to it? Is there anywhere we can get it? [[User:Senix1|Senix1]] ([[User talk:Senix1|talk]])

We still have to consider that current Y11 and Y12 IB Biology students are still using the 2009 syllabus. Perhaps we should '''fork the book into separate editions of the syllabus'''. [[User:CatanOverlord|CatanOverlord]] ([[User talk:CatanOverlord|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/CatanOverlord|contribs]]) 16:17, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

Before setting out to do loads of work on this, don't overlook the fact that the IB Biology syllabus has changed for exams from 2009.  Students starting in sept 2007 will follow a new syllabus.  Wouldn't it be better to use the structure of the new syllabus?

Why reinvent the wheel? This work has already been substantially covered by [Stephen Taylor]http://http://i-biology.net/ and [John Burrell] http://click4biology.info  

This is amazing! I started, then abandoned this ages ago. Thanks for contributing to this article: another testament to how great collectivism can be! [[User:Akapsycho|Akapsycho]] 18:33, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

If we all want the merging, I suggest that we keep the order of statements as how they are in the IB syllabus. [[User:76.105.23.27|76.105.23.27]] 23:28, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

Help this cause please! [[User:Akapsycho|Akapsycho]] 18:33, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:It does seem to need some editing.  Has a biologist read any of the statements? I'm not being cruel, it just seems the &quot;answers&quot; are often poorly framed. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:46, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

It needs more than &quot;some&quot; editing. Even if the content is fine, the layout is a mess. I think that each topic needs to get its own page. This Wikibook should also start being more of a Wikibook than a more detailed copy of the IB syllabus. [[User:Splat|Splat]] 00:22, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:Oh good. It was not only me that noticed problems - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:47, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:The content needs a ''lot'' of editing since the objectives in the new Syllabus have changed almost completely! I'm not sure, but I think that this is the new Syllabus with all the new objectives (although I think it's HL): http://production-app2.ibo.org/publication/7/part/2/chapter/4/page/1    Now I personally think that the formatting is perfectly fine and readable, the only thing that we have to do is change the objectives until Exams 2009 (which I think are around May). Another thing I'm thinking is if these objectives are somehow creative commons? Can we just put them on here, or are they protected.

I've made some extensive notes. I'll add them here. Someone please correct my spelling though- it's generally atroscious. --[[User:Daniel.Stevens|Daniel.Stevens]] 11:20, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

I decided to write out the principles of synaptic transmission (11.1.5)as clearly and consisely as possible, if you think it is worth adding, go ahead! Oh and good luck everyone with BIO HL tomorrow!  A.Brown!
*1. Nerve impulse (action potential) reaches end of pre-synaptic neuron, (from depolarisation in the axon)
*2. Opens voltage gated calcium ion (Ca2+) channel, allowing influx of Calcium (into Pre-synaptic Neuron/ axoplasm)
*3. Causes vesicle containing neurotransmitters to move to pre-synaptic membrane
*4. Vesicle fuses with pre-synaptic membrane and exctretes neurotransmitter by exocytosis
*5. Neurotransmitter (eg. acetylcholine, dopamine, etc.) diffuses across the synaptic gap and binds to a receptor on the post-synaptic membrane
*6. This causes chemical gated Sodium channels on the post-synaptic membrane to open, letting Sodium ions into the post-synaptic neuron; causing depolarisation
*7. Enzymes break down the neurotransmitter bound to receptor. 
*8. Broken down neurotransmitter reabsorbed by PRE-synaptic membrane and re-synthesised into neurotransmitter.
*9. Calcium ions in pre-synaptic neuron pumped back out into synaptic gap

''also, there's a problem with the light dependant reaction.. Cylic photophosphorylation only involve PS I not PSII !!! It is confusing!
here is my suggestion.. though probably needs editing:''

*1, PHOTOLYSIS: the splitting of water by light energy to produce Oxygen, H+ ions and e-. Oxygen released as a waste proudct of photosynthesis . H+ ions combine with NADP to give NADPH+H
*2, Photoactivation of Photosystem II: PSII absorbs light energy and electrons are boosted to a higher energy level.
*3, Electrons lost from PSII are replaced by electrons from PHOTOLYSIS
*4, Photophosphorylation: electrons at high energy level fall in energy through a series of carriers. As they pass through the cytochrome complex, the energy released is used to pump protons (H+ ions) into the thykaloid interior, creating a high concentration.
*5, Protons (H+ ions) flow back into stroma by diffusion through ATP synthase, hence generating ATP.
*6, Electrons continue to fall in energy level and reach PS I.
*7, PHOTOACTIVATION of PS I :light energy absorbed by chlorophyl in PS I, excites electron
*8, Electon used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH + H+, using 2H+ (NON-CYCLIC PHOTOPHOSPHORYLATION)
*9, OR, electron falls back to PS I through Cytochrome complex, generating more ATP due to concentration gardient of H+ discussed above. CYCLIC PHOTOPHOSPHORYLATION
*10, Cyclic photophosphorylation uses only PS I (and ATP synthetase) , not PS II

== Topic 1 ==

Isn't Topic 1 supposed to be &quot;Statistical analysis&quot;? [[Special:Contributions/218.101.117.106|218.101.117.106]] ([[User talk:218.101.117.106|talk]]) 04:22, 7 February 2008 (UTC)

It is on the new course, not on the old course which is here. This book should really say for first examinations year x (whatever the old course's first year was). Still lots the same though so just make sure if you're doing the new course and want to use this you check to make sure it's the same dot points for a given section.</text>

      <comment>No support for investing in real estate is the best invest -- it's certainly the largest. Entire first paragraph is conjecture.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Investing in Residential Real Estate is one of the primary means of wealth accumulation in America today.  For most Americans, investing in their own home is the largest investment they ever make.  Extending that investment to other properties can be a means of building net worth.

There are five key characteristics that make real estate investing different from a passive investments such as the stock market:

INCOME: the property produces income in the form of rent, and that income can be used to pay for the investment itself.  Because everyone has to have a place to live, the rental income tends to be more stable than the income from other investments. In addition, the income tends to rise over the course of time, as rent reflects the cost of ownership at the time of the rental.  This benefits the owner, whose monthly cost is largely fixed at the time of acquisition.

DEPRECIATION:  and other tax benefits are simply too good to be true.  Many smart investors aim for a &quot;break even&quot; cash flow, but still get solid cash tax benefits from the tax shelter generated from depreciation.  Investments can be exchanged without tax consequence, allowing the investor remarkable flexibility without any tax bill.  And even if you sell, long term gains are not considered earned income, and therefore are not taxed by Social Security.  The long term capital gains tax is currently at only 15%.  

EQUITY BUILD UP: Equity in the property grows from the gradual pay off of the loan balance through [[wikt:amortize|amortization]]. Many investors choose a 30 year fixed rate loan program to keep their debt service costs to a minimum.  Even so, as time passes, a larger and larger portion of the payment goes toward principal reduction.  Eventually, the owner will own the property free and clear of any debt. 

APPRECIATION: This increase in value can come from two sources, both from the economy (overall increase in value of real property) and from the improvements made by the owner (paint, carpet, adding a deck, mowing the lawn, etc.).  Appreciation is the secret benefit of residential real estate, because the real money in owning real property is in holding it long term.

LEVERAGE: It only takes a small amount of cash to control a relatively large investment in residential real estate.  Borrowing 80% to 95% of the purchase price is common, and locking in at a long term fixed interest rate is also common.  In fact, if an investor has a good credit record, financing for up to 100% of the purchase price is often available.  This type of leverage is typical in real estate because lenders believe the collateral (the real estate) is very stable in value.  This leverage allows the investor to accumulate substantial dollar amount of investments relatively quickly.  Also, owner financing is common, so investors with poor credit can get started as well.

*[[Cookbook:Dog Biscuits|Dog Biscuits]]
*[[Cookbook:Ground Tofu|Ground Tofu]]
*[[Cookbook:Lentil Rice Loaf|Lentil Rice Loaf]]

===Taco Meat===

* 1 small onion, finely diced
* 1 package vegetarian ground beef or 1 pound ground beef, cooked and drained with reserved fat
* 1&amp;frac12; T vegetable oil or reserved beef fat
* 1 T mild chili powder
* &amp;frac12; t oregano
* &amp;frac12; t cumin
* &amp;frac12; t black pepper
* &amp;frac12; t salt
* 3 oz. V-8 beverage

Mix the dry seasonings except for the salt together. Start by sweating onion in a frying pan or skillet with a generous pinch of the salt and seasoning mixture. Add the ground beef substitute (or cooked beef) and increase the heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, to brown the beef and onions. Add the rest of the salt seasoning mixture and incorporate. Add the V-8 and about &amp;frac14; of water, just so everything is wet. Cook and reduce for 5-10 minutes until consistency is correct. Add salt to taste.

===Mini-Peach Crisp===

Filling:
* 1-2 peaches, peeled and sliced
* 1 T sugar
* 1 t cornstarch

Topping:
* &amp;frac14; C brown sugar
* &amp;frac14; C rolled oats
* 2 T flour
* 2 T butter
* pinch salt
* pinch cinnamon

Preheat oven to 375&amp;deg;

Mix filling ingredients together until peach chunks are coated with sugar and cornstarch. Place evenly in bottom of small ramekin (5&quot; diameter).

Mix dry topping ingredients together. Cut in butter until evenly distributed and topping has texture of coarse bread crumbs.

Cook in 375&amp;deg; oven for about 35 minutes or until topping is golden brown and crisp bubbles around the edges. Serves 2.

===Poke Duo===
* 8 oz ahi tuna (sashimi-grade, divided into two portions)
* 1/4 t wasabi powder
* 1 t sesame seeds (white, untoasted)
* 1/2 t salt
* 1/4 t black pepper
* 1 stalk celery
* 3/4 pasilla pepper
* 1/4 C pistachios, chopped
* 1/4 medium red onion, very thinly sliced
* 1/8 t sriracha
* 1/2 C soy sauce
* 1/8 t toasted sesame oil
* chopped cilantro
* chopped green onions

This dish is a non-traditional poke made from tuna prepared two ways: sliced raw, as in traditional poke, and seared with wasabi, salt, black pepper and sesame seeds, then cooled and sliced.

To sear the tuna, divide into two portions--set one aside to slice raw later. Prepare the seasoning mix by mixing together the dry ingredients. Press the moist tuna into the coating on both sides. Heat a cast iron skillet till just the smoking point of canola oil, apply enough oil to coat the bottom and gently lay the coated tuna in the bottom of the pan. Sear approximately 90 seconds on each side, then remove from heat. Place on a covered plate in the refrigerator to cool.

To prepare the vegetables, thinly slice the red onion and the pasilla or anaheim pepper (if using a mild pepper, increase the amount of sriracha in the dressing. Add chopped celery and chopped pistachios into a bowl.

Mix the dressing ingredients together vigorously and add to the vegetables. Cover and refrigerate for at least a half hour.

When ready to serve, slice the tuna into cubes and dress with the vegetables. Mix thoroughly and place on a bed of sliced cabbage or lettuce. Top with freshly chopped cilantro and green onions. Makes two portions.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Demi. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Demi~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Thanks for all of you useful contributions to Wikibooks. I've just moved the contents of your new [[Currents]] article to your other one using the singular form, [[Current]], along with redirecting the former to the latter. You don't need to create one article for each form, create only the singular form, except when only the plural is used, like with [[Electronics]] (see [[w:en:Wikipedia:Naming conventions|Wikipedia:Naming conventions]] for a '''very''' detailed discussion of the page naming style used by some Wikibookians). You can easily link the the plural to your singular page like this, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[current]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt; yields [[current]]s, and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Current|currents]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; yields [[Current|currents]] (the second form is more versatile (you can put anything you like after the pipe symbol (the |), but it's a bit harder to type). Thanks again, and carry on your great work. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 02:18, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)
-------------------------
Thanks for the information on singular and plural forms in titles. I tried to reply on the 7th, but the page was locked for maintenance.

..... I look at the list of red titles (Pages wanted, etc.) and if I can help I contribute something, but soon there won't be any left. What is the relationship between the 'pedia and the 'books? Maybe I'll try Copying/pasting from one to the other? QUITTNER, [[User:142.150.49.171|142.150.49.171]] 16:24, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I'm glad you found it useful. Umm, you can copy stuff from Wikipedia, but you need to be careful to attribute you source properly. That is, you should copy the history of the Wikipedia article to the talk page of the article you are creating or adding to. It's also a good idea to make a link back to Wikipedia, for example &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipedia|Food Processor}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; you get the box below:
{{Wikipedia|Food Processor}}
:Maybe, instead of cutting and pasting, you could add to or create an article in an area that you are interested in. But, don't feel that you have to rush ahead to create articles, you can simply read through what others have done and how they formatted it, that will help you do a good job when you do contribute. Good luck. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 01:20, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Screening Tests:'''&lt;/big&gt;
*'''2009:''' Mayo -- PMID 19520758 -- &quot;Screening panels for detection of monoclonal gammopathies.&quot; (Katzmann JA, Clin Chem. 2009 Aug;55(8):1517-22.)
**Conclusion: &quot;Serum IFE, PEL, and FLC combined with urine IFE and PEL is the most comprehensive and inclusive panel to screen for monoclonal gammopathies. However, because of the small incremental sensitivity provided by urine studies and serum IFE, the use of serum PEL plus FLC provides a simple and efficient initial diagnostic screen for the high-tumor-burden monoclonal gammopathies such as MM, WM, and SMM. Urine studies and serum IFE can be ordered more selectively.&quot;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Multiple myeloma''':
* Bone marrow containing &gt; 10% plasma cells
* or a plasmacytoma plus at least one of the following
*# an M-protein in the serum (usually &gt; 3 g/dL)
*# an M-protein in the urine (&gt; 1 g/dL)
*# lytic bone lesions
*Must have the presence of clinical features (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, lytic lesions, recurrent bacterial infections, or extramedullary plasmacytomas)

'''Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS):'''
*Absence of symptoms
*M-protein &lt; 3 g/dL
*&lt; 10% plasma cells in bone marrow
*No lytic lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, or renal insufficiency

'''Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM):'''
*M-protein &gt; 3 g/dL
*&gt;10% plasma cells in bone marrow
*No lytic lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia

Plasma cell labeling index (PCLI) can differentiate MGUS and SMM from MM:
*Elevated PCLI is indicative of MM
*40% of pts with MM have a normal PCLI

Circulating plasma cells are rare in MGUS and SMM.

==Prognostic factors==
*Plasma cell labeling index (PCLI)
*:Uses monoclonal antibody BU-1 that reacts with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine
*:High PCLI (&gt;1%) predicts poor overall survival
*Beta-2 microglobulin
*:Correlates with myeloma tumor burden. High value predicts poor survival.

==Treatment==
===Treatment Overview===
*&lt;u&gt;Solitary plasmacytoma&lt;/u&gt;
**45-50 Gy to involved bone
**Surgery reserved for neurologic emergencies (spinal cord compression, some spine instability)
**Chemotherapy reserved for those who progress to multiple myeloma
**&gt;90% local control
**50-60% progress to multiple myeloma
*&lt;u&gt;Extramedullary plasmacytoma&lt;/u&gt;
**45-50 Gy to affected area and LNs
**Surgery + RT better outcomes than either modality in upper aerodigestive tract (UAD), no benefit to surgery elsewhere
**No benefit demonstrated for chemotherapy
**80% local control
**15% progress to multiple myelome
*&lt;u&gt;Multiple myeloma&lt;/u&gt;
**Chemotherapy and/or BMT primary treatment
**Bisphosphonates IV
**RT palliative intent; 15-20 Gy considered sufficient
**Hemibody RT (7.5 Gy / 8.5 Gy) for refractory cases

===Radiotherapy===
*Solitary plasmacytoma
**Dose &gt;45 Gy in 2 Gy/fx 
**2-3 cm margin; in spine generally treat 1 above and 1 below
**No LN irradiation

*Extramedullary plasmacytoma
**Dose &gt;45 Gy in 2 Gy/fx
**Elective LN irradiation recommended

*Multiple myeloma
**In MM intent is palliative. 
**Disseminated MM of bone is considered radiosensitive, and doses 15-20 Gy are considered sufficient for pain control. However, for long-term functional outcomes in spinal cord compression, consider 30/10
**Hemibody irradiation (6 weeks after chemo) with 7.5 Gy single fx to upper body and 8.5 Gy single fx to lower body


'''Solitary Plasmacytoma'''
*'''Mayo, 1989''' PMID 2912957 -- &quot;Solitary plasmacytoma of bone: Mayo Clinic experience.&quot; (Frassica DA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1989 Jan;16(1):43-8.)
**Retrospective. 46 patients with solitary plasmacytoma. 54% vertebral column. RT median 40 Gy (20-70 Gy). Median F/U 7.5 years
**Outcome: 54% developed multiple myeloma, 11% local recurrences
**Recurrence: median time-to-failure 18 months, but 23% &gt;5 years. No local failure if RT &gt;45 Gy
**OS: 5-year 74%, 10-year 45%. 


'''Multiple myeloma'''
:''For spinal cord compression in multiple myeloma, see also [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Spinal_Cord_Compression]]''
*'''MD Anderson, 2006''' (1993-2005)  PMID 16925080 -- &quot;Multiple myeloma of the cervical spine: treatment strategies for pain and spinal instability.&quot; (Rao G, J Neurosurg Spine. 2006 Aug;5(2):140-5.)
**Retrospective. 35 patients with MM mets in cervical spine, treated with RT and/or surgery
**RT only (dose not reported): 19/20 experienced pain resolution. 
**Spinal instability: 23/35 instability on x-ray, 15/23 treated with RT alone. No clinical progress of instability after RT

*'''Hamburg, 2006''' (1994-2004) (Germany) PMID 16413695 -- &quot;Short-course radiotherapy is not optimal for spinal cord compression due to myeloma.&quot; (Rades D, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Apr 1;64(5):1452-7.)
**Retrospective. 172 patients irradiated for spinal cord compression. RT short (8/1 or 20/5) or long (30/10, 37.5/15, 40/20).
**Outcome: 52% functional improvement; 47% of nonambulator patients gained ability to walk
**Motor function improvement: long RT 59% vs. short RT 39% at 1 month (NS), 67% vs. 43% at 6 months (SS), 76% vs. 40% at 1 year (SS) and 83% vs. 54% at 2 years (NS). No difference among long-term fractionation schemes. Local recurrence in 11% (short RT) vs 5%. 
**Conclusion: 30/10 appropriate for long-term functional outcome

*'''U.Arizona, 1993''' (1975-90) PMID 7683017 -- &quot;Radiation therapy for the palliation of multiple myeloma.&quot; (Leigh BR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Apr 2;25(5):801-4.)
**Retrospective. 101 pts with MM treated with 316 courses.
**dose range: 3-60 Gy (mean 25 Gy; most common 25-30 Gy). Fraction size mean: 3.1 Gy.
**Pain relief: 26% complete, 71% partial, 3% none. Only 6% required retreatment (at a median time of 16 months). No relationship between pain relief rate or retreatment rate with dose. Good pain responses seen with doses &gt; 10 Gy.

*'''Wash U, 1980''' (1961-75) PMID 6153562 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142(19800215)45:4%3C647::AID-CNCR2820450405%3E3.0.CO;2-E/abstract Full text] -- &quot;The role of radiation therapy in the management of plasma cell tumors.&quot; (Mill WB, Cancer. 1980 Feb 15;45(4):647-52.)
**Retrospective. 128 patients with MM and 16 patients with SPC
**MM: dose range up to 44 Gy. Most common 15-20 Gy. Only 6% fields needed re-treatment at later date. Palliation from pain: 21% complete, 70% partial, 9% none. Pain relief first noted after a median dose of 10-15 Gy.
**SPC: Recommend doses &gt;50 Gy for improved local control

===Chemotherapy===
*Adriamycin / pegylated doxorubicin
*Vincristine
*Bortezomib (Velcade) - inhibits proteasome / ubiquitin pathway. Inhibits NFKB (nuclear factor &amp;kappa;-B), several cytokines, VEGF, fibroblast growth factor
*Thalidomide - immunomodulator
*Lenalidomide (Revlimid) - analog of thalidomide. fewer side effects
*Dexamethasone - high dose [40mg per day X 4days on , 4 days off, repeated whole month] or low dose [40mg per day X4 days on 24 days off} every 28 days is used in combinations with the above therapies.
*Melphalan/Prednisone
*High dose Cyclophosphamide

====Trials====
*'''Italy, 2007''' PMID 17360989 -- &quot;A comparison of allografting with autografting for newly diagnosed myeloma.&quot; (Bruno B, N Engl J Med. 2007 Mar 15;356(11):1110-20.)
**Prospective. 162 patients with one sibling. Treated with VAD, followed by melphalan + autologous stem cell transplant. If HLA-identical sibling, followed by non-myeloablative TBI (2 Gy on day 0) and stem cell allograft. If no HLA-identical sibling, followed by myeloablative melphalan + second autologous stem cell transplant. Median F/U 3.7 years
**Median OS: allograft 6.7 years vs. autograft 4.5 years (SS). EFS 3 years vs. 2.4 years (SS)
**Conclusion: autograft+allograft from sibling better than tandem autograft

*'''IFM 99-06 (French)''' (2000-?)
**447 pts randomized to three arms: 1) standard MP (melphalan-prednisone), 2) MP + thalidomide, 3) MP followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
**ASCO 2006 Abstract &amp;mdash; &quot;Superiority of melphalan-prednisone (MP) + thalidomide over MP and autologous stem cel transplantation in the treatment of newly diagnosed elderly patients with multiple myeloma.&quot; Facon T et al.
***Median f/u 37 months. Improved PFS for MP+Thalidomide (27.6 months) vs 17.1 (MP) vs 19.4 (xplant), SS for MP+T, NS for MP vs xplant. MS 53.6 vs 32.2 vs 38.6 mo.

**PMID 16855634 (2006) &amp;mdash; &quot;International uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma.&quot; Durie BG et al. Leukemia. 2006 Sep;20(9):1467-73.

==Solitary Plasmacytoma==
*'''Mayo; 2006''' (1960-95) PMID 16741249 -- &quot;Immunoglobulin free light chains and solitary plasmacytoma of bone.&quot; (Dingli D, Blood. 2006 Sep 15;108(6):1979-83.)
**Retrospective. Included 116 pts with SBP for whom FLC assays were available prior to treatment. Excluded pts with M protein &gt; 3 g/dL. 
**64% had a detectable serum M protein; was &gt; 0.3 g/dL in 63 pts; in 11 detectable only by IFE. Median size of M protein was 0.5 g/dL. Abnormal FLC ratio in 47% at diagnosis. 
**43 pts progressed to MM at a median TTP of 1.8 yrs. Pts with abnormal FLC ratio at diagnosis had a higher chance of progression. Pts with persistent M protein (0.5 g/dL or higher) at 1-2 yrs from diagnosis also had a higher chance of progression. 5-yr probability of progression: 13% (normal FLC, normal M protein at 1-2 yrs), 26% (either risk factor abnormal), 62% (both risk factors abnormal)
**Conclusion: an abnormal FLC ratio can predict progression to myeloma

==Bisphosphonates==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The Five point (also known as five paragraph) essay is simply that—an, essay which completes its goal (defending its thesis) in five points. It is one of the easiest essays to utilize, though quite difficult to master, and so appears often in timed writing assignments. An essay may serve any of several functions—from conveying a general thought to elucidating on a particular topic—however, it should always move the reader in some way, particularly in persuasive essays.  

Start the introductory paragraph off broad. Be creative here. Get the reader interested. Quotes work well, be sure not to be cliché however, as the reader will become disinterested if they feel they already know the topic well enough. Different essays will require different sorts of introductory paragraphs, but most of the time, have a general statement, list your key points, then your thesis statement. Your thesis will almost always comes at the end of your introductory paragraph, and some people will tell you that it always should. In general, one may visualize a basic introductory paragraph as an upside down triangle, moving from the most general topic (the inverted base), to the pointed thesis at the bottom.

== Summarize Argument ==
You should sum up all the arguments you have given

== Argue Your Position ==
Make good arguments. Don't make bad arguments. Make attractive arguments. There are two routes to persuasion - the direct and peripheral route. The direct route uses concrete ideas. That is: X is true because of A, B, and C. A, B, and C should be logical and convincing. You should cite your sources. Go check out the [[w:APA style guide|APA style guide]] and the [[w:MLA style guide|MLA style guide]] to see how you should format your reference list. The peripheral route relies on cues outside of one's conscious awareness to make an argument. The peripheral route relies on emotion to get the point across. Psychology has done research that shows attractive people have an easier time persuading others of their viewpoints, so make your essay attractive. Make your final product look professional, and make your writing to the point and verbose, but '''do not be overly wordy'''.

Other perspectives talk of logos, pathos, and ethos with respect to arguing your position. Logos is the logical aspects to an argument. Pathos the term for an argument based on emotion. Ethos is an argument based on trust. You want to establish trust with your reader. You want to make logical arguments that make sense, and you want to make the person reading your argument feel a certain way. 

For example, an argument based on logic would be, we should abolish the death penalty because it will save money and lives. An argument based on ethos would be: I'm an expert on the death penalty, I have a PhD. in economics from Stanford, and after studying the topic for many years we have found that by abolishing the death penalty we could save 14 million a year due to fewer legal costs. An argument based on pathos would be, we should have the death penalty because of the evil acts people have committed, or my husband was brutally murdered and wouldn't you want justice for someone if they murdered your spouse?

Use good logic, establish trust, and make your arguments feel good and look pretty. Also, write more succinctly and cleanly than the preceding three paragraphs. Don't use apostrophes, or the words: good, or pretty.

== Counter Argument And Response ==
In this paragraph bring up a counter argument to your position. Then invalidate this argument.

== Conclusion ==
In your concluding paragraph, start specific and end broad. Use the first sentence to reiterate your thesis in some way. Next you could summarize your arguments using different wording. Vary the depth of what you write depending on the length of the essay. For a long essay you could be more specific and flowery, for a short essay, be to the point. Maybe you could add a little something to bolster or reinforce your arguments, but don't bring up material that diverges too radically from what you just wrote. If you do, you run the risk of confusing the reader, or seeming too diffuse in your writing. After this, you could write about the broad implications of what you just wrote about. Finally you could cap it off by quite briefly reiterating your argument and making a general statement or quote that will make your reader think and then you are done.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ryan524. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ryan524~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Bible is the sacred book of Christianity. Many of the biblical accounts, especially those of the Old Testament, are believed not only by Christians, but also Jews and Muslims. 

The word &quot;Bible&quot; originated from the Greek word, βιβλια, biblia, and means &quot;books&quot; or &quot;collection of books&quot;. The [[/Origin_of_the_Bible|origin of the Bible]] is very interesting, featuring multiple translations and conciliar debates leading to the canonization of the books as we know them today. The Bible consists of two parts, called &quot;testaments&quot; (testament refers to covenant with God, from the Latin &quot;testamentum&quot;): The Old Testament (OT), which contains the Torah (Law), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings) of the Jewish tradition, and the New Testament (NT), which contains the Gospels (good news) and the Epistles (letters), the  Acts of the Apostles (accounts of the early Christian movement), and the Revelation of John (an apocalypse).

According to The Roman Catholic Canon the Bible is comprised of 73 books: the OT has 46 books and the NT has 27. Most Protestant churches reject six books from the Catholic OT, referring to them as the Apocrypha (it is obvious that Orthodox and Catholics do not call them &quot;Apocryphal&quot; but use the adjective &quot;Deuterocanonical&quot;, which means &quot;of the Second Canon&quot; - the first being the Jewish Canon), giving the Protestant Bible 39 books in the OT and thus a total of 66 books.

The first Catholic English Bible translation was the &quot;Douay-Rheims Bible&quot;, 1609, followed by the Protestant (Anglican) &quot;[[/KJV|King James Bible]]&quot; in 1611. Although before these two there were many partial translations, and some full and authorized editions (such as the Great Bible which was a predecessor to the KJV, authorized by King Henry VIII of England in 1539), the KJV, which utilized the Douay-Rheims Bible in its presentation of the NT, is often viewed as the first major English translation of the Bible due to the dominant place it held as the standard English Bible for some 400 years.

The linguistic structure of the King James Bible helped shape the English language and set most of the standards on how words should be spelled, as well as word order and grammar. Putting aside its intrinsic religious value, it is a masterpiece of English literature.

The original languages of the biblical texts were Classical Hebrew (most of the OT), Biblical (probably Imperial) Aramaic (Daniel 2-7, portions of Ezra 4-7, Genesis 31.47 and Jeremiah 10.11), and Koine Greek (the entire NT).  Modern Hebrew, which is related to Biblical Hebrew, is spoken in Israel, a version of Aramaic is still spoken in Syria and surrounding by a population of almost one million people, and Greek is still spoken in its modern form in Greece.

In the final centuries BC, the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek (a translation called the Septuagint, abbreviated LXX), the universal language of the time. Then, in the very early Middle Ages the whole Bible was translated into Latin, which was, in turn, the language spoken in Europe at that time. After the Reformation many translations to the common languages (Spanish, French, English, German, etc.) began to appear.

The Bible is the most translated book of all time, the first book ever printed on a press with movable type, and the best selling book of all time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Honey comb.jpg|thumb|right|Honey Comb]]

Honey Comb, also known as Cut Comb Honey, or Combed Honey, is honey in its most natural state. This honey is encapsulated in its original bee made hexagonal wax container. Once the default method of availability, honey comb has more recently been dismissed with a preference towards [[Beekeeping/Extracted Honey| Extracted Honey]].

As of recently [[Beekeeping/Chunk Hone| Chunk Honey]], which is essentially smaller pieces of comb honey suspended in extracted honey, has been picking up popularity. 

==Producing Honey Comb==
In general combed honey is more difficult to produce successfully than extracted honey. The major reason being that to produce attractive comb honey, bees must be kept in conditions that will likely lead to [[Beekeeping/Swarming| swarming]], and the local [[Beekeeping/Honey Flow| honey flow]] must be long term.
===How To Produce===
===Production Tips===
One option for producing honey comb on a small scale, is to consider keeping bees in a [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]] where all honey produced is by default in comb form. Unlike standard [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth hives]], top bar hives don’t use foundation which leads to poor production of comb honey.

===Common Problems===

==How To Eat== 
When faced with comb honey, many consumers unfamiliar with the food are unsure how to eat it. While it is probably not the best honey product for use in tea, comb honey is often used spread over bread, or with anything that may benefit from extra texture. Some connoisseur even choose to eat by the spoonful.
Although the wax can be consumed alongside the honey, it is not a good source of nutrients, and will more than likely simply pass through.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Osmosis is a type of diffusion involving water molecules and a semi-permeable membrane. They move from areas of &quot;high water concentration&quot;, such as dilute solutions of say, sugar, to areas of &quot;low water concentration&quot;, such as concentrated solutions of sugar, until there is an equal concentration of water molecules on both sides.
There are three types of solution (and, thus, osmosis):
*'''Isotonic'''
Water concentration outside the cell is equal to concentration inside the cell. Water still passes through the cell membrane, but the net movement is 0.
*'''Hypotonic'''
Water concentration outside the cell is greater than concentration inside the cell. Water passes into the cell.
*'''Hypertonic'''
Water concentration inside the cell is greater than concentration outside the cell. Water leaves the cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">History and Forms of the Game:

A number of card games similar to whist can be traced all the way back to the early 16th century. They were all trick-taking games with a variety of minor variations. Whist became the dominant form, and enjoyed a loyal following for centuries.

The first game known as bridge was created by the twin innovations of exposing one hand during play and allowing the dealer to choose a trump suit. (According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word bridge is the English pronunciation of biritch, an older name of the game of unknown Middle Eastern origin; the oldest known rule book, from 1886, calls it &quot;Biritch, or Russian Whist&quot;. The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge (OED)&lt;ref&gt;The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge, 6th Edition, American Contract Bridge League (Memphis, USA), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; reports speculation that the word may come from a Turkish term bir-üç, or &quot;one-three&quot;, supposedly referring to the one exposed and three concealed hands.) This game, known today by the retronyms bridge-whist and straight bridge, became popular in the United States and the UK in the 1890s.

In 1904, the practice caught hold of using an auction phase to determine which player would designate the trump suit and have the privilege of playing with his partner's hand exposed. This variation was known as auction bridge.

The modern game of contract bridge was the result of innovations to auction bridge made by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt and others. Vanderbilt wrote down his rules in 1925, and within a few years contract bridge had become the dominant form of the game. It has supplanted all other forms of the game, including auction bridge, so that &quot;bridge&quot; is now synonymous with &quot;contract bridge&quot;.

The basic form of contract bridge retains from its predecessor games, all the way back to whist, the fact that four players compete, two against two, until one side has won two games. The resulting unit is called a rubber and hence this form of play is commonly known by the retronym &quot;rubber bridge&quot;. For those who dislike its indefinite duration, there is also a variant called four-deal bridge or Chicago.

In duplicate bridge, on the other hand, eight or more players compete at a time (most often in pairs, sometimes in teams of four or as individuals), normally playing a pre-set number of deals. In duplicate, the same deals are played more than once, and players win by outscoring their competitors with the same cards. This is implemented by placing the played cards in a container with four compartments, called a board, and passing it on to the next table. Computer-dealt hands may be used, allowing the same deal to be played at many tables, even at multiple locations.

While there is no reliable data on the number of people who play rubber bridge at home, it is generally accepted that most serious players play duplicate. It is the only form of the game at bridge tournaments and the usual form at bridge clubs. In recent years, duplicate bridge on the Internet has also become significant. Individuals can join a game from their home (or workplace!) and need not even be in the same country as their partner or opponents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Contract bridge, usually known simply as Bridge, is a trick-taking card game for four players who form two partnerships, or &quot;sides&quot;. The partners on each side sit opposite one another. Game play is in two phases: bidding and playing.

== Dealing ==

The game is played with one complete deck of 52 cards; one player is the dealer.

In rubber bridge, after the shuffle, the dealer hands out all the cards clockwise one at a time, starting with his left-hand opponent and ending with himself. At the same time, for convenience, the dealer's partner is usually shuffling a second deck, ready for use on the following deal. The deal rotates clockwise, so the dealer's left-hand opponent will deal next.

In duplicate, one player is designated as &quot;dealer&quot; on each particular board, but this is only for purposes of the auction and does not affect the actual dealing. The cards may be manually shuffled and dealt as in rubber bridge, but by any player; if this is done, it happens only once at the start of a session or match. Where computer-dealt hands are used, dealing machines (which may read either the standard markings, or bar codes added to each card) may be used to assemble the hands ready to be placed in the boards. It is also common for the movement to be arranged so that none of the players play all the boards; then at the start of play, each one may be given to players who will not play it, together with a printed record of the deal, and they assemble the hands.

== The auction ==

The dealer makes the first call, and the bidding continues clockwise until three players in rotation have passed after any call. A call is any bid, a pass, a double or a redouble. (However, the word &quot;bid&quot; is often used informally in place of &quot;call&quot;.)

When a player has the turn to bid, he may do any one of the following:

# Make a new bid,
# Pass,
# Double if the last preceding bid was made by the opponents, or
#   Redouble a bid that has been doubled by the opponent.

A bid must include a number of odd tricks (from one to seven) and a denomination. Odd tricks are the tricks that a partnership proposes to take in excess of six (known as book). A denomination is any suit or notrump specified in a bid.

Each bid must supersede the last preceding bid by naming a greater number of tricks in any denomination, or by naming the same number of tricks in a higher ranking denomination. The rank of the denominations in descending order is notrump, spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs.

The auction ends when there have been three passes following a bid (or double or redouble). The last bid becomes the contract. The player in the partnership that made this final bid who first bid the denomination of that bid (suit or notrump) will be the declarer.

When, in a deal, all four players have passed without there being a bid, the deal is scored as a zero and the cards are passed on to the next dealer.

== The play of the hand ==

The player from the pair that won the bidding (that is, the pair that is going to play the contract), who was the first to make a bid in the suit of the final contract (who is thus either the player bidding the final contract or his partner), is called the declarer. His partner is called the dummy.

Play to the first trick starts with the player to the left of the declarer. After the first card has been played, the dummy lays his cards open on the table. These cards are from then on played by the declarer, who tells the dummy which card is to be played whenever it is the dummy's turn to play on a trick.

Apart from this, the play is just like other trick-taking games - the player who took the previous trick leads to the next one (if the declarer took the trick in dummy, he has to play from dummy on the next trick, if he took the trick in his own hand, he has to play from his own hand). Whether there is a trump suit, and if so, which suit it is, has been decided during bidding.

During the play, each player must follow suit--that is, play the same suit as that led. If a player cannot follow suit (has no more cards of the suit led), he may discard a card of another suit, or, in a suit contract, play a trump. Trumping is optional. Failure to follow suit can result in penalties for a 'revoke.' The player who contributes the highest card from the lead suit wins, except that if any player plays a trump, the highest trump card wins.

== Duplicate Bridge ==

Like all other card games, the score in bridge depends on one's cards. To diminish this effect, and increase the element of skill, in clubs and tournaments one's score is not looked at on its own, but compared to that of others who played the same deals. There are two major systems: Pairs and teams games.

With Pairs games, two person teams (pairs) compete.  Depending on the rotation, the pairs may be grouped as 'North/South' and 'East/West' or may rotate between north/south and east/west seating. In each case, a team receives a point for each team they beat and half a point for each team they tie.  At the end of the session, points are added and the team with the highest point total is the winning team. Only half the teams (or less) will play any particular hand (the other half will play the opposing hands in the four-hand deal).

With team games, four-person teams divide into pairs.  A 'North/South' pair plays the 'East/West' pairs from the other team(s). The 'East/West' pair plays the 'North/South' pair of the opposing team(s). At the end of team play, teams compare their overall scores.

== Scoring - Rubber Bridge ==

In friendly play, one generally plays rubber bridge. In rubber bridge, extra points are scored for winning a rubber, which means getting to a game (100 points) twice. There are two types of points: Points below the line and points above the line. Only points below the line count towards a game.

===Score for making ===

If the declarer makes his contract, the number bid, multiplied by a suit-dependent multiplier, is scored below the line. Any overtricks, again multiplied by the suit-dependent multiplier, are scored above the line.

The multiplier is 20 for clubs and diamond (the minor suits), and 30 for hearts and spades (the major suits). For No Trump, the multiplier is also 30, but with an added 10 points below the line for the first trick (made) only.

==== Examples: ====

*  bid: 2 clubs, made 9 tricks: 40 (2×20) points below, 20 (1×20) above the line.
* bid: 4 hearts, made 10 tricks: 120 (4×30) points below, 0 (0×30) above the line.
*  bid: 4 no trump, made 11 tricks: 130 (4×30+10) points below, 30 (1×30) above the line.

=== Game and rubber ===

If the score of a partnership below the line equals or exceeds 100 points (either at once or taken together with what already was below the line), the partnership is said to have scored a game, and all scores below the line are turned into scores above the line. Thus making game takes five tricks in a minor suit, four in a major suit, or three in No Trump (or some combination of partial scores).

The first partnership that wins two games wins the rubber. They score a 700 point bonus if they won in two games, or 500 points if their opponents also made a game.

=== Vulnerability and slam bonus ===

A partnership that has already made a game is called vulnerable, which is of importance for the slam bonus and for the downtricks.

If a player bids and makes a contract of 6 in something (i.e. wins all but one trick), he is said to have made a small slam. This gives a bonus (above the line) of 500 points when not vulnerable, and 750 points when vulnerable. If a player bids and makes a contract of 7 in something (thus scoring all the tricks), he is said to have made a grand slam. This gives a bonus of 1000 points when not vulnerable, and 1500 points when vulnerable.

=== Undertricks===

If a pair fails to achieve their contract, they 'go down'. In such cases, their opponents score points above the line. If the pair is not vulnerable, their opponents get 50 points per undertrick, if it is vulnerable 100 points per undertrick.

===Doubled ===

If a pair is doubled, and makes their contract, they get double points for all tricks bid (below the line), while overtricks score extra - 100 points per overtrick if not vulnerable, 200 points if vulnerable (above the line). Furthermore, the pair gets 50 points bonus (above the line) 'for the insult'. All these values are doubled again if the contract was redoubled. The slam bonuses are not influenced by a double, nor are the rubber bonuses - although the latter are of course influenced by the fact that there are more scores below the line, and thus games are reached faster.

If a pair is doubled and goes down, the penalty (points to the other pair) are as follows:
* If the pair is not vulnerable, 100 for the first downtrick, 200 for the second and third, and 300 for each subsequent downtrick.
* If the pair is vulnerable, 200 for the first downtrick, and 300 for each following one.

These scores are also doubled again if the contract was redoubled.

=== Footnote - Recent scoring changes===

If you read old Bridge books, you may notice some differences in the scoring rules.

The undertrick penalty when doubled, not vulnerable, used to be 100 for the first undertrick and 200 for each subsequent. This was changed because it was too easy to sacrifice against a grand slam. A vulnerable grand slam is worth 1500 (slam bonus) + 500 (game bonus) + 210 (major suit trick score) = 2210. Down 11, doubled not vulnerable, used to be 2100, a profitable sacrifice.

Also, the &quot;insult bonus&quot; for making a redoubled contract used to be only 50. This was changed to 100, so that playing 5 of a minor, redoubled, making an overtrick, is always worth more than an undoubled small slam.

===Scoring - Duplicate Bridge===

In duplicate bridge, which is what is normally played in a club or tournament, each hand is scored by itself, and not as part of a rubber. This changes (and simplifies) the scoring as described above.

In duplicate bridge, if the required number of tricks for the contract has been made, the pair gets a number of points for the tricks bid and the overtricks as described above (20 per trick above the book of six tricks in clubs/diamonds, 30 per trick in hearts/spades, 30 per trick plus 10 bonus in No Trump, possibly doubled or redoubled). If the number actually bid is enough to score 100 points or more, a game has been made, which scores 300 when not vulnerable and 500 when vulnerable. If it is lower, the score is not carried over to the next hand, but there is a 'part score' bonus of 50 points.

The bonus for slam, the bonus 'for the insult' and the scores for downtricks and doubled overtricks are the same as described above.

In duplicate bridge, in every series of four deals, the vulnerabilities of 'all vulnerable', 'none vulnerable', 'vulnerable against not vulnerable' and 'not vulnerable against vulnerable' will all occur once, in a predetermined order.

*Bidding boxes and bidding screens

*Bidding box

In tournaments, &quot;bidding boxes&quot; are frequently used. A bidding box is a box of cards, each bearing the name of one of the legal calls in bridge. A player wishing to make a call displays the appropriate card from the box, rather than making a verbal declaration. This prevents unauthorized information from being conveyed via voice inflection. In top national and international events, &quot;bidding screens&quot; are used. These are diagonal screens which are placed across the table, preventing a player from seeing his partner during the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before resorting to any specific technique, it is recommended to decide on a bidding system that will be used by the partnership.

Bidding systems and conventions

A pair is allowed to try to pass information about their hands, but this is restricted in two ways:

* Information may only be passed by the calls made and later by the cards played, and not by any other means.
* All information passed must be available to the opponents. At a minimum, a player must fully explain a call or play made by her partner upon being asked by an opponent. In club and tournament play, additional disclosure mechanisms including partnership convention cards and the alert procedure usually must be used.

Thus, one may have all kinds of meanings for bids, as long as they are told to the opponents. However, the meanings that one can have for various bids are sometimes restricted at tournaments.

The meaning of the various bids in a partnership are called that partnership's bidding system. A number of different bidding systems exist, such as Goren, Acol, Standard American, and Precision Club. Many experts today use a system called Two Over One (2/1).

Bids, Doubles, Redoubles, and even Passes can be either natural or conventional.

A natural suit bid is one that implies some length in the suit bid. For example, an opening bid of one spade, showing at least 5 cards in spades (and nothing about any other suit lengths), would be natural.

A conventional suit bid provides information unrelated to the suit named. For example, an opening bid of one club, showing 16 or more points, but saying nothing about how many clubs are held, would be conventional.

A natural notrump bid is one that implies a balanced distribution of cards among all suits (no particularly long suit, although many experts will bid no trump with up to five cards in one suit as long as the bidder has no singletons or voids and at most one doubleton) and a certain number of points as agreed upon by the partnership.

A conventional notrump bid says none of these things. The most common examples of conventional notrump bids are the Unusual notrump (showing length in 2 unbid suits) and the Blackwood convention.

A natural double (also called penalty) is one that implies an intent to defend and defeat the current contract.

A conventional double is one that conveys some other meaning. The most common example of a conventional double is the Takeout double of a low-level bid, implying support for the unbid suits and asking partner to choose one of them.

There are many conventions. Some of the most famous are Stayman, Jacoby transfers and Blackwood.

== [[/Hand Evaluation/]] ==

The decision as to how high and what suit to bid is fundamental to the game, but broadly it will depend on how highly one values one's hand. There are a number of techniques used for this. The most basic is the Milton Work point count. This can be augmented by other guidelines such as losing trick count, law of total tricks or Zar Points (http://public.aci.on.ca/~zpetkov/TheAnnotation.html).

== Bidding Systems ==

Each bidding system can be either very detailed or very basic. Here are three common bidding systems. Until such time as you can find adequate description of these systems here, just search for the names. There are descriptions of these systems elsewhere on the web.

# Standard American (see also 2/1 variation)
#:5 card majors, strong 1NT, min. 3 card minors, Stayman, Blackwood, take-out doubles     
# Acol (popular in the UK)
#:4 card majors
# Precision or Strong Club
#:1st bid shows points, not suit. (1C=16-20pts; 1D=11-15pts)

On choosing and applying a bidding system.

If you look up Richard Pavlicek, you will see that the guy invented a bidding system No, actually he invented four bidding systems. On wait, he actually invented four flavors of one bidding system.

Suppose you and your partner decide the Richard Pavilcek's system is the best system in the world, and you want to play it. Which flavor should you choose? 

Even if you do choose a flavor, you will run into several kind of mishaps:
# Forgetting the conventions you are actually playing.
# Bidding more or less according to the system, and bidding bad contracts (bad contracts are the ones that are below average in any competitive bridge hand)
# You think that you partner, or you opponent play more often than you.

These three problems will arise no matter what bidding system you and your partner choose, unless you understand bidding in a deeper way, and not just by rote learning.

In order to properly understand bidding you have to first understand, really fully understand the play of the hand, both on the defender and on the declarer side.

From now on, I shall assume that you do.

You take any bridge hand, and play it double dummy. You play it in several contracts: for example {{cards|6s}} by NS, three notrump by EW/ After you play the hand several time you will realize, that playing double dummy, with competent play by declarer and defenders, some contracts can be made, and other cannot be.

Of all the NS contracts possible to make, one will get the NS partnership most points, let's suppose that this is 3H by north. The same goes for EW, let's suppose that their optimal contract is 3S. the proper result for this hand is {{cards|3s}} by EW.

That means that any good bidding system should lead EW to {{cards|3s}}, or a better result. Ho do we accomplish this? that takes some doing, but for now, just make sure you get yo the proper results, if you do not, ask yourself why not.

Techniques in the play of the hand

Terence Reese, a prolific author of bridge books, points out that there are only four ways of taking a trick, and two of these are very easy

* playing a high card that no one else can beat
* trumping an opponent's high card
* establishing long cards (the last cards in a suit will take tricks if the opponents don't have the suit and are unable to trump)
* playing for the opponents' high cards to be in a particular position (if their ace is in front of your king, your king may take a trick)

All trick-taking techniques in bridge can be reduced to one of these four methods.

The optimum play of the cards can require much thought and experience, and is too complicated to describe in a short article. However, some basic ideas of probability may be considered:

Some of the most important probabilities have to do with the position of high cards.

* The probability that a given opponent holds one particular card, e.g. the king: 50%
* The probability that a given opponent holds two particular cards, e.g. the king and the queen: approximately 25%
* The probability that a given opponent holds at least one of two particular cards, e.g. the king or the queen: approximately 75%

When developing long cards, it is important to know the likelihood that the opponents' cards in the suit are evenly divided between them. Generally speaking, if they hold an even number of cards, they are unlikely to be exactly divided; if the opponents have an odd number in the suit, the cards will probably be divided as evenly as possible. For example, if declarer and dummy have eight trumps between them, the opponents' trumps are probably (68% chance) divided 3-2 (one opponent with three trumps, the other with two) and trumps can be drawn in three rounds. If declarer is trying to play with a seven card trump suit, it is more likely that the outstanding trumps are divided 4-2 (48%) than that the cards are evenly divided 3-3 between the opponents (36%).

=== Basic techniques by declarer ===

When new to the game, a player should be familiar with these strategies for playing the hand:

* trumping
* crossruff
* establishing long suits
* finesse
* General suit management
* holdup (mostly at NT contracts)
* managing entries
* when to draw trumps

==== Drawing trumps ====
When playing as declarer in a trump contract, you should hopefully have chosen a trump suit in which you have the majority of the trumps&amp;mdash;ideally 8 or more trumps between your two hands. Even so, your opponents will have at least some trumps between them, and they can disrupt your contract by ruffing cards you were hoping to win. It's therefore often wise to lead trumps for a few rounds early in the hand. Since your opponents are forced to follow suit, you can exhaust them of trumps and play the rest of the hand safe from being ruffed. This is called ''drawing trumps''.

Drawing trumps prevents you from losing otherwise winning cards that get ruffed by your opponents, but it also exhausts your own trumps, which means you can't use them for ruffing. The key question is to look at the length of the trump suits in your two hands: you can generally reckon to score one trick for each trump in the hand with the longer trump suit (minus any missing trump honors). However, if you draw trumps then the trumps in the hand with the shorter trump suit don't score, since they have to be used to follow the led suit. If instead you lead a card from one hand in which the other is void, you can use the short trump suit for ruffing, gaining extra tricks.

In general you will want to draw trumps as soon as you can, unless you can see a specific reason not to. Good reasons to delay drawing trumps are:

* You need to score extra trump tricks by using the trumps in the hand with the shorter trump suit to ruff.
* You need to use trumps to provide extra entries to one of the hands (usually dummy)
* You need to discard losing cards quickly.

==== Setting up a long suit ====
{{Sectstub}}

==== The finesse ====
If you have all the top cards in a suit, you can make them score however you play them (provided your opponents are unable to ruff). If you hold the Ace and Queen and your opponents have the King, it may seem like you can't make two tricks with them. However, if you lead correctly you can score with the queen 50% of the time.

Suppose you are declarer (South) and dummy (North) has {{hearts|AQ}}. If you play the ace then the queen, the opponent holding the king will take the trick (unless the king is singleton). On the other hand, if you lead a low heart from your hand (South), then you may be able to win the queen. Suppose West holds the king. If West plays the king on your low heart, you play the ace and the queen is a guaranteed winner in the next round. If West doesn't play the king, you play the queen and win it. Of course, if the king lies with East then things won't work out so well. You'll play the queen and lose.

This is the basic concept of a ''finesse''. Note that whether the finesse works depends entirely on which hand holds the missing card. Once you play for the finesse, there's nothing your opponents can do about it if West holds the king, and nothing you can do to win if East holds the king.

How do you know whether to play a finesse? Occasionally there will be a clue in the bidding (say East has already shown he has ace and king in another suit, but his bidding rules out him having 10 points or more). More often though, it's a straight 50% gamble.

Even if you can't tell whether a finesse is going to win you a trick, it often pays to consider how bad the situation will be if the finesse doesn't work out and you lose the lead. Often there is one defender that represents more of a threat than the other, perhaps because they have a suit with lots of winners that the other opponent is void in and can't lead. A finesse into the &quot;safe&quot; hand will lose at most a single trick, while a finesse into the &quot;danger&quot; hand might lose three or four.

==== The hold up ====
Suppose your opponents hold strength in a particular suit and you're worried that they can make enough tricks in that suit to defeat your contract. In such a situation, it's often to your advantage to deliberately lose one or two tricks in the suit before you play a winner. Hopefully this means that one defender will have no more cards in this suit, so if they get the lead later on they can't make any tricks: though their partner has winners, they can't lead to them.

Suppose spades are trumps, and you have the following hearts:
{|
|
|{{Hearts|T87}}
|
|-
|{{Hearts|92}}
|
|{{Hearts|KQ3}}
|-
|
|{{Hearts|AJ654}}
|
|}

West leads the {{Hearts|9}} (top of a doubleton), East playing the Queen. You win with your Ace. If West regains the lead before you've drawn all the trumps (for example, by playing the {{Spades|A}}), West will be able to play the {{Hearts|2}} to East's King. East can then return the {{Hearts|3}} for West to ruff. Two heart tricks have been lost.

If instead of playing the Ace on the first round you duck, East will return a {{Hearts|K}} that you can win. It doesn't matter if West later gains the lead, since the third round of hearts can only be ruffed if it is led by East.

=== Advanced techniques by declarer ===

Someone who plays regularly in tournaments should be familiar with these concepts:

* counting the hand (tracking the distibution of suits and high cards in the opponents' hands using inferences from the bidding and play)
* coups and elimination
* duck
* dummy reversal
* endplay
* safety play
* squeezes

== Techniques as defender ==

=== Basic techniques by defenders ===

* opening lead
* when to lead trump
* suit management
* discarding

=== Advanced techniques by defenders ===

* avoiding an endplay or squeeze
* counting the hand (tracking the distibution of suits and high cards in the unseen hands using inferences from the bidding and play)
* opening lead - using information from auction
* signaling
* uppercut

The best explanation for various bridge playing techniques, is to first explain a playing technique, as used by the declareer, and then explaining a defender technique used to thwart that particular declarer technique.

The most basic technique is using long suits.

Suppose you are playing 3NT and you are holding the following two hands:

Dummy: {{BridgeHandInline|AKQxxx|xxx|xxx|A}}

Declarer: {{BridgeHandInline|Jx|KQJ|KQJ|xxxxx}}

West starts by cashing his heart and diamond aces. He now plays another heart, and you have to plan the play. You can immediately see two heart tricks, and two diamond tricks, no matter what you chose to discard on west's two aces (you probably discarded the two jacks, which is not always optimal, but that's deception, so we shall deal with it later, for this hand, it makes no difference.)

So, counting four tricks is good. you can also see another four in dummy, so that's almost the nine you need. Where are you going to get more tricks from?

Let's see. there are only thirteen spades, and you are holding eight of them. that means that you opponent are hoding only five. Chances are they are divided 3-2 between the two of them. but you can make you contract even if they are divided 4-1, providing that you play carefully enough. you should cash all your hearts and diamonds from the declarer hnd, than cash the spade jack, which would hold the trick. You then play a small spade to the AKQxx  left in dummy. You play the high cards first, and unless you are very unfortunate, the low spades will take tricks too. the opponents will have no spades left by that stage. Oh, don't forget to take the club ace too. You will end up with two overtricks.

&quot;breaking outside of deeply nested loops can be done without the use of the goto statement.&quot;
How can this be done without using goto? Did you mean changing the conditions in the outer loops to see if we've used a break in an inner loop?

No, it's simpler than that.

The 'continue' keyword can be used to jump to the top of the loop. The 'break' keyword will jump to the first executable statement after the loop. Both keywords can only modify the thread of control in the current loop, that is, a 'break' inside loop A, nested in another loop B will only move control to B, the outer loop.

A more obscure (opaque?) technique uses the setjump/longjump keyword pair, but setjump/longjump is normally way scary.

:Yeah, so, you ''can't do it''. Don't be so afraid of goto. Linux 2.6.11.11 uses it 29751 times in 4693521 lines of code. (the *.c files, not *.h files) That's 1 out of every 156 lines or 0.6338 percent, and I'm not excluding comments or blank lines. If I look only at lines containing a '''{''' or ''';''' character, I find that 1 out of every 67 lines have a goto, which is 1.48 percent. The reason is error handling with proper clean-up, freeing memory allocations and releasing locks without massive overhead and/or unnessesary state variables. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:45, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

==goto==
Here you can see the relative popularity of various control keywords in the Linux 2.6.11.11 kernel. Remember that this represents a large number of contributers producing a highly-regarded piece of software that people are betting their businesses on.

 KEYWORD COUNT PERCENT
 do       2679  0.6728
 switch  11314  2.8414
 while   12358  3.1036
 for     27180  6.8259
 goto    29107  7.3099
 else    35416  8.8943
 if     280134 70.3522

Yes folks, the goto is second only to '''if''' and '''else'''. Your professor lied.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:15, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

:As seen in the Linux kernel, '''goto''' is a rather popular mechanism for primitive exception handling. So much so that if state machines merit a mention then this should, too. Of course being that the main wikipedia has a NPOV policy, perhaps this wikibook should follow something similar, i.e. neutrality to what constitutes a good indent style, '''goto''' policy and so forth?

==getchar==
Edited the While section of this page because getchar() reads the next character from stdin, not necessarily the next character from the keyboard. On most systems stdin is populated only when the Enter key is pressed, so multiple prompts appear (getchar() gets called more than once for each input).

== TRUE and FALSE ==

C does '''''not''''' define these. Because truth is not represented by any one single value, it is considered very bad style to define these. People sometimes do of course, leading to all sorts of horrid bugs. When I'm faced with fixing up C code that defines these, my immediate thought is that the code will be riddled with bugs because the author did not accept the C way of doing things. The C way might be gross by modern tastes, but you're far better off just learning to accept it. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:49, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== interesting bit of code ==

I'm not sure how to write about this for a beginner, but some mention should be made:

 // this example assumes a 32-bit size_t
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
 
   long long t = (argc) ? -1 : sizeof argv;
 
   long long i;
   if(argc) i = -1;
   else     i = sizeof argv;
 
   return printf(&quot;t:%llx i:%llx\n&quot;,t,i);
 }

I get this:

 t:ffffffff i:ffffffffffffffff

This has to do with type promotion. The tertiary operator version is definitely not an exact substitute for the if...else version.

Perhaps just say &quot;mixing signed and unsigned can be bad, and remember that sizeof returns a size_t&quot;?

C programme to find the area of the Triangle:
---------------------------------------------

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main (void)
{
float Base,Height,Area;
printf(&quot;Base:&quot;);
scanf(&quot;%Base'\&quot;);
printf(&quot;Height:&quot;);

== Example at end of page ==

What is the example at the end of the page in aid of?
It seems it should be demonstrating use of goto;
or at least the topic of the chapter.
However, I fail to see its relevance. I suggest it be deleted.

=== Encyclopedia of poker variants? ===
At the moment this book seems to be a combination of a strategy guide with a compendium of different (and often extremely rare) variants of poker. This feels to me like two books, or perhaps one book with the description of rare variants belonging in another wiki. Does anyone else have a view on this? Personally, I think a strategy guide to poker where variants are documented only to illuminate discussions within the text seems like a coherent book.

== usage ==

We should have a fool proof detailed usage chapter for each tool and a detailed shaving description for each part of the body. Separate (sub)chapters for non-unisex parts. Pick your favourite and write.

== Name of the book ==

It was suggested on the talk page of the Finnish version that the books should be moved under name &quot;Removal of bodyhair&quot; or alike, because e.g. waxing is not shaving. I don't know, if this is the case for the English words. Give your comments on this anyway. --[[User:Easyas12c|Easyas12c]] 10:51, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
:I agree the precise definition of shaving is the removal of hair by use of a ''razor'' as opposed to ''waxing'' or laser or plucking.  '''Depilation''' refers to the removal of hair and would include all forms of hair removal.  --[[User:Psychofarm|Psychofarm]] 23:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
::Good ideas here. Perhaps the name of the book could also be something like ''Hairless skin how-to'' – to avoid using unfamiliar words and on the other hand long dull names. [[User:Dilaudid|Dilaudid]] 10:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== Usage of shaving cream ==

According to an article I read once, using shaving cream in the genitial area causes it's PH value to be disturbed. This is because the PH in this area differs to the rest of the body. You also shouldn't wash this area with soap. I don't know what you should use to shave there though. I use a lot of water.

==Chemical Removal?==

Should there be a section discussing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_depilatory[Depilation Creams]] and other forms of chemical hair removal?[[User:129.64.200.43|129.64.200.43]] 18:14, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:I think the scope of the book should definitely be extended to cover all forms of depilation – from temporary to permanent. [[User:Dilaudid|Dilaudid]] 10:35, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== Organization ==

It seems to me that the subsections could do with more &quot;superheadings&quot;: for example, all the different types of razors could be grouped together under &quot;Razors&quot;. Dropping the heading level of all the razors, though, seems unacceptable. Perhaps someone more Wikibooks (or just plain Wiki) experienced than I could consider popping the section headings out to their own pages as chapters, and creating appropriate sections (Razors, Lather-producers, Other for Equipment, for example)? [[User:Jay W.|Jay W.]] 10:24, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== transwiki ==

You may be able to use [[Transwiki:About hair growth and silkyness]].

== Splitting the Book or Expanding its Scope ==

I see merits in either splitting off the non-shaving material or changing the title. &quot;Removal of Body Hair&quot; does not work for me; I think most American speakers of English would not consider facial hair to be body hair. &quot;Hair Removal&quot; works better, IMO, and shaving is a kind of hair removal, but I am not sure that shaving would immediately come to my mind if I saw that title.

If the scope is expanded to include epilation, etc., should it also include haircutting (with the title &quot;Hair Removal and Trimming&quot;? That seems like a logical part of the broader topic, but it differs from the rest in that there is no direct contact between the cutting agent and the skin, hair follicles, etc. [[User:Peter Chastain|Peter Chastain]] ([[User talk:Peter Chastain|talk]]) 22:47, 6 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Chapter 1: Combating Viruses=
In this chapter you will get a good understanding about computer viruses including what they are, how they are written, what do they do, and how to fight back.

==What is a computer virus?==
A computer virus is a program which mutates/infects other trusted programs.  Usually, this is done to ensure the virus is run when the trusted program is run, and it is one of the earliest ways viruses hid themselves.  A computer virus usually consists of 2 main modules: an infector, and a payload.  For a program to be considered a virus, only the first module need be present.  The payload can be null; even then the program would be considered a virus. This, in effect, means a program may be doing no harm, but the fact that it is attaching itself to trusted programs makes it a virus.  Just as with a biological virus, the ability to replicate itself is the most important aspect of the survival of a computer virus.  As such, most computer viruses today have a payload module that, at the very least, tries to spread itself.

Say there's a program which deletes all the files when run, the simple action you would take to get rid of it is do a search and delete all copies of it from your disk.

But a real computer virus works a little differently, it has got first the &quot;Spread&quot; stage, in which it infects other trusted programs by adding copies of its Replication module (so that these in turn can affect others) and Payload module. During this time, Payload module will not do anything but stay silent. Only when this &quot;spread&quot; stage is over by meeting &quot;Virii Coders&quot; criteria, like &quot;Have we infected 10,000 files?&quot;, if yes, then its showtime. So when it's in showtime stage, it would have already infected all your favourite programs like Notepad, media player etc. Well, you know when a person is bitten by Dracula you see teeth marks on his/her neck, but there's no such easy identification way here. One needs to study the virus to come with such identification mechanisms known as Virus' Digital Signature, which is nothing but a byte patter that helps Anti-Virus programs identify it.

By the way, existence of FIRST virus program was demonstrated by Fred Cohen in 1983.

==How is a computer virus written?==
So for all of you who think that a program which deletes all the files when run is a VIRUS, think again. Here's a tiny-winy C program which can delete all the files on a computer, and I repeat: this program cannot be considered a VIRUS. Compile it and when you get the .exe extension, scan it many times with any of the Anti-Virus programs you have, be it Norton, McAfee or any other, they just won't report it as a VIRUS. Do you know why? Because it's not a virus, that's why.

&lt;pre&gt;
//Source code for program which deletes all the files when run and is not a virus, but a trojan.
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;process.h&gt;
int main() { system(&quot;del *.*&quot;); return 0 ;}
//Source code ends
&lt;/pre&gt;
Writing a real virus takes effort 100 times more than that. One needs to understand the machine and a lot about the targeted Operating System. So will you ever be able to write a virus or understand its working to save the universe? The answer is YES, if you spend at least 12+ hours a day on computer doing some hardcore programming and reading about your machine, like Intel manuals, etc.

You might on the other hand find some virus source code floating around somewhere, but you will never be able to understand it or innovate upon it until the answer to above question is YES.

==Fighting Back==

===What is an anti-Virus?===
An anti-virus is a program specifically written to examine all the programs installed on your computer looking for the known malicious programs (viruses).  The anti-virus software is no longer effective after approximately 30 days unless you download the updates, therefore the new updates tell the program about newly found viruses since the last update.

===Do I need an anti-virus?===
This largely depends on your operating system.  If you are running Windows, then it's probably not a bad idea. That said, it is possible to stay safe without installing anti-virus software if you are careful (this means not going to porn sites, avoiding illegal downloads, etc. etc.) about your online activities.

If you're using a Unix or Unix-like OS (such as Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, and so fourth) then viruses are not a substantial threat to you. Malware does exist on these platforms, and has done for quite some time, however due to the design of these operating systems, as well as the culture of their userbases, malware does not pose a threat to users of these systems. You'll be fine just so long as you don't do anything foolish whilst logged in as root.

===Where can I get an anti-virus program, and how much will it cost me?===
There are many options out there for users looking for Anti-Virus programs, both paid and free services.  Some of the major brands for Anti-Virus are [[w:McAfee VirusScan|McAfee]], [[w:Norton AntiVirus|Norton/Symantec]], and [[w:aspersky Anti-Virus|Kaspersky]]; several companies offer security suites, such as [[w:Zone Alarm|Zone Alarm]], McAfee, and Norton, which offer Antivirus, Firewall, and Anti-Spyware programs in a single bundle.  Many of these products have free trials available, but will require you to subscribe to their update service. Free (for personal users) products exist, like AVG Free edition and Avast! Home; there is also the open source ClamAV.  There is a port of ClamAV on Windows known as ClamWin.  Microsoft Windows users can also use web-based free security scan services, like the one available at safety.live.com.

===What are signature files?  Is it important to update my software?===
It is very important to update anti-virus software.  Every day, new viruses are released, putting your computer at risk.  As a result, it is very important to update your product.  The most important aspect of updating your  anti-virus software is updating signature files.  Every virus contains a unique signature, a string generated based on the contents of its files (after all, a virus is just a program on your computer).  When scanning, an anti-virus program will check the signatures of scanned files to see if they match any of the virus signatures. Signature files are provided by the anti-virus companies.

A [[w:Daemon_(computer_software)|daemon]] is an application that runs in the background, as opposed to being directly operated by the user. Examples of daemons are [[w:Cron|Cron]] and [[MySQL]].

Daemonizing a process with PHP is very easy, and requires PHP 4.1 or higher compiled with ''--enable-pcntl''.

== Building a Daemon ==

We'll start with ''set_time_limit(0)'' to let our script run indefinitely. Next, we fork the PHP process with ''pcntl_fork()''. Finally, we use ''posix_setsid()'' to tell the child process to run in the background as a session leader.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?
   set_time_limit(0);   // Remove time limit 
 
   if (pcntl_fork()) {  // Fork process
     print &quot;Daemon running.&quot;;
   } else {
     $sid = posix_setsid(); // Make child process session leader
       
     if ($sid &lt; 0)
            exit;
 
     while (true) {
                        // Daemon script goes here
     }
   }
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The code inside the ''while'' statement will run in the background until ''exit'' or ''die'' is explicitly called.

== Applications ==

While daemonizing a script can be useful, it is not appropiate for every script. If a script only needs to be executed at a certain time, it can take advantage of [[w:Cron|Cron]] for scheduled execution.

== Umm.... ==

Well, sorry to break up the process a bit but a few of these articles just simply needed to be re-written. I have done that and am in the process of placeing them. Please understand that the articles where neither
1) Age-apropriate
or
2) Well written (i.e. not consice, clear, well flowing)

But a lot of the original writing is intact

Please understand that this article was still under construction when it was nominated for proofreading and was not ready for this step. This has been fixed and the organization is complete. Thank You!!

-[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 20:40 (UTC) October 31, 2005

I think you have done this in precisely the right order.  You did the reorganization and rewriting and the reorganization phase and are now working on fact-checking.  I think the article had reached the point when I nominated it for proofreading where it did not need any more material added.  It did need reorganization after several hands had touched it.  I think you are making good progress, though certain portions are still a little awkward.  And, of course, the language will have to be brought down to grade level.  It will probably get more concise in that step, as well, because redundancy causes run-on sentences and higher grade-level scores (and lower readability scores).

As for the fact-checking, please follow the fact-checking guidelines referenced in the proofreading plan and put in citations for each fact you check.  This will make it easier for everyone who needs to review the work later, when we finally gather the whole thing up and print it.

As always, if you have suggestions for ways to improve the whole proofreading process, please make them.

Thanks

== Having started some copyediting... ==

Hello. Having come to take up [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]]'s plea for help, I've begun some copyediting, but, as the comments I've hidden in the text indicate, I'm wondering whether some concepts such as orbits and gravity need to be cross-referenced and/or mentioned. Please advise.

Thanks, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 06:14, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

== SOHO and the number of comets ==

I think this section is very misleading and gets the wrong point across.  SOHO wasn't even designed to explore and identify comets, but instead was strictly for solar observations.  That some comets were seen with this instrument is more a side effect that has its own group of hobbyists that monitor image updates from this probe with almost religious fervor.

There are only 160 comets that have been identified to have a regular orbit around the sun.  The original wording of this paragraph makes this clear, but the attempt to simplify this paragraph has butchered the meaning so far that the meaning has changed significantly.  There are thousands, perhaps millions of comets going around the sun.  SOHO has detected over 1000, most of which either burned up by crashing into the sun or went on a hyperbolic orbit that caused them to leave the solar system entirely.  Those that orbit with a regular pattern are a part of the 160 mentioned earlier, not the 1000 that were seemingly identified by SOHO.

I've stayed out of this edit cycle because I feel that other similar manglings of the meanings of these sections have occured.  This is just close to an extreme.  I'm also having a tough time trying to simplify the wording I've used earlier, so I'm leaving that to others who want to do this work.  I know it isn't easy, and I'm also willing to &quot;wait and see&quot; what the results will be.  I am curious as well why the close-up of Hailey's Comet was removed from this module, although that is easy to add back in.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:17, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

== Seeing Comets In The Sky ==

I changed this section as well.  Some background material:

The last &quot;Great Comet&quot; was actually &quot;The Great January Comet&quot;, which appear about the same time that Hailey's Comet also appeared in the sky.  Because of the news media attention on Hailey's Comet, many people alive at that time thought they were seeing Hailey's Comet instead, including many people in the popular news media (they havn't changed much, have they?)  The most recent return of Hailey's Comet in 1986 was so disappointing in terms of what you could see from the Earth that most people weren't even aware that it came by.  Unless you were born a few years before 1911, you have never seen a Great Comet before except in photographs or paintings.

Edmund Hailey and even Kepler had the good fortunes of being around when several major Great Comets appeared in the sky, and formed the basis for some of the current scientific theories about the motion of the planets.  The story about how Hailey disovered that the comet named after him was a recurring comet is even more interesting.

The issue of the roughly one Great Comet every hundred years has nothing to do with orbits (except for Hailey's Comet that has a period of 76 years... it is getting dimmer however with every pass near the Sun and is no longer considered a Great Comet by this standard.)  There are thousands of chunks of ice (the core of a Comet) that are falling toward the Sun all of the time, and using a statistical average about one of these every century gets close enough to the sun to become a spectacular comet.  The Great January Comet was visible on Times Square in New York City, so stictly speaking you don't need a telescope to see one of these.

The 20th Century was pretty much devoid of Great Comets, and there are no current candidates for any future ones at the moment either.  In 1974 it was thought that Comet Kohoutek might become a Great Comet due to its very large orbit (period of about 13,000 years) and the fact that during the initial observations it appeared to be much brighter than other similar objects at the same distance.  As it came close to the Sun, however, it turned out to be a disappointment and was only visible through telescopes.  Its peak as a comet also happened when it was on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth, so it was very difficult to see as well because of how close to the sun it was visually.  This is not considered a Great Comet either, although it is an interesting one and does count as one of the 160 regular period comets that have been named and discovered.

On Great Comets, usually you can see both tails, dust and gas.  In fact, there have been some comets with even more than two tails.  One comet that Chinese astronomers recorded is thought to have four tails and the tails were visually shaped like a swastika in the sky.  It is thought this may have been the orgin of this symbol as well.  A good thing that didn't happen during the middle of WWII.

I need to go back to the public library where I got the book, but Carl Sagan's book titled &quot;Comets&quot; is an excellent reference book about this topic.  The ISBN number is listed at the top of this discussion page.  All of this information is explained in that book in much more detail.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:41, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== moles ==
clarkfreifeld: In the table of base units, I changed &quot;amount of substance&quot; to &quot;countable amount of substance&quot; for the definition of the ''mole'', so as to distinguish from mass, which, to me would be more aptly defined as &quot;amount of substance.&quot; I don't know if that's now more confusing and just getting ahead of the game.

:I actually think it adds too much detail. When discussing moles in the context of using them, I would suggest going into depth, making sure student's know that a mole is just a number (~6.022e23), just like a dozen (12) or a score (20) or a ream (500) is a number. A mole makes sense when counting 10^23 atoms. I think &quot;countable amount&quot; only confuses things for students who don't yet know what a mole is.

:On the other hand, mass is not an amount of substance. It is defined by two equations: Inertia (F=ma) and Gravity (F=m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/G/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). (As an aside, the fact that these two definitions of mass are equivalent to the precision people have been able to measure is actually quite astonishing, and the subject of ongoing research.) The fact that mass is often used to measure the amount of a substance is just an application of the nearly constant acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface.

:Thus, both grams and moles measure quantities that necessitate detailed discussion to understand completely. This is the first page of the first chapter of a student's first real physics class! I suggest leaving the definitions vague, and let student's inquiry guide them to the answers they are interested in for now. Otherwise, bring up detailed discussion of grams and moles when appropriate in the context of the text.

== &quot;Units&quot; versus &quot;Measurements and Units&quot; ==
I'd like to suggest a change to the general theme of this chapter. It currently does a good job teaching about units in an abstract sense. However, I feel it is also important to emphasize that all of science, and particularly the use of &quot;units&quot;, is based on measurement. I am new to this wiki, so I have not started editing this existing text. My inclination is to go so far as to change the chapter title to &quot;measurement and uhits.&quot; This change in emphasis would also facilitate adding more pictures to chapter (as suggested on the PGCE comments page) and encorporating laboratory into the class. In the U.S., where I live, it is easy to emphasize the need for measurement and emphasis of units in a very accessible way -- by focusing on length measurements. Have students measure their own heights in feet/inches and meters. Drive home the point that physics is not just a class full of mathematics -- word problems. It has to do with things you can touch and feel AND MEASURE. The math is only there to make the measurements meaningful and express the real world in the powerful language of numbers and relationships.

Awaiting feedback from the current contributors before I begin making changes to the existing curriculum. [[User:Zolot|Zolot]] ([[User talk:Zolot|talk]]) 05:07, 15 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Definition==

We have already encountered [[Real analysis/Series|series]]. A power series is a series of the form

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_n \in \mathbb{R} \  \forall n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can also be seen as a real valued function. One of the first questions we will attempt to answer in this section is for which values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convergent.

==Convergence==

We can use the root test here. We can see that

&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} {\left\vert a_n x^n \right\vert}^{1/n} = \vert x \vert \limsup_{n\to\infty} {\left\vert a_n \right\vert}^{1/n}=\vert x \vert R&lt;/math&gt;

from before, so we see that there is a radius &lt;math&gt;r = 1/R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; converges for &lt;math&gt;\vert x \vert &lt; r&lt;/math&gt; and diverges for &lt;math&gt;\vert x \vert &gt; r&lt;/math&gt;. This radius has a special significance in [[Complex analysis]], but we will not be concerned with that here.

==Differentiability==

We can see by the root test that if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1} x^n&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, as &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} \vert (n+1)a_{n+1} \vert^{1/n}=
\limsup_{n\to\infty} \vert a_{n} \vert^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (n+1)^{1/n}=1&lt;/math&gt;, so this power series has the same radius of convergence as the original power series. Intuitively, we would guess that this was the derivative of it, but that requires proof. We look at the newton quotient:

&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime} (x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x+h)^n - \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime} (x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x+h)^n - a_n x^n}{h}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime} (x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x^n + nhx^{n-1} +o(h^2) - x^n)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime} (x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty na_n x^n-1 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1} x^n&lt;/math&gt;

==Taylor Series==

One use of power series is to approximate functions. We can see that &lt;math&gt;f(0)=a_0&lt;/math&gt;, so if a power series &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a good approximation for &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a_0 = g(0)&lt;/math&gt;.

We can also see from [[#Differentiability|]] that we need &lt;math&gt;1.f^\prime (0)=a_1&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;2.f^{\prime\prime} (0)=a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and by induction that &lt;math&gt;n!.f^{(n)} (0)=a_n&lt;/math&gt;, so we define the Taylor series of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as 

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n&lt;/math&gt;

By translation, we can also approximate &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by 

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(t)}{n!} (x-t)^n&lt;/math&gt;

To do this, we of course require that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable an infinite number of times at o or t.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rules==
* There can be a maximum of 10 players in a hand of five card stud.
* Each player is dealt one card face down (the ''hole card'') and one card face up (an ''open card''.) The two players to the dealer's left act as ''big blind'' and ''small blind'', respectively. The big blind must place an ''ante'' equal to one betting division, while the small blind must place an ante equal to one-half of one betting division. Thus, in a $5/$10 game, the big blind must ante $5, and the small blind must ante $2.50.
**In a game involving a ''bring-in bet'', the player with the smallest initial open card (determined in descending order from Ace to Deuce, with the suits descending Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs) must place a bet equal to the ''big blind'', in order to sweeten the pot.
*Once the antes have been placed, betting continues in a similar fashion to other poker games. The player to the left of the big blind acts first. Each player has three options: he or she may ''fold'' his hand, forfeiting any stakes they have placed in the pot and their chance to win the hand; ''call'' the previous bet, matching the largest single bet placed in the pot thus far; or they may ''raise'' the previous bet, exceeding the largest bet by one betting division.
**'''Betting Example''': Five players, Alex, Ben, Chris, Donna, and Ellen sit clockwise around a table playing $5/$10 five card stud. Alex is the dealer, Ben is the big blind, and Chris is the small blind. (For the sake of our example, there is no bring-in bet.) Donna may fold her hand, ''call'' the big blind by placing $5 in the pot, or ''raise'' the pot by placing $10 in the pot. If Donna raises, Ellen must place $10 in the pot to call or $15 to raise. If Ellen also raises, Alex must place $15 in the pot to call, or $20 to raise. In ''limit games'', each betting round is capped at '''4''' times the betting division for that round. Thus, in this first round, the maximum raise is $20.
*Once betting for the first round has ended, with all players either calling or folding, a second open card is dealt, and a new betting round begins.
*Again, when betting for the second round has ended, a third open card is dealt. In the third betting round, the opening bet is doubled - in our $5/$10 game, a player must place $10 in the pot initially, and all raises will be in increments of $10 (with $40 being the maximum raise.)
*Finally, the fourth open card is dealt, and the hands are complete. A fourth betting round occurs (again with a doubled opening bet), and finally the hands are revealed, with the best hand taking the pot.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Hans-AC. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Hans-AC~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

**[http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/3d.html Meeting Minutes] January 2005 - &quot;Dr. Brad Prestidge updated the group on RTOG 0232. This randomized trial has had slow accrual to date. The projected monthly accrual was 25.3 cases per month and the average monthly accrual for the past six months was 6.8 cases per month. We discussed the possibility the credentialing process is an obstacle to registering patients on a trial. It was pointed out the number of institutions credentialed exceeds 50 and the RPC and ITC were working on methods to reduce the burden of the credentialing process. In addition, two more treatment-planning systems are now able to allow institutions to participate in a clinical trial (Rosses and RTek). There was a brief discussion about hormone therapy being allowed on the protocol and as it stands up to two months of hormone therapy is allowed prior to registration. Patients may receive six months of hormone therapy. Finally, it was agreed IMRT be allowed on this trial. For the purpose of this study central Quality Assurance of the IMRT is not allowed. Institutions have the option of either being credentialed using IMRT for any of the RTOG studies using the RPC Phantom or using the QARC Benchmark tool.&quot;
**[http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/3d.html Meeting Minutes] June 2004 - &quot;Dr. Prestige announced accrual remains slow on RTOG 0232 – the randomized study for brachytherapy plus external beam radiation therapy versus brachytherapy alone for early stage prostate cancer. He encouraged institutions to get credentialed for electronic data submission of permanent brachytherapy treatment plans. Dr. Michalski pointed out there was some interest from institutions in the UK to participate.&quot;

'''RTOG 02-15 ([[Radiation Oncology/Prostate|PROSTATE]])''' 
*''Title:'' Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction In Patients Treated With Neoadjuvant Androgen Suppression and Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Impact on Patient and Partner Quality of Life
*''Objectives:'' 
**(1) To determine if there is a difference in erectile function between men treated with sildenafil versus placebo after radiation therapy + antiandrogens for prostate cancer
**(2) To determine if there is a difference in overall sexual function and satisfaction between men treated with sildenafil versus placebo after radiation therapy + antiandrogens for prostate cancer
**(3) To determine if there is a difference in partner sexual satisfaction between the sildenafil versus placebo arms of this study
**(4) To determine if there is a difference in patient and partner marital adjustment between the sildenafil versus placebo arms of this study
**(5)To assess factors that may predict response to sildenafil therapy (for example: age, pretreatment sexual function, tobacco use, and comorbidities)
*''[http://www.rtog.org/members/protocols/0215/0215.pdf Protocol]:''
**''Arm 1:'' Sildenafil with dose escalation PRN from 50 to 100 mg/day PRN x 12 weeks --&gt; CROSSOVER @ 13 weeks --&gt; Placebo with similar “dose escalation” opportunity x 12 weeks
**''Arm 2:'' Placebo with similar “dose escalation” opportunity x 12 weeks --&gt; CROSSOVER @ 13 weeks --&gt; Sildenafil with dose escalation PRN from 50 to 100 mg/day PRN x 12 weeks
*''Eligibility:'' cT1-T4, M0
*''Enrollment Target:'' 332 patients
*''Activation:'' January 3, 2003
*''Conclusion:'' 
**PMID 21235716 -- '''Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial of treating erectile dysfunction with sildenafil after radiotherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy: results of RTOG 0215.''' (Watkins Bruner D, J Sex Med. 2011). &lt;U&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; This is the first controlled trial to suggest a positive sildenafil response for ED treatment in patients previously treated with RT/ADT, however, only a minority of patients responded to treatment. ADT duration may be associated with response and requires further study. The overall low response rate suggests the need for study of additional or preventative strategies for ED after RT/ADT for prostate cancer.

**[http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/3d.html Meeting Minutes] June 2004 - &quot;The randomized prostate cancer trial (RTOG 0126) had the IMRT amendment approved by the NCI last fall. Accrual has improved this past meeting cycle.&quot;
**[http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/3d.html Meeting Minutes] January 2004 - &quot;The randomized prostate cancer trial (RTOG 0126) had the IMRT amendment approved by the NCI last fall. Accrual to the study has slowed while institutions submit the amendment to their IRB’s and complete credentialing requirements for IMRT. It is expected that accrual to this study will pick up once the regulatory requirements have been completed at the participating institutions and once RTOG 9910 closed to accrual.&quot;
**[http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/3d.html Meeting Minutes] June 2003 - &quot;Dr. Michalski reported that RTOG 0126, the randomized trial of high dose versus standard dose conformal radiation therapy for intermediate prostate cancer would soon allow IMRT. The decision was made to drop the need for two separate target volumes for patients receiving IMRT. Instead, a single target volume that encompasses the proximal seminal vesicles will be used. For patients treated with forward planned 3DCRT, an optional volume reduction after 55.8 Gy will be allowed. The prescription point was changed to a minimum dose to the PTV, rather than an ICRU reference dose.&quot;

*''Additional Info:'' January 2002 [http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/brachy.html Meeting Minutes] -- &quot;A Phase II study of external beam radiation therapy combined with permanent source brachytherapy for intermediate risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This protocol closed November 2001 having accrued 116 patients in approximately one year’s time. There is no mature data yet available regarding toxicity. Dr. Robert Lee presented the preliminary quality assurance data that suggests a lack of conformity between radiation oncologists in defining prostate volumes. There is a direct correlation between nonconformity in defining prostate volumes and nonconformity in dose delivered. Considerable discussion ensued regarding how to manage this problem within future RTOG prostate brachytherapy protocols. Suggestions to be taken to the Image Guided Radiotherapy Committee are having a central rapid-review system in place (not likely practical), or to have a web-based case illustrating how the volumes are to be drawn.&quot;

**Brachytherapy [http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/brachy.html Meeting Minutes] June 2000 - &quot;Dr. Michael Gillin presented an update of this study. The study opened to accrual in September 1998 and closed April 2000 having met its accrual objective of 95 patients. A review of dosimetry quality assurance has begun and should be available for presentation at the next meeting. Dr. Gillin presented some sample cases of the submitted dosimetry to illustrate the quality assurance process. One apparent problem is the observed difference in prostate definition between the treating radiation oncologists and the radiologist undertaking the quality assurance review. The Brachytherapy Committee will recommend that the Research Strategy Committee invite the radiologist to the next RTOG semiannual meeting to discuss this further. High quality assurance scores are critical to successful completion of further prostate brachytherapy studies.&quot;
**Brachytherapy [http://www.rtog.org/committees/minutes/brachy.html Meeting Minutes] January 2000 - &quot;Dr Colleen Lawton presented an update of this study. The study opened to accrual in September 1998 and has accrued 74 patients to date. A review of dosimetry quality assurance has begun and should be available for presentation at the next meeting. Target accrual is 95 patients. The study is accruing well and is expected to close in late 1999. Institutions must undergo a credentialing process prior to accruing patients. Thirty-three institutions have been credentialed but only 18 have put a patient on study. Institutions are encouraged to participate in this study since the credentialing process will be applied to future prostate brachytherapy studies.&quot;

The Game Engine is an interesting feature of Blender. The Game Engine is basically a 3D enviornment in which 3D objects move around and react to each other upon contact.
-You can do that without using the game engine, the game engine allows people to interact witht the 3d environment in realtime, not for the 3d environment to react with itself(although it does that to)

 The Game Engine is most easily applied to 3D architectural tours.
-while this is true, the statement is misleading, the game engine is MEANT for making games.


When it talks about vertex painting, it does not explain how to apply it to the stuff so when you press play it shows up...
This needs to be fixed.


-BALL goes through the hill not down the hill...

-The isosphere goes through the hill thus making the rest of the next(and the next next page) page undoable cause gravity is broken...

== subsurf not working ingame ==

I added a subsurf modifier of 3 for the hill but when I press PKEY I see the hill without subsurf and the ball doesnt roll when lying on the top face.--[[User:5o|5o]] ([[User talk:5o|talk]]) 17:33, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

Rigid Body and Dynamic options are not both available in 2.48 therefore sphere falls through - any fix or what am i missing (i successfully did this tutorial in a previous version)

You have to apply the subsurf in order for it to work in in the game mode.</text>

**[http://astro.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2238.pdf ASTRO Abstract] -- '''Dosimetric Consequences to the Pelvic Lymph Nodes Due to the Daily Motion of the Prostate''' (Chen H, ASTRO 2004). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Movement of the entire pelvic field according to the prostate motion has a significant impact on the coverage of the lymph nodes and the planned DVHs of surrounding normal tissues. The degree of impact depends on the magnitude of the movement and the margins used for the relevant structures. For patients with large (&gt; 10mm) prostate movements in the anterior direction, the small bowel doses increased substantially while the coverage of the presacral nodes was compromised. Conversely, large posterior moves put the external iliac nodes at risk for being under-treated. For the IMRT plans, our preliminary results suggest that the prostate motion could cause serious under-dosage of the lymph nodes.
**PMID 12967640 -- '''Cytokine profiles in patients receiving wide-field + prostate boost radiotherapy (xRT) for adenocarcinoma of the prostate''' (Kovacs CJ, Cytokine, 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Patients with prostate cancer (PC) were found to have a significantly (p&lt;0.05) elevated plasma level of the three cytokines prior to treatment. Moreover, during WFP + PB xRT, these circulating cytokine levels were further elevated, the elevation occurring in the form of cyclic waves; the concurrent waves of elevated IL-1alpha and M-CSF preceding that of TGFbeta. In addition to providing support for the existence of a humoral response to xRT in patients receiving WFP + PB xRT, the data demonstrated a significant correlation between the integral radiation dose (ID) and the temporal expression and magnitude of plasma IL-1alpha, M-CSF and TGFbeta levels in patients that had received 1-5 fractions (1.8-9Gy) of WFP + PB xRT. Thereafter, the appearance of elevated waves of cytokine expression in the patient's plasma continued independent of additional fractions of WFP + PB xRT.

(Roach M, ASCO 2002). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Prophylactic WP RT and NHT reduced the risk of disease progression for patients with high-risk prostate cancer. However, NHT combined with RT was no more effective than AHT when only the prostate was irradiated and WP RT was no more effective than PO RT without NHT.

**[http://astro.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_66.pdf ASTRO Abstract] -- '''Clinical Outcome of Patients Treated with 3D Conformal Radiation Therapy 3D-CRT for Prostate Cancer on RTOG 9406''' (Michalski, ASTRO 2004). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Previous reports from RTOG 9406 have demonstrated safety of dose escalation using 3D CRT for treatment to radiation doses as high as 79.2Gy and 1.8Gy per day or 78Gy and 2.0Gy per day fractions. The clinical disease-free survival (without 9406 PSA definition) appears comparable to other series using 3D CRT for localized prostate cancer. Analysis using ASTRO and other more sensitive and specific definitions of radiation therapy outcome will be presented. Analyses of outcome by prognostic factors including T-stage, initial PSA, Gleason score, and the use of neoadjuvant hormone therapy is planned.

(Roach M, IJROBP 2004). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Dose to the bulb of the penis seems to be associated with the risk of radiation-induced impotence.
**PMID 12694838 -- '''Preliminary evaluation of low-grade toxicity with conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer on RTOG 9406 dose levels I and II.''' (Michalski JM, IJRBOP 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Morbidity of 3D-CRT in the treatment of prostate cancer is low. It is important to continue to closely examine late effects in patients treated in RTOG 9406. The primary objective of dose escalation without an increase rate of &gt;/= Grade 3 sequelae has been achieved. However, the reduction in Grade 3 complications may have resulted in a higher incidence of Grade 1 or 2 late effects. Because Grade 2 late effects may have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life, it is important to reduce these complications as much as possible. Clinical trials should use quality-of-life measures to determine that trade-offs between severity and rates of toxicity are acceptable to patients.

(Valicenti RK, IJROBP 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Neoadjuvant HT did not show an independent effect on the risk of side effects after 3D-CRT in patients treated on RTOG 94-06. However, this combined modality therapy significantly increased the risk of acute GU effects compared to 3D-CRT alone in men with poor baseline urinary function.
**[http://www.rtog.org/abstracts/astrolist.html#Michalski ASTRO Abstract] -- '''Toxicity Following 3D Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer on RTOG 9406 Dose Level V''' (Michalski J, ASTRO Abstract 46, 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The rate of grade 3+ toxicity from 3DCRT with 78 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions remains better than expected compared to historical controls. However, low grade late toxicity is significantly higher in dose level V than dose level III. These differences may be dose and/or volume related.

(Ryu JK, IJRBOP 2002). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Based on excellent tolerance of 3D-CRT for stages T1 and T2 prostate cancer, further biological dose escalation has been pursued to Levels IV and V, 74 Gy and 78 Gy, respectively, at 2 Gy per day, in an attempt to reduce the total treatment duration. This trial has closed. A Phase III comparative RTOG trial is being developed to determine whether high-dose 3D-CRT improves efficacy.
**PMID 11917289 -- '''Trade-off to low-grade toxicity with conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9406.''' (Michalski JM, Semin Radiat Oncol 2002). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;:The primary objective of dose escalation without an increase rate of &gt; or = grade 3 complications has been achieved. However, the reduction in grade 3 complications may have resulted in a higher incidence of grade 2 late effects. Because grade 2 late effects may have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life, it is important to reduce these complications as much as possible.

***&lt;u&gt;Results:&lt;/u&gt; At dose level IV, grade 3 acute effects in 1% (Group 1) and 3% (Group 2). No grade 4 or 5. Late toxicity is low compared to historical controls: grade 3 bladder (1 in group 1, 4 in group 2), grade 3 bowel (1 in group 2), no grade 4 or 5.  Late grade 2 toxicities of any type in 22% (group 1) and 15% (group 2).  No difference in rate of acute/late toxicity for 73.8 Gy/1.8 vs 74 Gy/2.0.  Trend toward more grade 3 or higher toxicity with 2 Gy fractions vs 1.8 Gy p=0.09).   
***&lt;u&gt; Conclusion: &lt;/u&gt; Tolerance to 3DCRT with 74 Gy in 2Gy fractions remains better than expected compared to historical controls. The magnitude of any effect from fraction size requires additional follow-up.

(Valicenti R, ASTRO 2002; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys [54] (2):133-134, 2002.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Induction HT did not have an independent effect on the risk of side effects after 3D CRT. However, induction HT combined with 3D CRT significantly increased the risk of acute GU effects compared to 3D CRT alone in men with poor baseline urinary function. In patients receiving 3D CRT, no more than 30% of bladder volume should exceed the prescribed reference dose.

Importantly, however, the fourth criterion was not satisfied -- for those who failed biochemically, the relative risk of prostate cancer related death for patients treated with LTAD is 1.5 (p=0.05) times greater than STAD, indicating that the significance of a PSA failure event is not the same for each of the protocol arms. Thus, PSA failure may not be a satisfactory surrogate marker for prostate cancer survival in randomized clinical trials when the treatments have different duration of androgen deprivation.

The relationship of Ki67-SI to patient outcome is a continuous function, wherein the higher the Ki67-SI the greater the risk of an adverse result. The 7.1% cut point has been confirmed as correlating with DM and CSD, and appears to be useful in the selection of patients who will not benefit from LTAD+RT over STAD+RT.

'''RTOG 90-20 ([[Radiation Oncology/Prostate|PROSTATE]])'''
*''Title:'' A Phase II Trial of External Beam Radiation With Etanidazole for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
*''Objectives:''
**(1) Determine the clinical complete response rate (as evidenced by clinical exam and reduction in PSA level to below 10 ng) following standard external beam irradiation plus etanidazole in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.
**(2) Evaluate disease-free survival, duration of response, and overall time to complete response in order to determine the endpoint that most sharply defines the long-term success of treatment.
**(3) Determine the safety (i.e., absence of acute and chronic complications) of etanidazole given with whole-pelvis external beam irradiation in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.

Compliance rates for both institutional and patient participation were acceptable at initial and 3 month follow-up. Reasons for noncompliance were predominantly institution related and not patient related. Strategies to address both institution and patient compliance have been developed and implemented within the RTOG. Serious disagreement between patient self-reports of symptoms on the FACT QL scale and medical professional ratings on the RTOG acute toxicity rating scales of the same symptoms was 13% at 3 months follow-up. This warrants continued use of QL self-assessments in clinical trials.

**PMID 11483335 -- '''Phase III radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) trial 86-10 of androgen deprivation adjuvant to definitive radiotherapy in locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate.''' (Pilepich MV, IJROBP 2001). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; In patients with Gleason score 2--6 carcinoma of the prostate, a short course of androgen ablation administered before and during radiotherapy has been associated with a highly significant improvement in local control, reduction in disease progression, and overall survival.

This marker should be further evaluated in a larger cohort of patients.

(Li R, Clin Cancer Res 2004). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Higher Ki-67 SI was significantly associated with a greater risk of DM and DSS in locally advanced prostate cancer after definitive EBRT or AD + EBRT.

**[http://astro.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2227.pdf ASTRO Abstract] -- '''MDM2 as a Predictor of Prostate Cancer Outcome: An Analysis of RTOG 8610''' (Khor, ASTRO 2004). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Positive MDM2 expression was associated significantly with Gleason score and, although not significant, an increased risk of distant metastasis. While the relationship of MDM2 overexpression to DM was not statistically significant, this observation may be clinically meaningful. The cohort examined was small and with larger patient numbers, MDM2 overexpression may emerge as a significant covariate. In addition, MDM2 overexpression, like p53, may potentially be more discriminating in men with more favoravle risk prostate cancer.
**PMID 12947069 -- '''Loss of p16 expression is of prognostic significance in locally advanced prostate cancer: an analysis from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 86-10.''' (Chakravarti A, JCO 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Loss of p16 is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome in cases of locally advanced prostate cancer.
**PMID 12663710 -- '''Prostate cancer DNA ploidy and response to salvage hormone therapy after radiotherapy with or without short-term total androgen blockade: an analysis of RTOG 8610.''' (Pollack A, JCO 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Nondiploidy was associated with shorter survival, which seemed to be related to reduced response to salvage hormone therapy for those previously exposed to short-term TAB.
**PMID 12478146 -- '''Race and survival of men treated for prostate cancer on radiation therapy oncology group phase III randomized trials.''' (Roach, J Urol 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; As previously reported, tumor grade (Gleason score), palpation T stage, lymph node status, pretreatment PSA and treatment type are major predictors of overall and disease specific survival. We noted no evidence that race has independent prognostic significance in patients treated for prostate cancer in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prospective randomized trials.
**[http://www.rtog.org/abstracts/astrolist.html#Hughes ASTRO Abstract] -- '''Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC): secondary analysis of radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) 8610.''' (Hughes, ASTRO Abstract 128, 2003; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 57 (2 Suppl): S201-2, 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;This analysis represents one of the largest sample bases reviewed for VEGF expression in human prostate carcinoma patients. VEGF is highly expressed in this study population. Although no statistically significant correlation was seen between extent of VEGF expression and outcomes for patients randomized in RTOG 8610, VEGF will be further investigated as a high priority biomarker for patients from RTOG 9202 to add a broader distribution of prostate cancer patients with regard to GS for analysis. Further study will include biological correlation of VEGF IS with microvessel density in the RTOG 8610 patients.
**[http://www.rtog.org/abstracts/astrolist.html#Konski ASTRO Abstract] -- '''Monte Carlo Simulation of a Markov Model for a Phase III Clinical Trial Evaluating the Addition of Total Androgen Suppression (TAS) To Radiation Versus Radiation Alone for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer (RTOG 86−10)''' (Konski, ASTRO Abstract 151, 2003; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 57 (2 Suppl): S215-6, 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Our analysis shows that adding hormonal treatment to RT improves both health outcomes and lowers costs. The expected cost is lowered by preventing failures in the future and obviating the need for additional therapies, such as hormones and chemotherapy. Despite producing lower quality of life in the short term, hormonal therapy reduces the cost and morbidity associated with future treatment failures.
**PMID 12459350 -- '''Effect of a short course of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy on the response to subsequent androgen suppression in prostate cancer patients with relapse after radiotherapy: a secondary analysis of the randomized protocol RTOG 86-10.''' (Shipley WU, IJRBOP 2002) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Although a 4-month course of neoadjuvant and concurrent maximum androgen suppression and RT (compared with RT alone) significantly increases the freedom from relapse rate and freedom from receiving salvage HT, it does not compromise the long-term beneficial effect of subsequent salvage HT, if needed for relapse. These findings with long follow-up in patients treated for locally advanced disease diagnosed 9-14 years previously should help allay concerns of the possible development of &quot;resistance&quot; to androgen suppression when 4-month courses of neoadjuvant HT are used before primary treatment.
**[http://www.rtog.org/abstracts/astro.html#Hughes ASTRO Abstract] -- '''Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) Expression in Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: Secondary Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 86-10.''' (Hughes L, ASTRO 2002, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys [54] (2):271-272, 2002.). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; This analysis represents the largest sample base reviewed for COX-2 expression in prostate carcinoma patients. COX-2 is highly expressed in this study population. Patients with GS 7–10 locally advanced prostate cancer had greater intensity of COX-2 expression when compared with their lower GS counterparts. Due to the large degree of COX-2 expression seen in prostate carcinoma, COX-2 will be a high priority biomarker when evaluating samples from RTOG 92-02. 
**PMID 11240235 -- '''Subset analysis of RTOG 85-31 and 86-10 indicates an advantage for long-term vs. short-term adjuvant hormones for patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy.''' (Horwitz EM, IJRBOP 2001). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Adjuvant long-term hormones compared to short-term hormones resulted in statistically significant improvements in bNED control, DMF, and CSF rates for patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer.

(Shipley WU, ASCO 2001). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; For those patients that relapsed following irradiation and were treated with salvage HT, a more advanced extent of progression at the time of initiating salvage HT, decreased significantly disease specific survival and overall survival in this retrospective analysis. These findings warrant confirmation by a second independent study.
**PMID 10837944 -- '''Predicting long-term survival, and the need for hormonal therapy: a meta-analysis of RTOG prostate cancer trials.''' (Roach M, IJRBOP 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Based on this meta-analysis of RTOG trials, subsets of patients can be identified who either do not appear to benefit from the use of hormonal therapy, benefit from short-term hormonal therapy, or who benefit only from long-term hormonal therapy. These observations should be confirmed by prospective randomized trials before they can be considered conclusive. In the meantime, however, these observations provide rational guidelines for deciding who should receive hormonal therapy and for how long.
**PMID 10837943 -- '''Four prognostic groups predict long-term survival from prostate cancer following radiotherapy alone on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group clinical trials.''' (Roach, IJRBOP 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Recognition of these four risk groups provides a basis for estimating the long-term DSS for men treated with XRT alone and should facilitate the design of future prospective randomized trials.

**PMID 10894874 -- '''Survival advantage from higher-dose radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer treated on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials.''' (Valicenti, JCO 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; These data demonstrate that higher-dose radiation therapy can significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer in men with clinically localized disease. This survival benefit is restricted to men with poorly differentiated cancers.

The interaction of radiation therapy plus hormone therapy and abnormal p53 protein expression may provide a clinical link to experimental evidence that radiation therapy and/or hormone therapy act, at least in part, by the induction of apoptosis (a cell death program) and suggests that this mechanism may be blocked in patients whose tumors have p53 mutations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is how graphics should work:

&lt;pre&gt;
View.Set (&quot;offscreenonly&quot;)
loop
   Draw background picture
   Draw foreground stuff
   View.Update
end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

In most cases, you must do it like this to avoid flicker.

Example:
A moving circle:

&lt;pre&gt;
View.Set (&quot;offscreenonly&quot;)
for count : 1 .. 600
    drawfilloval (count, 200, 30, 30, red)
    View.Update
    delay (10)
    drawfilloval (count, 200, 30, 30, white)
end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are some commands in the example that you are probably not familiar with. A for loop is a counted loop it runs for a certain number of times. So the statement &quot;For count : 1..600&quot; means that the loop will run from 1 to 600, and each time it runs it will store that value in the variable &quot;count&quot;. So the first time it will run count will have a value of 1, the second time it will be 2 and so on. &quot;drawfilloval&quot; does exactly what it says it draws an oval and fills it with the color specified. Delay also does what it says it pauses the program for a certain amount of time specified in the bracket, 1000 is equal to 1 sec so in the example it is 10, so program pauses for 0.01 s. The pause is needed so the program wait before it draws the white oval on top of the red one.

1. Take 4 ordinary straws.

2. Take a 1.5inch square piece of napkin or any paper. Moisten it a little (saliva or water will do) twist and roll it into a stick.

3. Insert your paper stick into the ends of two straws, forming one long straw connected by the help of the paper stick.

                      ^
                     / \\
                    /   \ \
                   /     \  \
                  /       \   \    ------------

4. Bend then stand the long straw in a triangle, ^ denotes the paper stick connecting both straws. Use a third straw to assist the straws in standing upright on a flat surface. In essence you have formed a pyramid.  Two of the straws are attached the third being only an assistant.

5. Now take your fourth straw to lift all three straws into the air simultaneously, without using your hand to touch any other straw.

'''Note:''' This is not a word game, nor is there a cheap solution.  If you apply some logic you will find an interesting solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Ada/Navigation|Strings}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Ada supports three different types of strings. Each string type is designed  to solve a different problem.

In addition, every string type is implemented for each available Characters type &lt;small&gt;(Character, Wide_Character, Wide_Wide_Character)&lt;/small&gt; giving a complement of nine combinations.

== Fixed-length string handling ==

Fixed-Length Strings (the [[Ada Programming/Types#Predefined_types|predefined type String]]) are [[Ada Programming/Types/array|arrays]] of Character, and consequently of a fixed length. Since String is an [[ada Programming/Subtypes#Indefinite subtype|indefinite subtype]] the length does not need to be known at compile time &amp;mdash; the length may well be calculated at run time. In the following example the length is calculated from command-line argument 1:

 X : String := Ada.Command_Line.Argument (1);

However once the length has been calculated and the string has been created the length stays constant. Try the following program which shows a typical mistake:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|show_commandline_1.adb}}

The program will only work when the 1st and 2nd parameter have the same length. This is even true when the 2nd parameter is shorter. There is neither an automatic padding of shorter strings nor an automatic truncation of longer strings.

Having said that, the package {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}} contains a set of procedures and functions for Fixed-Length String Handling which allows padding of shorter strings and truncation of longer strings.

Try the following example to see how it works:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|show_commandline_2.adb}}

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Command_Line}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Show_Commandline_2 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} CL   {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Command_Line}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} S    {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings}};
    {{Ada/kw|package}} SF   {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}};
 
    X : String := CL.Argument (1);
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Argument 1 = &quot;);
    T_IO.Put_Line (X);
 
   SF.Move (
      Source  =&gt; CL.Argument (2),
      Target  =&gt; X,
      Drop    =&gt; S.Right,
      Justify =&gt; S.Left,
      Pad     =&gt; S.Space);
 
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Argument 2 = &quot;);
    T_IO.Put_Line (X);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Show_Commandline_2;

== Bounded-length string handling ==

Bounded-Length Strings can be used when the maximum length of a string is known and/or restricted. This is often the case in database applications where only a limited number of characters can be stored.

Like Fixed-Length Strings the maximum length does not need to be known at compile time &amp;mdash; it can also be calculated at runtime &amp;mdash; as the example below shows:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|show_commandline_3.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Command_Line}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Bounded}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Show_Commandline_3 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} CL   {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Command_Line;
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Max_Length (
       Value_1 : Integer;
       Value_2 : Integer)
    {{Ada/kw|return}}
       Integer
    {{Ada/kw|is}}
       Retval : Integer;
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       {{Ada/kw|if}} Value_1 &gt; Value_2 {{Ada/kw|then}}
          Retval := Value_1;
       {{Ada/kw|else}}
          Retval := Value_2;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
       {{Ada/kw|return}} Retval;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Max_Length;
 
    {{Ada/kw|pragma}} Inline (Max_Length);
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} SB
    {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Strings.Bounded.Generic_Bounded_Length (
        Max =&gt; Max_Length (
                   Value_1 =&gt; CL.Argument (1)'Length,
                   Value_2 =&gt; CL.Argument (2)'Length));
 
    X :  SB.Bounded_String
      := SB.To_Bounded_String (CL.Argument (1));
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Argument 1 = &quot;);
    T_IO.Put_Line (SB.To_String (X));
 
    X := SB.To_Bounded_String (CL.Argument (2));
 
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Argument 2 = &quot;);
    T_IO.Put_Line (SB.To_String (X));
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Show_Commandline_3;

You should know that Bounded-Length Strings have some distinct disadvantages. Most noticeable is that each Bounded-Length String is a different type which makes converting them rather cumbersome. Also a Bounded-Length String type always allocates memory for the maximum permitted string length for the type. The memory allocation for a Bounded-Length String is equal to the maximum number of string &quot;characters&quot; plus an implementation dependent number containing the string length (each character can require allocation of more than one byte per character, depending on the underlying character type of the string, and the length number is 4 bytes long for the Windows GNAT Ada compiler v3.15p, for example).

== Unbounded-length string handling ==

Last but not least there is the Unbounded-Length String. In fact: If you are not doing embedded or database programming this will be the string type you are going to use most often as it gives you the maximum amount of flexibility.

As the name suggest the Unbounded-Length String can hold strings of almost any length &amp;mdash; limited only to the value of Integer'Last or your available heap memory. This is because Unbounded_String type is implemented using dynamic memory allocation behind the scenes, providing lower efficiency but maximum flexibility.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|show_commandline_4.adb}}

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Command_Line}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Unbounded}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Show_Commandline_4 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} CL   {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Command_Line;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} SU   {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
 
    X :  SU.Unbounded_String 
      := SU.To_Unbounded_String (CL.Argument (1));
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Argument 1 = &quot;);
    T_IO.Put_Line (SU.To_String (X));
 
    X := SU.To_Unbounded_String (CL.Argument (2));
 
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Argument 2 = &quot;);
    T_IO.Put_Line (SU.To_String (X));
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Show_Commandline_4;

As you can see the Unbounded-Length String example is also the shortest &lt;small&gt;(discarding the first example, which is buggy)&lt;/small&gt; &amp;mdash; this makes using Unbounded-Length Strings very appealing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A farmer placed his eggs into the back of his pickup truck and headed to town to take them to market. 

On the way to the market he encounterd a toll gate and did not have any money. So, the farmer gave the toll keeper half of his eggs plus half an egg. The farmer drove on and arrived at a second toll gate and again having no money gave that toll keeper half his eggs plus half an egg. The farmers next stop was the market.

When he arrived at the market he had one egg left. 
How many eggs did the farmer have when he left his farm?

      <text xml:space="preserve">He started with 7 eggs. How? 

See Below:

At the market the farmer had 1 egg. 

Working backward from toll gate two, the only way that could happen is by giving up half his eggs plus half an egg (dividing 3 into half to get 1.5 plus .5 to give up 2 eggs, leaving 1 egg).

Again working backward from toll gate one, the only way that could happen is by giving up half his eggs plus half an egg (dividing 7 into half to get 3.5 plus .5 to give up 4 eggs, leaving 3 eggs).

So, the farmer left the farm with 7 eggs!

*''Title:'' Phase III Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy with Zoladex vs Observation Only Following Definitive Radiotherapy for Unfavorable Prognosis Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate 
*''Objectives:''
**1) Evaluate the relative effectiveness of elective vs. therapeutic androgen deprivation with Zoladex with regard to disease progression and survival among patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who are at high risk for relapse and tumor-related death, including patients with evidence of involvement of regional lymphatics or gross extension of palpable tumor beyond the prostate (clinical or pathological Stage C)
**2) Assess the side effects associated with long-term administration of Zoladex. 
*''[http://www.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials/view_clinicaltrials.aspx?version=healthprofessional&amp;cdrid=74059&amp;protocolsearchid=668796 Protocol]:''
**''Arm 1:'' 65-70 Gy EBRT
**''Arm 2:'' 65-70 Gy EBRT + indefinite AST started during last week of RT
*''Eligibility:''  
**(A2 and B with LN+) or (C) with no &quot;bulky&quot; (&gt;25cc) disease unless spread to extra-pelvic nodes, M0

**PMID 15817329 -- '''Androgen suppression adjuvant to definitive radiotherapy in prostate carcinoma--long-term results of phase III RTOG 85-31.''' (Pilepich MV, IJRBOP 2005). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; In a population of patients with unfavorable prognosis carcinoma of the prostate, androgen suppression applied as an adjuvant after definitive RT was associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but in a statistically significant improvement in absolute survival. The improvement in survival appeared preferentially in patients with a Gleason score of 7-10.
*''Publications:''
**PMID 15681524 -- '''Androgen suppression plus radiation versus radiation alone for patients with stage D1/pathologic node-positive adenocarcinoma of the prostate: updated results based on national prospective randomized trial Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 85-31.''' (Lawton CA, JCO 2005). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Pending the results of randomized trials, patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who have pathologically involved pelvic lymph nodes (pathologic node-positive or clinical stage D1) should be considered for external-beam irradiation plus immediate hormonal manipulation rather than radiation alone with hormone manipulation at the time of relapse.
**PMID 12478146 -- '''Race and survival of men treated for prostate cancer on radiation therapy oncology group phase III randomized trials.''' (Roach M, J Urol 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; As previously reported, tumor grade (Gleason score), palpation T stage, lymph node status, pretreatment PSA and treatment type are major predictors of overall and disease specific survival. We noted no evidence that race has independent prognostic significance in patients treated for prostate cancer in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prospective randomized trials.

**PMID 10837944 -- '''Predicting long-term survival, and the need for hormonal therapy: a meta-analysis of RTOG prostate cancer trials.''' (Roach M, IJRBOP 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Based on this meta-analysis of RTOG trials, subsets of patients can be identified who either do not appear to benefit from the use of hormonal therapy, benefit from short-term hormonal therapy, or who benefit only from long-term hormonal therapy. These observations should be confirmed by prospective randomized trials before they can be considered conclusive. In the meantime, however, these observations provide rational guidelines for deciding who should receive hormonal therapy and for how long.
**PMID 10894874 -- '''Survival advantage from higher-dose radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer treated on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials.''' (Valicenti R, JCO 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; These data demonstrate that higher-dose radiation therapy can significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer in men with clinically localized disease. This survival benefit is restricted to men with poorly differentiated cancers.

(Corn BW, Urology 1999). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;Patients with prostate cancer and indications for postoperative RT should be considered for combined RT and hormonal manipulation. Because statistically significant advantages for this experimental approach could not be defined for all end points studied (in particular, overall survival), efforts should be made to enroll these patients in the recently activated RTOG trial (96-01) comparing RT plus placebo to the combination of RT plus Casodex in the postoperative setting.

'''RTOG 83-07 ([[Radiation Oncology/Prostate|PROSTATE]])'''
*''Title:'' Phase II Megestrol Acetate vs Diethylstilbestrol Adjuvant to Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Stage B/C Carcinoma of the Prostate 
*''Objectives:'' 
**(1) Evaluate the relative effectiveness and toxicity of megestrol acetate versus diethylstilbestrol as pre-adjuvants to radiotherapy; the principal endpoints are tumor clearance rates and serum testosterone levels. 
**(2) Compare the two treatment options with respect to local-regional control, disease-free interval, and survival.
**(3) Assess the effect of both treatments on sexual function.
*''[http://www.cancer.gov/search/ViewClinicalTrials.aspx?cdrid=71416&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;protocolsearchid=1658049 Protocol]''
**''Arm 1:'' Megestrol x 2 months followed by 65-70 Gy EBRT + Megestrol
**''Arm 2:'' Diethylstilbestrol x 2 months followed by 65-70 Gy EBRT + Diethylstilbestrol
*''Eligibility:'' Stage B2 or C, LN+ ok if below aortic bifurcation, M0
*''Enrolled:'' 203 patients
*''Conclusion:''
**PMID 7721614 -- '''Phase II trial of hormonal cytoreduction with megestrol and diethylstilbestrol in conjunction with radiotherapy for carcinoma of the prostate: outcome results of RTOG 83-07.''' (Pilepich MV, IJRBOP 1995). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The results of the study indicate comparable efficacy (using tumor clearance as an end point) of DES and Megestrol. Although DES appears more effective in suppressing testosterone, it is also associated with a higher incidence of drug-related toxicity.
*''Publications:'' 
**PMID 10837944 -- '''Predicting long-term survival, and the need for hormonal therapy: a meta-analysis of RTOG prostate cancer trials.''' (Roach M, IJRBOP 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Based on this meta-analysis of RTOG trials, subsets of patients can be identified who either do not appear to benefit from the use of hormonal therapy, benefit from short-term hormonal therapy, or who benefit only from long-term hormonal therapy. These observations should be confirmed by prospective randomized trials before they can be considered conclusive. In the meantime, however, these observations provide rational guidelines for deciding who should receive hormonal therapy and for how long.

(Zhou R, IJRBOP 1995). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Quantitative image analysis of the IPSAP stain predicts survival in patients treated with external beam radiotherapy with and without prior hormonal therapy.
**PMID 2646266 -- '''Hormonal cytoreduction in locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate treated with definitive radiotherapy: preliminary results of RTOG 83-07.''' (Pilepich MV, IJRBOP 1989). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The results of the study indicate comparable efficacy (using tumor clearance as an end-point) of DES and Megestrol. While DES appears more effective in suppressing testosterone it is also associated with a higher incidence of toxicity. The cytoreduction (using either DES, Megestrol, or an alternative regimen) concept remains to be tested in a Phase III study comparing it to radiotherapy alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As explained later, digital signals can only take one of two values at any one point.
Analog signals, however, can take any value within a range.
In modern electronics, many traditionally analog circuits are being replaced with digital ICs for various reasons:
* Reduced cost:
** Digital ICs can be programmed, meaning many different analog circuits can each be replaced with the same IC, reducing cost.  For example, the same DSP chip might replace many different analog filters.
** Digital ICs can be easily expanded to put multiple functions on the same chip.  For example, a DSP chip replacing multiple analog filters at the same time.
** Digital ICs can be reprogrammed without modifying the circuit, simplifying prototyping and field upgrades.
* Increased versatility:
** A digital IC can have its settings changed arbitrarily while it is being operated, these settings can even be changed by software.  The equivalent in an analog circuit might require expensive and complicated switching techniques.
* Numeric precision: once a signal is converted to digital data, distortion and circuit noise are no longer a significant issue.  A cheap modern watch driven by a digital circuit (such as a quartz oscillator and a counter) is more precise than any analog or mechanical clock.
* Ease of storage: digital data, once recorded, does not degrade as easily as analog data.

Digital circuits are also becoming more prevalent where there are no analog analogues, such as computers.  Although analogue computers exist, their utility is severely limited by comparison.

Analog circuits are still more suitable for many functions.  
One important category is interfaces.
Digital circuits are usually inferior to analog circuits for receiving and transmitting signals.
* A common digital interface, the differential line, needs an analog circuit to function well.  The receiver must filter out common mode interference by computing the analog difference between the two lines.  Most digital interfaces are designed as analog, only a few legacy interfaces (which have poor performance) use entirely digital circuits.
* Many radio signals are simply too high frequency to work with existing digital circuits.  Radio modulators, demodulators, mixers, transmitters, and receivers are still analog.  Some signals are even too high frequency for transistor circuits of any kind to amplify efficiently, such as microwave signals, which are still transmitted using vacuum tubes.
* Signals must be conditioned before conversion to digital to avoid aliasing: analog filters remove unwanted parts of signals.
* Many devices, such as monitors, require analog control.  Even LCD monitors require analog circuits, although they need not be as sophisticated as CRT analog circuits.
* Audio equipment requires analog circuits.  Speakers must be driven by analog signals, microphones produce analog signals.  Signal of a microphone must be conditioned before conversion to digital, this usually entails sophisticated analog circuits such as preamplifers, compressors, and filters.

'''Chicken Fried Steak''' is a hearty food dish in the southern USA. The dish is commonly served with mashed potatoes smothered in chicken fried steak gravy. 

Chicken Fried Steak is, simply, a cut of steak (usually cheap round steak)pounded until tender and then breaded like you would bread chicken, and fried in oil. Milk, salt, and pepper are added to the grease drippings and used to make a thick gravy, which is generously poured over the steak and, usually, mashed potatoes. Many people think the gravy makes the steak!

==Ingredients==
*[[cookbook:Flour|white flour]], as needed plus 3 tbsp
*2 tbsp [[cookbook:pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]
*1 tbsp kosher salt
*2 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s, beaten
*1 cup whole milk, combined with 1/4 cup heavy cream
*3 beef cube steaks, 1/2 inch thick
*3 tbsp bacon drippings, divided
*2 tbsp smoked paprika
*1/3 cup chicken broth

==Procedure==

#Pour 2 tbsp drippings into a 12 inch cast-iron skillet.
#Preheat pan at medium high heat.
#*Wet hand, drip 1 drop of water in pan to test the heat. If it sizzles, it's hot enough. Not too much water though or it may sizzle so much you get hot grease on you!
#Mix eggs with seasonings.
#Trim each steak.
#Dip steaks into eggs.
#Dredge steak into flour thoroughly on both sides.
#When the pan is hot enough, put steaks in pan in a triangle formation.
#Fry until golden brown, 4 minutes per side.
#Remove steak(s) from pan and place in a 200 degree oven.
#Pour remaining drippings into pan and lower heat to medium. Add flour and cook, whisking, until light blonde color is achieved.
#Add chicken broth and deglaze pan, whisking. Add cream mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook until gravy coats back of spoon.
#Drizzle over steaks and serve.

==Warnings==
* When heating the pan in step 2.  Wet hand, drip 1 drop of water in pan to test the heat. If it sizzles, it's hot enough. Not too much water though or it may sizzle so much you get hot grease on you!
*Don't let the gravy get too thick.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Boolean Algebra==
Boolean Algebra was created by George Boole (1815 - 1864) in his paper ''An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities'', published in 1854. It had few applications at the time, but eventually scientists and engineers realized that his system could be used to create efficient computer logic.
The Boolean system has two states: '''True''' (T) or '''False''' (F). This can be represented in several different ways as on or off, one or zero, yes or no, etc. These states are manipulated by three fundamental operations called ''logical operators'': '''AND''', '''OR''' and '''NOT'''. These operators take certain inputs and produce an output based on a predetermined table of results. For example, the AND operator takes two (or more) inputs and returns an 'on' result only when both (or all) inputs are 'on'. 
*In these tables T means &quot;True&quot;, or &quot;Yes&quot;, or 1 (in electronics), and
*F means &quot;False&quot;, or &quot;No&quot; or 0 (in electronics). 
*For example, the 1st line of the AND table says  that if A is F and B is F then the result also is F. This is also said often as If A is 0 and B is also 0, then A AND B = 0 &lt;u&gt;times&lt;/u&gt; 0 = 0
*Also at the bottom of the AND table 1 times 1 is 1.
*Looking at the OR table, use &lt;u&gt;plus&lt;/U&gt; instead of times: 0 plus 0 is 0, where again 0 is F and 1 is T. Only 0 and 1 exist, therefore if the result of the addition is more than 1, then change it to 1.
*The 3rd table shows NEGATION: whatever it is, change it to the other; 0 is changed into 1, and  1 is changed into 0.

 &lt;td&gt;'''B'''&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=center&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=center&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=center&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border=1 align=center cellpadding=5&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;'''NOT'''&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;'''A'''&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bar A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=center&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td align=center&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

These simple operators are good because they allow us to create very simple logic circuits:
if user put in a quarter AND the Coke button is pressed, drop a Coke

There are ways, however, to combine these expressions to make much more complex but useful digital circuits. By using multiple operators on the same inputs, it is possible to create much more complex outputs. An expression like:
A and B or C
would have a truth table of the following:
&lt;table border=1 cellpadding=5 align=center&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;A and B or C&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This truth table follows the rules
If A and B are true, or C is true, then X is true

Exercise: Go through each case in the table and check it using the above statement.

===Formal Mathematical Operators===
AND is represented by &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\cdot  \,&lt;/math&gt; that is A AND B would be &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B \,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A \cdot  B \,&lt;/math&gt;.

OR is represented by &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;+ \,&lt;/math&gt; that is A OR B would be &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A+B \,&lt;/math&gt;.

NOT is represented by &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\bar{}&lt;/math&gt; that is NOT A is &lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

If these three operators are combined then the NOR and NAND can be created. So A NOR B is &lt;math&gt;\neg (A \vee B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;. NAND is &lt;math&gt;\neg (A \wedge B) \,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{A\cdot B}&lt;/math&gt;. Other notations are valid as well, and many different combinations of them arise in mathematics and engineering.  No universal standard has been agreed upon.  However, most sources will make explicit the particular notation used.

===Boolean Algebra Laws===

Boolean Algebra, like regular algebra, has certain rules. These rules are Associativity, Distributivity, Commutativity and De Morgan's Laws. Associativity, Commutativity and Distributivity only apply to the AND and OR operators. Some of these laws may seem trivial in normal Algebra but in other algebras they are not. 

====Associativity====
Associativity is the property of algebra that the order of evaluation of the terms is immaterial.
:&lt;math&gt;A \vee (B \vee C) = (A \vee B) \vee C  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \wedge (B \wedge C) = (A \wedge B) \wedge C  &lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt;A+(B+C)=(A+B)+C \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\cdot(B\cdot C)=(A\cdot B)\cdot C \,&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Wikipedia:Associativity]]

====Distributivity====
Distibutivity is the property that an operator can be applied to the terms within the brackets.
:&lt;math&gt;A \wedge (B \vee C) = (A \wedge B) \vee (A \wedge C)&lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt;A.(B+C)=(A\cdot B)+(A\cdot C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Wikipedia:Distributivity]]

====Commutativity====
Commutativity is the property that order of application of an operator is immaterial.
:&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B  = B \wedge A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \vee B  = B \vee A&lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt;A\cdot B=B\cdot A \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A+B=B+A \,&lt;/math&gt;
:[[Wikipedia:Commutativity]]

====De Morgan's Law====
De Morgan's Law is a consequence of the fact that the not or negation operator is not distributive.
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P\wedge Q)=(\neg P)\vee(\neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P\vee Q)=(\neg P)\wedge(\neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P\cdot Q}=\bar {P}+ \bar {Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P+Q}=\bar {P}\cdot  \bar {Q}&lt;/math&gt;

====Notes====
It is important to note that 
:&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B \vee C \ne A \wedge (B \vee C)&lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt;A\cdot B+C \ne A\cdot (B+C)&lt;/math&gt;
This can be seen as either AND having a higher precedence or the fact that Associativity does not hold between AND and OR or that it is an invalid application of distributivity.

Another way of looking at this is the possible application of our understanding of normal algebra rules using the second notation.  Where clearly the analogy between OR being addition and AND being multiplication is made.  We would never make this error if this were high school algebra.

====Rules====

All of these Laws Result in a number of rules used for the reduction of Boolean Algebra.

#&lt;math&gt;A \wedge A=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\vee A=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\wedge 1=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\vee 1=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\wedge 0=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\vee 0=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\wedge \neg {A}=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\vee \neg {A}=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\neg (\neg {A})=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\vee \neg {A}\wedge B= A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\neg {A} \vee A\wedge B= \neg {A} \vee B&lt;/math&gt;
Or
#&lt;math&gt;A\cdot A=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A+A=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\cdot 1=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A+1=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\cdot 0=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A+0=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\cdot \bar {A}=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A+\bar {A}=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\overline {\bar {A}}=A \,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A+\bar {A}\cdot B= A + B&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\bar {A} + A\cdot B= \bar {A} + B&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===

Simplify the following Expressions.
#&lt;math&gt;B \wedge A \wedge \neg {A}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A \wedge \neg {B} \vee A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;
Or
#&lt;math&gt;B\cdot A\cdot  \bar {A}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A\cdot  \bar {B} + A\cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

For number 1 using rule 7. We get.

:&lt;math&gt;B\wedge 0=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt;B\cdot 0=0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Which happens to be rule 5 so the answer is zero.
In number 2 we can take out A. Given 
:&lt;math&gt;A \wedge( \neg {B} \vee  B)&lt;/math&gt;
Or
:&lt;math&gt;A\cdot  (\bar {B} + B)&lt;/math&gt;
The Expression within brackets is rule 8. So the answer is A.

'''RTOG 77-06 ([[Radiation Oncology/Prostate|PROSTATE]])'''
*''Title:'' Phase III Prostatic Irradiation vs Pelvic Irradiation plus Prostate Boost for Stage A2/B Prostatic Adenocarcinoma  
*''Objectives:'' 
**(1) Determine the value of irradiation of the prostate only vs. pelvic irradiation with prostate boost in patients with Stages A2 and B adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
**(2) Compare the morbidity and complications of these two radiotherapeutic regimens.
*''Eligibility:'' Stage A2 and B, N0M0
*''[http://www.cancer.gov/search/ViewClinicalTrials.aspx?cdrid=70582&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;protocolsearchid=1658203 Protocol]:''
**''Arm 1:'' 65 Gy prostate field EBRT 
**''Arm 2:'' 45 Gy pelvic field EBRT + 20 Gy prostate boost
*''Enrolled:'' 453 patients 
*''Conclusion:''
**PMID 3058656 -- '''Elective pelvic irradiation in stage A2, B carcinoma of the prostate: analysis of RTOG 77-06.''' (Asbell, IJRBOP 1988). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The results of the study revealed no statistically significant benefit of elective pelvic irradiation.
*''Publications:''  
**PMID 12478146 -- '''Race and survival of men treated for prostate cancer on radiation therapy oncology group phase III randomized trials.''' (Roach, J Urol 2003). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; As previously reported, tumor grade (Gleason score), palpation T stage, lymph node status, pretreatment PSA and treatment type are major predictors of overall and disease specific survival. We noted no evidence that race has independent prognostic significance in patients treated for prostate cancer in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prospective randomized trials.
**PMID 10837944 -- '''Predicting long-term survival, and the need for hormonal therapy: a meta-analysis of RTOG prostate cancer trials.''' (Roach, IJRBOP 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Based on this meta-analysis of RTOG trials, subsets of patients can be identified who either do not appear to benefit from the use of hormonal therapy, benefit from short-term hormonal therapy, or who benefit only from long-term hormonal therapy. These observations should be confirmed by prospective randomized trials before they can be considered conclusive. In the meantime, however, these observations provide rational guidelines for deciding who should receive hormonal therapy and for how long. 
**PMID 10837943 -- '''Four prognostic groups predict long-term survival from prostate cancer following radiotherapy alone on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group clinical trials.''' (Roach, IJRBOP 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Recognition of these four risk groups provides a basis for estimating the long-term DSS for men treated with XRT alone and should facilitate the design of future prospective randomized trials.
**PMID 10894874 -- '''Survival advantage from higher-dose radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer treated on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials.''' (Valicenti, JCO 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; These data demonstrate that higher-dose radiation therapy can significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer in men with clinically localized disease. This survival benefit is restricted to men with poorly differentiated cancers.
**PMID 10022702 -- '''Long-term survival after radiotherapy alone: radiation therapy oncology group prostate cancer trials.''' (Roach M, J Urol 1999). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; In the first 10 years Gleason score was the single most important predictor of death. Gleason score should be incorporated into the current clinical staging system.

(Valicenti R, ASCO 1999). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;These data suggest a significant effect for higher radiation dose to reduce the probability of dying from prostate cancer in men with poorly differentiated disease. 
**PMID 9531360 -- '''Impact of surgical staging in evaluating the radiotherapeutic outcome in RTOG #77-06, a phase III study for T1BN0M0 (A2) and T2N0M0 (B) prostate carcinoma.''' (Asbell, IJRBOP 1998). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; At 12-year median follow-up, there still was no survival difference in those patients treated prophylactically to the pelvic nodes and prostatic bed vs. the prostatic bed alone. Those patients not surgically staged with only LAG for lymph node evaluation were less accurately staged, as reflected by a statistically significant reduced survival and earlier metastases.

(Zhou, IJRBOP 1995). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Quantitative image analysis of the IPSAP stain predicts survival in patients treated with external beam radiotherapy with and without prior hormonal therapy
**PMID 7523341 -- '''PSA confirmation of cure at 10 years of T1B, T2, N0, M0 prostate cancer patients treated in RTOG protocol 7706 with external beam irradiation.''' (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1994). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Prostatic specific antigen adds to the accuracy of determining clinical long-term cure and shows that 65-88% of patients who are clinical no evidence of disease are &quot;biochemical&quot; cures as well. These correlation percentages are quite similar to the largest contemporary surgical series, and strongly support the concept and fact of cure of prostate cancer with radiation.
**PMID 8270458 -- '''Patterns of Care and RTOG studies in prostate cancer: long-term survival, hazard rate observations, and possibilities of cure.''' (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1994). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; These data make a strong argument for the long-term cure of prostate cancer by external beam radiation, and support the continued use and study of radiation therapy as a curative modality in prostate cancer. No similar national data is available for any other method of management.
**PMID 1587749 -- '''Comparison of pathologic and clinical evaluation of lymph nodes in prostate cancer: implications of RTOG data for patient management and trial design and stratification.''' (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1992). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The clinical determination of nodal status, therefore, has no prognostic value in contrast to pathologic determination and should not be used for stratifying patients in clinical trials. The CT scans often used to evaluate nodal status are more useful if delayed until they can be done as part of the treatment planning process where the CT has value. When imaging tests suggest positive lymph nodes in prostate cancer patients, the imaging finding is confirmed by biopsy.
**PMID 1917621 -- '''The effect of overall treatment time on the outcome of definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma: the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 75-06 and 77-06 experience.''' (Lai PP, IJRBOP 1991). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The incidence of late complications was not related to the number of elapsed treatment days. Therefore, the overall treatment time does not have an impact on the outcome of definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma. It is hypothesized that prostate carcinoma behaves as late-reacting tissue in which there is little, if any, accelerated repopulation of clonogenic tumor cells during the later half of a protracted course of radiotherapy.
**PMID 1917610 -- '''Outcome for lymph node dissection negative T-1b, T-2 (A-2,B) prostate cancer treated with external beam radiation therapy in RTOG 77-06.''' (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1991). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The outcome of this group is equal or superior to reports of radical prostatectomy in similar stage patients.
**PMID 2808056 -- '''Impact of surgical staging in evaluating the radiotherapeutic outcome in RTOG phase III study for A2 and B prostate carcinoma.''' (Asbell, IJRBOP 1989). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Compared to the lymphangiography group, the staging lymphadenectomy group showed better overall survival (87% to 76% at 5 years, p = .02), better disease-free survival (76% to 63% at 5 years, p = .008) and better metastases-free survival (88% to 82% at 5 years, p = .04). There was no difference between the groups in local control. The lymphangiography evaluation of pelvic nodes was clearly inferior for demonstration of the absence of pelvic node metastasis as reflected by reduced survival and increased metastasis.
**PMID 3597142 -- '''Correlation of radiotherapeutic parameters and treatment related morbidity--analysis of RTOG Study 77-06.''' (Pilepich, IJRBOP 1987). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Within the range of pelvic doses used in this study a significant dose effect could not be detected. Total doses to the prostate of more than 7000 cGy were associated with an increased risk of rectal bleeding. Certain treatment techniques, (AP/PA irradiation of the pelvic lymphatics) were associated with an increased incidence of bowel complications.
**PMID 6483687 -- '''Surgical staging in carcinoma of the prostate: the RTOG experience. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.''' (Pilepich, Prostate 1984). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The incidence of postirradiation lymphedema was found to be strongly dependent upon the extent of dissection. 
**PMID 6346857 -- '''Preliminary report on phase III RTOG studies of extended-field irradiation in carcinoma of the prostate.''' (Pilepich, Am J Clin Oncol 1983). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The use of paraaortic fields in RTOG 75-06 and pelvic fields in RTOG 77-06 have not resulted in a significant increase of GI or GU morbidity at this time. The only statistically significant trend was the incidence of postirradiation genital and lower extremity edema which strongly correlated with the extent of staging lymphadenectomy. 
**PMID 7155987 -- '''Some questions raised by histologic study of RTOG protocols 75-06 and 77-06 as illustrated by selected samples.''' (Terry, Prostate 1982).

**'''2000''' PMID 10894874 -- &quot;Survival advantage from higher-dose radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer treated on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials.&quot; (Valicenti, JCO 2000). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; These data demonstrate that higher-dose radiation therapy can significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer in men with clinically localized disease. This survival benefit is restricted to men with poorly differentiated cancers.
**'''1999''' PMID 10022702 -- &quot;Long-term survival after radiotherapy alone: radiation therapy oncology group prostate cancer trials.&quot; (Roach M, J Urol 1999). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; In the first 10 years Gleason score was the single most important predictor of death. Gleason score should be incorporated into the current clinical staging system.
**'''1999''' Valicenti R, Lu JD, Grignon D, et al.: &quot;Radiation dose-response is Gleason score dependent on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prostate cancer trials.&quot; [Abstract] Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 18: A1194, 311a, 1999.
**'''1998''' PMID 9531359 -- &quot;Ten-year outcomes for pathologic node-positive patients treated in RTOG 75-06.&quot; (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1998). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; A small fraction of node-positive patients are cured at 10-year follow-up by radiation therapy (2 of 90 with PSA +3 of 90 by clinical endpoints). Innovative treatment programs should be directed at node-positive patients in an effort to improve the fraction cured.
**'''1998''' Roach M, Lu J, Pilepich M, et al.: &quot;Long term survival in 1500 men treated for prostate cancer with radiotherapy alone (XRT): based on radiation therapy oncology group protocols 7706, 7506, 8531, and 8610.&quot; [Abstract] Proceedings of the American Urological Association 1998.
**'''1998''' [http://www.asco.org/ac/1,1003,_12-002643-00_18-0031-00_19-0013421,00.asp ASCO Abstract] -- &quot;Prognostic subgroups predict disease specific survival for men treated with radiotherapy alone on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) prostate cancer trials.&quot; (Roach M, ASCO 1998; Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 17: A1201, 312a, 1998.). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Recognition of these four prognostic subgroups should allow estimates to be made of the long term DSS of men treated with radiotherapy alone for CAP.
**'''1996''' Hanks, G. E., Buzydlowski, J., Perez, C. A., Emami, B., Rubin, P., Sause, W., Earle, J., Rotman, M., Roach, M. and Russell, A.: &quot;The Ten Year Outcome of Pathologic and Imaging Node Positive Patients Treated with Irradiation In RTOG 75-06.&quot; AUA, J Urol, 1996.
**'''1995''' PMID 7591889 -- &quot;Correlation of survival with quantitative tissue staining of prostate specific acid phosphatase in patients with prostate carcinoma by using microscopic image analysis: a preliminary report of correlative studies on RTOG protocols 75-06, 77-06, and 83-07.&quot; (Zhou R, IJRBOP 1995). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Quantitative image analysis of the IPSAP stain predicts survival in patients treated with external beam radiotherapy with and without prior hormonal therapy
**'''1994''' PMID 8270458 -- &quot;Patterns of Care and RTOG studies in prostate cancer: long-term survival, hazard rate observations, and possibilities of cure.&quot; (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1994). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; These data make a strong argument for the long-term cure of prostate cancer by external beam radiation, and support the continued use and study of radiation therapy as a curative modality in prostate cancer. No similar national data is available for any other method of management.
**'''1992''' PMID 1587749 -- &quot;Comparison of pathologic and clinical evaluation of lymph nodes in prostate cancer: implications of RTOG data for patient management and trial design and stratification.&quot; (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1992). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The clinical determination of nodal status, therefore, has no prognostic value in contrast to pathologic determination and should not be used for stratifying patients in clinical trials. The CT scans often used to evaluate nodal status are more useful if delayed until they can be done as part of the treatment planning process where the CT has value. When imaging tests suggest positive lymph nodes in prostate cancer patients, the imaging finding is confirmed by biopsy.
**'''1991''' PMID 1917621 -- &quot;The effect of overall treatment time on the outcome of definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma: the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 75-06 and 77-06 experience.&quot; (Lai PP, IJRBOP 1991). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The incidence of late complications was not related to the number of elapsed treatment days. Therefore, the overall treatment time does not have an impact on the outcome of definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma. It is hypothesized that prostate carcinoma behaves as late-reacting tissue in which there is little, if any, accelerated repopulation of clonogenic tumor cells during the later half of a protracted course of radiotherapy.
**'''1989''' PMID 2463874 -- &quot;Correlation of prostate-specific acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen immunocytochemistry with survival in prostate carcinoma.&quot; (Hammond ME, Cancer 1989). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; In those patients who subsequently relapsed and were subjected to hormonal manipulation, there appeared to be a higher likelihood of response to hormones with intense prostate-specific acid phosphatase staining.
**'''1987''' PMID 3318090 -- &quot;Prognostic significance of nodal involvement in locally advanced (stage C) carcinoma of prostate--RTOG experience.&quot; (Pilepich MV, Urology 1987).
**'''1987''' PMID 3546223 -- &quot;Correlation of pre-treatment transurethral resection and prognosis in patients with stage C carcinoma of the prostate treated with definitive radiotherapy--RTOG experience.&quot; (Pilepich MV, IJRBOP 1987). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;u&gt; The TUR population fared significantly worse for all four end-points (rate of locoregional failure, incidence of distant metastases, disease-free survival, and survival).
**'''1987''' PMID 3558026 -- &quot;Prognostic factors in carcinoma of the prostate--analysis of RTOG study 75-06.&quot; (Pilepich MV, IJRBOP 1987). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Correlation of the assessed variables and the study endpoints (local control, incidence of distant metastases, NED survival, survival) singled out the degree of histological differentiation as the most powerful prognostic factor for all the endpoints.
**'''1987''' PMID 3494005 -- &quot;Correlation of radiotherapeutic parameters and treatment related morbidity in carcinoma of the prostate--analysis of RTOG study 75-06.&quot; (Pilepich MV, IJRBOP 1987). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The study design entailed randomization to either pelvic irradiation followed by a prostate boost or pelvic and periaortic irradiation followed by a prostate boost. Periaortic irradiation was not associated with a significantly increased incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea. No correlation between the total dose to the regional lymphatics (ranging from 4400 to 5100 cGy) and the incidence of bowel and bladder injuries could be established. Doses to the prostate in excess of 7000 cGy have not resulted in a significantly increased incidence of bladder injuries, but have been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea. The techniques of pelvic irradiation did not seem to significantly influence the incidence of bowel or bladder complications. The technique of delivery of the prostatic boost did seem to influence the incidence of bowel injuries. This refers to the lateral boost technique and the perineal boost technique which have been associated with a higher incidence of diarrhea.
**'''1986''' PMID 3514555 -- &quot;Extended field (periaortic) irradiation in carcinoma of the prostate--analysis of RTOG 75-06.&quot; (Pilepich MV, IJRBOP 1986). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The results of the study revealed no apparent benefit of elective periaortic irradiation in patients with detectable disease confined to the pelvis.
**'''1984''' PMID 6483687 -- &quot;Surgical staging in carcinoma of the prostate: the RTOG experience. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.&quot; (Pilepich, Prostate 1984). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The incidence of postirradiation lymphedema was found to be strongly dependent upon the extent of dissection.
**'''1984''' PMID 6386761 -- &quot;Treatment-related morbidity in phase III RTOG studies of extended-field irradiation for carcinoma of the prostate.&quot; (Pilepich, IJROBP 1984). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;In most instances of treatment-related morbidity, the symptoms were recorded during the first several months to 1 year following completion of treatment. Late occurrences, however, were not uncommon in certain types of radiation-produced injuries, such as proctitis, hematuria, and urethral strictures. Resolution of symptoms has been observed in a large proportion of patients including those with late occurrences of treatment-related morbidity, although the probability and the pattern of resolution differed considerably from one type of morbidity to another. Symptoms of cystitis are more likely to abate than those of proctitis. In patients who develop symptoms of proctitis the probability of persistence of symptoms beyond the second year following occurrence has been estimated at 20%-30%. Hematuria and symptoms secondary to urethral strictures seem to be even more likely to recur or persist, while genital and leg edema remain chronic in the majority of patients.
**'''1983''' PMID 6346857 -- &quot;Preliminary report on phase III RTOG studies of extended-field irradiation in carcinoma of the prostate.&quot; (Pilepich, Am J Clin Oncol 1983). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; The use of paraaortic fields in RTOG 75-06 and pelvic fields in RTOG 77-06 have not resulted in a significant increase of GI or GU morbidity at this time. The only statistically significant trend was the incidence of postirradiation genital and lower extremity edema which strongly correlated with the extent of staging lymphadenectomy. 
**'''1982''' PMID 7155987 -- &quot;Some questions raised by histologic study of RTOG protocols 75-06 and 77-06 as illustrated by selected samples.&quot; (Terry, Prostate 1982).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Glossary of Art Movements'''

===Abstract Expressionism===
American art movement of the 1940s that emphasized form and color within a non-representational framework.  Jackson Pollock initiated the revolutionary technique of splattering the paint directly on canvas to achieve his interpretation of perfection.

===Art Deco===
A 1920s style characterized by setbacks, zigzag forms, and the use of chrome and plastic ornamentation. New York's Chrysler Building is an architectural example of the style.

===Art Nouveau===
An 1890s style in architecture, graphic arts, and interior decoration characterized by writhing forms, curving lines, and asymmetrical organization. Some critics regard the style as the first stage of modern architecture.

===Ashcan School===
A group of New Jersey realist artists at the beginning of the twentieth century who rejected the formal subject matter of the academy and focused on gritty urban scenes and ordinary, even ugly, aspects of life.

===Assemblage (Collage)===
Forms of modern sculpture and painting utilizing readymades, found objects, and pasted fragments to form an abstract composition. Louise Nevelson's boxlike enclosures, each with its own composition of assembled objects, illustrate the style in sculpture. Pablo Picasso and Braque developed the technique of cutting and pasting natural or manufactured materials to a painted or unpainted surface.Picasso incorporated elements such as wallpaper pieces and chair caneing.

===Barbizon School (Landscape Painting)===
A group of 19th-century French painters who rejected idealized landscape painting and sought a more informal, realistic portrayal of nature. They were heavily influenced by 17th-century Dutch genre painting. Theodore Rousseau, one of the principal figures of the group, was a proponent of outdoor painting, based on direct observation of one's surroundings. 

===Baroque===
European art and architecture of the 17th and 18th centuries. Giovanni Bernini, a major exponent of the style, believed in the union of the arts of architecture, painting, and sculpture to overwhelm the spectator with ornate and highly dramatized themes. Although the style originated in Rome as the instrument of the Church, it spread throughout Europe in such monumental creations as the Palace of Versailles.

===Beaux Arts===
Elaborate and formal architectural style characterized by symmetry and an abundance of sculptured ornamentation. New York's old Custom House at Bowling Green is an example of the style.

===Black or African-American Art===
The work of American artists of African descent produced in various styles characterized by a mood of protest and a search for identity and historical roots. See Romare Bearden.

===Classicism===
A form of art derived from the study of Greek and Roman styles characterized by harmony, balance, and serenity. In contrast, the Romantic Movement gave free rein to the artist's imagination and to the love of the exotic.

===Conceptual art===
An art form originating in the late 1960´s. In conceptual art, the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work.
It has had a prominent effect on art production and art theory until this day.

===Constructivism===
A form of sculpture using wood, metal, glass, and modern industrial materials expressing the technological society. The mobiles of Alexander Calder are examples of the movement.

===Cubism===
Early 20th-century French movement marked by a revolutionary departure from representational art. Pablo Picasso and Georges Bracque penetrated the surface of objects, stressing basic abstract geometric forms that presented the object from many angles simultaneously.

===Dada===
A product of the turbulent and cynical post-World War I period, this anti-art movement extolled the irrational, the absurd, the nihilistic, and the nonsensical. The reproduction of Mona Lisa adorned with a mustache is a famous example. The movement is regarded as a precursor of Surrealism. Some critics regard HAPPENINGS as a recent development of Dada. This movement incorporates environment and spectators as active and important ingredients in the production of random events.

===Expressionism===
A 20th-century European art movement that stresses the expression of emotion and the inner vision of the artist rather than the exact representation of nature. Distorted lines and shapes and exaggerated colors are used for emotional impact. Vincent Van Gogh is regarded as the precursor of this movement.

===Fauvism===
The name “wild beasts” was given to the group of early 20th-century French painters because their work was characterized by distortion and violent colors. Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault were leaders of this group.

===Futurism===
This early 20th-century movement originating in Italy glorified the machine age and attempted to represent machines and figures in motion. The aesthetics of Futurism affirmed the beauty of technological society.

===Genre===
This French word meaning “type” now refers to paintings that depict scenes of everyday life without any attempt at idealization. Genre paintings can be found in all ages, but the Dutch productions of peasant and tavern scenes are typical.

===Impressionism===
Late 19th-century French school dedicated to defining transitory visual impressions painted directly from nature, with light and color of primary importance. If the atmosphere changed, a totally different picture would emerge. It was not the object or event that counted but the visual impression as caught at a certain time of day under a certain light. Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro were leaders of the movement.

===Intentism===
A movement that began to re-establish the role of the artist in an artwork. Intentists believe that all meaning is the outworking of intention

===Mannerism===
A mid-16th-century movement, Italian in origin, although El Greco was a major practitioner of the style. The human figure, distorted and elongated, was the most frequent subject.

===Minimalism===
Minimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, where the work is stripped down to its most fundamental features.

===Modern Ink Painting===
A late-20st-century and early-21st-century movement, Modern ink painting is an emerging style that reaches beyond traditional Asian ink painting in scope and treatment of a minimalist-art.  Contemporary ink painting is developing and establishing the recognition it deserves and gaining its own place among the major pictorial works of the world. This global contemporary art movement represents sort of amalgamation of the Western visual art problems and practices with those of East Asia. Best known European contribution to the Modern ink painting is Alfred Freddy Krupa.

===Neoclassicism===
An 18th-century reaction to the excesses of Baroque and Rococo, this European art movement tried to recreate the art of Greece and Rome by imitating the ancient classics both in style and subject matter.

===Neoimpressionism===
A school of painting associated with George Seurat and his followers in late 19th-century France that sought to make Impressionism more precise and formal. They employed a technique of juxtaposing dots of primary colors to achieve brighter secondary colors, with the mixture left to the eye to complete (pointillism).

===Op Art===
The 1960s movement known as Optical Painting is characterized by geometrical forms that create an optical illusion in which the eye is required to blend the colors at a certain distance.

===Pop Art===
In this return to representational art, the artist returns to the world of tangible objects in a reaction against abstraction. Materials are drawn from the everyday world of popular culture—comic strips, canned goods, and science fiction.

===Realism===
A development in mid-19th-century France lead by Gustave Courbet. Its aim was to depict the customs, ideas, and appearances of the time using scenes from everyday life.

===Rococo===
A French style of interior decoration developed during the reign of Louis XV consisting mainly of asymmetrical arrangements of curves in paneling, porcelain, and gold and silver objects. The characteristics of ornate curves, prettiness, and gaiety can also be found in the painting and sculpture of the period.

===Surrealism===
A further development of Collage, Cubism, and Dada, this 20th-century movement stresses the weird, the fantastic, and the dreamworld of the subconscious.

===Symbolism===
As part of a general European movement in the latter part of the 19th century, it was closely allied with Symbolism in literature. It marked a turning away from painting by observation to transforming fact into a symbol of inner experience. Gauguin was an early practitioner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fijian language uses the same Latin alphabet as English. Fijian pronunciation is not very difficult for the English speakers to learn. The Fijian vowels are pronounced as they are written. However, some consonants are pronounced differently from English: 

*B is pronounced &quot;mb&quot; as in 'bamboo'.
*C is a lisped &quot;th&quot; as in 'feather'.
*D is pronounced &quot;nd&quot; as in 'Andrew'.
*Dr is pronounced &quot;ndr&quot; as in 'laundry'.
*G is pronounced &quot;ng&quot; as in 'sing'.
*Q is pronounced &quot;ng&quot; as in 'mango'.
*V is always pronounced bilabially.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two important concepts when considering strength training. First, strength training does not necessarily mean that your body will get huge and bulky with muscle. Second, strength training, if done appropriately is important in preventing injury, but if done irresponsibly can cause injury.

Strength is a subject measure. There are many types of strength, such as endurance, pushing, holding, throwing, snapping, and pulling. These strengths are trained for in different ways. For strength irregardless of speed, slow and heavy weight training is the most effective. While, for speed strength fast, high-intensity, exercise is the most effective. It is very difficult to become both fast and extremely strong, they are usually incompatible for the muscles to handle given strength usually increases muscle bulk. Fortunately, the human body can handle being very fast and moderately strong as well as very strong and moderately fast.

The first concentration is building pure strength regardless of speed or muscular endurance. The most effective way to do this is by free weight training. This is one of the main objectives in both body building and powerlifting. The main principle is to set goals to slowly increase the amount of weight your body can lift.

For example, I have a goal to bench press 200 lbs with 8 repetitions for 3 sets and I can only bench press 140 lbs with 8 repetitions and 3 sets. I might start off by increasing the weight of my bench press by 5 lbs. When increasing the weight, I may only be able to bench press 6 repetitions. The next time I am at the gym, I will set the goal to do 7 repetitions with 145 lbs, and the next time 8. After I reach 8, I can increase it another 5 lbs, and so on until I reach my goal of 200 lbs. 

Whereas, with muscle endurance training, you train your muscle to constantly work. For this type of training, increasing the total amount of repetitions or sets is a good way to increase muscle endurance. In fact, good muscle endurance is important for muscle strength. Many professionals recommend alternating weeks of strength training and muscular endurance training in a strength training regimen.

For speed training, slowly lifting weights simply won't work. You have to use explosive exercises, like sprints, jumps, and pushes. Explosiveness is especially important in sports. A few examples are in baseball explosive strength is used when swinging a bat; in hockey, when taking a shot; in boxing, when throwing a punch; even in surfing, explosive strength is used to balance on a wave. 

This brings me to my next point in strength training: setting sub-goals to your main goal. Basically, you didn't learn to run right away you had to learn your first step, then your first walk, until finally, you trained your body to run. It other words, you need to create small successive steps to reach your goal. It makes a daunting task like increasing your bench press by 60 lbs into a doable endeavor. It is important to set doable sub-goals as well, and when you accomplish those sub-goals it gives you motivation to continue working toward your main goal. In fact, the more sub-goals you set for yourself, the more effective training you will have since you will feel accomplished more often than feeling a failure which keeps self-esteem high.

Goal setting is important in anything, and especially important in building strength, but there are specific things to weight training that should be adhered too. First, don't worry if you are weak at first. In reality, everyone has to start off and most of the time, people are weak when they start and even the massively strong people understand what it's like to just start off which makes them encouraging and non-judgmental. Second, strength building is a slow process and requires hard work. If you push yourself too hard you could injure your muscles, joints, and tendons for life. It's not worth being stupid and lifting more than your body can handle, just take it slow and your gains will come in time.

==Types of exercises==
*Benchpress
*Pushups
*Chinups
*Bicep curls
*Tricep press

== Overload and overtraining ==
Our body is capable of performing at much higher intensities than what it can sustain for long. This is called peak energy output. When lifting weights, for example, we can sometimes lift weights that are almost at dangerous levels for our present state. We might not realize that we are pushing ourselves to those high levels because the body seems to be able to do it. 

It happened many years back, I was doing wrist curls. I was lifting almost 100 Lbs. When I look back at it now, I say to myself &quot;how foolish that was?&quot;. That day I tore a ligament (or tendon - don't know the exact technical term) in my wrist. It has been years from that day but I still can't lift 20 lbs. using my wrists without pain. 

Sometimes it is too easy to push ourselves and we don't realize that we are crossing the delicate line. 

It is better to remain moderate. One injury can cast a huge setback for years. It is better to gain slow and steady - from my own experience.

Another hindrance to health is overtraining. Overtraining occurs when you literally exercise too much, or too hard. This happens often with people who weight train. This is because they will lift weights on the same part of the body two or more days in a row, without giving time for the muscles to rest and recuperate. This isn't limited to weight trainers, since an intense exercise can overwork the human body. It is important to give your body adequate rest.

Overtraining harms your body so much that it makes you weaker, takes time to heal, and lowers your immune system. It is counterproductive! Overtraining often happens because people think that they must &quot;feel the pain&quot; to accomplish their exercise goals. This simply isn't true, if you exercise appropriately you should not feel pain, in fact, some professionals recommend not even working out when sore. Although, others think that you shouldn't work out as hard when sore, but, working out is beneficial since it helps to move lactic acid out of the muscles.

== What is adequate rest? ==
Adequate rest differs from person to person given differences in metabolism and genetics. One person may be able to curl dumbbells every two days without overtraining the muscles, while another person can only train them once a week. Usually, the longer a person has been training and the younger they are, the less time they need between training sessions. As well, the harder you work during a training session, the longer you will need to rest before training again. It is important to remember that the resting period is reduced by proper nutrition and sleep.

Generally, if weight training, a person should, at minimum, wait 48 hours before working out the same muscle group and if body building, the wait should be extended to 72 hours. Cardio exercise can be performed every 24-hours for most people. With both, one day a week should be used to rest without any exercise at all.

The best way to figure out your training threshold is to start off with light training and slowly increase the amount each successive training session. This will allow you to figure it out without the worry of injury or overtraining.

'''RTOG 97-14 ([[Radiation Oncology/Prostate|PROSTATE]], BREAST, [[Radiation Oncology/Palliation|PALLIATION]])'''
*''Title:'' Randomized Trial of Palliative Radiation Therapy For Osseous Metastases: A Study of Palliation of Symptoms and Quality of Life
*''Objectives:''
**(1) To determine whether 8 Gy in a single fraction provides equivalent pain and narcotic relief compared to 30 Gy in 10 fractions for patients with painful bone metastases.
**(2) To determine the frequency and duration of pain relief and narcotic relief for each of the two treatment arms.
**(3) To determine the effect on quality of life measures for each of the two treatment arms.
**(4) To determine the incidence of pathologic fracture within the treatment field for 8 Gy in a single fraction compared to 30 Gy in 10 fractions.
**(5) To evaluate resource utilization and create a model to compare resources/costs for each of the two protocol treatment arms.
**(6) To correlate survival time with physician prediction of survival, Karnofsky performance status, and FACT quality of life score to determine which gives the best estimation of actual survival time in this group of patients.
**(7) To determine cost-effectiveness of therapies in terms of cost/quality adjusted life years.
*''[http://www.rtog.org/members/protocols/97-14/97-14.pdf Protocol]:''
**''Arm (1):'' 3 Gy x 10 (30 Gy in 2 weeks)
**''Arm (2):'' 8 Gy x 1 (8 Gy single dose)
*''Eligibility:''   
**Breast or prostate malignancy
**Radiographic evidence of bone mets, excluding skull, hands, and feet
*''Enrollment Target:'' 898 patients
*''Activated:'' February 1, 1998
*''Closed:'' April 30, 2001
*''Conclusion:''
**'''2005''' PMID 15928300 -- '''Randomized trial of short- versus long-course radiotherapy for palliation of painful bone metastases.''' (Hartsell WF, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Jun 1;97(11):798-804.) &lt;U&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Both regimens equivalent for pain control and narcotic relief at 3 months. 8/1 less acute toxicity but higher retreatment

** PMID 19632065 -- '''Functional interference clusters in cancer patients with bone metastases: a secondary analysis of RTOG 9714.''' (Chow E, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Apr;76(5):1507-11.) &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; Palliative radiotherapy is effective in reducing bone pain. Functional interference component clusters exist in patients treated for bone metastases. These clusters changed over time in this study, possibly attributable to treatment. Further research is needed to examine these effects.

Further consideration should be given to tailoring treatment by gender.

Analysis of RTOG 9714''' (Hartsell WF, ASTRO 2004). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; KPS, FACT scores, and physician predicted survival all are correlated with actual survival. Physicians on this study were able to predict which patients would have longer survival times, although the prediction of survival was optimistic compared to actual survival by an average of 3 months.

Utility scores increased significantly from baseline to 3 mos. for each of the treatment arms. The increased utility of changes in emotion on the 30Gy arm may indicate a benefit from increased social support gained with longer treatment time. Cognition decreases equally on both arms congruent with the literature on metastasis. Value added of utilities to standard quality of life and symptom assessment is a quantitative valuation of improvement.

Pain and narcotic relief is equivalent for both 30 Gy in 10 fractions and 8 Gy in a single fraction. At 3 months follow−up, there is no difference between the two treatment arms, regardless of stratification. Treatment was well tolerated with few adverse effects.

'''Mead''' is a fermented alcoholic beverage made of honey, water, and yeast. It is sometimes known as &quot;honey wine&quot; (for obvious reasons) and is generally pronounced &quot;meed&quot; (IPA: /miːd/), though South Africans usually pronounce it &quot;med&quot;, to rhyme with &quot;red&quot; (IPA: /mɛd/).

Mead can have a wide range of flavors, depending on the source of the honey, additives including fruit and spices, the yeast employed during fermentation, and aging procedure. Mead can be difficult to find commercially, though some producers have been successful marketing it.

Many meads retain some measure of the sweetness of the original honey, and some can even be considered as dessert wines. Drier meads are also available, and some producers offer sparkling meads, which (like champagne) can make for a delightful celebratory toast.

A mead that also contains spices (like cloves, cinnamon or nutmeg) or herbs (such as oregano or even lavender or chamomile) is called ''metheglin''. A mead that contains fruit (such as strawberry, blackcurrant or even rose-hips) is called ''melomel'' and was also used as a delicious way to store summer produce for the winter. Mulled mead is a popular winter holiday drink, where mead is flavoured with spices and warmed, traditionally by having a hot poker plunged into it. ''Hippocras'' is spiced grape wine sweetened with honey. A grape-based wine with added honey is called a ''pyment''. ''Cyser'' is made with apple juice and honey; ''braggot'' or ''bracket'' is made with malted barley and honey.

Production of mead for private consumption should be considered to be submitted to the same regulations as the production of [[Cookbook:Wine|grape wine]]. See also the numerous warnings on the [[Cookbook:Alcoholic_Drink#Warnings|alcoholic drink]] page.

==Equipment==
[[Image:Homebrew Fermenter.jpg|right|thumb|Fermenter with airlock fitted]]
Mead is made in a fermentation vessel, preferably a glass carboy, with an airlock and a rubber bung. These items can usually be found at a brewer's supply store. The ingredients of mead are honey, filtered water, and yeast. Fruit or spices are optional.

Mead should be made in sanitized equipment to ensure food safety. Potassium metabisulphite is a common sanitizing agent. Those who are allergic to sulphites can use other sanitizing methods. Failure to remove all traces of this chemical from the equipment may result in poisonous or otherwise undrinkable mead.

==Ingredients==

*3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] per [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallon]] (U.S.). (For example, 15 pounds of honey are used with a 5 gallon (U.S.) carboy.)
*1 pound of [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]. (optional)
*1 packet of dry winemaker's [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (Lalvin EC1118, K1V1116 or similar) as well as yeast nutrient.

==Procedure==

Some mead makers prefer to create a starter culture by preparing a mixture of one cup of room temperature sanitized fruit juice and the freeze dried winemaking yeast and placing it into a smaller one [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] sanitized container fitted with a rubber stopper and airlock for a day or two until the mixture is bubbling. This container is kept at room temperature out of direct sunlight. This starter culture will cause the fermentation below to begin with vigor and may prevent the mead from failing to ferment.

Honey is slowly added to a large pot half-full with water while heating. There is a common disagreement among mead makers as to whether you should boil the honey or not; mead makers have had success with either method. Boiling will alter the flavor, but will enhance the clarity of the finished mead. As the mead is heated over medium heat, it will nearly boil after the honey has been completely dissolved.

After a time of heating the honey (which helps it dissolve and can also pasteurize it), the mixture is cooled to between (170°F/76°C) and (140°F/60°C) and the raisins are added. The mixture continues to cool, then is transferred to the carboy. Once it has cooled to room temperature (68°F/20°C), yeast which has been rehydrated is added to the honey/water mixture (must) and the airlock is put on. After being placed in a cool (68°F/20°C), dark place for a few hours or a day, the airlock should start to allow bubbles to escape. This is waste carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and shows that the yeast is processing the sugar into alcohol. The raisins rise to the surface of the fermenting mixture. If they block the airlock, the mead maker will have to rack. Stirring or agitating the mixture is avoided, as it may cause the liquid to rise up and spill out of the airlock.

After a four to six week period the mead maker may want to rack the mead into a second sanitized carboy. An airlock is not necessary during primary (aerobic) fermentation. This racking will clear out the lees and allow the mead to clear faster. The mead is siphoned into the second carboy via a sanitized tube, usually filled it with sterile water to start the siphon. The mead is siphoned carefully to avoid splashing as excess oxygen at this point may cause an unpleasant taste in the final product. An airlock is placed on the second carboy. It is imperative that sterile conditions be maintained while the carboys are open to avoid infection. The mead is racked in another 3 months or when all signs of fermentation have stopped (usually when the airlock doesn't produce any bubbles for a long period of time&amp;mdash;typically over 30 seconds between bubbles) and your mead has cleared. Excessive racking will promote oxidation, resulting in an undrinkable mead. The carboy is clear enough when it is possible to read a newspaper through it. The mead will then need to age, usually one year, and anywhere up five or more. Bulk aging can be done done in a tertiary carboy, but bottle aging is also common.

Then next step is to bottle the mead. Mead is generally sealed in sanitized bottles using airtight caps or quality corks. If the fermentation is not complete, pressure will build up inside the sealed bottles and cause them to explode. Mead is generally aged for at least 6 months in the bottle before drinking.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==The basic idea of the fundamental group==
[[Image:Torus.png|thumb|Torus]]
[[Image:Sphere-wireframe.png|thumb|Sphere]]
An easy way to approach the concept of fundamental group is to start with a concrete example. Let us consider the 2-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; and the surface of the torus.

Let us start thinking about two types of loops of the torus (paths starting and ending at the same point). It seems that a path around the &quot;arm&quot; of the torus is substantially different from a “local” simple loop: one cannot be deformed into the other. On the other hand, in the sphere it seems that all the loops can be deformed into any other loop. The set of &quot;types of loops&quot; in the two spaces is different: the torus seems to have a richer set of &quot;types of loops&quot; than the spherical surface. This type of approach constitutes the base of the definition of fundamental group and explains essential differences between different kinds of topological spaces. The fundamental group makes this idea mathematically rigorous.

==Definition of fundamental group==
'''Definition:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space and let p and q be points in X. Then two paths &lt;math&gt;f: [0,1] \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g: [0,1] \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; are considered equivalent if there is a homotopy &lt;math&gt;H: [0,1]^2 \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that H(x,a) is a path from p to q for any &lt;math&gt;a \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. It is easily verified that this is an equivalence relation.

'''Definition:''' Define the composition of paths &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; from x to y and then &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; from y to z to be simply the same adjunction of paths as we had in the section on path connectedness:

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} f_1(2x) &amp; \text{if } x \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]\\ f_2(2x-1) &amp; \text{if } x \in [\frac{1}{2},1]\\  \end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

We shall denote the composition of two paths f(x) and g(x) as f(x)*g(x).

'''Definition:''' Let &lt;math&gt;f: [0,1] \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; to be a path. Define the inverse path (not to be confused with the inverse function) as &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)=f(1-x)&lt;/math&gt;, the path in the opposite direction.

'''Definition:''' Let X be a topological space, and let p be a point in X. Then define &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; to be the constant path &lt;math&gt;f: [0,1] \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; where f(x)=p.

Now consider the set of equivalence groups of paths. Define the composition of two equivalence groups to be the equivalence group of the composition of any two paths. Define the inverse of an equivalence group to be the equivalence group of the inverse of any within the equivalence group. Define &lt;math&gt;[C_p]&lt;/math&gt; to be the equivalence group containing &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;.

We can easily check that these operations are well-defined.

Now, in a fundamental group, we will work with loops. Therefore, we define the equivalence, composition and inverse of loops to be the same as the definition as that of paths, and the composition and inverse of the equivalence classes also to be the same.

'''Definition:''' The set of equivalence classes of loops at the base point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, is a group under the operation of adjoining paths. This group is called '''fundamental group''' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; at the base point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to demonstrate that this is a group, we need to prove:

1) associtivity: &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]*([\beta]*[\gamma])=([\alpha]*[\beta])*[\gamma]&lt;/math&gt;;

2) identity: &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]*[1]=[1]*[\alpha]=[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;;

3) inverse: &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]*[\overline{\alpha}]=[\overline{\alpha}]*[\alpha]=[1]&lt;/math&gt;.

1) It is quite obvious that when you have a path from a to b, and then b to c, and finally c to d, then the adjunction of the paths from a to b and b to d is the same as the path you get when you adjoin the paths from a to c and then c to d.

In fact, an explicit homotopy on &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]*([\beta]*[\gamma])&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;([\alpha]*[\beta])*[\gamma]&lt;/math&gt; can be given by the following formula:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(t,s) = \begin{cases} \alpha(\frac{4t}{s+1}), &amp; \mbox{if }0\le t\le\frac{s+1}{4}\\\beta(4t-s-1), &amp; \mbox{if }\frac{s+1}{4}\le t\le\frac{s+2}{4}\\\gamma(\frac{4t-s-2}{2-s}), &amp; \mbox{if }\frac{s+2}{4}\le t\le 1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;.

2) &lt;math&gt;[C_{x_0}]&lt;/math&gt; is the identity. One can easily verify that the product of this constant loop with another loop is homotopic to the original loop.

3) The inverse of the equivalence relation as defined before serves as the inverse within the group. The fact that the composition of the two paths f(x) and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the constant path can easily be verified with the following homotopy:

&lt;math&gt;h(x,y)=f(xy)*f_{-1}(xy)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Box &lt;/math&gt;

==Dependence on the Base Point==
We now have our fundamental group, but it would be of interest to see how the fundamental group depends on the base point, since, as we have defined it, the fundamental group depends on the base point. However, due to the very important theorem that in any path-connected topological space, all of its fundamental groups are isomorphic, we are able to speak of the ''fundamental group of the topological space'' for any path-connected topological space.

===Proof===
Let´s take &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1\in X&lt;/math&gt; in the same path-component of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, it´s possible to find a relation between &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,x_1)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;h:\left [ 0,1 \right ]\to X&lt;/math&gt; be a path from &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{h}(s)=1-s&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; back to &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. The map &lt;math&gt;\beta_h:\pi_1(X,x_1)\to \pi_1(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\beta_h[f]=[hf\overline{h}]&lt;/math&gt;is an isomorphism. Thus if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is path-connected, the group &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is, up to isomorphism, independent of the choice of basepoint &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

When all fundamental groups of a topological space are isomorphic, the notation &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is abbreviated to &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition:''' A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called simply-connected if it is path-connected and has trivial fundamental group.

==The fundamental group of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;==
This section is dedicated to the calculation of the fundamental group of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; that we can consider contained in the complex topological space. One more time we can start with a visual approach.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Imagem2.JPG]]&lt;/center&gt; 
It's easy to imagine that a loop around the circle is not homotopic to the trivial loop. It's also easy to imagine that a loop that gives two complete turns is not homotopic to one that gives only one. Simple intuition seems to be that fundamental group of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; is related with number of turns. However, the rigorous calculation of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^1)&lt;/math&gt; involves some difficulties.

We define &lt;math&gt;p:\mathbb{R}\to S^1\sub\mathbb{C},p(t)=e^{2i\pi t}&lt;/math&gt;. It's possible to demonstrate the following results:


'''Lemma 1: '''Let &lt;math&gt;f:\left [ 0,1 \right ]\to S^1\sub\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a path. Then there exists &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}:\left [ 0,1 \right ]\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p\circ\overline{f}=f&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;f(0)=x_0\land z_0\in p^{-1}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}&lt;/math&gt; is unique, called a '''lift''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Imagem3.JPG]]&lt;/center&gt;


'''Lemma 2: '''Let &lt;math&gt;F:\left [ 0,1 \right ]\times\left [ 0,1 \right ]\to S^1\sub\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a homotopy on paths with start point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;z_0\in p^{-1}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then exists only one homotopy &lt;math&gt;\overline{F}:\left [ 0,1 \right ]\times\left [ 0,1 \right ]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; on paths with start point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p\circ\overline{F}=F&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Note:''' These lemmas allow to guarantee that homotopic loops have homotopic lifts.

For more information see [[w:Homotopy_lifting_property|Wikipedia]].


'''Theorem:'''&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^1,(1,0))\simeq\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be a loop with base &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]\in\pi_1(S^1,(1,0))&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;z_0=0&lt;/math&gt; and define
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^1,(1,0))\to\mathbb{Z}\;\;\;v([\alpha])=\overline{\alpha}(1).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The good definition of this application comes from the fact that homotopic loops defined in &lt;math&gt;\left [ 0,1 \right ]&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; have homotopic lifts. We have &lt;math&gt;p(\overline{\alpha}(1))=\alpha(1)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;.So, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha}(1)=k&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;v([\alpha])\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

1) &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is surjective. For &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; we define the loop &lt;math&gt;\alpha_N(t)=e^{2i\pi Nt}&lt;/math&gt;. We then have &lt;math&gt;\overline\alpha_N(t)=Nt&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v([\alpha_N])=N&lt;/math&gt;;

2) &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is injective. Let &lt;math&gt;v([\alpha])=v([\beta])&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;(\overline{\alpha}(1)=\overline{\beta}(1))\land(\overline{\alpha}(0)=\overline{\beta}(0)=0)&lt;/math&gt;. We then have that &lt;math&gt;F(t,s)=p((1-s)\overline{\alpha}(t)+s\overline{\beta}(t))&lt;/math&gt; is a homotopy on &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, or either &lt;math&gt;[\alpha]=[\beta]&lt;/math&gt;;

3) &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism. We want to demonstrate that &lt;math&gt;v([\alpha]*[\beta])=v([\alpha]+v([\beta]&lt;/math&gt;. Let´s consider 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\gamma(t) = \begin{cases} \overline{\alpha}(2t), &amp; \mbox{if }0\le t\le \frac{1}{2} \\ \overline{\beta}(2t-1)+\overline{\alpha}(1), &amp; \mbox{if }\frac{1}{2}\le t\le 1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha}(1)&lt;/math&gt; is an integer and &lt;math&gt;p\circ\gamma=\alpha*\beta&lt;/math&gt;.We then have,&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\overline{\alpha*\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v([\alpha]*[\beta])=v([\alpha*\beta])=\gamma(1)=\overline{\alpha}(1)+\overline{\beta}(1)=v([\alpha])+v([\beta])&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can note that all the loops are homotopic to &lt;math&gt;\alpha_N(t)=e^{2i\pi Nt}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, or either, all the loops, up to homotopy, consist of giving a certain number of turns.

We can think this demonstration through the following scheme:
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Imagem5.JPG]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Box &lt;/math&gt;

==Covering spaces and the fundamental group==
One of the most useful tools in studying fundamental groups is that of a '''covering space'''. Intuitively speaking, a covering space of a given space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is one which 'looks like' a disjoint union of copies of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in a small enough neighborhood of any point of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but not necessarily globally. 

This section will define covering spaces formally, state important '''lifting theorems''' for covering spaces, and then show what the consequences are for fundamental groups.


'''Definition:''' Suppose &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a topological space. A space &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''covering space''' for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if we are given a continuous map &lt;math&gt;p: Z \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; with the following property: for any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an open neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U \ni x&lt;/math&gt; such that 

(i) &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is a disjoint union &lt;math&gt;\coprod_{\alpha \in A}V_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;of open subsets of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;;

(ii) the restriction of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to any of these open subsets &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism from &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; to U.


Unsurprisingly, we call &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; a '''covering map'''. 


'''Example:''' In fact, we've already seen an example of a covering space. In the calculation of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^1)&lt;/math&gt; above, we implicitly made us of the fact that the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a covering space for &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;. The map &lt;math&gt;p: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow S^1, t \mapsto e^{2\pi i t}&lt;/math&gt; is the covering map. How can we check this? Well, recall that &lt;math&gt;e^{2 \pi i t_1} = e^{2 \pi i t_2}&lt;/math&gt; iff the difference &lt;math&gt;t_1 - t_2&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. So, suppose we're given a point &lt;math&gt;x \in S^1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;U_x = S^1 - \{-x\}&lt;/math&gt; - that is, the set consisting of the whole circle except for the point antipodal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then a little thought shows that if &lt;math&gt;Arg(x) = t_x&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(U) = \mathbb{R} - \{ t_x + \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the preimage of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; consists of the whole real line except for a 'hole' at each point &lt;math&gt;t_x + n, n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

It's clear (draw a picture!) that this set is a disjoint union of subintervals, and one can check that the exponential function maps each subinterval homeomorphically onto &lt;math&gt;U_x&lt;/math&gt;. So we do have a covering map. Neat! &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

===Homotopy Lifting===
Now we come to a theorem which looks a bit esoteric at first, but in fact allows us to do much with covering spaces.

'''Theorem (Homotopy Lifting):''' Suppose &lt;math&gt;p : Z \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is a covering map for a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f: I^n \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a map from the unit &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cube to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F: I^{n+1} \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; a homotopy of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to another map &lt;math&gt;f': I^n \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose (for the last time!) that &lt;math&gt;\phi: I^n \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; is a map satisfying &lt;math&gt;p \cdot \phi = f&lt;/math&gt;.
Then there exists a unique map &lt;math&gt;\Phi: I^{n+1} \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following:

(i) &lt;math&gt;\Phi |_{I^n} = \phi&lt;/math&gt;;

(ii)&lt;math&gt;p \cdot \Phi = F&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;


The proof is quite technical, but straightforward, and so is omitted. Any introductory book on algebraic topology should give it --- see, for example, Armstrong, &quot;Basic Topology&quot; (Springer).
At first sight this is pretty daunting, so let's take a concrete case to make it easier to digest. Suppose &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt; --- then &lt;math&gt;I^n&lt;/math&gt; is just a point, and hence &lt;math&gt;f: I^n \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is just a function selecting a particular point of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with its image, a point &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in X&lt;/math&gt;. Now a homotopy from &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to another map is (recalling the definition of homotopy) just a map &lt;math&gt;F: I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F(0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;; hence, nothing more than a path in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; starting at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. What does the theorem tell us about covering maps &lt;math&gt;p: Z \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;? 

It says (check it!) that if &lt;math&gt;z_0 \in Z&lt;/math&gt; is a point such that &lt;math&gt;p(z_0) = x_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a path in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; starting at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a '''unique''' path &lt;math&gt;\gamma'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; starting at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p \dot \gamma' = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;. In fancier (and looser) terminology, we say that a path in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a unique '''lift''' to &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, once the starting point of the lift has been chosen.

On reflection, this result --- sometimes known as the '''path lifting theorem''' --- is not so surprising. Think about a covering space as a 'folded-over' version of the base space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as in Fig XXXX. If we look at a small open set &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt;, its preimage in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a disjoint union of open sets each homeomorphic to it. If we just concentrate on the portion of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; lying inside &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for now, it's clear that for each of the disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique path in &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which maps onto &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; via the covering map &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. So to specify a lift, we simply need to choose which of the sets &lt;math&gt;V_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; it lives in (and this is equivalent to choosing a point in the preimage of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; as above). Now the whole path &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be split up as a finite 'chain' of short paths living inside 'small' open sets like &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (check this!), so finite induction shows that the whole lift is uniquely determined in this way.

===Covering Spaces and &lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt;===
Now we come to the connection between covering spaces and the fundamental group, which is of major significance.

'''Theorem:''' Given a covering space &lt;math&gt;p: Z \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, the map &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; induces a map &lt;math&gt;p_* : \pi_1(Z) \rightarrow \pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; which is an injective (i.e. 1-1) group homomorphism.

'''Proof (Sketch):''' First, consider a path &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;: it's a continuous map &lt;math&gt;\gamma : I \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;, and so we can compose it with the covering map &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to get a path &lt;math&gt;p \cdot \gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. So we have a map

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p':&lt;/math&gt; paths in &lt;math&gt;Z \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; paths in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

We want to show this can be used to define a map 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p*:&lt;/math&gt; homotopy classes of loops in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; based at &lt;math&gt;z_0 \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; homotopy classes of paths in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; based at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

This sounds complicated, but in fact isn't at all: the idea is, given a homotopy &lt;math&gt;H: I \times I \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; between two paths &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, the composition &lt;math&gt;p \cdot H&lt;/math&gt; is a homotopy in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; between their images &lt;math&gt;p'(\gamma_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p'(\gamma_2)&lt;/math&gt;. (If this still seems opaque, be sure to check the details.) Also, loops based at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; clearly map to loops based at &lt;math&gt;p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

So, we have our map &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt; as desired, mapping &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(Z,z_0)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,p(z_0)).&lt;/math&gt; We still need to show (a) that it's a group homomorphism, and (b) that it's injective.

(a) is pretty easy. To prove it, choose two elements of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(Z,z_0)&lt;/math&gt;. These are homotopy classes of based loops, so we can choose loops to represent them. What we need to see is that if we concatenate these loops, and then look at the image of this concatenation in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the result is homotopic to the loop we get if we first map each of the loops via &lt;math&gt;p'&lt;/math&gt; and then concatenate them. Convince yourself that this is so.

(b) is more tricky. To prove it, we must show that the kernel of the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt; described above consists just of the identity element of &lt;math&gt;pi_1(Z,z_0)&lt;/math&gt;. So, suppose we have a path &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; representing an element &lt;math&gt;[\gamma]&lt;/math&gt; in the kernel: so &lt;math&gt;p*([\gamma])&lt;/math&gt; is the identity of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X,p(z_0))&lt;/math&gt;. By definition of &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt;, this means that &lt;math&gt;p'(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is homotopic in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the constant path at &lt;math&gt;p(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;. So suppose &lt;math&gt;F: I \times I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is such a homotopy: the trick is to use the homotopy lifting theorem (above) to 'lift' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt;, a homotopy in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to the constant path at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;. (Again, one should check the details of this!) Since such a homotopy &lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt; exists, this shows that the homotopy class &lt;math&gt;[\gamma]&lt;/math&gt; is the identity element of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(Z,z_0)&lt;/math&gt;. So the only element in the kernel of &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt; is the identity element of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(Z,z_0)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt; is injective, as required. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Let's think about the significance of this result for a moment. An injective homomorphism of groups &lt;math&gt;G \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; is essentially the same as a subgroup &lt;math&gt;G_H \subset H&lt;/math&gt;, so the first thing the theorem tells us is that there's a significant restriction on possible covering spaces for a given space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; can't be a covering space for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; unless &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(Z)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;. Right off the bat, this rules out whole classes of maps from being covering maps. There's no covering map from the circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; to the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, for example, since the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers, as we saw above, while that of the real line is trivial (why?). Similarly, there's no covering map from the torus &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times S^1&lt;/math&gt; to the two-dimensional sphere &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;   --- the latter has trivial fundamental group, while that of the former is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt; (the direct sum of two copies of the integers). And so on, ad infinitum.

This latter example is particularly nice, I think, in that it shows how looking at algebraic invariants of spaces (in this case, fundamental groups), rather than our geometric 'mental picture' of the spaces themselves, vastly simplifies arguments about the existence or form of particular kinds of maps between spaces. Can you give me a simple geometric argument to show that there's no possible way to 'wrap' &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; around the torus so that every point is covered an equal number of times? Can you do the same for the three-dimensional sphere &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;? For &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;? (If so, I humbly salute you.)

'''Example:''' Now let's look at a specific covering space, and see what the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt; we talked about above actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in a concrete case.
Think about the circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; as the unit circle in the complex plane: &lt;math&gt;s^1 = \{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| = 1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can define a continuous map &lt;math&gt;p:S^1 \rightarrow S^1&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;p(z) = z^2&lt;/math&gt;. 

I claim that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a covering map. To see this, imagine a point &lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \theta &lt; 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;). It isn't hard to see that there are exactly two points &lt;math&gt;z' \in S^1&lt;/math&gt; such that p(z') = z; moreover, if we look at a 'small enough' circular arc around &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, its preimage under &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; will consist of two disjoint circular arcs, each containing one of the two preimages of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and each mapped homeomorphically onto our original arc by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. (Check these details!)

So, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a covering map, and so the above theorem tells us that &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt; is a group homomorphism from the fundamental group of the circle to itself. In symbols, we have &lt;math&gt;p^*: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. But what is it? To answer this, consider a path &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; that winds once around the origin. As we saw in the previous section, the equivalence class of such a path is mapped to the element &lt;math&gt;1 \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; under the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, to work out &lt;math&gt;p*[\gamma]&lt;/math&gt;, we look at the equivalence class of the path &lt;math&gt;p \cdot \gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; (this is just the defintion of &lt;math&gt;p*&lt;/math&gt;). It's easy to check (do it!) that &lt;math&gt;p \cdot \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a path is &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; winding twice around the origin, and so its equivalence class is &lt;math&gt;[\gamma] * [\gamma]&lt;/math&gt;. So we have &lt;math&gt;p*([\gamma]) = [\gamma] * [\gamma]&lt;/math&gt;. Looking at &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^1)&lt;/math&gt; as the group of integers, we have &lt;math&gt;p*(1) = 2&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;p^*: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is just the doubling map!
 
Of course, it's all well and good introducing new concepts like covering spaces, but this doesn't achieve a lot unless our new concepts prove useful in some way. Covering spaces have indeed proved useful in many ways, but hopefully the following example will suffice to illustrate this point:

'''Theorem (Nielsen-Schreier):''' Any subgroup of a free group is free.

'''Proof (Sketch):''' Consult Wikipedia for a rigorous definition of 'free group': roughly speaking, it is a group in which no non-trivial combination of elements equals the identity.
Now, the strategy of proof is along the following lines:

1) Given a free group &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, find a graph &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X) = F&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that a &lt;i&gt;graph&lt;/i&gt; is a topological space consisting of a discrete set of points to which are attached a family of line segments. Again see Wikipedia for a rigorous definition.)

2) Show that for a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a subgroup &lt;math&gt;H &lt; \pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a covering space &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(Z) = H&lt;/math&gt;.

3) Show that any covering space for a graph is itself a graph.

4) Show that the fundamental group of a graph is a free group.

== The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ==
Theorem: Let f be a polynomial with coefficients in the complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a root of that polynomial in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Phrased in the language of algebra, the set of complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; are algebraically closed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There seems to be a flaw in the proof that resolution is complete (see the second theorem under Properties of Propositional Resolution).  The problem comes at the statement:

First, notice that
:&lt;math&gt;Res(\phi^p) = \{C-\{\lnot p\}: C \in Res(\phi), p\notin C\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Taken literally, this is false.  For instance, consider &lt;math&gt;C = \{\lnot p\vee p, p\vee r\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\phi^p = \{q\} = Res(\phi^p)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Res(\phi) = \{\lnot p\vee p, p\vee r, q\vee r\}&lt;/math&gt;, so the right-hand side of the above formula is &lt;math&gt;\{q, q\vee r\} \ne \phi^p\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The author seems to have used subsumption, that is, if some clause is a superset of another, remove that clause.  With this addition, which is more or less a new inference rule, the two sides do become equal if the right-hand side has been fully reduced by subsumption.  Another possibility would be to define the &quot;=&quot; in the statement to mean logical equivalence as defined by truth tables.  Either of these would require further exposition.  Even then, however, the proof is too brief.  It took me some hours to &quot;notice&quot; that the statement is true, even after thinking about subsumption.  I believe, therefore, that the proof should be expanded to make it clearer, as follows (I have found it convenient to define &quot;closure&quot;, which is in a sense the opposite of subsumption):

First, I would add, earlier in the section, the following.

Fact X: A CNF formula is satiisfiable if and only if the foumula created by replacing every occurrance of some variable &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\lnot p&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa is satisfiable.

This is a useful fact in itself, and one that my students, anyhow, would often not see for themselves.  Then, in the proof or elsewhere, I would define the closure &lt;math&gt;cl(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; to be the formula obtained by adding to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; every superset of the clauses in &lt;math&gt;cl(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  I would then change the proof, starting with the observation that if &lt;math&gt;cl(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; contains neither &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;lnot p&lt;/math&gt;, neither does &lt;math&gt;cl(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, since the new formula can only produce longer clauses than the old one, not shorter.  Also, I would note that if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is closed, then so is &lt;math&gt;Res(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  After defining &lt;math&gt;\phi^p&lt;/math&gt; (as an operation on any formula), I would observe that if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is closed, then so is &lt;math&gt;\phi^p&lt;/math&gt;.  (I might give each of these facts a one-sentence proof.)  I would then say

Claim: If &lt;math&gt;cl(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is closed, then :&lt;math&gt;Res(\phi^p) = (Res(\phi))^p.&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this is just a simpler way to write the statement that I first mentioned.  Then,

Proof: First, consider any &lt;math&gt;C\in \phi^p&lt;/math&gt;.

:Go a head and make the changes! [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:21, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I think the horn clause example is faulty. It says:

&lt;ul&gt;
Special case for which SAT is in polynomial time. Example:&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;math&gt;(p \vee \neg q \vee r) \wedge (\neg p \vee q \vee \neg r)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Horn clause is a disjunction of literals of which at most one is positive.
&lt;/ul&gt;

But in the example both p and r are positive literals!

== Informal presentation needed? ==

Sorry if this is an incorrect assumption as I am unsure of the intended audience of this book, but it seems to me that if someone is already familiar with the syntax and semantics of set theory, and comfortable reading and understanding formal mathematical definitions, then surely they will be intimately familiar with propositional logic. Even having a chapter on propositional logic tells me that this chapter is probably meant for someone who is also unfamiliar with higher-order logics and discrete math concepts.

I would probably give an introduction and truth tables for logical connectives; and the nature of compound vs atomic statements. Maybe a little bit of history on logic and expand further upon the domain of problems that propositional logic can solve as opposed to higher order logics; and give an overview of these categories - separated from the formal definitions of concepts.

== Minor points ==

I'm no expert, but the second numbered line describing CNF seems wrong to me:

&lt;code&gt;2. Note that φ is true when &lt;math&gt;\neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; is false. Hence, negate ψ using DeMorgan's laws.&lt;code&gt;

Shouldn't it be &quot;φ is true when &lt;math&gt;\neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; is true&quot;?  Or &quot;φ is true when &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is false&quot;?

==External Beam==
===Overview===
*A UK trial reported in 1986 was the first to randomize patients to RT 8/1 vs. 30/10. While there was no difference in pain relief at 12 weeks, the trial was criticized for low compliance and short follow-up
*A follow-on UK trial revealed that RT 8/1 has higher rate of clinical response than RT 4/1
*Several other trials have confirmed equivalent safety and efficacy of 8 Gy x1 compared with multi-fraction regimens, including RTOG 97-14
*All trials show a higher re-treatment rate for 8/1 fractionation (~25% vs. ~10% for multifraction regimens), but some of this may be for other reasons than pain level prior to re-irradiation
*Cochrane review (2004) found overall pain response ~60%, complete pain response ~33%, with no difference between single fraction and multifraction regimens. The composite retreatment rate was higher for single fraction 21% vs. 7%. Conclusion was that single fraction is effective
*Based on the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study, patient who live &lt;12 weeks do particularly poorly after RT. Only half respond (and that means their pain score decreases from 7 to 5 on 11 point scale), and most die in pain even in the presence of analgesics. Patients who live &gt;12 weeks do better, with 78% responders


===Meta-analyses===
*'''University of Toronto, 2007''' - PMID 17416863 &amp;mdash; &quot;Palliative Radiotherapy Trials for Bone Metastases: A Systematic Review.&quot; Chow E et al. J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 10;25(11):1423-1436.
**Single-fraction vs multiple fraction RT. Updates previous meta-analysis. Literature review.
**Conclusion: Overall response and complete response same in single fraction (8/1) and multi-fraction treatments. Retreatment rate higher with single fraction

*'''Cochrane Review, 2004''' PMID 15106258 -- &quot;Palliation of metastatic bone pain: single fraction versus multifraction radiotherapy - a systematic review of the randomised trials.&quot; (Wai MS, Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2004;(2):CD004721.)
**Pooled meta-analysis. 11 trials, 3435 patients. Any primary site, but mainly prostate, breast, and lung
**Pain response: single fraction 60% vs. multifraction 59% (NS). Complete response 34% vs. 32% (NS). Single fraction higher re-treatment 21% vs. 7% (SS)
**Pathologic fracture: single fraction 3% vs. 1.5%
**Conclusion: Single fraction as effective as multiple fractions at relieving pain. Higher re-treatment and higher rate of pathologic fracture in the single fraction arm

*'''McMaster University, 2003''' PMID 12573746 -- &quot;Meta-analysis of dose-fractionation radiotherapy trials for the palliation of painful bone metastases.&quot; (Wu JS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Mar 1;55(3):594-605.)
**16 trials, 
**Conclusion: No significant difference in complete and overall pain relief between single and multifraction palliative RT for bone metastases. More frequent re-irradiation rate in the lower dose arms.

===Randomized===
*'''[[Radiation_Oncology/RTOG_Trials/9714|RTOG 97-14]]''' (1998-2002) -- RT short (8/1) vs. RT long (30/10)
**Randomized. 898 patients. Prostate or breast cancer. Weight-bearing 56%, C-spine 5%, T-spine 19%, L-spine 27%, cord compression not allowed. Life expectancy &gt;3 months, KPS &gt;=40 Arm 1) RT 8/1 vs. Arm 2) 30/10. Primary outcome pain relief at 3 months
**'''Outcome; 2005''' PMID 15928300 -- &quot;Randomized trial of short- versus long-course radiotherapy for palliation of painful bone metastases.&quot; (Hartsell WF, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2005 Jun 1;97(11):798-804.)
***Outcome: 3-month complete pain relief 8/1 15% vs. 30/10 18% (NS); partial 50% vs. 48% (NS); stable 26% vs 24%; progressive 9% vs 10%. Comparable narcotic relief. Retreatment rate 18% vs. 9% (p&lt;.001)
***Toxicity: acute 8/1 10% vs. 30/10 17% (SS); late toxicity rare
***Conclusion: Both regimens equivalent for pain control and narcotic relief at 3 months. 8/1 less acute toxicity but higher retreatment
**'''Single males; 2006''' PMID 16814950 &amp;mdash; &quot;Continuing evidence for poorer treatment outcomes for single male patients: retreatment data from RTOG 97-14.&quot; Konski A et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Sep 1;66(1):229-33. 
***Retreatment (within the original RT portal) at 36 months: 8/1 18% vs 30/10 9% (SS) No difference in retreatment rate between arms for unmarried males, but difference was seen in all other groups.
***Conclusion: Patients receiving 8 Gy in a single fraction had significantly higher retreatment rates compared with patients receiving 30 Gy in 10 fractions.

***Markov model using information from the trial. Cost modeled using Medicare RVU rates
***Outcome: Mean cost 8 Gy group $998 vs 30 Gy group $2316. QALY survival 7.3 months vs 9.5 months. ICER $6973/QALY
***Conclusion: Single fraction was the less expensive and more cost-effective treatment

*'''Norway/Sweden''' (1998-2000) -- short RT (8/1) vs. long RT (30/10)
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to comparable outcomes on interim analysis''. 376/1000 patients. Bone metastases (spine 38%, pelvis 35%, extremity 20%) resulting in clinically important pain, KPS &gt;40, life expectancy &gt;6 weeks. [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Spinal_Cord_Compression|Spinal cord compression]] excluded. Arm 1) RT 8/1 vs. 30/10. Target known mets with 2-3 cm margin, for spinal lesions 1 VB above/below.

***Outcome: No difference in pain intensity, global QoL, fatigue, or opioid/non-opioid analgesics. (NS). Median O/S 8 Gy 9.6 months vs. 30 Gy 7.9 months (NS)
***Conclusion: Similar benefit. Recommend single fraction 8 Gy as standard

*'''TROG 96.05''' PMID 15878101 -- &quot;Randomized trial of 8 Gy in 1 versus 20 Gy in 5 fractions of radiotherapy for neuropathic pain due to bone metastases (Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group, TROG 96.05).&quot; (Roos DE, Radiother Oncol. 2005 Apr;75(1):54-63. Epub 2004 Oct 28.)
**Phase III. 272 patients. Bone mets, known primary, no change in therapy x6 weeks, no cord compression. Lung 31%, prostate 29%, breast 8%
**Randomized to 8 Gy/1 fx vs. 20 Gy/5 fxs in 15 centers
**Response rate: 53% vs. 61% (p=NS); TTF 2.4 mo vs. 3.7 mo (p=0.056)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;8/1 was not shown to be as effective as 20/5, nor was it statistically significantly worse. Outcomes were generally poorer for 8/1, although the quantitative differences were relatively small.&quot;

*'''Dutch Bone Metastasis Study''' (1996-1998) -- short RT (8/1) vs long RT (24/6)
**Randomized. 1171 patients. Painful bone metastases, spinal cord compression excluded, C-spine excluded (T/L-spine 37%, pelvis 29%, femur 16%, other 18%). Primary endpoint pain. Median F/U 4 months
**'''1999''' PMID 10577695 -- &quot;The effect of a single fraction compared to multiple fractions on painful bone metastases: a global analysis of the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study.&quot; (Steenland E, Radiother Oncol. 1999 Aug;52(2):101-9.)
***Outcome: Response 71% (breast 76%, prostate 78%, NSCLC 60%), complete response 35%. No difference in pain relief at 3 months, 12 months. No difference in time-to-progression. Median OS 7 months (NS); breast CA 16 months vs. NSCLC 3 months.
***Retreatment: overall 16%; 8/1 25% vs. 24/6 7% (SS), on further analysis higher recurrence pain score in 24/6 group before retreatment 
***Toxicity: No difference in acute toxicity; double the rate of subsequent pathologic fractures in the single fraction arm
***Conclusion: Equality of 8/1 vs 24/6, provided 4x more retreatments accepted. Equality holds in long-term survivors
**'''Last 12 weeks; 2010''' PMID 20225326 -- &quot;Efficacy of radiotherapy for painful bone metastases during the last 12 weeks of life: results from the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study.&quot; (Meeuse JJ, Cancer. 2010 Mar 11. [Epub ahead of print])
***Subset analysis. 274 patients who died within 12 weeks after randomization. Patient classified as responders (decrease in initial pain intensity score by 2 of 11 points without analgesic increase, or decrease in analgesics without increase in pain. Used ) 
***Outcome: Response 8/1 53% vs 24/6 56% (NS); median time-to-response 2 weeks (1-9) in both groups. In responders, pain score decreased from 7/11 to 5/11 by death. In non-responders, no change. 60% of patients never reached below pain score 5 until death (regardless of RT and medication use). Compared with patients who lived &gt;12 weeks, response percentage for patients who lived &lt;12 weeks was poor 45% vs 78% (SS)
***Conclusion: Pain responded in ~50% of patients with short survival, regardless of fractional schema. Single fraction should be preferred, and additional palliative measure remain essential

*'''UK/NZ''' (1992-1997) -- short RT (8/1) vs. long RT (20/5 or 30/10)
**Randomized. 761 patients. Painful skeletal metastases (pelvis/hip 28%, L-spine 20%, ribs 11%, T-spine 9%, femur 6%, C-spine 3%, other 22%). Arm 1) RT 8/1 vs. Arm 2) RT 20/5 or 30/10. Primary endpoint pain relief.
**'''1999''' PMID 10577696 -- &quot;8 Gy single fraction radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic skeletal pain: randomised comparison with a multifraction schedule over 12 months of patient follow-up. Bone Pain Trial Working Party.&quot; ([No authors listed], Radiother Oncol. 1999 Aug;52(2):111-21.) Full 12 month follow-up available in 30%.
***Outcome: No difference in time-to-improvement, time-to-complete pain relief, or class of analgesics (NS). Complete response (no pain, no increase in pain meds) 58%. Retreatment 8/1 23% vs. long-RT 10% (SS) but on further analysis likely due to greater readiness to reatreat rather than need due to pain outcome
***Toxicity: No difference in nausea (56% vs. 65%), vomiting (30% vs. 32%), spinal cord compression, or pathological fracture
***Conclusion: No difference in safety or efficacy; pain relief durable over 12-month follow up. 8 Gy single fraction is the treatment of choice

Hemibody began within 3 days of local RT, and the local RT portal was shielded during hemibody RT. Lung shielding to keep lung dose to 6 Gy. Liver and kidney limited to 15 Gy.
***Dose-limiting toxicity at 17.5 Gy (hematologic toxicity). Time to new disease in the hemibody field: 19% at 1 yr, no difference between arms; no difference in retreatment rates. 
**Conclusion: Comparing this study to single fraction study (RTOG 82-06), there was a reduction of 36% of new disease with the fractionated technique. No difference in survival.

**Conclusion: rapid pain relief. Safest dose appears to be 600 (upper) and 800 (lower/mid). ''Compared with conventional RT'' (a la RTOG 74-02), overall pain relief and duration of pain relief are similar, but HBI achieved pain relief much sooner (complete pain relief within 2 weeks vs many months), 4 times lower recurrence of pain in the radiated fields (54% vs 13%)

*''Please also see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Toxicity/Spine|spine dose tolerance]] page


==Epidemiology==
*Estimated &gt;20,000 cases in US per year, in ~10% patients
**Most common breast (~30%), NSCLC (~17%), prostate (~14%)
*Clinical presentation
**Back pain (90%), frequently for weeks
**Weakness (80%)
**Sensory deficits (50-80%)
**Autonomic dysfunction (40-60%)
*Definition (Princess Margaret, see PMID 15774794)
**Radiographic features: Compression of dural sac and its contents (spinal cord and/or cauda equina) by an extradural tumor mass. Minimum radiographic evidence is indentation of the theca at the level of clinical features 
**Clinical features: Any or all of the following: pain (local or radicular), weakness, sensory disturbance, and/or evidence of sphincter dysfunction.
*Anatomically, compression can be intramedullary, leptomeningeal, or extradural
*Pathophysiology of extradural compression includes several mechanisms
**Continued growth of bone met into epidural space
**Blockage of neural foramina by a paraspinal mass 
**Destruction of vertebral bone, causing a collapse and displacement of bony fragments into epidural space
**Vascular obstruction of epidural venous plexus, leading to cord edema, ischemia, and ultimately permanent damage
*History (adapted from Perez, 4th):
**When did the pain begin?
**When last walking independently?
**Why come to hospital today?
**Fever or weight loss?
**Last void?
*Physical exam (adapted from Perez, 4th):
**KPS?
**Raise legs against gravity?
**Hands sensation compared with feet sensation?
**Reflexes (ankle, knee, elbow, wrist)?
*Workup: MRI (sensitivity 93%, specificity 97%, accuracy 95%)
*Predictive factors: time to development of motor deficits, favorable histology
*Median OS ~3 months
**If ambulatory after treatment, median OS ~7 months
**If non-ambulatory after treatment, median OS ~1.5 months
**Approximately 30% can survive &gt;1 year

**Scoring system. 2096 met spinal cord compression patients. Factors: primary tumor type, interval between tumor diagnosis and MSCC, visceral mets, motor function before RT, time to develop motor deficits. Total score 21-44. Outcome modeled: ambulatory status
**Outcome: Post-RT ambulatory rate if score &lt;=28 6%, 29-31 44%, 32-34 70%, 35-37 86%, &gt;=38 98%. 6-month OS 6%, 31%, 42%, 61%, 93%
**Conclusion: For patients with score &lt;=28, suggest short course RT. For patients with score 29-37, suggest surgery + RT. For patients with score &gt;=38 RT alone provides excellent results

** 653 patients (treated with RT alone) prospective trial for validation of 2008 retrospective study with 2096 patients reported above. Same scoring system as 2008 with simplified three instead of five groups for post treatment ambulatory status. RT alone groups were compared with another group of 104 patients treated with surgery followed by RT.
**Outcome: Post-RT ambulatory rate for score ≤28 (Group I)=10.6%, 29-37 (Group II)=70.9%, ≥38 (Group III)=98.5%. 6-month OS 11.3%, 46.4%, and 92.0%. Addition of laminectomy (n=41) did not add statistically significant (SS) benefit compared to RT alone. SS benefit with laminectomy plus stabilization (n=63) followed by RT when all groups combined (P=0.04), with non-SS trend in Group II (P=0.23, possibly due to only 31 patients in the group).
**Conclusion: For patients with score ≤28, suggest short course RT for palliation of pain. For patients with score 29-37, consider adding laminectomy &lt;u&gt;plus&lt;/u&gt; stabilization to RT. For patients with score ≥38 RT alone provides excellent results

*'''Hannover; 2002''' (1998-2000) PMID 12095565 -- &quot;Final results of a prospective study of the prognostic value of the time to develop motor deficits before irradiation in metastatic spinal cord compression. (Rades D, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Jul 15;53(4):975-9.)
**Prospective. 98 patients. No surgery, dexamethasone 32-40 mg/qd. 3 subgroups based on time of motor deficit development prior to RT: Group A (1-7 days, n=31), Group B (8-14 days, n=31), and Group C (&gt;14 days, n=36). Groups balanced. RT started as soon as possible, 30/10 or 37.5/15 or 40/20, using PA field
**Outcome: Initial ambulatory rate A 48% vs. B 55% vs. C 56%. Post-treatment ambulatory rate 35% vs. 55% vs. 86%. This held at 6 weeks (SS), 12 weeks (SS), and trend at 24 weeks (p=0.07). Deterioration worst in Group A (10% improved, 42% stabilized, 48% worse)
**Predictors: time-to-develop motor deficit (slower better), type of tumor (favorable=myeloma, lymphoma, SCLC, testicular better), pretreatment ambulation (ambulation better)
**Conclusion: Functional outcome better with slower development of motor deficits before RT

==Steroids==
*If clinical suspicion is high, should be administered even before radiographic diagnosis. They can be rapidly discontinued if necessary
*A randomized trial showed improved ambulation with administration of steroids over no steroids, with a dose of 96 mg QD
*Loading and maintenance dose are not well established. A small randomized trial showed statistical equivalence between dexamethasone 100 mg IV and dexamethasone 10 mg, although there was a suggestion of clinical benefit for the higher dose
*Very high doses (~100 mg QD) can result in significant toxicity, and are typically not used now. One ought to be cautious in patients with diabetes mellitus, HTN, and peptic ulcer disease
*A recommended regimen (Perez 5th ed) is dexamethasone 10 mg IV loading dose, then dexamethasone 4-6 mg every 6-8 hours. Patients should also be started on proton pump inhibitor for the duration of dexamethasone based on PPI date in NSAIDs and GI prophylaxis
*A Phase II trial suggests that for patients with good motor function, corticosteroids may not be necessary, as long as they are counseled about development of symptoms


*'''Perugia; 1996''' (Italy)(1991-1993) PMID 8610645 -- &quot;Radiotherapy without steroids in selected metastatic spinal cord compression patients. A phase II trial.&quot; (Maranzano E, Am J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;19(2):179-83.)
**Phase II. 20 patients with spinal cord compression, no neurologic deficit (radiculopathy allowed), no massive invasion of spine on MRI/CT. Walking deficits in 4 patients (2 radiculopathy, 2 back pain). No steroids given RT 30/10
**Outcome: 100% ambulatory at completion. Median OS 14 months
**Conclusion: RT without steroids is feasible in patients with good motor function and avoids toxicity

*'''Copenhagen''' -- 96 mg dexamethasone vs. control

***Outcome: Gait function dexamethasone 81% vs. control 63%, 6-months later 59% vs. 33%. Median OS no difference
***Toxicity: Significant side effects 11%
***Conclusion: High-dose glucocorticoid therapy should be given as adjunct

**Retrospective. 28 consecutive patients, treated with high-dose dexamethasone (96 mg IV, taper in 14 days). 
**Toxicity: 29% side-effects, 14% serious (1 fatal ulcer, 1 rectal bleeding, 1 GI perforation, 1 sigmoid perforation)
**Conclusion: High incidence of side effects, now use dexamethasone 16 mg daily, taper in 14 days

*'''Rotterdam''' -- bolus 10 mg IV vs. bolus 100 mg IV
**Randomized. 37 patients with cord compresion. Arm 1) Dexamethasone bolus 10 mg IV vs. Arm 2) dexamethasone bolus 100 mg IV. Both followed by dexamethasone 16 mg daily

***Outcome: Improved neurologic status: moderate 8% vs. high 25% (NS). Overall no difference in pain, ambulation, or bladder function
***Conclusion: No difference
***Comment: Small trial, and clinically significant difference (8% vs. 25%) if real

==Surgery + RT vs. RT alone==
*Surgery is indicated when there is spinal instability or bony retropulsion causing the cord compression. This is a consensus opinion, without literature support (see PMID 15774794)
*Surgery may also be indicated in patients with symptomatic cord compression, with paralysis &lt;2 days based on the Patchell trial. However, there is significant morbidity associated with the operation, and the trade-offs need to be considered. Laminectomy  doesn't appear as beneficial
 

*'''Bluegrass Neuro-Oncology Consortium''' (1992-2002) -- Decompression + RT vs. RT alone
**Randomized. ''Stopped early after meeting stopping rule.'' 101/200 patients, paraplegia &lt;=48 hours. Spinal cord compression from mets (excluded radiosensitive histologies, CNS primary). Decadron 100 mg, then 24 mg Q6. Arm 1) Surgery + RT vs. Arm 2) RT alone. 32 unable to walk (16 vs. 16). RT 30/10, field 8cm wide and one VB above/below lesion. RT started within 14 days post-op, or within 24 hrs of randomization. Endpoint ability to walk.

***Ability to walk: surgery + RT 84% vs. RT alone 57% (SS). Length of response: 122 days vs. 13 days (SS). No improvement: surgery + RT 19% vs. RT alone 62% (SS)
****If ambulatory: Ability to walk 94% vs. 74% (SS); duration of response 153 days vs. 54 days (SS)
****If non-ambulatory: Ability to walk 62% vs. 19% (SS); duration of response 59 days vs. 0 days (SS)
***Cross-over: ambulatory patients treated with RT alone and failed, then treated with surgery: 30% able to walk
***Continence: surgery + RT 156 days vs. RT alone 17 days (SS); OS 126 days vs. 100 days (SS)
***Conclusion: Direct decompression + RT better than RT alone, even for patients who are ambulatory
**Comment: RT alone arm results significantly worse than what would have been expected based on other prospective RT trials; took 10 yrs to accrue 101 pts, suggesting results apply to only a minority of cord compression pts; non-neurologic morbidity higher in RT alone group, suggesting insufficient stratification factors used

==RT Dose==
*There does not appear to be any difference among the various dose-fractionation regimens
*In the US, RT 30/10 is considered standard of care, and shorter fractionation schedules (20/5 or 8/1) are typically reserved for those with progressive disease refractory to systemic chemotherapy and are typically avoided in newly diagnosed patients who are chemotherapy-naive (Perez 5th ed)

Ok firstly this page is very confusing.  So this is what I'm going to do.  Firstly I'm going to remove ideas of coupling, oscillators, and offsets until the ideal op-amp is discussed.  

Firstly oscillators because that clouds the use of Op Amps.  They are first and foremost signal amplifiers.  Secondly coupling because this is also a more advanced idea to real amplifier circuit and Op Amp have high CMRR, common mode rejection ratios which means coupling is generally unnecessary.  Where as a real Common Emitter amplifier, for instance doesn't.  Which means it is not neccesary.  Lastly offsets, If this is your first sight of an Op Amp then how would know of or dream up an offset.

That which was removed is below.  - [[User:IknowNothing|IknowNothing]]

----

'''Oscillator'''
When positive feedback occurs in an Op-Amp/Transistor it becomes an oscillator.
Unless, of course, it becomes a Comparator.

'''Coupling''' ways of allowing an AC signal to go from on stage to another without changing the bias of the 2 stages.
&lt;!-- huh ? --&gt;

Diode.  DC voltage drop.  When AC passes only allows half the waveform through.  This is useful for constructing a power supply.  

Capacitive coupling.  DC does not pass through capacitors, but AC does.  At low frequencies capacitors have high impedance, and at high frequencies capacitors have low impedance.

Transformer coupling. Inductor based.  AC does not pass through inductors, but DC does.  Low impedance at low frequencies and high impedance at high frequencies.

----

My next move is to move any comments of what an Op Amp is physically constructed from until a discussion of real op amps. Since it just clouds the issue.  - [[User:IknowNothing|IknowNothing]] &lt;!-- Hey IknowNothing, I took the liberty to modify your page since I found some errors in this present section. First, I changed the word resistance to impedance when you talk about capacitors and inductors, since this is technically the good word to use. --&gt;

==Notation==

I have changed &lt;math&gt;G_{openloop}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A_{vo}&lt;/math&gt; and use &lt;math&gt;A_f&lt;/math&gt; for closed loop gain. - [[User:IknowNothing|IknowNothing]]

== Interested Contributor. ==

In am interested in contributing information on the &quot;operational amplifier&quot; used in a differential configuration.  In particular, the case in which the input is a &quot;floating voltage source&quot; (i.e. magnetic readhead).  This topology would be a variant of the difference amplifier whose input is typically two individual voltage sources each referenced to ground. 

Do you think there might be any interest in this topic? - [[User:hgmjr|hgmjr]]

Yes. I don't quite understand what distinguishes the two cases you mention. I suspect I'm not the only one. What about the [[w:Instrumentation amplifier]]? Is that one of the two cases, or is that a third case?

Since
[[Circuit Theory:Op Amps]]
[[Electronics/Op-Amps]]
talk about exactly the same thing,
should we merge them?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 23:00, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

:There is going to be alot of cross-talk between the Electronics and Circuit Theory books, although the later are being prepared specifically to tend to a different audience then the former. Also, I am working on creating an entire &quot;curriculum&quot; of sorts in Electrical Engineering, and I want to make sure that there is a firm foundation in place on these subjects before more advanced books on the topic get written. 

:I will admit that Op-Amps specifically do not play a particularly central role in the Circuit Theory book, or in the EE curriculum at large, and would conceed that perhaps the Op-Amp page in particular would not adversely affect the project if it were merged (or even removed entirely) from the Circuit Theory book. Other pages however, i would fight the motion whole-heartedly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:33, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

I don't know how you came to that conclusion.  I'm an EE and I can tell you that the introductory circuit analysis courses that EEs take INCLUDES op-amps.  It's a very basic part of the curriculum.  What's the difference between the audiences between circuit theory and electronics?  I don't see any.  [[User:70.18.253.241|70.18.253.241]] 22:09, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:Well, I'm an EE as well, and we learned about Op Amps one week, and the subject never once came up again. I was under the impression that it simply wasnt that big a deal considering the little treatment of it that I recieved in my education. I certainly don't think that there is enough material on Op Amps to span 2 books, so I wont bother trying to make that happen. Also, I came to the conclusion that the two books are focused towards different audiences for a number of reasons that I have enumerated (so far without opposition) in a number of places, including [[User:Whiteknight|my user page]], and the [[Talk:Circuit Theory|Circuit Theory talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:37, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

I read your criteria and it appears the electronics book version does treat it like a black box for the most part, which would fit your criteria.  I really can't see you justify dropping it all together, I find it strange that your curriculum barely covered it, but I wouldn't exclude it just because yours didn't.  They're an integral part of introductory circuit theory classes for a reason, and I think it'd be best not to question the judgement of such a unaninmously implemented program  without some better justification than &quot;well I personally didn't use it much after that.&quot;  Your use page says you're a ECE (as opposed to just EE), so perhaps the exra digital slant is why you don't have as much experience with them?  [[User:Njyoder|Njyoder]] 22:05, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

: My only point is that if there is talk that the material is being covered adequately well in two books, and if the [[Circuit Theory]] book cannot cover the material any better then the [[Electronics]] book, then there probably isnt much reason to have it covered in 2 separate books. If the concensus is to merge then, we will merge the pages. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

ooooo

It seems to me that this is a hardware/software problem. Keep both modules, with

*&lt;u&gt;Electronics:Op-Amps&lt;/u&gt; describing the hardware aspect. Which Op-Amps are available, construction and price differences, which to use why (with mathematics for hardware by itself), max/min. statistics/ratings, their construction, even, maybe, different bases available, temperature range for use, for storage.
*&lt;u&gt;Circuit Theory/Op Amps&lt;/u&gt; describing how to use them, the various applications (with applicable circuit-based mathematics).
*Links to other pages of WIKIBOOKS, and WIKIPEDIA, aiming for minimum duplication. Think of the many users who are not at all interested in the theory, only in what to do and how to do it quickly and at minimum cost.

== Fully differential op amp ==

=== The challenge ===

(a copy of [[Talk:Circuit_Idea/Simple_Op-amp_Summer_Design#fully differential op amp]])


[[User:DavidCary|David Cary]] wrote:

................................................

TI manufactures several 24-bit ADCs.
All of their data sheets recommend using the OPA1632 &quot;fully differential amplifier&quot;.
(No surprise that it is also manufactured by TI).

A &quot;[[Electronics/Op-Amps#fully_differential_amplifier | fully differential amplifier]]&quot; is very different from a &quot;[[Electronics/Op-Amps#Difference_amplifier | difference amplifier]]&quot; or a &quot;[[w:instrumentation amplifier]]&quot;.

Can Dieter's procedure be applied to a fully differential amplifier?
At first glance, I'm guessing that there's one minor and one major change:
* Use equal feedback resistors Rf, one from the + output to the - input, and one from the - output to the + input. Connect the &quot;common&quot; input to the appropriate voltage source. ''(minor change to the &quot;[[Electronics/Op-Amps#Difference_amplifier | difference amplifier]]&quot; )''
* The sum of the gains = zero in a properly-designed fully differential amplifier circuit. ''(Right? major change)''
* Calculate resistor values for each input, using Ri = Rf / |desired gain|.
* For inputs with positive gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the + input on the amplifier.
* For inputs with negative gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the - input on the amplifier.
* If all your inputs are differential pairs, then the sum of all the gains is now zero. Done. Otherwise add a ground resistor to bring the total gain to zero.
If that process looks good, please move it to [[Electronics/Op-Amps#fully_differential_amplifier]].

If they were single-ended circuits, the sum of the input gains would constitute K; if they were balanced (symmetric) differential amplifying circuits (like the basic 4-resistor FDA circuit), the sum of the input gains would be 0.'' Only, Dieter didn't share my assertion and removed my insertion:(

:Well, let's try to record these changes hoping that Dieter will miss out on them:). For a start, I have scattered the examples illustrating the quick design procedure. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 17:35, 16 November 2007 (UTC)


::Shadow's design procedure only applies to Voltage feedback op-amps. It does not apply to Current mode op-amps, nor to video amps. Please keep the name. This is Shadow's procedure.
::It's not a trick.  The procedure only applies to the General Summing Amplifier.  The gain equation is derived via VSA analysis and simplified for large op-amp gain.
::Don't confuse this aproach with the comedy of error approach typically used in electronics. [[User:Djhk|Djhk]] 18:13, 7 November 2007


::Fully differential amplifiers were popular as video amps in the past; also popular inside ICs due to noise concerns.

:::[[User:Djhk|Djhk]], I do not yet understand why the sum of the input gains of a fully differential amplifier is one instead zero. Please, elucidate me. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 18:59, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

::::The key to Daisy's theorem is the word ALL. Whenever you draw an incomplete circuit, the gain sum is indeterminate. Before submitting any circuit, test it. Build it on a simulator or better build the circuit. Keep the trash out of the wiki. Don't mention Daisy when speculating. [[User:Djhk|Djhk]]

:::::[[User:Djhk|Djhk]], I do not yet understand why the sum is 1. Please, log in before writing comments and finish them with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; (these four tildes will be replaced by your user name and the current date).
:::::What do you think about the sketch below? Are there virtual grounds at the two FDA's inputs? [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 08:56, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

::::::&quot;The sum of the gains = zero in a properly-designed fully differential amplifier circuit&quot;. Wrong! Daisy's theorem states that the sum of ALL gains is equal to one. This applies to the +out node, the -out node, or any other node. If we add two sets of gains, each of which has a sum of +1, how do we get a sum of zero. Is 1+1 = 0 ? [[User:Djhk|Djhk]] 20:59, 24 November 2007

:::::::[[User:Djhk|Djhk]], look at equation 11 at page 10 of this [http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/sloa054d/sloa054d.pdf TI article] about FDA. For simplicity, assume R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Uocm = 0. Then, V&lt;sub&gt;OUT+&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5V&lt;sub&gt;IN+&lt;/sub&gt; - 0.5V&lt;sub&gt;IN-&lt;/sub&gt;; the sum of gains is 0.5 - 0.5 = 0. Or look at equation 13 at the same page: V&lt;sub&gt;OUT-&lt;/sub&gt; =  - 0.5V&lt;sub&gt;IN+&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.5V&lt;sub&gt;IN-&lt;/sub&gt;; the sum of gains is again - 0.5 + 0.5 = 0. These calculations corroborate the speculation that the sum of the gains in a FDA is zero. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 17:37, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

::::::::Daisy's theorem applies to linear circuits. Any single voltage in a linear circuit can be expressed as a sum of gains times inputs. If ALL inputs are included in the equation, then the sum of the gains is equal to one. Taking two gains and adding them may result in any value. In your example the gains refer to different nodes. Write the linear equations for each output, include ALL inputs and you will find that the gains in each equation add to one.

=== Presenting FDA in a more attractive way ===

[[Image:Fully_diff_amp_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A fully differential amplifier acting at a differential input voltage (an idea for a more attractive image)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Here is an idea for a more attractive circuit presentation in a case, if you want to discuss this nice circuit. Let's outline roughly the circuit operation.

To apply a differential input signal means to change the two input voltages to the same extent but to opposite directions. For example, let's choose a typical case when, in the beginning the two input voltages are zero. As a result, the FDA has set its output voltages zero as well; no currents flow through the circuit.

Then, we decrease simultaneously the upper voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN-&lt;/sub&gt; under the ground and the lower voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN+&lt;/sub&gt; above the ground. At the first moment, the FDA is &quot;surprised&quot; and does not react to this &quot;intervention&quot; (its output voltages V&lt;sub&gt;OUT-&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;OUT+&lt;/sub&gt; remain zero). As a result, the FDA's input voltages become V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; = - R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

After a while, the FDA &quot;recovers&quot; and, observing continously its input voltages, begins changing its output voltages: V&lt;sub&gt;OUT-&lt;/sub&gt; to the positive rail V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;OUT-&lt;/sub&gt; to the negative rail V&lt;sub&gt;EE&lt;/sub&gt;. The FDA stops when it manages to zero (approximately) its input voltages (to make its inputs ''virtual grounds''). By the way, there is another virtual ground point here - the middle point inside of the flying load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is interesting that, in contrast to the ordinary op-amp differential amplifier, here both the power supplies produce currents flowing through the negative feedback resistors and the flying load. In this case, the (+) FDA's output &quot;blows&quot; a current while the (-) FDA's output &quot;sucks&quot; a current. If R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the (-) FDA's output (or, maybe it is more correctly to say an &quot;input&quot;) &quot;sucks&quot; all the current of the (+) FDA's output. Am I right?

It is interesting as well to draw more pictures when we vary other circuit quantities:
* add a constant common-mode input voltage to the varying differential input voltage,
* vary only V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; (converting a single-ended signal to a differential one),
* move simultaneously the sliders of the two potentiometers R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (changing the circuit gain),
* vary the common-mode input voltage while the differential input voltage stays constant,
* vary the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OCM&lt;/sub&gt; (not shown on the figure above) that controls the output common-mode voltage (keeping differential and input voltage constant), etc. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 16:15, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

:Still a fantasy. Can we get a schematic? How about a simulation? [[User:Djhk|Djhk]] 22:57, 24 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages, containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce binary packages.

== Detailed Objective ==
'''Weight: 3'''

'''Description:'''
&lt;br&gt; 
Candidates should be able to perform package management using RPM and YUM tools.

*Key knowledge area(s):
**Install, re-install, upgrade and remove packages using RPM and YUM.
**Obtain information on RPM packages such as version, status, dependencies, integrity and signatures.
**Determine what files a package provides, as well as find which package a specific file comes from.

*The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
**rpm
**rpm2cpio
**/etc/yum.conf
**/etc/yum.repos.d/
**yum
**yumdownloader


== Red Hat Package Manager ==

Some Linux distribution uses rpm the “Red Hat Package Manager” for all its distribution software.
RPM maintains a detailed database of all software installed in the system.

To install a RPM package, do:

 rpm -i [package].rpm

The package will be installed only if the dependency are met and there is no conflict with another package.
To upgrade a package, do:

 rpm -U [package].rpm

The files of the old package version will be removed and replaced by the new files.
To remove a RPM package, do:

 rpm -e [package].rpm

The package will be removed only if no other package depends on it.

== RPM Queries ==

With the -q option you can query the RPM database or display information about package file.

There are several switches that you can use:
* -i: to get package information
 rpm -q -i apache

* -l: To get a file list of a package.
 $ rpm -q -l pciutils
 /sbin/lspci
 /sbin/setpci
 /usr/share/doc/package/pciutils
 ...
 /usr/share/pci.ids

* -f file: Query which package a file belongs to.
 $ rpm -q -f /sbin/lspci
 pciutils-2.1.9-58

* -s: File list with status information.
* -d: list only documentation files.
* -a: List all the installed packages.

If you want to display information about package file you can specify filename using -p switch:
 rpm -q -i -p [package].rpm

== RPM Commands ==

To get general information on a package or program, use rpmlocate.

 rpmlocate ipcs -q -i apache

Searching for ipcs in rpm db:

 util-linux-2.11n-75:
 /usr/bin/ipcs
 /usr/share/man/man8/ipcs.8.gz

To list all the installed packages, use rpmqpack:

 rpmqpack

Alternatively use:
 rpm -qa


== Source Installation ==

The RPM source files have generally the format package.src.rpm and can be installed the same way as binaries.
The directories where they will be installed from /usr/src/packages are:

* SOURCES: For the original sources.
* SPECS: For the .spec file that controls the build process.
* BUILD: All the sources are built in this directory.
* RPMS: Where the complete binary packages are stored.
* SRPMS: The sources.

To install the source of a package, do:

 $ rpm -i mypack.src.rpm

The source files will be stored in the /usr/src/packages in directories SPEC and SOURCES.
To compile the sources, do:

 $ rpm -ba /usr/src/packages/SPECS/mypack.spec

The result of the compilation will be stored in the BUILD directory

== Exercises ==

* [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/Exercises results|Exercises results]]

# Is the apache package installed?
# In which package are the files /bin/ls, /usr/sbin/tcpdump, and /sbin/ifconfig?
# From the floppy disk install the pci utilities and grub packages. Build the binaries and try to execute them. The sources should be in the /usr/src/packages/BINARY directory.

The major dose limiting toxicity was hematological (thromboleukopenia). There was not a significant dose response effect on occult disease (appearance of new disease) or in the requirement for additional treatment, although certain trends were noted for the higher doses. When only patients completing assigned HBI from RTOG 82-06 and 88-22 were compared, there was no difference in the time to new disease or additional treatment in the treated field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A capsule contains medication, normally within a small container that is digested by the body. Rarely, a capsule may not be digested, and you will see it in the toilet after you use the restroom. 


Time release capsule should not crushed or chewed, which may result in a drug overdose. These capsules are made to be taken once a day, and release a small amount of drug over 24 hours. Crushing, chewing, or opening a time-release capsule destroys it, and will make you receive the medication for one day in only a few minutes. In some situations, this can kill a person. 


Examples of capsules: Nexium, zidovudine

      <text xml:space="preserve">A suspension is a liquid with small pieces of drug. The drug is not complete dissolved in the solution. Whenever you take a suspension, you should always shake (or stir) it so that you receive the right amount of drug every time you take it. Otherwise, you may receive too little drug in the beginning, and too much drug in the end 


Examples of Suspensions: Amoxicillin suspension, Insulin

'''Bigos''' is considered the Polish national dish by many. For more information see [[w:Bigos|Wikipedia's article on Bigos]].

== Ingredients ==
: 2.5 kg fresh [[Cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]]
: 2 kg fermented cabbage ([[Cookbook:sauerkraut|sauerkraut]])
: 500 g [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] or [[Cookbook:venison|venison]]
: 250 g [[Cookbook:sausage|sausage]]
: 250 g [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]]
: fresh or dried [[Cookbook:mushroom|mushroom]]s
: whole [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]

== Procedure ==
#Chop the cabbage, add pepper and salt, a part of the mushrooms and bay leaf, and cook until soft (about 2-3 hours).
#Chop the bacon and let it melt in a frying pan. 
#Fry the chopped meat and sausage in the bacon grease. 
#If necessary, drain excess water from the stewed cabbage and add the fried meat, bacon, and sausage along with the grease out of the pan. Stew everything as long as possible - the longer, the better (sometimes it is done for 3 hours a day in 3 following days, or even longer). 
#When ready, the dish should be a thick mash that does not &quot;leak&quot; water on the plate; it should be mildly sour and have a strong flavour of smoked bacon.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
There are countless variations of this basic recipe. According to some, the amount of meat should be equal to the amount of cabbage; others prefer to use only fermented cabbage as in German sauerkraut.

A very particular feature of this dish is that it can be safely stored even for a few days without refrigerating. This is why bigos used to be a common soldiers' dish.

''''''&lt;u&gt;Pharmacology&lt;/u&gt;'''''' (from Greek φάρμακον, pharmakon, &quot;drug&quot;; and -λογία, -logia, &quot;the study of&quot;) is a branch in science concerned with the effects of the drugs on living organisms (pharmacodynamics) and the effects of living organisms with the drugs (pharmacokinetics). This subject embodies drug composition and properties, interactions, toxicology, therapy, and medicinal uses such as application and antipathogenic capabilities. Pharmacology is subdivided into two categories as mentioned above, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics deals with chemical interactions with body/cell receptors. Pharmacokinetics, on the other hand, deals with the four stages of chemicals passing through the body: absorption, distribution, [[Structural Biochemistry/Metabolism|metabolism]] and excretion.

Pharmacology is not to be confused with pharmacy. Pharmacy is a professional field in medicine concerned with preparation and distribution of medicine. Pharmacology is the study of the interaction and effects between chemicals and biological systems and vice versa.

'''RTOG 78-10 ([[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation|PALLIATION]])'''
*''Title:'' Phase I/II Study of Half-Body Radiotherapy for Multiple Osseous Metastases 
*''Objectives:''
**(1) Evaluate the frequency and the duration of pain relief as a function of the dose schedules proposed.
**(2) Assess tumor and response by evaluation of measurable lesions in different sites.
**(3) Determine the normal tissue tolerance and toxicity following single exposure doses of irradiation, particularly focusing on the dose-limiting organs:  bone marrow, lung, kidney, liver, brain, spinal cord, small bowel and heart, both in terms of acute and late reactions and damage.
**(4) Study the natural history of progression of disseminated cancer, particularly the osseous lesions, and develop a useful staging system for evaluation of disseminated disease.
*''[http://www.cancer.gov/search/ViewClinicalTrials.aspx?cdrid=68715&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;protocolsearchid=1660691 NCI_Protocol]:'' Dose escalation of hemibody irradiation
*''Enrolled:'' 168 patients
*''Conclusion:''
**PMID 2423225 -- '''Single-dose half-body irradiation for palliation of multiple bone metastases from solid tumors. Final Radiation Therapy Oncology Group report.''' (Salazar OM, Cancer 1986). &lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; &quot;HBI achieves pain relief sooner and with less evidence of pain recurrence in the irradiated area than conventionally treated patients. The most effective and safest of the HBI doses tested were 600 rad for the upper HBI and 800 rad for the lower or mid-HBI.&quot;

==A Plan for the Module==
This module needs a plan if it is to become a useful resource for people wishing to learn Urdu.  Here's a proposal to get us started; I can't go much further than this, but I'm sure someone else out there can.  

Also, a template would make it easier to navigate from one page to the next, from exercise to answer key, and from section to section.  --[[User:Skoosh|Skoosh]] 22:32, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

===Getting started===
* Introducing Urdu
** Relationship to Hindi, Farsi, Arabic 
** History and literature 
* Writing and Pronunciation
** Aspirated consonants 
** Retroflex consonants 
** Romanization

===Basic Urdu===
* Salam, ap kaise hen? : Greetings and small talk 
* Voh kya he? : Asking and answering 
* tu, tum aur ap : Formality and politeness

Okay, I did something making the template like [[Template:Japanese]].  I don't know Urdu so I obviously can't write to much, I hope to maybe learn some while doing this though.  I think [[Japanese]] is a good model of athorough language book although some features of [[Arabic]] are not bad.  I like how [[French]] has both languages for the lesson titles but I don't particularly care for its introduction page -- its Appendix structure also looks pretty decent.  [[User:Grenavitar|gren]] [[User talk:Grenavitar|グレン]] 20:19, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

I created [[Urdu:Table of contents]] which I hope will help us develop our format... much (all?) of what you said was included into it and it should be our layout on how to procede. [[User:Grenavitar|gren]] [[User talk:Grenavitar|グレン]] 20:35, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

This is likely not the best way to go about it... but, I am stealing information from wikipedia in an attempt to give background on some of the subjects.  It should be modified for the purposes of the book but I believe for now it it better than nothing. [[User:Grenavitar|gren]] [[User talk:Grenavitar|グレン]] 05:08, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Meat|Meat]]

'''''Ossobuco''''', when loosely translated from Italian, means hollowed bone; a reference to the large piece of marrow in the center of the veal shank bone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/osso-buco Definition of ''ossobuco'' on Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It's a Milanese speciality of veal shanks cooked in meat broth and flavored with white wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/osso-buco-recipe/index.html Giada De Laurentiis' recipe for ''ossobuco'' on the Food Network website]&lt;/ref&gt;
Slowly braised, this relatively tough, yet flavorful cut of meat becomes meltingly tender, and the connective tissues and marrow dissolve into the sauce, making it rich and creamy. 

The shank is a relatively cheap cut of veal which is readily available in most good supermarkets and butcher shops. Look for meaty hind-shanks cut from the top of the thigh &lt;ref&gt;[http://visual.merriam-webster.com/food-kitchen/food/meat/cuts-veal.php Cuts of veal as displayed on Merriam-Webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with a high proportion of meat to bone. Each piece should be about five inches across and one-inch to one-and-a-half inches thick.

This dish probably had its origins in a Milanese farmhouse during the late nineteenth century and most likely did not originally include tomatoes, a New World vegetable.&lt;ref name= &quot;Clifford A. Wright&quot;&gt;[http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/recipes/display/bycategory.php/recipe_id/726/id/38/ Info from Clifford A. Wright on ''ossobuco'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ossobuco'' first became popular in the ''osterie'' of Milan, which were neighborhood restaurants of Italy's large cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford A. Wright&quot;/&gt; These catered to the neighborhood's local residents but rarely if ever to tourists and foreigners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford A. Wright&quot;/&gt;

Traditional ''ossobuco'' was prepared with cinnamon, [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]], bay leaf and ''[[Cookbook:Gremolata|gremolata]]'' and today is called ''ossobuco in bianco'' (''ossobuco'' in white sauce). The modern version has, by and large, replaced the older one. This new version includes tomatoes and ''[[Cookbook:Mirepoix|mirepoix]]'': carrot, celery and onion, flavored with herbs but no ''gremolata'' (although hybrid versions exist which include both tomato and ''gremolata'').

''Risotto alla milanese'' is traditionally served with ''ossobuco'', but goes well with [[Cookbook:polenta|polenta]] or mashed potatoes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford A. Wright&quot;/&gt;

The following recipe is for the modern version.
{{Wikipedia|Ossobuco}}

== Ingredients ==
* 4 slices [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] hind shank, about 2.5 to 4 centimeters (1 to 1½ inches) thick 
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped fine
* 3 ribs [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] with leaves, chopped fine
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], chopped fine
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 240 millilitres (1 cup) dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] or white [[Cookbook:Vermouth|vermouth]]
* about 480 millilitres (2 cups) meat [[Cookbook:Stock|broth]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]] fillets, mashed
* ½ teaspoon dried [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* 2 to 3 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 2 strips [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] peel
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* fresh ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

== Procedure==
# Preheat oven to {{#invoke:Temperature|f|350}}.
# If the butcher has not done so, tie the shanks around the middle with kitchen twine; this will keep them from falling apart during cooking.
# Choose a heavy, covered roasting pan or Dutch oven which will just accommodate the veal shanks in one layer. Put the butter, two tablespoons of the oil, the onions, celery and carrots in the pan and [[Cookbook:sweat|sweat]] over medium heat until the vegetables have wilted--about eight minutes. Add the garlic and lemon peel and [[Cookbook:sweat|sweat]] until they're fragrant, about two minutes more. Remove from the heat.
# Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a skillet until it is near the smoking point. Lightly flour the veal shanks and slip them into the oil. Richly brown the shanks on both of the cut sides, then place them in the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.
# Place the wine in the skillet and boil until reduced by one-half, deglazing the bottom of the pan. Pour this over the veal shanks.
# Heat the beef broth to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the tomato paste and anchovies. Add this to the veal shanks, along with the herbs, several grindings of pepper, and a large pinch of salt. The liquid should cover three quarters of the shanks. If not, add extra water.
# Bring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately two hours, turning and basting the shanks every half hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about one half cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.
# Transfer the shanks to a platter, remove the strings, and cover to keep warm. If the sauce seems watery, as is probable, place the pan on the stove top over high heat and reduce the cooking liquid until the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency. Pour the sauce over the shanks and serve.

== Notes ==
* There are variations to this dish which use other animal shanks, including turkey and [[Cookbook:venison|venison]] shanks.
* The recipe calls for anchovies, which enrich the finished sauce without adding a fishy flavor. Don't omit them, even if you don't like anchovies.
* Traditionally, the cooking sauce is finished with a mixture of garlic, lemon zest and parsley called ''gremolata.'' It adds a burst of freshness to the finished dish. ''Gremolata'' consists of the grated zest of one lemon, one finely minced clove of garlic, and one tablespoon of finely chopped parsley. Add this mixture to the sauce at the end of the cooking, as it's being reduced.
* ''Ossobuco'' is almost always served with [[Cookbook:Risotto|''risotto'']]. It's one of the few examples of Italian cooking where a starch is served with the main course. One may, for a change, substitute ''orzo'' or ''ancini de pepe'' cooked in meat broth and finished with butter and [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan cheese]].

How do you know &quot;what is the next right thing for you to do?&quot;

So I created a little chart for myself that I put on top margin of my on-line notebook that serves as my personal journal.  

The process goes as follows...

* First '''Check In''' with yourself and handle any of these concerns.
* Then accept '''Input'''.
* Then '''Orient''' yourself.
* Then '''Remind''' yourself of your plan of attack.

After that I spend time to '''Reflect'''.

And I put a line for my '''Values''' as footnote to myself.

An an example my chart looks as follows and you can customize your own to be useful and meaningful for yourself.

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Esoterica. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Esoterica~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

you said to me ''I added these pages on the Votes for deletion page to be transwikied to the french wikibooks.''

sorry, I undid that by mistake ; it is in fact a very good idea, can you do that again ? how can I do that simply?

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called RoceKiller. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name RoceKiller~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Hey McPhearson et al,
Reading the idiotic and feable-minded comments of a few &quot;less than average IQ&quot; posters here is very similar to the pain I feel in my brain after I inadvertently inhale to much ice.  I believe it is what you would call a brain freeze.  Some of these morons on here are very clearly bitter toward anyone with the ability to finish his reading in a shorter period of time.  I would say to that person, go finish that book you have been reading the past 12 months, and stay the hell off of this site!  What a moron.  If you spent a few hundred bucks on some software that you saw advertised about 3 am, right after the girls gone wild video, then all I can say is your problem, your money, you should have just spent 10 bucks on the soft porn, and you clearly are an idiot to get suckered into some stupid scammers statements.  I would expect you also buy the &quot;virus software&quot; that popped up on your screen stating you had 3,000 viruses and click here to buy the fix.  Idiot either way.  I assume you are also the one that added in the main, er book? that you are mildly retarded, or at least mildly autistic.  Friend, I would say after reading your comments that there is nothing mild about your condition, except the doctor that claimed it was only mild.  I can tell you with 100% certainty it is full blown retardation, and nothing mild about it.  For the rest of us, we will continue taking advantage of &quot;all methods and speeds&quot; of absorbing printed information, and you can continue on your pathetic way.  Good luck with that romance novel you've been reading since Christmas of 2009.  Oh, and by the way, unfortunately for you, and your archaic method of &quot;reading&quot; you spend at least an hour reading the &quot;wikibook&quot; that you commented was total garbage.....huh, interesting.  But hey, at least you will remember how awful and useless the facts in it were for the rest of your life.  Me, I happily read it in about 2 minutes, and will remember everything I wanted to out of it.  Essentially, that there are still very ignorant persons out their that are still utilizing theories that went out of commission in 1910, and that fortunately there were a couple, if only that, of beneficial statements about the many many advantageous ways to take in information, and reading and comprehending at a much higher rate of 250 wpm is one that persons without your condition of mild, er, major retardation, utilize every single day of our enlightened life.  Sorry, this must have taken you at least 2 hours to read.  I'll shorten it for you next time.  The one positive is that by the time you are done reading this you will have memorized it in you long term thus maybe 20 years from now on your 100th, you may understand.

: They sent me to college full time when I was 13 due in large part to my ability to read extremely rapidly.  This is how I learned how to do it.  I have been teaching people how to do it for 26 years.  Unfortunately, there remain feebleminded people who seem to consider that the mental limitations, limited experience, and limited understanding they are saddled with aclpply to everybody, and they like to deface things as above while wholeheartedly believing that they are contributing to society by doing so.

:Rapid visual reading is not about reading to ace comprehension tests.  A &quot;speed reader's&quot; brain is ploughing through enormous amounts of information at high speeds, and making sense out of it.  The primary idea of rapid visually oriented reading is to look at information, qualify it, search it, or classify it.  Typically one pass through information reading at &quot;normal&quot; speeds is not enough to remember most of what a person has read.  The same applies to speed reading.  One advantage of speed reading is that a reader can read the same material 4 times over in the same time it takes a person reading it at &quot;normal&quot; speeds.  Do you think a person who reads something four times over in the same amount of time has an advantage in understanding?  Try it yourself.  Just remember that practice is required to develop a skill.

:This material is surprisingly hard to write about:
:*It is hard to describe mental processes within one's own brain or the reports of others with no or minimal references to rely upon from commonly shared experience.  Keep in mind that none of the people that were &quot;natural&quot; speed readers interviewed by Evelyn Wood could describe how they did what they did.  Groping, often feeble attempts at describing something outside of common experience are often gawked at as &quot;obtuse or woolly thinking&quot;.  If you actually saw me or someone like me in action cramming 105 pages of organic chemistry textbook in 20 minutes and then acing a college midterm using such skills, you would have a little more respect for the difficulty of putting such skills into words and be more prone to try to encourage it.
:*It is easy to leave out relevant information.... and often hard to know what to put in place of something even when you know you are leaving something out.

If you think the statement in bold is feeble minded, just take a look at the module in question.  The reason it is difficult to write about is because it will not make logical, practical, or intuitive sense to anyone reading it at under 300wpm (reading for comprehension).  It just does not make practical sense and passing an exam on short term memory is nonsense and it is not a skill that people need. People want to understand and remember what they read long term. If they don't they are gonna look a pretty dumb in the long term.  [[User:N.Raja|N.Raja]] 05:52, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

:Not everything needs to be read for the long term.  Here is a case example: you are given a stack of books four feet high and told that somewhere in that stack is a peice of information that an engineer misunderstood and implimented his misunderstanding in his project.  You have two days to find the problem.  How you gonna do it?  You don't have to read that pile to memorize it, you need to read it to sift the information, looking for something that does not synch with how that engineer actually implemented his project.  The only way to solve that problem is with developed speed reading skills.  I know, because I have been in that situation on multiple occasions, and come through.  You can't use skimming or scanning to find a problem like one single control bit inverted because some chinese author inverted a sentence structure - you have to be aware of the structure of the every sentence in that four foot thick pile to spot a glitch like that. -- Jim Whitaker [[User:4.227.195.115|4.227.195.115]] 12:27, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
::Why would anyone give such an exercise?  If they know the fact is in there, why not point you at where it is?  Otherwise you could read the whole thing, and find they mistaken ... the thing you looking for is not in fact in there. [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 14:56, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

Firstly, this is actually an extremely hypothetical, plus even more rarely occuring, situation.  It is not worth the trouble of regular speed reading practice to cover this base.  Plus, skimming and scanning will make a better job of it.  You have already dug yourself into a hole.  How come normal everyday researchers at research establishments, law associations, and universities are able to cope with this kind of situation without ever having to enrol in any sort of speed reading course?  I'll tell you.  Its because the natural processes of reading (including educated guesses at where the information is hiding, and scanning and skimming) will enable the solution.  Plus, skimming is better for digging out details.  Speed reading trains you to ignore details.  If you are looking through Chinese texts, it will probably be for legal reasons of contract.  Details are essential.  Either way, speed reading is a great way to train yourself to be ignorant.  [[User:N.Raja|N.Raja]] 14:44, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

== Speed Reading Research ==

Okay, so since you have taught speed reading for 26 years and after reading this 
Wiki entry, I feel it was a good overview, but not fully complete. 
What book/reference material would you recommend to someone who is researching all the different styles of speed reading?  Is there anything out there?
What book/self-study guide is the best in the speed reading field to learn from in your opinion?

Thanks


:There are no generally accepted books that will define the best methods for speed reading.  But a good way to find sources is to compare what has been posted on wikipedi in terms of references:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading.  

:One good source is any paper or book written by R.Carver et al.  These chaps have researched reading rate at the highest level for years, and have been constantly verifying their findings.  Theirs is an extremely thorough approach, and a good baseline for doing any research on reading ability and rate.

:Beyond that, (and for interesting contrast) there are the speed reading books usually sold on the popular psychology sections of bookstores, and more cheaply in the psychology sections of libraries.  You will notice the difference between these two sources.  The former scholarly research investigates reading rate and goes through a great deal of peer scrutiny, whereas the speed reading manuals generally disagree with each other in every sense and even contradict themselves throughout (similar to this wikibook as it stands).  

:The one thing I am intrigued by is the level of misconception, self deception, and non comprehension of speed readers, as is evident in this wikibook.  It is utterly fascinating how people can be so innacurate regarding their own level of ability or understanding.  I am doing research in this area, and speed reading is a very rich source for collecting data about self deception in general, especially in the inability to accept the facts.  Very useful for understanding metacognition. 

:As a researcher, I've no intention to insult anyone here.  If you feel your version of speed reading is good for humanity, go ahead and spread the word. People will take it or leave it as they wish. Regards[[User:Thaumaturge|Thaumaturge]] 09:22, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::To respond to the first question above: most of the material out there on speed reading is absolutely pathetic.  It is almost all complete hype.  (The classic example of pure hype is &quot;Mega Speed Reading&quot; which basically says &quot;read faster, read faster, now READ EVEN FASTER&quot;.  See, how you are a speed reader!  They charge something like 60 or 80 bucks for a set of cassette tapes... Wonderful....)  Most of the people providing feedback about this article are people for whom such systems have failed....  The only good material I can think of was published in the 1970's (some of which I attempted to recapture in this wikibook) and cannot be found these days.  I cannot recommend ANYTHING out there in current publication, which is why I put this material in this wikibook together.  The best place to learn high speed reading skills from is to study someone who developed their own system that works, experiment with reading methods, but ultimately to develop your own style, or to completely abandon the whole notion if you don't have the &quot;right kind of brain&quot; to make use of speed reading skills.  It is '''impossible''' to give a complete run down of a viable speed reading system because so much depends upon the individuals own abilities.  An author can only put into words what people have been able to put into words about the ways that their brains seem to work.  It is impossible to impart mental abilities in a ten page article, '''and impossible to put together such a description that will appease all students of psychology who will sit there and pick away at it to find ways to claim it is nonsense because it doesn't &quot;agree&quot; with &quot;accepted&quot; assumptions about how the brain works'''.  Some of the writing in this wikibook needs a fair amount of work, such as the section I just rewrote on &quot;Cognitive Window&quot; which was somewhat confusing in it's previous incarnation.  -- Jim Whitaker [[User:Metaphorman|Metaphorman]] 05:54, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::To the second author, the researcher, I am seriously interested in what you see as self-contradictory or self-deceptive in this wikibook, because I will most certainly iron such out and clean it up.  It is probably just bad writing rather than self-contradiction.  I haven't gotten any constructive criticism on this material yet, so it is sort of sitting there.... uncorrected and waiting for real feedback.

::Another thing to point out, mental abilities vary enormously across the population.  For example, I have an IQ in the seven to eight sigma range.  I was sent to college full time when I was 13.  Systems that work for me don't work well for others.  I am known for lightning fast cognitive faculties, and reading at speed reading rates is a '''natural extension''' of that.  I have been using speed reading skills since I was 11 years old (and teaching wide eyed people I encounter who want to learn how to do it), and it is not uncommon for me to pick up a four foot high stack of technical manuals to isolate some misunderstanding of some engineer that has screwed up a project.  To date I have a 100% hit rate in finding such things while reading at often 10K-20K WPM.  I don't read that kind of stuff to &quot;remember&quot; what I read (when I was a teenager I tried to &quot;memorize&quot; an encyclopedia and quickly learned the error of my ways - but at least I didn't waste a lot of time trying to do it :-) ), I read stacks of manuals and such to compare the information I see in the text with what I already know (or assume).  I have no self deceptions about my reading abilities, they have been tested consistently and thoroughly since I was 11.  Your reading researchers, quite frankly, are concentrating on people with IQ's of 100....  Not having read their material, but having some exposure to their conclusions, I feel safe in assuming that they are making an enormous number of flawed assumptions: about what reading is, what reading can be, and what it means to understand something.  A person doesn't have to '''remember''' what they are reading in order to recognize and evaluate ideas in printed text -- the assumption to the contrary is a fundamental flaw in their methodology.  -- Jim Whitaker [[User:Metaphorman|Metaphorman]] 05:54, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:If anyone has ideas of how to expand this article, or specific ideas of shortcomings, you are welcome to put suggestions here for others such as myself to embellish (or reject), or introduce them into the text... -- Jim Whitaker [[User:Metaphorman|Metaphorman]] 12:12, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I think this article has only one shortcoming; The words.  

It is truly the dumbest lot of tripe I have ever read about improving reading.  The good news is that it is so unconvincing, it is unlikely to get anyone into trouble, chasing their tails to &quot;forget everything after tests&quot;.

If speed reading is incompatible with long term memory, then there is absolutely no point whatsoever in training yourself to do it.  Long term memory is crucial for learning, scanning data, thinking, and using the brain for any useful task.  You have a really dopey idea of long term memory, AND you like to promote activities that have no value to people whatsoever.  You make some attempt to sell it using hype, but really the logic is so absurd, it could be comedy.  Just get a life and read books properly.  That way you will actually understand them. [[User:Mcphearson|Mcphearson]] 04:04, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

:You miss the point.  The point being that people are out on the web looking for information about speed reading and how to do it.  No on in their right mind claims that speed reading is about improving reading.  It is a tool to allow you to rapidly process lots of information as rapidly as your brain can do it.  It's shortcomings are spelled out rather clearly, I think. - Jim Whitaker [[User:Metaphorman|Metaphorman]] 03:10, 24 July 2005 (UTC)


You have not pointed out shortcomings so much as differentiated speed reading further from reading (and made it sound useless to anyone with a brain).  You have hyped speed reading into a magical technique for passing exams without having to attend.  But the fact is, your prescriptions are totally conflicting to the point of idiocy.  I have noticed that your original article was very different from the present one in its explanation and terminology.  But no matter how much blowing with the wind you do, you just don't seem to be able to make any sense. But that's not so much your fault.  The fact is, speed reading does not make sense either. [[User:Mcphearson|Mcphearson]] 03:52, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:Anybody who uses speed reading alone in the expectation of passing a college level examination gets what he deserves.  Once in a while, it works.  And yes, the terminology didn't so much change as it got deleted because so many people didn't think it was &quot;mainstream&quot; enough, so I toned this down to be a little more like mainstream speed reading &quot;dogma&quot;.  My older versions attempted to explain how things worked in the brain at high speed and how to control the runaway mental processes of speed reading.  It got flamed repeatedly to the point that I figured someone else would go in and purge the article of my ideas, so I did it first.  They are still there in the older versions for anyone who wants to dig through the history of this article as you did. -- Jim Whitaker [[User:4.227.247.178|4.227.247.178]] 06:22, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Well, like I said, your success story at the bottom of the article is like one of those speed reading adverts that screams at you that you don't need to study and long term learning is unimportant.  The whole book really doesn't stand up to even basic logic.  [[User:Mcphearson|Mcphearson]] 10:04, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

:Who ever said anything about &quot;logic&quot;?  This is '''speed reading!'''  The point is to introduce people to a different way of thinking and reading.  It works for some people, when they use the skill judiciously and are familiar with its weaknesses.  The story at the bottom of the page is unusual, showing how it has sometimes been used in desperate situations. -- Jim Whitaker [[User:Metaphorman|Metaphorman]] 03:00, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

Hi again.  The inconsistencies are probably too many to list in one go.  But I can start with the practical options.  You state that skimming and scanning are distinct from speed reading, but your description of the action and results of speed reading exactly matches the action and result of skimming and scanning.  That is contradictory.

I can tell you that they are distinct.  However, you are stating that speed reading is superior.  Skimming and scanning can be achieved by ANYONE in a short time with NO REGULAR PRACTICE whatsoever, and NO REDUCTION IN THE ABILITY TO JUDGE COMPREHENSION and more useful for extracting details from text.  Speed reading (as you are promoting it) requires regular practice, only some people are capable, and as the research shows, it results in reduced ability to judge comprehension.  As ability to judge comprehension level is crucial for even barely competent reading, surely speed reading is a terrible way to train your mind.  And as flexible reading is the most important factor in work, study etc, surely skimming and scanning will be more appropriate.  

You infer that people are amazed at their results when they learn speed reading, and that this is a distinguishing feature.  The same is true when you show someone how to scan for the first time.  They are reading at 1000 to 10000wpm plus and getting an overview of the main concepts, and realizing that their comprehension level is low, but still being amazed at their results.  

In these first three examples, skimming and scanning are not self deluding practices.  Speed reading (and its related theories) is consistently deceptive and the pseudo(pretend)scientific theories support the self delusion. [[User:Thaumaturge|Thaumaturge]] 7 July 2005 07:20 (UTC)

:: I concur.  The good thing about these wikibooks is that someone with sense and knowledge is curious enough to read and  state the obvious about where the absurdities lie (ie, speed reading).  After trying hard throughout my job and degree and in practice training, I have discovered that ANY kind of speed reading is just poison for the mind.  It makes novels less interesting, work reading full of holes, and exam results shrink.  It feels great for a while to be able to glide over the page with smooth speed and feel like you are going somewhere fast.  But then you test yourself with the most realistic comprehension test possible (exams, work, and conversation about the material with other knowledgable people) and you find this kind of reading will consistently let you down time and time again. It is no surprise (and very reassuring) that people have been sued for making even moderate claims about speed reading. And yes, I have used the methods pushed in this wikibook, and stating that some people are incapable is just the most ridiculous excuse I have heard, it is backed up with dodgy nlp theory, and it is inconsistent with the findings of reading research and psychology.  Speed reading is EXTREMELY limited in usefulness.  And it sets up so many bad reading habits it should be avoided like the plague.  The only possible thing you can use it for is the most pulpy and useless reading materials known to man.  That may be 90% fluff, but normal writing is at least 90% meaningful.  Normal text requires a good level of comprehension to get the gist of and understand in a useful way. 

::Here is some repeated advice to save any newbie a lot of time and effort:  Just focus on good comprehension as a good workhorse level of reading, good imaginative study strategy, and a very very very small and focused amount of skimming, rather than mind limiting speed reading (and for overview purposes only).  [[User:Authopten|Authopten]] 08:03, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

After reading through the article I can't see why the other comments here are making such a big deal with the article. The article does not make any preposterous claims and the discussions about how useful speed reading is seem to be rather irrelevant. What I gather from this is that, speed reading, as explained here, is a tool for information synthesis and retrieval, not for information storage (memorization). I can certainly see a use for accelerated information synthesis.

On the article: the last &quot;success story&quot; at the end does indeed feel a bit out of place, and rather biased. Some of the referenced links seem a little dubious as well; as they show the same type of reading speed hype commonly found in popular literature on the subject.

: What on earth is wrong with being biased?  This is a how-to booklet on speed reading, not wikipedia - thank God.  In this context, virtually anything goes.  [[User:Metaphorman|Metaphorman]] 04:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

I would certainly be interested in links to academic research on the subject instead.

: What you will find is a lot of derision about how speed reading and academics aren't a good mix and suggestions by some about what to do when you are faced with overwhelming amounts of reading to do.  Probably the best selection of reading is on a link on the wikipedia page: [http://www.chemistrycoach.com/lbe5.htm Study skills page with dozens of reading and rapid reading links] which I am adding to the links at the end of this wikibook.

I've not yet made up my mind about the material here, but working in the IT field, and being able to absorb (and apply) more material at up to 2000wpm than most of my colleagues are able to absorb (let alone apply) at the commonly accepted deep-reading speed of 100-400wpm (300wpm is as slow as I am able to go without losing focus and comprehension), I do not automatically discount your claims.

I'd like to thank you for putting up this page, as it makes for interesting reading anyway, and must have constituted a lot of work. Let the reader beware and make up their own mind based on whether it works for them.

== Worst Wikipedia article I've ever seen ==

Is there a single Wikipedia rule that this monolith of nonsense doesn't break?

+1. Same here. Generally, Wikipedia can probably get one person to just clean out the speedreading garbage from all wiki sites. Never read so many scientifically rejected theories on one page.
But as long as there are people out there that look for the quick fix instead of the real skill, we will have to live with this. No reason to be bitter about it, though. [[Special:Contributions/84.63.58.109|84.63.58.109]] ([[User talk:84.63.58.109|discuss]]) 15:08, 3 July 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is the problem with democracy in it’s current form?

I see various images. I see a closed wooden chest, but with light coming out from the inside. I see a cartoon cat opening this chest slowly, with music in the background creating tension. The tension get's stronger. The cat looks pretty stupid; it's not very smart. It slowly opens the chest and the light get's stronger and stronger. But then a huge first pumps out unexpectedly and punches the cat inthe face. After that I see long halms of grass near the egde of a river,bending stronly in the wind. Bending but not cracking. The grass islong and small, but also extremely flexible. Next I see a futuristic city viewed from above. Their is a platformin the sky. It's huge and I hear sounds everywhere. Sounds likehammers and saws and of tonnes of steel being dropped. It's a busy scene where many things are happening. Slowly this scene changes, as I feel my imagination is not strong enough to view this scene. Instead I get a similair image of men being at work near a busyroad. There are cars constantly passing by as this is a huge crossroad, but the cars are slowed down enormously by the work. In the background there is an entrance to a freeway, but it's closed off from this side. This is a crossroad. From this side the freeway is inacsessable, but from another angle it is. Cars speed up andenter the freeway, but here the cars are almost stuck. They can reach the freeway, but only with great difficulty.The world and it's goverenments are like the building project in the air of this futuristic city. It's complex and it's nearly impossible to get a good overview. Work is constantly being done. It's a work in progress and it's nowhere near finished. We look inside our own box of logical thought, our perception, but what the government sees as the right solution, can be nothing more then a giant fist that punches you in the face. Government projects are like a huge blackbox, you don't know what's inside. At many times the solution plays out worse then you expected. There's also a reason for me not seeing this complex image of the futuristic building project correctly; it's too complex and I am not ready. Similairly the world is not ready to divise such a perfect and complex building plan. Right now the government act like the men doing work at the road. They work, but not very efficiently. They will get the job done, but while doing so they also narrow the road to the freeway of prosperity.


Of political party’s and treacle

The current political system is like a plate full of treacle. The treacle is stirred with a large wooden spoon, but it's very syrupi and sticky. It takes a great amount of effort to spir this treacle. Small waves move about in circles, like when a stone is dropped in the water. But the waves too are very syrupi and even when the spoon is used to stir heavily; you can't really get the waves to move. Next to the plate stands a clock. As I look at it it's markers speed up and I feel like everything around me is rushed. I see shadows of things moving. Afterimages of things moving so fast I can't see them properly. Time speeds up and as I look at the plate again I can see that the treacle get's harder and harder as time passes; like cement drying in the sun. It get ever harder to steer the syrup.

Next I see senate. A large room shaped like in a half circle, with many chairs in many rows; but nearly all are empty. Hollands prime minister speaks. It is a long speech, but he is doing it with great vigor. His hands move in various shapes to strengthen his tale and I can hear passion, or even a bit of anger in his voice. However, there are few people in this large room and the few that are there seem either bored or preoccupied with other things. Behind me is a large screen, with the name of various political party's and their logo's on it and as my attention is drawn to the screen the scene slowly changes and I see a room full of people.
This room is even larger then the first and it is filled with people. Supporters of the political party and the press. Journalist write down eagerly every word that is spoken and photographers take many pictures, as their blue light flashes in this darkened room. The atmossphere is lively and everyone seems excited. There are flowers given to those who held a speech. This is a gathering of an important political party at the elections. I see again a large screen, but this time there are statistics beamed on it. I see percentages of how well each party did. Everyone is happy (this is decmoracy), but suddenly the scene changes and I see the same clock as before and time speeds up. I view the treacle on the table again and it looks just the same. It's quite hard and nearly impossible to stir.

The democratic process of elections every 4 years is not enough to soften the treacle and make it easier to stir. Even though everyone (or most people) appear to be happy with democracy in it's current form, it's still flawed.

Coming back to my analogy of the plate of treacle. Maybe it's not treacle at all the plate needs to be filled with. Treacle might smell and taste nice and sweet; but it can also stick to your teeth leaving a bad aftertaste. Maybe we need a toothbrush to clean the teeth or maybe we need to fill the plate with something else like yogurt. Yogurt is clean and white; you don't need to stir it and it's also very healthy (more so then treacle which has a lot of sugar). You don't need to stir yogurt; as it's less sticky so that would be a defenite advantage.
Also; if it doesn't leave an aftertaste you don't really need a toothbrush that much....


What does the treacle stand for and what does the yogurt stand for?

Let's start with the treacle. I look closely at the treacle in the plate and suddenly a bunch of strawberry's appear. They float around in the brown/grayish sirup and they look very nice. I pick one of the strawberry's out and I hold it in my hand. I weigh it (it's suprisingly heavy) and I lick it (it's very sweet). The strawberry get's bigger and heavier as I hold it; it's the size of a 2 person tent now. A door appears out of nowhere and children are playing in it. I look inside and I see a suprinsly large room filled with toys like lego blocks, dolls and plastic toy cars. A slide appear at the top of this strawberry and there's a stair too, so the children can climb at the top of the berry and slide down. The strawberry appear to be multi functional. I touch it's side and it's still soft and squishy: it's still a real strawberry. A natural product. I get the feeling the floor is very important. The floor the strawberry is standing on is hard. It gives a good foundation for the children to play on. I see the small strawberry's floating around in the treacle and I realize that treacle or any kind of liquid is not a good foundation to build anything on. But at the same time; the treacle needs to be liquid for you to stir it. The treacle changes to yogurt and the yogurt changes to ice. I see a vast water which is frozen. People are skating on it; as are some fantasy figures including a cartoon wolf, a snowman and a piguin. The ice is also a good foundation to build on. It can handle nearly anything exept heat. On the other hand; treacle tastes quite nice if it's hot. So the treacle also has some good quality's that ice doesn't have, even though ice is a better foundation. Like the mighty eagle that fly’s in the sky; the real solution can be found by spreading your wings, fly away and look from above on the problem.


The solution?

Strawberry’s floating in yogurt is a nice recepy, but even better it is to freeze the yogurt; so the straberry’s have a good foundation. But the best way would be to freeze the yogurt, while still retaining the ability to heat it at will. The strawberry’s are very important: they are the center of government and they need to be moved, changed, or simply replaced if nessecary. You can only do that if the yogurt is liquid and thus it needs to be heated.

The problem with the current political system is that the sticky treacle is said to be the only way we can be governed. The plate is the egde of reason and beyond it no one looks; which reminds me of my analogy of the boxes. Most people think inside their own little box of perception; even though there are thousands upon thousands of other boxes to look in. But the place is not really the problem: government needs to be defined in a rigid framework and the plate is very good for this. But the quality of the sirup is questionable at best. Like I said: it is very hard to stir. The process of stirring is the everlasting political debate of solutions. But solutions are hard to find if the only place you look is in the sticky sirup that is hard to stir.

Yogurt ice provides a very rigid framework for the straberry’s to function. Strawberry’s are seperatly governed community’s, who look and function alike; but who all have control over a different geographical area. Like the many lines engraved on the skin of the berry, there need to be red lines of government choices. Like the lines on ones hand; they are unique. Although all hands look very much alike; the pattern of lines on your hand is unique. Strawberry’s are small and managable; they are nice to eat but they don’t fill your stomach (although they are still very healty). Likewise; a society needs to be cunked into little pieces that can govern most things for themselves. This will keep the model easy to manage. Stirring in a large plate of hard-to-stir treacle will not be nessecary.

The yogurt is the interacting between the straberry’s. There is still a central system of government; but the real power is still in the hands of these small community’s. People are skating on the yogurt ice to and from different straberry’s; with their skates leaving lines behind on the ice. These are also lines of goverment choice, but they are on a higher level: the national level. Sometimes outside influence is needed; so that the yogurt can be heated and the strawberry’s can be organised. And remember; this whole scene is still very small and fragile. A plate can be broken and straberry’s can be eated without much effort. The system is a means to achieve something and not a goal by itself. The plate is standing on a tabel. At that table people are looking at the scene before them. They have forks, spoons and knife and many other things you need for eating. These are tools they need to shape the model as I explained in new ways: for it will never be perfect. These people are always moving; people stare at the scene and have there say then they move away and other people fill there place. This is a control group. People randomly selected have there say in shaping the model on the table.

There’s really, much, much more to this image stream; but right now I can’t be bothered to write it all down. There are some many suble and meaningful perception to be found in this image stream. Perhaps at a later time I will write that all tdown. For now I think this will do.


The European constitution

I another interesting thing that comes to mind in this context is the voting for the European constitution. This was actually the first time in Holland we had a referendum. For many weeks politicians campained for it. They all expected us to vote in favour of it. But as time slowly passed and the day of the voting drew near, it grudually became clear that the voting would go against. Nomatter how hard these politicians tried, they could not get the population to vote in favor. The results was 62% against 38% I believe, but that doesn't even matter. What does matter is the way this referendum was executed. It really makes me sick. It had little to do with democracy at all! The first time such a referendum was held here, and all politicians expected us to vote for it. Much of the media was fixed on this. It seems to me that this is nothing more then an attempt at indoctrination. In our country the situation is getting worse. Time and time again the population shows that they do not agree with what politicians do. But they dont learn from it. Democracy at least in it's current form is flawed. Elections once every four years is not enough for democracy to function properly. At least not in this country. The referendum was only one example of the huge gap that’s between politicians and the population.

The problem is that politician are too far removed from society. They have lived inside their own world for my years. Like an astronaut who has lived in a space station for half his life, doesnt really know what is happening back on earth. Or like a mother who doesn't know how her child is behaving at school (until she get's the report card that is), but even that can show a heavily disorted image. How can you tell what is right for people, if you don't even know what they want?
Let me give another example. I am a member of a students society. There are many people there I like, but some of their behavior is puzzling to me. Students who take 8 years over a 4 year degree; with the argument that the government will pay anyway. This same argument they often use to explain why they don't have a job. But many also feel that some jobs are just &quot;too good&quot; for them. I am part of this social group, but at the same time I have a part time job in a greenhouse. I am sure that most students would detest such a job. But I think it's ok really. Ok; I don't earn that much, but they work is nice enough and I work with nice people (although undoubly most are not nearly as smart as me). It really doesnt matter for me; at many times these lower educated people are more fun to talk with anyway.
My point is: many students feel they are too good to have such a job and to work with such people. But at the same time, these are the people that will govern us some day. If they feel they are too good for the rest of the population, how can they govern that population well and fair?

My image stream has showed me two different solutions. One involves a direct control system where people are randomly selected from the poplutation to form a kind of control senate. Not to make decisions, but to judge them from time to time. They don't even have to have real political power. An advice group would be good enough. How does this help?
For one thing it removes at least part of the gap that is between politicians and society. A group of people randomly selected, maybe give up there job for a years or so, to sit in a senate that judges certain laws and descisions. Politicians will be constantly reminded that they are governing for the people and when they do it badly they will get negative advice from this control group. Question is; would these people have enough expertise to judge laws effectivly? It’s an interesting question that cannot be answered rigth away, but perhaps this isnt even important. What is important is that a randomly selected group of people, will come from many different corners of society. They will all have a different perception and they will all have different strength and weaknesses; unlike politicians who all basicly think in the same box.

A second solution would be that drastically decentralize the government. Small groups function better then large groups most of the time, since they have less problems and situations to solve. If a model has less variables, it will be easier to solve. An easy basic system, is much easier to optimize then a large and extremly complex system. This could be part of the reason why our current governmental system is so inefficient. Another benefit of such small groups is that communication is potentially much better and efficient. If many peole have insight into the work a governor is doing, then that governor will undoubly improve his work.


Extra points

As I said before; there is much more to be gotten from this IS then I have done so far, but I can answer these points.

1: The strawberry feels completly natural, with a soft and squishy surface, but it is actually hollow inside. The inferior is darkened, with only scarce light coming from a neon light hanging at the ceiling. Small children are playing. In one corner I see a tabel with lego blocks on it. Two children are using these large, colored blocks to build a house, tower or similair building. There's also a t.v. where a particular children's show is playing. Another child is riding a bicycle. As I focus more on the interior of this room it appears to grow larger and larger. I hear strange sounds that somehow the straberry is growing. I see the strawberry is actually hanging at the branch of a plant. There're many plants here and the strawberry appears to be only a small part of it.

The straberry is indeed a part of the government. The playful additude suggest very much the thinking outside of the box that must be done to achieve it. The building blocks stand for the building of an efficient organisation and the lego blocks are chosen because different parts of the plain must be stacked upon each other. Small, managable component's. The tv shows whats going on in the world, with extensive coverage and the bicycle is actually for the moving around and seeing with your own senses what is going on in the world.

2: The key difference lies in the treacle versus the yogurt ice. The treacle is the set minded thinking of politicians today. The treacle is our extensive model of society with everything in it from the public school system, to motor taxes. The problem is that this model is so large, complex and inefficient that altering it is like stirring in the treacle: it takes a long time and because of opposing party's and conflicting needs you never actually get what you want. Many laws are discussed that changes just a little bit of the current system, but the system is so large and complex that all overview is lost. That's why the strawberry's are so great. They are managable community's, like pions on a checkers board. All are capable of moving independent, but you need all of them to stand a chance at winning the match. Cooperation on national basis is needed, but only when truly nessecary. This garantees some important things, but the main benefit is easier management, because your working with a much smaller and easier to manage model.
Other then that I believe the 12 headed council we've spoken of before is still very much in order here, as is the book of law that still lies at it's center, but is used more guidance then for law. It's more of a philosophy then a strict set of rules. Then there are other points we've discussed. Flexibility (the ability to change the government on higher levels then just the changing of a law) and communication (so that the population has direct influence on the government itself and not just through a four year voting system).

Interestingly this model is entirely opposite from the current trend of globalisation. Is it any wonder that the European constitution is unwanted by even the European population? Another interesting question to think about.....


What IS the best solution to the present difficulties andinhumanities inthe world?

Again I see the image of the cat opening the black box. You don't know what's inside, but the answer comes out unexpectedly. It suprises you and baffles you completly. All good solutions seem crazy on the surface. I see a freeway with cars passing by at both sides. The are manystrokes and all strokes are full of cars, but they don't hinder each other. These are independent modules workign seperatly, but all are very efficient. I see various drivers of cars signalling each other. They simply greet each other. Now I see a round table, with about 12 seats and 12 persons occupying the seats. A book lies in the middle. This is a way of governing. A selected number of people working on equal basis at this round table. Their's a book of law in the middle, but it's only a book. The government is made by the people and not by the rules inthe book, because if you put the law above everything; you are thinking inside the small treasure chest as describing above and you cannot get out. But in fact there are many thousands of chests all in the same room. All are boxes of the same size and shape. You onlyneed one key to open them all at will and that key is creativy; or thinking outside the box.I see a PDA computer. I put it in my pocked. I can feel it in my jacket, but it doesnt bother me. I hear a signal and I take it out; it seems I've been e mailed. I'm at the freeway again, but now I'm drying at the other side of the road. There are modules indepentdant of each other, but trough IT; communication is easily possible. It's convienent and efficient. There is a strong splitting of tasks, but also strong inter communication between all tasks. Communication makes people move like the grass in the wind. Always moving when itblows, but never cracking. I see thousands upon thousands of tanks in a dark and futuristic scene. They are filled with people. At least that's what I think. They are about the size of a norally lengthed person, but the glass of these tanks are green and filled with fog. I can't see what's inside. This is a dark room in an omnious setting. I'm overwelmed by it's size. Suddenly a hand breaks the glass of one of the tanks. Mist spreads out. Fluid scattersacross the ground. It's slimy and green. I've never seeen anything like it. A grey hand and upper arm appear out of the tank, trying to press the button that will open the glass. It's not human. I see long fingers with claws and I'm scared, because I have no idea what will pop out of this tank. Like this tank there are many thousands in this room. All filled with strange and bizzare creatures. I see other tanks are breaking too and strange beasts are moving out. Theare similair to humans in form, but they are defenatly not. They are alien. I see weird green beasts with six arms and blue aquatic seeming creatures with many tentacles coming out of the back of their head. All are coming out of their tanks. They have been in statis for a long while, but now these alien have awoken. The more creatures I see coming out of the tanks, the more I feel at peace in this scene. Lights go on and the room is no longer dark. There arenot only aliens in this huge room, but also humans like me and the humans and alien interact. They are speaking to each other in strange tongues. I view this science fiction scene and it reminds me of tv shows like star trek where human and aliens interact on a (mostly) friendly basis. People are scared of the unkown. Solutions presented by image streaming seem strange and alien, but the more it evolves into society, the less scary it is.

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Solaris. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Solaris~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

== Please don't clear information ==

[[Acetone peroxide synthesis]] is a controversial article, but it is not appropriate to remove information that you think people shouldn't have (it is considered vandalism). It's an instructional resource, so it's entirely appropriate that potential sources of the required chemicals should be provided. Please see the talk page for more discussion, and to justify any future edits that you may make. Additionally, please log in with your user account before making any more edits, it looks like you are trying to hide behind your IP address, and that looks bad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Virtual University''' is an initiative of students, professors and [[philanthropist]]s for some free education via the [[www]], with interactive components.

Many universities, like [http://www.edison.edu/academics/university_center.htm Edison college] or the [[Open University]] in [[England]], have interactive courses over the internet ([[Distance education]]), however they charge tuition. Especially as support for third world countries there are now some proposals to deliver courses and interactive material free. Erik Moeller [[user:eloquence]] proposed the [[wikiversity]] which is under construction as an umbrella for such virtual education. In Germany a demonstration version is mounted with courses, free video/audioconferences and interactive tools, for example on [http://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Ozeanographie/kurse/ oceanography]. First professors volunteered as &quot;[[faculty patrons]]&quot; for the project, like [[Gotthilf Hempel]], [http://marine.rutgers.edu/faculty_ukils.html Uwe Kils] - all faculty worldwide is invited to add some classes and ideas to this international project, also mount some works and reading material and images and graphs on [[Wikisource]] and register with [http://www.skype.com SKYPE] and [http://www.ivisit.com iVISIT] for communication. A lecture (like &quot;[http://wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Virtual_university/classes/oceanography/antarcticbiology Biology of Antarctica]&quot;) should serve as an umbrella with jumps to information. The teaching content should be contained on life Wikipedia pages, possibly with forked-off mirrors frozen at intervals after proofreading, like in the faculty checked forked off stage of the article about [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antarctic_krill&amp;oldid=15128927 Antarctic krill]. Fred Bauder offered on his [[Wikinfo]] server the possibility for cooperating faculty to protect selected areas, like [[CV]], publications, hatching another crystallization point for free Internet academia: [http://wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Virtual_university Virtual university @ Wikinfo].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first &quot;solution&quot; violates the intent, which is that each person only passes along one bit of information (if you are going to allow the possibility of a delayed answer, what next? calling out the colour in a choice of languages? in an angry/mellow/falsetto voice...

The second solution works nicely though.

This problem is severly flawed. It assumes that the teacher will put one colour had randomly, then one of the other colour, and alternate between colours, but it doesn't expliciatly say this. There is nothing preventing there from being 8 red and 2 white?


The puzzle doesn't state anywhere that the 10th person answers first. And isn't this sort of test only encouraging cheating behaviour? :D</text>

[[Image:Olives au marche de Toulon p1040238.jpg|right|thumb|Olives on sale at the farmers' market in Toulon, France]]
The '''olive''' is a bitter, tart, and/or savory fruit.  Many varieties are grown, and a large number of preparation methods exist.  Most olives are simply pressed for [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|oil]].

The fruit is naturally quite bitter; processing is necessary to reduce this bitterness to tolerable levels, though a noticeable amount remains in gourmet olives.  [[Cookbook:Fermentation|Fermentation]] and osmosis are methods of destroying and extracting this bitterness, respectively.  

Osmosis methods resemble [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickling]] or salt curing, but are carried further since the goal is the removal of bitter water-soluble chemicals, rather than water alone.  Olives are bruised and then either leached repeatedly in [[Cookbook:Brining|brine]] or packed in [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] for long periods of time.  

The green olive and black olive are the same plant; green olives are pickled before ripening, where black olives are pickled after being ripened.

In mixed drinks it is the famous garnish of the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Martini|Martini]]; it may be used in [[Cookbook:Mortadella|Mortadella]] and is commonly used in [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]s as well. 

Olives are a mainstay of Mediterranean cooking, a simple ingredient that
can add complex flavor to a wide variety of dishes.  [[Cookbook:Tapenade|Tapenade]] is a mixture of olives,  [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]] and [[Cookbook:Caper|capers]].

Hi, my name's László. I have accounts on [[w:User:Everlong|Wikipedia]] and [[commons:User:Everlong|Wikimedia Commons]] as well, but I enjoy working on Wikibooks the most because books are big projects that allow expression of creative vision. I hope to help make the Chinese wikibook the most complete and accessible resource for learning Chinese online.

===My major interests===
*''[[Chinese:_Contents|Mandarin Chinese]]''
*''[[Positive Psychology]]'' and ''[[Buddhist Philosophy]]''
*[[Cantonese]], [[Indonesian]], [[Spanish]], [[Jamaican Creole]] and [[Wikibooks:Languages_bookshelf|language textbooks]] in general.
*''[[Linux]]'', [[LaTeX]] and ''[[Using Firefox]]''
*''[[Law and Economics]]'', [[How to manage money]], ''[[How to reduce home energy usage]]'' and ''[[Microeconomics]]''
*''[[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]]'', [[Screen Printing]], [[How To Use An Abacus]], [[Go]]
&lt;small&gt;The italicized books are things I know at least something about. The rest are things to learn.&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is an open source attempt at discussing how to create a Linux computer system by starting with a blank hard disk and assembling all the &quot;parts&quot; needed for a Linux distribution such as Debian, Fedora core, or Slackware. If you do not know what Linux is, STOP. Go read some other [[Subject:Linux | book on the subject of Linux]] first -- perhaps [[Using Ubuntu Linux]], [[Puredyne]], [[Linux Guide]], or [[Knowing Knoppix]]. Reading this book first will only make you more confused. This is not intended to be a newbie guide nor an installation manual. It is more of a map on discussing all the aspects of a real world attempt to create a Linux-controlled computer, specifically an x86 computer, as this is what the original kernel was written for. There are thousands of tutorials on how to create Linux, even a website dedicated to this very topic ([http://www.linuxfromscratch.org linuxfromscratch.org]).   Those instructions are not very detailed and are closed to editing; therefore, this is a Wiki-style attempt at reproducing the instructions on how to build a Linux system from scratch, for non-computer scientists.  This attempt at a new interpretation is  meant as simply another resource to be used ''with'' the book from www.linuxfromscratch.org as well as any other HOW-TOs available from the Internet.
{{prerequisite | Subject:Linux }}

As for distros that accomplish this task, [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo] is pretty close to installing everything from scratch.  However, after the compiling of the kernel, it's highly automated from there on, using the emerge tool to download, build, and install everything. That is where this approach differs.  Everything will be edited by &quot;hand&quot; and compiled individually.

Before you begin, read [http://algolog.tripod.com/lnxchk.htm this checklist] and make sure you have all of the information asked.

In order to determine if the system you are going to install Linux on is adequate, please read the [http://mirrors.kernel.org/LDP/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/before.html &quot;Before You Begin&quot;] section of the Linux HOW-TO.

The &lt;u&gt;Linuxfromscratch&lt;/u&gt; site will be referred to as LFS in this wikibook.

This book will use the latest stable version of the Linux kernel.

==Setting up the Hard Disk &amp; Partitions==

This book assumes the hard disk is completely blank with no existing partitions. Make sure you are logged in as root, check by typing &lt;tt&gt;whoami&lt;/tt&gt;.

The first item needed is a [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO.html LINUX boot disk] to run FDISK or CFDISK (or you could use a non-destructive partitioning program such as FIPS,  QTParted, or Paragon Partition Manager -- DO NOT use Partition Magic, it seems to have lots of trouble understanding Linux partitions). The best way to do this part is to get a live Linux CD distribution, such as Knoppix, KLAX, SLAX or LFS, which have all the packages included. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GParted GParted] LiveCD has been released specifically for this purpose. This way you will have a booted system, access to FDISK or CFDISK, as well as shell access to run utilities. 

There are several partitions to make.  In theory, a Linux system could run under a single partition (like Windows or MS-DOS systems do), but almost no one does this. Therefore the creation of specific partitions is the first step. 

===The naming convention for IDE devices===

''hd'' designated the device &quot;harddisk&quot;
''a'',''b'', etc... designates the first drive, second drive, etc...
1,2,3,etc... designates the partition.

†Optional
This scheme is by no means static, one could add more partitions, such as '''/var''' or '''/tmp''' (or even just use one for the entire system -- this is not recommended, however).

===Creating the partitions===

To create a partition on the first hard disk, use a program like FDISK or CFDISK.  Since fdisk is the most commonly used program in most Linux installation HOW-TOs, we will use this in our example.  

Pay attention to the names of the partitions as this information will be needed later for the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/tt&gt; file. 

To see the partitions available, type:
:fdisk -l

Here we will create three partitions: the boot, swap and root.  Other partitions can be created later. To start the program, type: &lt;tt&gt;fdisk /dev/hda&lt;/tt&gt; (replace hda with what ever drive you are installing Linux on). To display the partition table within fdisk, type p. This guide will assume there are no other partitions. For a system with other partitions (such as Windows), please consult other guides. 

====The boot Partition====
#Type '''n''' to create a new partition, fdisk will display:
#:Command (m for help): n 
#:Command action e 
#::extended p 
#::primary partition (1-4) 
#Select '''p''' to select a primary partition, (/dev/hda1)
#Then '''1''' to select the first primary partition. 
#Then choose the default the 1-xxxxx refers to the number of cylinders on your specific drive, which will vary according to size.
#Hit enter for the default
#:First cylinder (1-xxxx, default 1) 
#Then fdisk will display:
#:Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-xxxx, default xxxx):
#*For this part you will create a 100MB boot partition, so enter +100m
#*If you print the partition (p), it should display your partitions
 Device   Boot    Start   End    Blocks     Id   System 
 /dev/hda1            1    14    xxxxx+     83   Linux
#To make this partition bootable, Type '''a''' then '''1''' to toggle the bootable flag. It should now print like this:
 Device   Boot     Start   End    Blocks     Id   System 
 /dev/hda1  *         1    195    xxxxx+    83   Linux

====The Swap Partition====

#Follow the same procedure for creating the boot partition,
#*Type '''n''' to create a new partition, fdisk will display
#*Select '''p''' to select a primary partition, 
#*Then '''2''' to select the second primary partition.  (/dev/hda2)
#fdisk will start at the next available cylinder(196), hit &lt;tt&gt;enter&lt;/tt&gt; for the default.
#Then type +512M to create a partition 512MB swap partition
#Now, type '''t''' to set the partition type, '''2''' to select the partition you just created and then type in '''82''' to set the partition type to &quot;Linux Swap&quot;.

====The Root Partition====

#Type n to create a new partition, then p to tell fdisk that you want a primary partition. Then type 3 to create the third primary partition (/dev/hda3).
#fdisk will start at the next available cylinder(1189), hit &lt;tt&gt;enter&lt;/tt&gt; for the default.
#As for the end, make it whatever size you want, but at least 80MB
#Now hit '''w''' to write the partition table. This step finalizes the partition creation process.
#Type fdisk -l to see the new partitions.

==Creating the filesystems==

#Format the boot and root partitions using ext2 filesystem. (ext3 can also be used)
#:mke2fs /dev/hda1 
#:mke2fs /dev/hda3 
#Initialize the swap partition; you can label it with the &lt;tt&gt;-l&lt;/tt&gt; command
#:mkswap /dev/hda2
#Activate the swap partition;
#:swapon /dev/hda2

==Mounting filesystems on Partitions==
Mounting a partition means attaching it to the Linux filesystem, you don't mount a device or partition, you mount the filesystem &quot;somewhere&quot; in order to continue building Linux.

Before mounting the filesystems, they should be checked, unmounted.
#First type &lt;tt&gt;mount&lt;/tt&gt; to see what is mounted, if any /hda partition is mounted, &lt;tt&gt;umount&lt;/tt&gt; it. (Note: The swap partition will show as mounted per the previous step. If you want to check it you will need to unmount it with &lt;tt&gt;swapoff /dev/hda2&lt;/tt&gt; first, then use &lt;tt&gt;swapon&lt;/tt&gt; again.)
#To check the file system, type 
#:e2fsck /dev/hda1

Information about the partitions can be displayed using the '''df''' command with the ''-h'' or human readable option which greatly improves readability.

For the initial installation, a mount point need to be created and assigned to an environment variable. Think of it as a space in memory to mount the partitions to. The variable can be anything you want, here it will be LFS and created by running:
:export LFS=/mnt/lfs

#Create the mount point variable. (the -p switch os the parents option, it  makes parent directories as needed.
#:mkdir -p $LFS
#Mount the LFS (root) file system
#:mount /dev/hda3 $LFS
#Check that the LFS variable is set up properly:
#:echo $LFS
#*It should respond &lt;tt&gt;/mnt/lfs&lt;/tt&gt;
#Check the new partition with &lt;tt&gt;mount&lt;/tt&gt; to see if it is not mounted with permissions that are too restrictive (nosuid, nodev, or noatime). the response should be:
#:&lt;tt&gt;/dev/hda3 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)&lt;/tt&gt;
#*All programs to be compiled will be done so under the &lt;tt&gt;$LFS/tools&lt;/tt&gt; directory, so create it.
:mkdir $LFS/tools
#Next a [http://www.faqts.com/knowledge_base/view.phtml/aid/24 symlink] needs to be created for the tools directory. 
#:ln -s $LFS/tools /
#Make a directory to store the source tarballs with the correct permissions:
#:mkdir $LFS/sources
#:chmod a+wt $LFS/sources
#to see your directories, type 
#:ls $lfs
#*if you want to build the packages as a SU, rather than root, see LFS chapter 4.3
#create a new .bash_profile
#:cat &gt; ~/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; &quot;EOF&quot; 
#:exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash 
#:EOF
#Create the .bashrc file for a non-login shell:
#:cat &gt; ~/.bashrc &lt;&lt; &quot;EOF&quot;
#:set +h
#:umask 022
#:LFS=/mnt/lfs
#:LC_ALL=POSIX
#:PATH=/tools/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
#:export LFS LC_ALL PATH
#:EOF
#prepare the environment for building the temporary tools, &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt; the just-created user profile:
#:source ~/.bash_profile

Now an environment is available for the build.

== Building Temporary System ==
This section will guide you through the process of building all the packages you downloaded into the sources folder.

First we must move into our sources folder where all our packages are. 
Note: If you can't download the source files
1) look /lfs-sources directory
2) use cp command to copy the source files to $LFS/sources directory

#: cd $LFS/sources

Then follow the LFS book for installing packages in version 7.0(the one I am using) we install binutils-2.21.1a. An important thing to remember you must do this for all packages: 1. extract the content of the package. 2. go to the package 3. follow the instructions in the book 4. after building the package delete all content. AN example of this is shown below for bintuils-2.21.1a

when extracting packages we will use the tar command. For files that end with .bz2 i use tar xvjf &quot;package name here&quot; (without quotes) and for .gz i use tar xvf&quot;package name here&quot;(without quotes).

#tar xvjf binutils-2.21.1a.tar.bz2
#:cd bintutils-2.21.1a (faster way is cd binutils*)

binutils recommends that we build a seperate build directory
#:mkdir -v ../binutils-build
#:cd ../binutils-build

now we prepare binutils for compilation
#:../binutils-2.21.1/configure \
--target=$LFS_TGT --prefix=/tools \
--disable-nls --disable-werror

after it is finished we use the make command to compile the package
note that if you have more than one core you can use the -j&quot;number&quot; command so i have 2 cores so i'd use make -j2

#: make or make -j2(for 2 core processor only)

After this is complete for 64 bit computers we must create a symlink to ensure the sanity of the toolchain

#:case $(uname -m) in
x86_64) mkdir -v /tools/lib &amp;&amp; ln -sv lib /tools/lib64 ;;
esac

and then install the package

#:make install

after this is done we must remove the files/folders so go back to the sources folder

#: cd ../ or cd $LFS/sources

then remove the files/folders

#: rm -rv binutils-2.21.1 binutils-build

and voila you have succesfully built your first package now use this format to build the rest of your packages, remember extract,go in extracted directory, follow book, remove content

==Installing software packages==

In this section, the package versions used by the LFS book will be used as they have been tested, and are known to work. The reason being that, for example, package &quot;foo&quot; might need package &quot;bar&quot; to be at a certain stage of release, and so on. Therefore this part of the book will almost mirror the original LFS book[http://lfs-matrix.net/lfs/view/stable/index.html], adding details where they are absent from LFS.

The LFS website offers a LIVE CD via emule or bittorent. To use this option, go to the LFS page and click on the &lt;tt&gt;packages&lt;/tt&gt; link. Download the LIVE CD.

==The Packages &amp; Patches==

The list is found at [http://lfs-matrix.net/lfs/view/stable/chapter03/packages.html LFS Packages] and
[http://lfs-matrix.net/lfs/view/stable/chapter03/patches.html LFS Patches].

Download or otherwise obtain the packages. For a more detailed list of the packages used, read this [[/Packages|subpage]]

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antibiotics''' are drugs that are used in the treatment or prevention of bacterial infections.  Strictly speaking, antibiotics are natural substances produced by micro-organisms as opposed to semi-synthetic or synthetic antibiotics, which are either natural substances artificially modified or totally human created respectively.  In common parlance and clinical practice this distinction is not used currently.

Antibiotics form part of a wider range of '''antimicrobial agents''', a group which also includes antifungals, antivirals, antiprotozoals and disinfectants.  This group is also known as '''chemotherapeutic agents'''.

==Concepts in antibiotic pharmacology==

===Blind therapy===
Initial or Blind or Umbrella or Empirical therapy refers to the treatment of an infection without knowing the causative pathogen.  This will refer to the first presentation of an infected patient, where the clinician must decide which antibiotics to use prior to laboratory confirmation.

===Bacteriostatic===
A drug that inhibits growth or development of a bacterium, rather than directly killing it.  
Bacteriostatic drugs depend upon the immune system of the patient for activity, and so make poor choices where the immune system is compromised, for example patients with AIDS.
A drug that is bactericidal for one strain of bacteria may only inhibit the growth of another strain. Although it might seem logical that bactericidal drugs would be preferable to bacteriostatic drugs, the type of infection is important in determining which kind of drug to use. Endocarditis seems to be best treated by bactericidal drugs. Meningitis is another candidate for bactericidal drugs. Strikingly, a bacteriostatic drug can antagonize the action of a bactericidal one in the treatment of meningitis. In treating urinary tract infections and preventing staphylococcal wound infections, studies have shown that bacteriostatic drugs work as well as bactericidal drugs. 

In central nervous system infections, a rapidly bactericidal drug can release bacterial products that stimulate inflammation. For this reason, it is recommended that corticosteroids be given at the same time as a bactericidal antibiotic for bacterial meningitis. Certain bacteriostatic drugs may be preferable in cases of streptococcal and clostridial gangrene, because they inhibit the production of the toxins that cause much of the morbidity.

Some infectious disease physicians wrongly believe that bacteria-killing drugs are automatically preferable to those that inhibit bacterial growth.

The '''MIC''' (minimum inhibitory concentration) is the minimum concentration of drug which can inhibit the growth of the microorganism.

===Bacteriocidal===
A drug that directly kills a bacterium.  The '''MBC''' (minimum bactericidal concentration) is the minimum concentration of drug which can kill the microorganism.


===Chemotherapeutic Spectrum / Antimicrobial Spectrum===
The range of bacteria that an antibiotic affects, divided into Narrow Spectrum and Broad Spectrum.
*Narrow spectrum antibiotics act against a limited group of bacteria, for example sodium fusidate only acts against ''staphylococcal'' bacteria.
*Broad spectrum—antibiotics act against a larger group of bacteria, for example amoxicillin.

===Combination therapy===
The use of two or more agents simultaneously.  This combination can produce:
#An additive effect 
#Synergistic effect, where the effect of using both agents together is greater than the sum of the effects of the drugs.  This can be seen in
##Co-trimoxazole
##Co-amoxiclav
##Penicillin and an Aminoglycoside for endocarditis
#Antagonism, where the combination reduces the activity of each antibitoic.  This is seen where a bacteriostatic and a bactericidal drug are used in combination.


Reasons why this may be preferred include:
#To avoid the development of resistance, particularly in bacteria
#To provide broad coverage in polymicrobial infection 
#Severe infections where the cause is unknown, or in empirical therapy. 
#Synergy in specific infections
#Where the pathogen cannot be easily killed and prevention of emergence of resistance. (Tuberculosis, Leprosy)

Reasons why combination therapy might not be preferred include:
#Increased toxicity
#Antagonism - the two agents interact resulting in reduced antibiotic effect
#Increased cost

Some agents are available in combination within a single pharmaceutical preparation, for example co-amoxiclav contains both the active agent &quot;amoxicillin&quot; and the enzyme inhibitor &quot;clavulanic acid&quot;, which extends the spectrum of amoxicillin.

==Superinfection==

It is a phenomenon may be defined as appearance of bacteriological and clinical evidence of new infection during the chemotherapy of a primary one.

Some causative organism of Superinfection
#Candida or fungal infection commonly
#Enterobacteriaceae (Shigella, Salmonella, Escherichia, Klebsiella)
#Pseudomonas
#Staphylococcus

 

Mechanism of Action—

Normal bacterial flora like E. coli produces vit-K. But antibiotics can destroy the flora, those who are sensitive to that antibiotic and there is imbalance of the flora. Then there is development of endogenous bacteria and overgrowth of micro-organism. So, there is another infection called Superinfection. Superinfection may occur in two ways—

Superinfections mostly occur in broad spectrums. Due to antimicrobial therapy there is removal of the inhibitory influence of the drug sensitive flora that is normally inhibited in the nasopharynx and other body orifices. Many of these floras produce antibacterial substance called Bacteriosin. As a result of alteration of normal microbial flora of the host, there is establishment of growth of exogenous microorganism and endogenous proliferation of microorganism which are relatively not sensitive to that particular antibiotic. So, secondary infection is superimposed on the original infection. Usually they are Candida. The Superinfection is common and usually dangerous.

 
The incidence of superinfection can be reduced by using a narrow spectrum, such as benzylpenicillin, in preference to a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as cefotaxime.

==Mechanism of Action==

Variation in site of action can indicate why certain antibiotics operate against certain bacteria, but not others.

The principle sites of action are:

#Cell wall synthesis
#Cell membrane function 
#Protein synthesis 
#Nucleic acid synthesis


 
==Complications of antimicrobial therapy==

#Development of bacterial resistance (drug resistance) including cross resistance.
#Toxicity
#Chronicity
#Relapse
#Allergy and Hypersensitivity reaction
#Superinfection

Causes of anti-microbial failure—

1.   Development of drug resistance

2.   Improper diagnosis

3.   Improper selection of antimicrobials

4.   Improper dose and dosing schedule

5.   If the combination therapy is not used where necessary

==Rational use of antibiotics== 

The main basis is “SANE”

S → Specificity

A → Availability

N → Need to the community

E → Efficacy

 

1.   Right diagnosis should be made either clinically or by laboratory.

2.   Right decision should be made whether the chemotherapy is needed or not.

3.   Proper selection of drug—

*  Specificity

*  Routes of administration

*  Cost effectiveness

*  Safe drug

*  Proper combination

*  Easy availability

*  Essential drug (drugs needed for the vast majority of the population—ORS, Paracetamol)

4.   Right dose—usually we give initially loaded dose followed by maintenance dose.

5.   Right duration—at least 3-5 days antibiotic should be continued.

6.   Right time schedule—to maintain MIC and MBC.

7.   Status of the patient—

*  Age of the patient

*  Hepatic and renal function

*  Pregnancy

*  Lactating mother

*  Immune system of the patient

*  Site of infection

 


 


 

Chemoprophylaxis—

It is the use of drug to prevent infection by one organism virtually uniform susceptibility.

 

Categories—

A. True prevention—protection from invasion of microorganism, to which they are exposed.

*a.  Penicillin prevent group-A β-hemolytic streptococci. The illness is mainly Rheumatic fever, Acute-Glomerulonephritis etc.

*b.  Co-trimoxazole to prevent recurrent UTI caused by E. coli.

*c.  Rifampicin and Minocycline to prevent meningococcal infection.

B. Secondary infection is prevented in patients ill with other diseases.

*a.  Quinolones are used to prevent septicemia in immune compromised patients such as AIDS, Leucopenia etc.

C. Suppression of existing infection before it causes over disease.

*a.  PPD (purified protein derivatives) test positive, Isoniazide is given against Tuberculosis.

*b.  Chloroquine and Mefloquine are given to prevent malaria.

*c.  Anti tetanus vaccine is given in trauma

D. Surgical chemoprophylaxis—it is the use of anti-microbials on a prophylactic basis in case of a surgery. It may be used for various surgical conditions. It is justified as follows—

*a.  In operations where large number of bacteria are present in the target tissue.

*b.  Where the infection risk is low but the consequence may be fatal (prosthatic valve).

*c.  In susceptible patients (neutropenic patients)

*d.  Based on the knowledge of the probable organism

Example—

1.  In colorectal surgery there is high risk of infection with bacteroids, E. coli, Clostridia. So chemoprophylaxis may be achieved with Cephalosporin and Metronidazole.

2. In gastric conditions where acid secretion is low, infection risk is high. Such as prophylaxis of Cephalosporin may be given.

3.  In gynaecological infection chemoprophylaxis is indicated prior to hysterectomy or perineal floor repair operation with Cephalosporins, Metronidazole. The lower genital tract contains bacteroids, coliform and anaerobes.

4.  In valvular disease Penicillin is given.

5.  In leg amputation Penicillin and Metronidazole is given to prevent gas gangrene

==Antimicrobial resistance==

Bacteria are said to be resistant if their growth is not halted by the maximal level of an antibiotic that is tolerated by the host.

Development of antimicrobial resistance is one of the important causes of failure of anti-microbial therapy. Resistance develops as a result of the followings—

Natural resistant strains—during treatment some bacteria are naturally eliminated and those which are not will then proliferate.

Spontaneous mutation—it permits selective multiplication of resistant strains.

Transmission of genes from other bacteria—such transmission may be plasmid mediated or the resistance may occur by chromosomal or extra-chromosomal mechanisms.

 

The resistance is mediated via—

1.   Production of enzyme that can modify the drug or inactivate the drug

2.   ↓ the passage of anti-microbials into the cells

3.   ↑ the influx of anti-microbial into the cell

4.   Modification of the target site of the drug

 

Development of Bacterial Resistance—

 

Genetic—may be of 2 types—

1. Chromosomal—

This develops due to spontaneous mutation of DNA. Due to spontaneous mutation of DNA—

·     Alteration of PBP (Penicillin binding protein) capacity

·     Alteration of PBP

·     Alteration of amino acids in ribosomes

·     Alteration of DNA gyrase (it is inhibited by Quinolones)

·     Alteration of protein of ribosomes

·     Alteration of pathway of synthesis of folate

 

2. Extrachromosomal / Plasmid mediated—

Plasmid—plasmids are extra-chromosomal DNA molecule which may exist free in the bacterial cytoplasm. As they are extra-chromosomal the genetic information is readily transformed among the bacteria of same species and sometimes among the bacteria of other species. This transfer is encoded in the R-factor.

·    Production of enzymes that destroy the active drugs. (β-lactamase, acetylating, adenylating, phosphorylating enzymes, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase)

·    Reduced efficacy of drug for target.

·    Production of new synthetic pathway to bypass the metabolic block. (Sulfonamide)

·    Reduced uptake of drug. (Penicillin—altered porin channel in gm –ve, Aminoglycosides—no entry in gm +ve)

·    Enhanced influx of drug from bacteria. (Tetracycline)

 

Non-genetic—

1.  Some organisms may inherently resistant to an antibiotic. (Vancomycin—gm -ve)

2.  Microorganisms those are metabolically inactive. (Mycobacterium—non multiplying)

3.  Microorganisms may loss their specific target structure for a drug of several generations.

(Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Rickettsia all of these are devoid of cell wall, Tetracycline is given in these cases)

 

Limitation of Resistance—

a.  To give rational dose of drug, avoidance of discriminate.

b.  Use of antimicrobial combination in appropriate circumstances.

c.  Constant monitoring of resistance pattern in hospital or community acquired.

 

Cross Resistance—means when one group of microorganisms is resistant then at the same time another group of microorganism can be resistant when they share the same chemical structure of mechanism of action.

Ex—if Polymixin is resistant then Colistin is also resistant, if Neomycin is resistant then Kanamycin is also resistant.

== Health Hazard ==
Today’s society has access to more antibiotics than ever before, and tomorrow’s society will have even more access than today’s. Antibiotic cures for different ailments are used frequently by the human population. This seemingly benign, even beneficial, proliferation of antibiotic use has some dangerous repercussions. 

Bacteria become drug resistant by exposure to a drug over a period of time long enough for it to build a resistant gene. This new resistant gene may be passed on to other bacteria through conjugation (transfer directly between cells) or transformation (picking up bits of DNA released by other bacteria). Some antibiotics such as tetracycline can actually catalyze the exchange of resistant genes between bacteria.  

Disease in humans can be caused by either bacteria or viruses. A bacteria is a living, single-celled organism, while a virus is only living in conjunction with a host and is completely unresponsive to antibiotics. So, it is the reaction of bacteria, not viruses, to antibiotics that poses a hazard to human beings. This does bring to light the frequent inappropriate use of antibiotics in “treating” the common cold which is caused by a virus. Using antibiotics to battle the cold is done in vain, the only thing to be done in this case would be to let it run its course. By using antibiotics at this inappropriate time, the only effect on the body is the increased destruction of beneficial bacteria. 

There are over 100 trillion bacteria in the human body, but most are innocuous, and can even be beneficial in warding off diseases. Many physicians still think of antibiotics as benign, but research has proved that they can actually change the microbial ecology of the body and facilitate the spread of drug-resistant genes to the public. Antibiotics kill off harmless bacteria that actually create competition for drug-resistant microbes. An example of the hazards of this can be seen in “Hospital-acquired infections”, where patients are often treated with multiple, powerful antibiotics which leaves them with minimal beneficial bacteria to ward off the many drug-resistant pathogens to which they are exposed.

Antibiotics are also erroneously used by farmers in the food of their livestock. These antibiotics are simply used to promote quick growth, and have massive repercussions on the human population consuming this livestock. Humans ingest the animals, who have been routinely exposed to antibiotics and have thus built up drug resistant bacterial genes, and introduce microbes into their bacteria infested GI tracts, thereby encouraging these resistant genes to spread from the infected livestocks' bacteria to their own bacteria. 

Attempts to correct, or even to simply slow down, this eruption of hazardous effects of antibiotic use have been targeted towards the FDA and Department of Agriculture to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock food, and towards physicians to utilize antibiotics more prudently. Yet, with little success in these endeavors thus far, and the increased discovery of additional antibiotics, some for lasting conditions such as heart disease, which would require the use of antibiotics over the span of one’s entire lifetime, the repercussions of society’s inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics is culminating into a dangerous epidemic.--[[User:Miacris|Miacris]] 08:26, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Set up a turntable with a pulley attached to a bench top nearby. Wind a string around the central axel of the turntable at a fixed radius, and hang over the pulley with a stack of masses attached to this end. Release the mass stack and time how long it takes to fall to ground, thus rotating the turntable with a particular torque for a fixed angular displacement.(ex/ 5 revolutions) Adjust the applied torque by changing the mass stack value, and time again for the same angular displacement. Repeat for three or more further values of the mass stack, each time recording the time it takes for the turntable to complete the fixed angular displacement chosen (ex/ 5 revolutions)
Using the gathered data it is possible to calculate the angular acceleration of the turntable for each value of torque applied, then plot a graph of these to calculate the gradient, which equals the rotational inertia I of the turntable.
Further experiments could involve adding mass to the turntable at various radial distributions to  demonstrate the effect of increasing the rotational inertia.

== script ==

Hi - considering Yiddish is written in the Hebrew (Aramaic) script, maybe we could also write in that script rather than just the Romantic/English transliterations. I have a English/Hebrew keyboard, but my Yiddish doesn't really extend far beyond drek and shtup. :)

: Ja, I think we should have both. My Yiddish isn't great, but I know some history. Maybe I'll get round to writing an introduction eventually. ----[[User:163.195.192.74|163.195.192.74]] 21:11, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC) (English Wikipedia User: Taejo)

::&quot;svvarts&quot;? I've never seen &quot;svv&quot; used in transliteration. Are you following some particular transliteration for Yiddish? There are several. -- [[:wikipedia:en:user:Jmabel]] 20:51, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

The Transliteration is not YIVO, it's not anything; some weird new American dialect at best. if it's an u or i or a or o he'll write an u which is why we best stick to YIVO.[[User:זאראטוסטרא|זאראטוסטרא]] ([[User talk:זאראטוסטרא|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/זאראטוסטרא|contribs]]) 18:26, 29 June 2011 (UTC)

== considering YIVO ==

I suggest removing the yivo transliteration completely, instead dedicating a part to the Yiddish alefbet. YIVO is not an alternate orthography for Yiddish, it not more than a mean of transliteration to the English language. Please throw a look at how it is handled in other languages not written in latin - Greek, Persian and Hebrew. I actually believe it should be rewritten completely, animal names and colours are not that helpful; that 3 irregular verbs aren't that helpful either. My Yiddish is more than just rusty, yet I could explain the basics, but I would need helpers. Do we have any literate advanced Yiddish speakers? [[User:84.167.249.71|84.167.249.71]] 21:37, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

I know a few chuncks of Yiddish and the Alefbet, but by no way in hell I could read the proper version with the original spelling for Aramaic and Hebrew-rooted words. That's why I guess it's called conversational, not literary Yiddish. I'm sure there are plenty of people needing something similar for their stay in Greece or Russia. [[Special:Contributions/79.216.238.200|79.216.238.200]] ([[User talk:79.216.238.200|talk]]) 22:08, 9 October 2008 (UTC)
EDIT: Knowing the vegetable names hardly suffices even for a conversation about vegetables. The book indeed needs to be rewritten. Can anyone contact the yiddish wikipedians? I'd start greetings or asking directions and time if I knew how.

== If anyone wants to work on this book ==

I suggest throwing away this one completely and starting from scratch. You can grab some pages from [[Yiddish for Yeshivah Bachurim|the other Yiddish book]], such as the reading Yiddish page, but keep in mind that many things will have to be changed to suit the audience (i.e., you'll have to explain how to pronounce all those letters that are the same as Hebrew). And all the examples have to be totally different, and much of the vocabulary. --[[User:Clum|Clum]] ([[User talk:Clum|talk]]) 06:32, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

== Remake ==

Hello, I have decided to take up the challenge of making a high-quality Conversational Yiddish Wikibook. I have written up the front page, and I want to see what people would think. Will anyone help? My Yiddish is not perfect yet, so someone who is further along should help and fix any errors, as well as help to write pages. So, I hope people will allow me to undertake this challenge, and help, too. -[[User:Shikku27316|Shikku27316]] ([[User talk:Shikku27316|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shikku27316|contribs]]) 02:03, 5 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

'''Template:IPA is for IPA characters only!'''
* For '''[[polytonic Greek script]]''', please use [[:Template:Polytonic]] [[Template talk:Polytonic |[talk&amp;#93;]].''
* For '''other languages or symbols''', please use [[:Template:Unicode]] [[Template talk:Unicode |[talk&amp;#93;]].
&lt;/div&gt;

'''[[Template:IPA]]''' fixes broken display of [[w:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) characters in MS Internet Explorer 6 for Windows.  In other web browsers, it doesn't affect font display at all.  

It also allows all registered Wikipedia users to specify styles for IPA text by editing their monobook.css style sheet.

----


An example, placing a phonetic rendering of the word ''characters'' in Template:IPA:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{IPA|/&amp;amp;#712;k&amp;amp;aelig;.&amp;amp;#633;&amp;amp;#601;k&amp;amp;#716;t&amp;amp;#601;(&amp;amp;#633;)z/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The result will be a span with a style attribute, like this:

  &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span&lt;/nowiki&gt; class=&quot;IPA&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Lucida Grande, &lt;br /&gt;
   Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Gentium, Code2000; &lt;br /&gt;
   font-family /**/:inherit;&quot;&gt;/&amp;amp;#712;k&amp;amp;aelig;.&amp;amp;#633;&amp;amp;#601;k&amp;amp;#716;t&amp;amp;#601;(&amp;amp;#633;)z/&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Which appears in your browser as:

: {{IPA|/&amp;#712;k&amp;aelig;.&amp;#633;&amp;#601;k&amp;#716;t&amp;#601;(&amp;#633;)z/}}

Without template:IPA:

: /&amp;#712;k&amp;aelig;.&amp;#633;&amp;#601;k&amp;#716;t&amp;#601;(&amp;#633;)z/

[The last two should only look different if you are using Internet Explorer on Windows.]

Please place all IPA text into Template:IPA, even if it doesn't have any special IPA characters, like this: {{IPA |/aj pi ej/}}.  This will allow users to format all examples of IPA text consistently, with their choice of fonts, colours, etc.

== Technical details ==

The &lt;code&gt;class=&quot;IPA&quot;&lt;/code&gt; attribute exists so that Wikipedia users can apply their own style sheets to text in Template:IPA.  See [[#Applying custom styles to IPA text]], below.

The first declaration &lt;code&gt;font-family: Lucida Grande, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode, Gentium, Code2000;&lt;/code&gt; actually lives in a sub-template at [[:Template:IPA fonts]].  It lists a series of fonts that are known to contain IPA characters.

The second style declaration &lt;code&gt;font-family /**/:inherit;&lt;/code&gt; overrides the preceding font declaration, and tells the text in Template:IPA to use the default font inherited from its surroundings, in every browser except MSIE 6.0.  The empty comment placed just in the right spot confuses MSIE 6 and prevents it from applying this declaration.  This is a documented way of hiding CSS from MSIE 6.

== Editing Template:IPA ==

The font list is at [[:Template:IPA fonts]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:IPA_fonts&amp;action=edit [edit&amp;#093;].  Remember that Template:IPA is intended to display IPA characters.  Criteria for selecting fonts:

* Full IPA character set.
* Normal and bold weights, for emphasis.
* Sans-serif, matching Wikipedia's default font.

Less important criteria:

* Having a wide range of other international characters.
* Having italics.

Do not surround font names with single quotes, because Wikipedia's software will escape them with backslashes.  CSS recommends single quotes around font names with spaces, but doesn't require them.

=== About the fonts ===

'''Vitamin C''' is a water-soluble nutrient essential for life and is used by the human body for many purposes. To the best of scientific knowledge, all animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin C, except for a small number of animals, including humans.

===Introduction===
==What can vitamin C do for your health?==

By Kathleen Zelman, MPH, RD/LD
WebMD Weight Loss Clinic - Feature

Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD

Vitamin C is one of the safest and most effective nutrients. The benefits of vitamin C may include protection against immune system deficiencies, cardiovascular disease, prenatal health problems, eye disease, and even skin wrinkling.

A recent study published in Seminars in Preventive and Alternative Medicine that looked at over 100 studies over 10 years revealed a growing list of benefits of vitamin C.

&quot;Vitamin C has received a great deal of attention, and with good reason. Higher blood levels of vitamin C may be the ideal nutrition marker for overall health,&quot; says study researcher Mark Moyad, MD, MPH, of the University of Michigan. &quot;The more we study vitamin C, the better our understanding of how diverse it is in protecting our health, from cardiovascular, cancer, stroke, eye health [and] immunity to living longer.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; Moyad notes, &quot;the ideal dosage may be higher than the recommended dietary allowance.&quot;

==How Much Vitamin C Is Enough?==
Most of the studies Moyad and his colleagues examined used 500 daily milligrams of vitamin C to achieve health results. That's much higher than the RDA of 75-90 milligrams a day for adults. So unless you can eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, you may need to take a dietary supplement of vitamin C to gain all the benefits, Moyad says. He suggests taking 500 milligrams a day, in addition to eating five servings of fruits and vegetables. He also notes that only 10% to 20% of adults get the recommended nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily.

Moyad says: &quot;The safe upper limit for vitamin C is 2,000 milligrams a day, and there is a great track record with strong evidence that taking 500 milligrams daily is safe,&quot; he says.

==The foods and beverages you'd need to consume to reach 500 milligrams (mg):==

•Cantaloupe, 1 cup: 59 mg Vitamin C
•Orange juice, 1 cup: 97 mg
•Broccoli, cooked, 1 cup: 74 mg
•Red cabbage, 1/2 cup: 40 mg
•Green pepper, 1/2 cup, 60 mg
•Red pepper, 1/2 cup, 95 mg
•Kiwi, 1 medium: 70 mg
•Tomato juice, 1 cup: 45 mg

==The Health Benefits of Vitamin C==
According to recent research, vitamin C may offer health benefits in these areas:

1. Stress. &quot;A recent meta-analysis showed vitamin C was beneficial to individuals whose immune system was weakened due to stress -- a condition which is very common in our society,&quot; says Moyad.  And, he adds, &quot;because vitamin C is one of the nutrients sensitive to stress, and [is] the first nutrient to be depleted in alcoholics, smokers, and obese individuals, it makes it an ideal marker for overall health.&quot;

2. Colds. When it comes to the common cold, vitamin C may not be a cure. But studies show that it can help prevent more serious complications. &quot;There is good evidence taking vitamin C for colds and flu can reduce the risk of developing further complications, such as pneumonia and lung infections,&quot; says Moyad.

3. Stroke. A recent study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that those with the highest concentrations of vitamin C in their blood were associated with 42% lower stroke risk than those with the lowest concentrations.  The reasons for this are not completely clear. But what is clear is that people who eat plenty of fruits and vegetables have higher blood levels of vitamin C.

4. Skin Aging. Vitamin C affects cells on the inside and outside of the body.  A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition examined links between nutrient intakes and skin aging in 4,025 women aged 40-74. It found that higher vitamin C intakes were associated with a lower likelihood of a wrinkled appearance, dryness of the skin, and a better skin-aging appearance. 

Other studies have suggested that vitamin C may also:

•Improve macular degeneration.
•Reduce inflammation.
•Reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

==Vitamin C's Role in the Body==
Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is necessary for the growth, development and repair of all body tissues. It's involved in many body functions, including formation of collagen, absorption of iron, the immune system, wound healing, and the maintenance of cartilage, bones, and teeth.

Vitamin C is one of many antioxidants that can protect against damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals, as well as toxic chemicals and pollutants like cigarette smoke. Free radicals can build up and contribute to the development of health conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and arthritis.

Vitamin C is not stored in the body (excess amounts are excreted), so overdose is not a concern. But it's still important not to exceed the safe upper limit of 2,000 milligrams a day to avoid stomach upset and diarrhea.

Water-soluble vitamins must be continuously supplied in the diet to maintain healthy levels. Eat vitamin-C-rich fruits and vegetables raw, or cook them with minimal water so you don't lose some of the water-soluble vitamin in the cooking water.

Vitamin C is easily absorbed both in food and in pill form, and it can enhance the absorption of iron when the two are eaten together.

Deficiency of vitamin C is relatively rare, and primarily seen in malnourished adults. In extreme cases, it can lead to scurvy -- characterized by weakness, anemia, bruising, bleeding, and loose teeth.

Scurvy symptoms arise as a result of the deactivation of many ascorbic acid dependent enzymes, classified as 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (2-ODD’s).  This class of enzymes, which are widely present in all animal cells is involved in the incorporation of O2 into organic substrates.  To be catalytically active, these enzymes require Fe2+ and ascorbic acid as co substrates.  The reaction catalyzed by 2-ODD’s involves the splitting of the dioxygen molecule to generate an oxygen-iron complex which is then used to hydroxylate a proline residue that is then used in many biochemical pathways.  Some of these reactions include ring closures and post-translational hydroxylations.  Since the enzymatic activity in highly dependent on the presence of ascorbic acid, it is proposed that 2-ODD’s and ascorbic acid (ASC) evolved together to carry out these biological reactions.   

In the absence of ASC, one of the 2-ODD’s, P4H self oxidizes and becomes inactive.  This inactivation was the first determined causes of scurvy symptoms.  P4H, which carries out the hydroxylation of peptidyl-proline, is required for collagen folding.  Without the hydroxylation the trimers that are a key to mature collagen formation cannot form.  This leads to decreased melting point and an increased flexibility under biological conditions.  

This is just one of many biological pathways that, as a result of a decreased dietary intake of ASC can lead to the symptoms observed in scurvy.

==The foods richest in vitamin C are:==
Citrus fruits, green peppers, strawberries, tomatoes, broccoli, white potatoes, and sweet potatoes. Other good sources include dark leafy greens, cantaloupe, papaya, mango, watermelon, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, red peppers, raspberries, blueberries, winter squash, and pineapples.

===Plant sources===

[[Image:Rosa_rubiginosa_hips.jpg|right|thumb|Rose hips are a particularly rich source of vitamin C]]
Citrus fruits (lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit), tomatoes, and potatoes are good common sources of vitamin C. Other foods that are good sources of vitamin C include papaya, broccoli, brussels sprouts, black currants, strawberries, cauliflower, spinach, cantaloupe, and kiwifruit. Also, cranberries and red peppers are good sources of the vitamin.

The amount of vitamin C in foods of plant origin depends on:

* the precise variety of the plant,
* the soil condition
* the climate in which it grew,
* the length of time since it was picked,
* the storage conditions,
* the method of preparation. Cooking in particular is often said to destroy vitamin C - but see the section on Food preparation.

The following table is approximate and shows the relative abundance in different raw plant sources. The amount is given in mg per 100 grams of fruit:

===Animal sources===
[[Image:Goat.jpg|thumb|250px|Goats and most animals make their own vitamin C]]

It was only realised in the 1920s that some cuts of meat and fish are also a source of vitamin C for humans. The muscle and fat which make up the modern western diet are however poor sources. As with fruit and vegetables cooking destroys the vitamin C content.

The following table shows the relative abundance of vitamin C in various foods of animal origin, given in mg of vitamin C per 100 grams of food:

==Functions in the body==

* As a participant in hydroxylation, vitamin C is needed for the production of collagen in the connective tissue. These fibres are ubiquitous throughout the body; providing firm but flexible structure. Some tissues have a greater percentage of collagen, especially: skin, mucous membranes, teeth and  bones. 
* Vitamin C is required for synthesis of dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline in the nervous system or in the adrenal glands. 
* Vitamin C is also needed to synthesise carnitine, important in the transfer of energy to the cell mitochondria.
* It is a strong antioxidant.
* The tissues with greatest percentage of vitamin C &amp;mdash; over 100 times the level in blood plasma &amp;mdash; are the adrenal glands, pituitary, thymus, corpus luteum, and retina. 
* The brain, spleen, lung, testicle, lymph nodes, liver, thyroid, small intestinal mucous membrane|mucosa, leukocytes, pancreas, kidney and salivary glands usually have 10 to 50 times the concentration present in plasma.

No bodily organ stores ascorbate as a primary function, and so the body soon depletes itself of ascorbate if fresh supplies do not continue to arrive though the digestive system, eventually leading to death if unresolved.

Only a few animal species including humans (primates) and guinea pigs are unable to synthesize ascorbic acid (ASC).  There are several theories as to why this has been eliminated from the genetic code including the fact that dietary intake of ASC is often enough.  It has even been suggested that the loss of this gene might have conferred an advantage to primates since hydrogen peroxide is generated as a byproduct of the synthesis of ASC.

==Vitamin C deficiency==
Lack of ascorbic acid in the daily diet leads to a disease
called scurvy, a form of avitaminosis that is characterized by:
* loose teeth
* superficial bleeding
* fragility of blood vessels
* poor healing
* compromised immunity
* mild anaemia.

==Daily requirement==
There is a continuing debate within the scientific community over the optimum amount of vitamin C for humans.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Footnotes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;

A healthy person on a balanced western diet should be able to get all the vitamin C needed to prevent the symptoms of scurvy from their daily diet. However, a person who is just freed from a scorbutic condition with only a small amount of ascorbate (i.e. RDA quantities) is arguably a very unhealthy individual, and certainly not one in optimum health. People who smoke, those under stress and women in pregnancy have a slightly higher requirement.

The amount of vitamin C needed to avoid deficiency symptoms of scurvy has been set by variously national agencies as follows:

:40 mg per day UK Food Standards Agency

:60&amp;ndash;95 mg per day US Food and Nutrition Board  2001 revision.

Some researchers have calculated the amount needed for an adult human to achieve similar blood serum levels as Vitamin C synthesising mammals as follows:

:400 mg per day &amp;ndash; Linus Pauling Institute &amp;  US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Recommendation.

:3000 mg per day &amp;ndash; Vitamin C Foundation's recommendation.

:6000-12000 mg per day &amp;ndash; Thomas Levy, Colorado Integrative Medical Centre recommendation.

:6000-18000 mg per day &amp;ndash; Linus Pauling's daily recommendation

:from 3000 mg to 200,000 mg based on bowel tolerance levels (see Cathcart below)

High doses (thousands of mg) may result in diarrhoea, which is harmless if the dose is reduced immediately. Some researchers (Cathcart) claim the onset of diarrhoea to be an indication of where the body’s true vitamin C requirement lies. Both Cathcart and Cameron have demonstrated that very sick patients with cancer or influenza do not display any evidence of diarrhoea at all until ascorbate intake reaches levels as high as 200 grams (1/2 pound).

The small size of the ascorbic acid molecule means the kidneys cannot retain it in the body. Some other explanation is required to explain why very sick persons retain such huge quantities of vitamin C without any discharge.  Quite a low level in the blood serum will cause traces to be present in the urine. All vitamin C synthesising mammals have traces in the urine at all times.
The fact that animals like rats pass ascorbate into their urinary tract, after expending valuable energy manufacturing it, implies that there is a benefit to having vitamin C passing through, and this does not represent waste.

The RDA is based on blood plasma and white blood cell saturation data. In 2004, the validity of the pharmacokinetic research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that gave this data was challenged by Hickey and Roberts 4. According to these authors, the doses required to achieve blood, tissue and body &quot;saturation&quot; are much larger than previously believed. They allege that the Institute of Medicine (IoM) and the NIH have ignored an open letter from Drs Steve Hickey, Hilary Roberts, Ian Brighthope, Robert Cathcart, Abram Hoffer, Archie Kalokerinos, Tom Levy, Richard Passwater, Hugh Riordan, Andrew Saul and Patrick Holford, calling for revision of the RDA, and have refused to reconsider their low-dose recommendations. Hickey and Roberts have issued their open scientific challenge in the form of a book, which was submitted to the IoM and NIH prior to publication.

==Food preparation==
It is important to choose a suitable method of food preparation. When cooking vegetables, one should seek to minimize or not discard the water used in their preparation, e.g. by frying the food &amp;ndash; which unfortunately increases fat content, steam cooking or by making soup.

Recent observations suggest that the impact of temperature and cooking on vitamin C may have been overestimated: 
#Since it is water soluble, vitamin C will strongly leach into the cooking water while cooking most vegetables &amp;mdash; but this doesn't necessarily mean the vitamin is destroyed &amp;mdash; it's still there, but it's in the cooking water. (This may also suggest how the apparent misconception about the extent to which boiling temperatures destroy vitamin C might have been the result of flawed research: If the vitamin C content of vegetables (and not of the water) was measured subsequent to cooking them, then that content would have been much lower, though the vitamin has not actually been destroyed.)
#Not only the temperature, but also the exposure time is significant. Contrary to what was previously and is still commonly assumed, it can take much longer than two or three minutes to destroy vitamin C at boiling point. 

It also appears that cooking does not necessarily leach vitamin C in ''all'' vegetables at the same rate; it has been suggested that the vitamin is not destroyed when boiling broccoli.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Footnotes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;, this may however just be a result of vitamin C leaching into the cooking water at a slower rate from this vegetable.
Copper pots will destroy the vitamin.

Vitamin C enriched teas and infusions have increasingly appeared on supermarket shelves. Such products would be nonsense if boiling temperatures did indeed destroy vitamin C at the rate it had previously been suggested. It should be noted however that as of 2004 most academics not directly involved in vitamin C research still teach that boiling temperatures will destroy vitamin C ''very'' rapidly.

==Reported potential harmful effects==
Reports of harmful effects of vitamin C tend to receive great prominence in the world's media. Many such reports have never been published in peer reviewed journals, which casts some suspicion on their credibility.

*In April 1998 ''Nature'' reported alleged carcinogenic and teratogenic effects of excessive doses of vitamin C. The effects were noted in test tube experiments and on only two of the 20 markers of free radical damage to DNA. They have not been supported by further evidence from living organisms. Almost all mammals manufacture their own vitamin C in amounts equivalent to human doses of thousands of milligrams per day. 

*University of Southern California researchers in April 2000, reported a thickening of the arteries of the neck in persons taking high vitamin C doses. It was pointed out by vitamin C advocates that vitamin C's  collagen synthesising role would lead to thicker and stronger artery walls. This research did not measure the blood velocity, which after simple mathematics, gives a more precise estimate of cross sectional area of the blood vessel.   

*In June 2004, Duke University researchers reported an increased susceptibility to osteo-arthritis in guinea pigs fed a diet high in vitamin C.  However, a 2003 study at Umeå University in Sweden, found that &quot;the plasma levels of vitamin C, retinol and uric acid were inversely correlated to variables related to rheumatoid arthritis disease activity.&quot;

* &quot;Rebound scurvy&quot; is an often quoted theoretical, and never observed,  condition that occurs when the amount of daily intake of Vitamin C is rapidly reduced from a  very large amount to a relatively lower amount.  This is an exaggeration of the ''rebound effect'' that occurs because ascorbate-dependent enzyme reactions continue for 24-48 hours, and use up vitamin C in the blood that is not being replenished. The effect is to lower one's serum vitamin C blood concentration to less than normal for a short amount of time. During this period of time there is a slight risk of cold of flu infection through reduced resistance. Within a couple of days the enzyme reactions shut down and blood serum returns to the normal level of someone not taking high supplements. This is not scurvy, which takes weeks of zero vitamin c consumption to produce symptoms. It is something people who take large vitamin C supplements need to be aware of in order to manage phased rather than sudden changes to the amount taken.

* Kidney stones are a much cited harmful side effect of taking vitamin C in larger than normal amounts. However research has shown this not to be the case &lt;sup&gt;[[#Footnotes|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Therapeutic uses==
Vitamin C is needed in the diet to prevent scurvy. It also has a reputation for being useful in the treatment of colds and flu. The evidence to support this idea, however, is ambiguous, unless the studies are divided by dose size and dosing regime. When that is done, it is remarkable that most of the studies showing little or no effect employ quite small doses of ascorbate such as 100mg to 500mg per day. (&quot;small&quot; according to the vitamin C advocates) The Vitamin C foundation ([http://www.vitamincfoundation.org/surefire.htm 1]) recommends 8 grams of vitamin C every half hour in order to show an effect on the symptoms of a cold infection that is in progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The old family Bible under careful scrutiny yields some treasure, if only to emphasize that according to Mark 16, the road to Emmaus should have been toward Galilee (North country) and Bethany should have sufficient water (John 3:23), near to Nazareth. (Mark 1:10):
* three Bethabara(s) - ''southern site preferred by Origen, 3rd century A.D., as place of Jesus' baptism (John 1:28)''.
* two Bethany(s) - ''one beyond the Jordan which is dissected by the Kings Highway trade route through Damascus''.
* two Emmaus(s)
::''Josephus in Antiquities places Emmaus near to Tiberias, built by Herod the Tetrarch on Lake Gennesareth (Galilee) to honor Roman Emperor Tiberius. The attraction of the small village of Emmaus, named, the warm baths or springs, was its reputation (Josephus, Wars) as a place of healing. Vespasian made his camp there, before the seige of Gamala in 67 A.D.'' 
* one Wilderness - ''historically accurate, the desert (Heb. Arabah) of Isaiah 33:9 and SW of the Dead Sea.''
:: not exactly - a smaller Wilderness of John 11:54, opposite Ephraim, according to map, west of Jordan is devoid of settlement and possibly &quot;the wilderness.&quot;
* no Bethsaida west (as Mark 6:53 relates Gennesaret mentioned was west of Sea and north of Magdala) on Sea of Galilee adjacent to Capernaum - ''only Bethsaida Julias east on map.'' Next stop on the mission (Mark 7) was Tyre, even further west. Except for the storm scene, the disciples crossed and recrossed the Lake with ease, the mark of true fishermen, who became fishers of men.
'''Highlights''' &amp;#8722; The Holy Land, Jesus, and Beyond
:* A Savior is Born: Bethelehem
:* Hometown: Nazareth
:* Ministry: from Sidon to the Decapolis
:* Last Known Dwelling: Capernaum

== Page Simplification? ==
Maybe the job of fixing the broken links could be simplified by cutting out the parts of the article that don't relate directly to cooking, that's what I assume your aim is Polyparadigm. That would shorten the article, hence making it easier to edit.

== Overview ==

When programming in Cocoa there are two core [[w:framework|frameworks]] that the developer can use:
* Foundation Framework
* Application Framework

The Application Framework is more commonly referred to as the Application Kit or just AppKit. It provides developers with [[w:Application_programming_interface|APIs]] that simplify commonly performed programming tasks related primarily to the [[w:Graphical_user_interface|GUI]] and the elements that make up the GUI (e.g. menus, windows, icons, buttons, etc.).

== Using AppKit ==

To use AppKit the developer must use a programming or scripting language that is capable of interacting with the classes, functions and APIs that make up Appkit. The most obvious choice is [[w:Objective-C|Objective-C]] as this is the language in which Cocoa is written. Also natively supported is [[w:Applescript|AppleScript]]. Other [[w:C_programming_language|C]] based programming languages can also be used (with some constraints) while [[w:Python_programming_language|Python]], [[w:Ruby_programming_language|Ruby]] and [[w:Tcl|Tcl]] are three scripting languages that can be interfaced to Cocoa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Java ===
==== Invocation ====

In Java, there are four kinds of method invocation, namely ''invokestatic'', ''invokespecial'', ''invokevirtual'', ''invokeinterface''. As the names suggest, the first is used to invoke static method and the rest instance methods. Since a static method cannot be overridden, invokestatic is very simple; it is essentially the same as calling a function in C.

We now see the mechanism of invocation of instance methods. Consider the following piece of code.

&lt;pre&gt;
class A {
  public static int f () { return 1; }
  private int g_private () { return 2; }
  public final int g_final () { return 3; }
  public int g_non_final () { return 4; }

  public void test (A a) {
    a.f ();  // static; this is always 1.
    a.g_private ();  // special; this is always 2.
    a.g_final (); // special; this is always 3.
    a.g_non_final (); // virtual; this may be 4 or something else.
  }
}

class B extends A {
  public int g_non_final () { return 6; }
}

class C extends B {
  public int g_non_final () { return 7; }
  public int foo () { return A.this.g_non_final (); }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

invokestatic is invoked with the references to the class name and the method name and pops arguments from the stack. An expression &lt;code&gt;A.f (2)&lt;/code&gt; is complied to:

&lt;pre&gt;
iconst_2           // push a constant 2 onto the stack 
invokestatic A.f   // invoke a static method
// the return value is at the top of the stack.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In Java, a private method cannot be overridden. Thus, a method has to be called based on a class regardless of how an object is created. invokespecial allows this; the instruction is the same as invokestatic except that it also pops the object reference besides supplied arguments. Thus far, dynamic binding is not in use, and it is not necessary to have informaion about binding at runtime about private methods.

Specifically, &lt;code&gt;invokespecial&lt;/code&gt; can be used either (1) calling a private method or (2) a invoking a method of the super class (including the constructor for the super class, namely &lt;init&gt;). To call a super method other than &lt;init&gt;, one has to write like &lt;code&gt;super.f ()&lt;/code&gt; where f is the name of the super method.

In semantics &lt;code&gt;invokeinterface&lt;/code&gt; doesn't differ from &lt;code&gt;invokevirtual&lt;/code&gt;, but it can give the compiler a hit about the invocation.

==== Class methods ====
Class methods can be defined with a &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; qualifier. Private class methods may be in the same object, if they belong to the different classes. No two public class methods may be in the same object; in other words, class methods cannot be overridden. This also means &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; qualifier is semantically meaningless for class methods.

==== Fields ====
Each field is accessed based on a class. Consider the following.

 class A {
   public int i = 2;
 }
 
 class B extends A {
   public int i = 3;
 }

 B b = new B ();
 A a = b;
 b.i++;  // this would be 3 + 1 = 4
 a.i++;  // this would be 2 + 1 = 3

In other words, an access control modifier (none, public, private and protected) only affects if clients of the class can access a given field. This means that Java virtual machine may ignore the access flag, handling each field in the same manner.

'''Roasted Vegetable Pasta''' This is a tried and true favorite.  You can add whatever vegetables you prefer.  

==Ingredients==
*3 large leeks, white parts only, split in half lengthwise and cut to bites sized pieces 
*1 medium red onion, whacked into eighths 
*1 red bell pepper (sometimes use 2) cut into wide strips 
*olive oil
*2 fresh sprigs of thyme 
*Vegetable stock or water 
*4 large garlic cloves, chopped 
*1 1/2 cups (360ml) tomato sauce 
*1/2 cup (120ml) chopped fresh basil 
*1/4 cup (60ml) white wine 
*1 tablespoon (or less) of salt 
*3/4 pound (330g)dried penne pasta (doesn't have to be penne) 
*1/3 cup (80ml) grated Parmesan cheese 
*optional:  3 ounces (85g) mozzarella or goat cheese 

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. (220c) 
#Put leeks, onion, and red bell pepper in a shallow roasting pan, tossing them with a tablespoon of olive oil to coat them. Add thyme and roast until they are cooked and start to brown (about 30-45 minutes).  Hint: check early to make sure they're not burning, and add a little water or vegetable stock if the juices are evaporating. 
#While vegetables are roasting, sauté the garlic in a tablespoon of olive oil until it begins to colour.  Add the tomato sauce and simmer 1 minute.  Then turn off heat and add the basil.  Stir the roasted vegetables into the sauce.  Gorgeous! 
#Turn oven down to 375 F (190c).  Add wine to roasting pan and stir, scraping up bits of vegetables that are stuck to pan, and add these deglazed juices to the sauce. 
#Boil large pot of water and add the salt and pasta - undercook the pasta - should take only 6-8 minutes. 
#Drain pasta, add it to the sauce and vegetables.  Add the cheese and mix it all.  Grease a 2 to 2 1/2 quart casserole dish and pour it all in.  Top with the optional mozzarella or goat cheese if you like, then bake it all for another 15 minutes in the 375 F (190c) oven.

'''Tri-colored Autumn Rice Balls''' (San-Shoku Ohagi)

Ohagi is a simple a tea sweet, which was at one time served during the autumn equinox celebration.  The name comes from a type of bush clover that only blooms in the fall.  Serve these rice balls with your finest cup of tea.

==Ingredients==
* 3 cups prepared [[Cookbook:Steamed Sweet Rice|steamed sweet rice]]
* 1/4 cup toasted black sesame seeds, lightly crushed
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 cup smooth Japanese bean paste (koshi-an), chilled
* 1/2 cup roasted soybean powder (kinako) or toasted ground pecans.  

==Procedure==
# Mix sesame seeds and sugar in a small bowl. 
# Moisten your hands with water and divide warm rice into 12 equal portions. 
# Shape 4 portions into balls.  Moisten a clean dish towel and squeeze dry. 
# Place 2 1/2 tablespoons bean paste on towel; pat into 4 inch circle.
# Place 1 rice ball in centre of bean paste circle and use towel to mould bean paste around the rice ball. 
# Repeat this 3 more times, using another 1/2 cup of bean paste and the other 3 rice balls.
# Place these on a nice serving tray.  Flatten the remaining eight rice portions. 
# Form the remaining bean paste into 8 balls (about 2 teaspoons per ball).  Place a bean paste ball in the centre of each piece of flattened rice and shape the rice around it. 
# Mould these stuffed rice balls into oval shapes.  Roll 4 ovals in the sesame-sugar mixture.  Roll the other 4 balls in the roasted soybean powder.  Add these to the serving tray. 

Makes six servings of 2 rice balls each.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, my question remains: Is an egg a dairy product??  Not is it CONSIDERED one, is it one??
:: Depends on how you look at it. Dairy primarily refers to milk and other milk products like cheese. However, &quot;dairy&quot; also refers to products produced on a dairy farm, which traditionally would probably include eggs. Thus the confusion. Eggs are therefore not &quot;dairy&quot; but they could be a &quot;dairy product&quot; (with different meanings of &quot;dairy&quot; in each).  [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 06:36, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Sociologists develop theories to explain social phenomena.  A ''theory'' is a proposed relationship between two or more ''concepts''.  In other words, a theory is explanation for why or how a phenomenon occurs.  An example of a sociological theory is the work of Robert Putnam on the decline of [[w:civic engagement|civic engagement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D. 2001. Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community. 1st ed. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;  Putnam found that Americans involvement in civic life (e.g., community organizations, clubs, voting, religious participation, etc.) has declined over the last 40 to 60 years.  While there are a number of factors that contribute to this decline (Putnam's theory is quite complex), one of the prominent factors is the increased consumption of television as a form entertainment.  Putnam's theory proposes:

:The more television people watch, the lower their involvement in civic life will be.

This element of Putnam's theory clearly illustrates the basic purpose of sociological theory: it proposes a relationship between two or more concepts.  In this case, the concepts are ''civic engagement'' and ''television watching.''  The relationship is an ''inverse'' one - as one goes up, the other goes down.  What's more, it is an explanation of one phenomenon with another: part of the reason why civic engagement has declined over the last several decades is because people are watching more television.  In short, Putnam's theory clearly encapsulates the key ideas of a sociological theory.

Sociological theory is developed at multiple levels, ranging from ''grand theory'' to highly contextualized and specific ''micro-range theories''.  There are many ''middle-range'' and ''micro-range'' theories in sociology.  Because such theories are dependent on context and specific to certain situations, it is beyond the scope of this text to explore each of those theories.  The purpose of this chapter is to introduce some of the more well-known and most commonly used grand and middle-range theories in sociology.  

===Importance of Theory===
In the theory proposed above, the astute reader will notice that the theory includes two components:  The data, in this case the findings that civic engagement has declined and TV watching has increased, and the proposed relationship, that the increase in television viewing has contributed to the decline in civic engagement.  Data alone are not particularly informative.  If Putnam had not proposed a relationship between the two elements of social life, we may not have realized that television viewing does, in fact, reduce people's desire to and time for participating in civic life.  In order to understand the social world around us, it is necessary to employ theory to draw the connections between seemingly disparate concepts. 

Another example of sociological theorizing illustrates this point.  In his now classic work, ''Suicide'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1997&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1997. Suicide. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Emile Durkheim was interested in explaining a social phenomenon, [[w:suicide|suicide]], and employed both data and theory to offer an explanation.  By aggregating data for large groups of people in Europe, Durkheim was able to discern patterns in suicide rates and connect those patterns with another concept (or variable): [[w:religious affiliation|religious affiliation]].  Durkheim found that [[w:Protestants|Protestants]] were more likely to commit suicide than were [[w:Catholics|Catholics]].  At this point, Durkheim's analysis was still in the data stage; he had not proposed an explanation for the different suicide rates of the two groups.  It was when Durkheim introduced the ideas of ''[[w:anomie|anomie]]'' and ''[[w:social solidarity|social solidarity]]'' that he began to explain the difference in suicide rates.  Durkheim argued that the looser social ties found in Protestant religions lead to weaker social cohesion and reduced social solidarity.  The higher suicide rates were the result of weakening social bonds among Protestants.  

While Durkheim's findings have since been criticized, his study is a classic example of the use of theory to explain the relationship between two concepts.  Durkheim's work also illustrates the importance of theory: without theories to explain the relationship between concepts, we would not be able to hypothesize cause and effect relationships in social life or outline processes whereby social events and patterns occur.  And to propose cause and effect relationships and / or outline processes in social experience are the major components of sociological theory.

===Prominent Sociological Theories===
As noted above, there are many theories in sociology.  However, there are several broad theoretical perspectives that are prominent in the field (they are arguably [[w:paradigms|paradigms]]).  These theories are prominent because they are quite good at explaining social life.  They are not without their problems, but these theories remain widely used and cited precisely because they have withstood a great deal of criticism.

As the dominant theories in sociology are discussed below, you might be inclined to ask, &quot;Which of these theories is ''the best''?&quot;  As is often the case in sociology (as in other scientific disciplines), just because things are different doesn't mean one is better than another.  In fact, it is probably more useful and informative to view these theories as ''complementary''.  One theory may explain one element of society better than another.  Or, both may be useful for explaining social life.  In short, all of the theories are correct in the sense that they offer compelling explanations for social phenomena.

==Structural-Functionalism==
'''Structural-Functionalism''' is a sociological theory that originally attempted to explain social institutions as collective means to meet individual biological needs (originally just ''[[w:Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]]'').  Later it came to focus on the ways social institutions meet social needs ([[w:Structural functionalism|structural-functionalism]]).  

Structural-functionalism draws its inspiration primarily from the ideas of [[w:Emile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1997b&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile, and Lewis A. Coser. 1997. The Division of Labor in Society. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim was concerned with the question of how societies maintain internal stability and survive over time. He sought to explain social cohesion and stability through the concept of [[w:social solidarity|solidarity]]. In more &quot;primitive&quot; societies it was [[w:mechanical solidarity|mechanical solidarity]], everyone performing similar tasks, that held society together. Durkheim proposed that such societies tend to be segmentary, being composed of equivalent parts that are held together by shared values, common symbols, or systems of exchanges. In modern, complex societies members perform very different tasks, resulting in a strong interdependence between individuals. Based on the metaphor of an organism in which many parts function together to sustain the whole, Durkheim argued that modern complex societies are held together by [[w:organic solidarity|organic solidarity]] (think interdependent ''organs''). 

The central concern of structural-functionalism is a continuation of the Durkheimian task of explaining the apparent stability and internal cohesion of societies that are necessary to ensure their continued existence over time. Many functionalists argue that social institutions are functionally integrated to form a stable system and that a change in one institution will precipitate a change in other institutions.  Societies are seen as coherent, bounded and fundamentally relational constructs that function like organisms, with their various parts (social institutions) working together to maintain and reproduce them. The various parts of society are assumed to work in an unconscious, quasi-automatic fashion towards the maintenance of the overall social ''equilibrium''. All social and cultural phenomena are therefore seen as being ''functional'' in the sense of working together to achieve this state and are effectively deemed to have a ''life'' of their own. These components are then primarily analysed in terms of the function they play. In other words, to understand a component of society, one can ask the question, &quot;What is the function of this institution?&quot; A ''function'', in this sense, is the contribution made by a phenomenon to a larger system of which the phenomenon is a part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoult1969&quot;&gt;Hoult, Thomas Ford (1969). ''Dictionary of Modern Sociology''. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, one can ask of education, &quot;What is the function of education for society?&quot;  The answer is actually quite complex and requires a detailed analysis of the history of [[w:education|education]] (see, for instance, this article on the [[w:History of education|history of education]]), but one obvious answer is that education prepares individuals to enter the workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsden1996&quot;&gt;Marsden, George M. 1996. The Soul of the American University: From Protestant Establishment to Established Nonbelief. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2003&quot;&gt;Smith, Christian. 2003. The Secular Revolution: Power, Interests, and Conflict in the Secularization of American Public Life. 1st ed. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  By delineating the functions of elements of society, of the social structure, we can better understand social life.

Durkheim's strongly sociological perspective of society was continued by Radcliffe-Brown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radcliffe-Brown1965&quot;&gt;Radcliffe-Brown, A.R. 1965. Structure and Function in Primitive Society. illustrated edition. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[w:Auguste Comte|Auguste Comte]], Radcliffe-Brown believed that the social constituted a separate ''level'' of reality distinct from both the biological and the inorganic (here ''non-living''). Explanations of social phenomena therefore had to be constructed within this social level, with individuals merely being transient occupants of comparatively stable social roles. Thus, in structural-functionalist thought, individuals are not significant in and of themselves but only in terms of their [[w:social status|social status]]: their position in patterns of social relations. The social structure is therefore a network of statuses connected by associated roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Layton1997&quot;&gt;Layton, R. 1997. An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 37-38. ISBN 0521629829&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural-functionalism was the dominant perspective of sociology between World War II and the Vietnam War.

===Limitations===
Structural-functionalism has been criticized for being unable to account for social change because it focuses so intently on social order and equilibrium in society.  For instance, in the late 19th Century, higher education transitioned from a training center for clergy and the elite to a center for the conduct of science and the general education of the masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsden1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2003&quot;/&gt;  In other words, education did not always serve the function of preparing individuals for the labor force (with the exception of the ministry and the elite).  As structural-functionalism thinks about elements of social life in relation to their present function and not their past functions, structural-functionalism has a difficult time explaining why a function of some element of society might change or how such change occurs.  However, structural-functionalism could, in fact, offer an explanation in this case.  Also occurring in the 19th Century (though begun in the 18th) was the [[w:industrial revolution|industrial revolution]].  The industrial revolution, facilitated by capitalism, was increasingly demanding technological advances to increase profit.  Technological advances and advanced industry both required more educated workforces.  Thus, as one aspect of society changed - the economy and production - it required a comparable change in the educational system, bringing social life back into equilibrium.

Another philosophical problem with the structural-functional approach is the [[w:ontological|ontological]] argument that society does not have ''needs'' as a human being does; and even if society does have needs they need not be met.  The idea that society has ''needs'' like humans do is not a tenable position because society is only alive in the sense that it is made up of living individuals. Thus, society cannot have wants and/or needs like humans do.  What's more, just because a society has some element in it at the present that does not mean that it must necessarily have that element.  For instance, in the United Kingdom, religious service attendance has declined precipitously over the last 100 years. Today, less than 1 in 10 British attend religious service in a given week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce2002&quot;&gt;Bruce, Steve. 2002. God is Dead: Secularization in the West. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while one might argue that religion has certain functions in British society, it is becoming apparent that it is not necessary for British society to function.

Another criticism often leveled at structural-functionalist theory is that it supports the [[w:status quo|status quo]].  According to some opponents, structural-functionalism paints conflict and challenge to the status quo as harmful to society, and therefore tends to be the prominent view among [[w:Conservatism|conservative]] thinkers.

===Manifest and Latent Functions===
[[w:Robert K. Merton|Merton]] (1957) proposed a distinction between ''manifest'' and ''latent'' functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merton1957&quot;&gt;Merton, Robert (1957). ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', revised and enlarged. London: The Free Press of Glencoe.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Manifest'' functions are the intended functions of a phenomenon in a social system.  ''Latent'' functions are the unintended functions of a phenomenon in a social system.  An example of manifest and latent functions is education.  The manifest purpose of public education is to increase the knowledge and abilities of the citizenry to prepare them to contribute in the workforce.  A latent function of the public education system is the development of a hierarchy of ''the learned''.  The most learned are often also the most affluent.  Thus, while education's manifest function is to empower all individuals to contribute to the workforce and society, it also limits some people by creating boundaries of entry into occupations.

==Conflict Theory==
A prominent sociological theory that is often contrasted with structural-functionalism is '''conflict theory'''.  Conflict theory argues that society is not best understood as a complex system striving for equilibrium but rather as a competition.  Society is made up of individuals competing for limited resources (e.g., money, leisure, sexual partners, etc.).  Broader social structures and organizations (e.g., religions, government, etc.) reflect the competition for resources in their inherent [[w:inequality|inequalities]]; some people and organizations have more resources (i.e., power and influence) and use those resources to maintain their positions of power in society.  

Conflict theory was developed in part to illustrate the limitations of structural-functionalism. The structural-functionalist approach argued that society tends toward equilibrium, focusing on stability at the expense of social change. This is contrasted with the conflict approach, which argues that society is constantly in conflict over resources. One of the primary contributions conflict theory presents over the structural-functional approach is that it is ideally suited for explaining social change, a significant problem in the structural-functional approach.


The following are three primary assumptions of modern conflict theory:

*Competition over scarce resources is at the heart of all social relationships. Competition rather than consensus is characteristic of human relationships. 
*Inequalities in power and reward are built into all social structures. Individuals and groups that benefit from any particular structure strive to see it maintained. 
*Change occurs as a result of conflict between competing interests rather than through adaptation. Change is often abrupt and revolutionary rather than evolutionary. 

A heuristic device to help you think about society from a conflict perspective is to ask, &quot;Who benefits from this element of society?&quot; Using the same example as we did above, we can ask, &quot;Who benefits from the current higher educational system in the U.S.?&quot;  The answer, of course, is the wealthy.  Why?  Because higher education in the U.S. is not free.  Thus, the educational system often screens out poorer individuals not because they are unable to compete academically but because they cannot afford to pay for their education. Because the poor are unable to obtain higher education, this means they are also generally unable to get higher paying jobs which means they remain poor.  This can easily translate into a vicious cycle of poverty.  Thus, while the function of education is to educate the workforce, it also has built into it an element of conflict and inequality, favoring one group (the wealthy) over other groups (the poor).  Thinking about education this way helps illustrate why both structural-functionalist and conflict theories are helpful in understanding how society works.

Conflict theory was elaborated in the United Kingdom by [[w:Max Gluckman|Max Gluckman]] and [[w:John Rex|John Rex]], in the United States by [[w:Lewis A. Coser|Lewis A. Coser]] and [[w:Randall Collins|Randall Collins]], and in Germany by [[w:Ralf Dahrendorf|Ralf Dahrendorf]], all of whom were influenced by [[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]], [[w:Ludwig Gumplovicz|Ludwig Gumplovicz]], [[w:Vilfredo Pareto|Vilfredo Pareto]], [[w:Georg Simmel|Georg Simmel]], and other founders of European sociology.

===Limitations===
Not surprisingly, the primary limitation of the social-conflict perspective is that it overlooks the stability of societies. While societies are in a constant state of change, much of the change is minor. Many of the broader elements of societies remain remarkably stable over time, indicating the structural-functional perspective has a great deal of merit.

As noted above, sociological theory is often complementary. This is particularly true of structural-functionalism and social-conflict theories. Structural-functionalism focuses on equilibrium and solidarity; conflict-theory focuses on change and conflict. Keep in mind that neither is better than the other; when combined, the two approaches offer a broader and more comprehensive view of society.

==Symbolic Interactionism==
In contrast to the rather broad approach toward society of structural-functionalism and conflict theory, '''Symbolic Interactionism''' is a theoretical approach to understanding the relationship between humans and society. The basic notion of symbolic interactionism is that human action and interaction are understandable only through the exchange of meaningful communication or symbols.  In this approach, humans are portrayed as ''acting'' as opposed to being ''acted upon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herman1994&quot;&gt;Herman, Nancy J. and Reynolds, Larry T. 1994. Symbolic Interaction: An Introduction to Social Psychology. Altamira Press. ISBN 1882289226&lt;/ref&gt;

The main principles of symbolic interactionism are:&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumer1986&quot;&gt;Blumer, H. 1986. Symbolic Interactionism: Perspective and Method. University of California Press. ISBN 0520056760&lt;/ref&gt;
#human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings that things have for them
#these meanings arise from ongoing processes of social interaction and interpretation
#social action results from a &quot;joint action&quot;, or the fitting together of individual lines of action

This approach stands in contrast to the strict [[w:behaviorism|behaviorism]] of psychological theories prevalent at the time it was first formulated (in the 1920s and 1930s).  According to Symbolic Interactionism, humans are distinct from infrahumans (lower animals) because infrahumans simply respond to their environment (i.e., a stimulus evokes a response or stimulus -&gt; response) whereas humans have the ability to interrupt that process (i.e., stimulus -&gt; cognition -&gt; response).  Additionally, infrahumans are unable to conceive of alternative responses to gestures. Humans, however, can.  This understanding should not be taken to indicate that humans never behave in a strict ''stimulus -&gt; response'' fashion, but rather that humans have the capability of not responding in that fashion (and do so much of the time).

[[File:The looking glass self.png|thumb|right|250px|This drawing illustrates the idea of the &quot;looking-glass self&quot; by illustrating that we can internalize how other people view us and then reflect upon those external appraisals without having to actually converse with others.]]

This perspective is also rooted in phenomenological thought (see [[w:social constructionism|social constructionism]] and [[w:phenomenology|phenomenology]]).  According to symbolic interactionism, the objective world has no reality for humans, only subjectively-defined objects have meaning. Meanings are not entities that are bestowed on humans and learned by habituation. Instead, meanings can be altered through the creative capabilities of humans, and individuals may influence the many meanings that form their society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herman1994&quot;/&gt;  Human society, therefore, is a social product.

Neurological evidence based on [[w:EEG|EEG]]s supports the idea that humans have a &quot;social brain,&quot; that is, there are components of the human brain that govern social interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabbagh2009&quot;&gt;Sabbagh, Mark A., Lindsay C. Bowman, Lyndsay E. Evraire, and Jennie M. B. Ito. 2009. “Neurodevelopmental Correlates of Theory of Mind in Preschool Children.” Child Development 80:1147-1162.&lt;/ref&gt;  These parts of the brain begin developing in early childhood (the preschool years) and aid humans in understanding how other people think.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabbagh2009&quot;/&gt;  In symbolic interactionism, this is known as &quot;[[w:reflected appraisal|reflected appraisals]]&quot; or &quot;[[w:looking glass self|the looking glass self]]&quot; and refers to our ability to think about how other people will think about us.  A good example of this is when people try on clothes before going out with friends. Some people may not think much about how others will think about their clothing choices, but others can spend quite a bit of time considering what they are going to wear. And while they are deciding, the dialogue that is taking place inside their mind is usually a dialogue between their &quot;self&quot; (that portion of their identity that calls itself &quot;I&quot;) and that person's internalized understanding of their friends and society (a &quot;[[w:generalized other|generalized other]]&quot; called the &quot;me&quot;). An indicator of mature socialization is when an individual quite accurately predicts how other people think about him/her.  Such an individual has incorporated the &quot;social&quot; into the &quot;self&quot; and will thus experience the world through an ongoing internal communication process that seeks to determine &quot;if I do this, what will be thought of me.&quot;    

It should also be noted that symbolic interactionists advocate a particular methodology.  Because they see ''meaning'' as the fundamental component of human and society interaction, studying human and society interaction requires ''getting at'' that meaning.  Thus, symbolic interaction tends to take two distinct, but related methodological paths.  Processual Symbolic Interaction seeks to uncover the elaboration and experience of meanings in natural settings of social interaction through primarily [[w:qualitative|qualitative]] methods (e.g., examining the process whereby people become and signify selves) while Structural Symbolic Interaction seeks to map the contours of the self through primarily [[w:quantitative|quantitative]] methods (e.g., examining the structure of the self by asking who people believe themselves and others to be).  

Symbolic Interaction arose through the integration of Structural Functionalism and Conflict Theories.  Specifically, Symbolic Interaction seeks to uncover the ways &quot;meanings&quot; are deployed within interactions and embedded within larger social structures to facilitate social cohesion (Structural Functionalism) and social change (Conflict Theories).  To use the case above, Symbolic Interaction may be used to explain the distinction between Conflict and Structural Functionalist approaches to education.  If people act toward education based on the meaning they have for it, for example, then people that believe (or are taught to believe) that education serves an important function for all of society (e.g., Structural Functionalism) will be hesitant to change this social structure.  On the other hand, if people believe (or are taught to believe) that education transmits social inequalities from generation to generation (e.g., Conflict Theory), then they will be more likely to attempt to change this structure over time.  In either case, societies (and the people that form them) will move towards cohesion (Structural Functionalism) or conflict (Conflict Theory) concerning educational structures based upon the meanings these people have for the current educational structure.  Symbolic Interaction thus often focuses on elaborating the multitude of ways that micro patterns of interaction and interpretation justify, sustain, and / or change large scale social structures and patterns of activity within the world.  

Central to Symbolic Interaction is the notion that selves and societies exist in an ongoing reciprocal relationship wherein each acts back upon the other.  Stated another way, Symbolic Interactionism argues that people become selves by learning and internalizing the symbolic materials of the social and historical context and culture they are born into and raised within (e.g., the individual is formed by the society), and then act back upon and alter societies (e.g., norms, cultures and structures) by deploying the symbolic resources at their disposal throughout the course of their ongoing lives (e.g., the society is formed by the joint action of individuals).  As a result, Symbolic Interactionists argue against the division of society into micro, meso, and macro forms, and instead focus on the ways that interconnected people continuously construct, alter, signify, and affirm themselves and others in ways that create, sustain, and change existing social structures.  They thus argue that society is always an ongoing information exchange between individuals, groups, and social structures that each depend on the other for their meaning and by extension their existence and survival.  

===Limitations===
The most significant limitations of symbolic interactionism relate to its primary contribution:  it focuses on the ongoing construction and contestation of meanings in society (e.g., norms, rules, cultures, and interpersonal experiences), which can only be grasped via examination of small groups or individual beings.  As a result, Symbolic Interactionism typically focuses on &quot;how&quot; things are done (e.g., the ways people accomplish things that can be observed in real time and in the natural world) rather than &quot;why&quot; things are done (e.g., hypotheses that can only be examined within mathematical and / or experimental settings disconnected from the natural world).  As a result, Symbolic Interaction is more adequately suited to explaining how the world is, but is unable to demonstrate and document predictions about how the world might be under certain circumstances.

==Role Theory==
Another more micro-oriented approach to understanding social life that also incorporates the more structural elements of society is '''Role Theory'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebaugh1988&quot;&gt;Ebaugh, Helen Rose Fuchs. 1988. Becoming an Ex: The Process of Role Exit. 1st ed. University Of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Role theory emerged from the integration of Structural and Processual Symbolic Interactionist insights, and often draws heavily upon both of these theoretical traditions (see also [[w: dramaturgy|dramaturgy]]).  Role theory posits that human behavior is guided by expectations held both by the individual and by other people.  The expectations correspond to different roles individuals ''perform'' or ''enact'' in their daily lives, such as secretary, father, or friend. For instance, most people hold pre-conceived notions of the role expectations of a secretary, which might include: answering phones, making and managing appointments, filing paperwork, and typing memos.  These role expectations would not be expected of a professional soccer player.

Individuals generally have and manage many roles. Roles consist of a set of rules or norms that function as plans or blueprints to guide behavior. Roles specify what goals should be pursued, what tasks must be accomplished, and what performances are required in a given scenario or situation. Role theory holds that a substantial proportion of observable, day-to-day social behavior is simply persons carrying out their roles, much as actors carry out their roles on the stage or ballplayers theirs on the field.  Role theory is, in fact, predictive.  It implies that if we have information about the role expectations for a specified status (e.g., sister, fireman, prostitute), a significant portion of the behavior of the persons occupying that position can be predicted.

What's more, role theory also argues that in order to change behavior it is necessary to change roles; roles correspond to behaviors and vice versa.  In addition to heavily influencing behavior, roles influence beliefs and attitudes; individuals will change their beliefs and attitudes to correspond with their roles.  For instance, someone over-looked for a promotion to a managerial position in a company may change their beliefs about the benefits of management by convincing him/herself that they didn't want the additional responsibility that would have accompanied the position.

Many role theorists see ''Role Theory'' as one of the most compelling theories bridging individual behavior and social structure.  Roles, which are in part dictated by social structure and in part by social interactions, guide the behavior of the individual.  The individual, in turn, influences the norms, expectations, and behaviors associated with roles.  The understanding is reciprocal.

Role Theory includes the following propositions:
# people spend much of their lives participating as members of groups and organizations
# within these groups, people occupy distinct positions
# each of these positions entails a role, which is a set of functions performed by the person for the group
# groups often formalize role expectations as norms or even codified rules, which include what rewards will result when roles are successfully performed and what punishments will result when roles are not successfully performed
# individuals usually carry out their roles and perform in accordance with prevailing norms; in other words, role theory assumes that people are primarily conformists who try to live up to the norms that accompany their roles
# group members check each individual's performance to determine whether it conforms with the norms; the anticipation that others will apply sanctions ensures role performance

===Limitations===
Role theory has a hard time explaining social deviance when it does not correspond to a pre-specified role.  For instance, the behavior of someone who adopts the role of bank robber can be predicted - she will rob banks.  But if a bank teller simply begins handing out cash to random people, role theory would be unable to explain why (though ''role conflict'' could be one possible answer; the secretary may also be a Marxist-Communist who believes the means of production should belong to the masses and not the bourgeoisie).

Another limitation of role theory is that it does not and cannot explain how role expectations came to be what they are. Role theory has no explanation for why it is expected of male soldiers to cut their hair short, but it could predict with a high degree of accuracy that if someone is a male soldier they will have short hair.  Additionally, role theory does not explain when and how role expectations change.  As a result, role theorists typically draw upon insights from Symbolic Interaction Theory and Historical Comparative analyses to address these questions.  

===Impression Management===
An extension of ''role theory'', '''impression management''' is both a theory and process.  The theory argues that people are constantly engaged in controlling how others perceive them.  The process refers to the goal-directed conscious or unconscious effort to influence the perceptions of other people by regulating and controlling information in social interaction. If a person tries to influence the perception of her or his own image, this activity is called ''self-presentation''. 

Erving Goffman (1959), the person most often credited with formally developing impression management theory, cast the idea in a dramaturgical framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1959&quot;&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1959. The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.  Anchor Books. ISBN 0385094027&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1961&quot;&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1961. Encounters: Two Studies in the Sociology of Interaction. MacMillan Publishing Co. ISBN 0023445602&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that individuals in face-to-face situations are like actors on a stage performing roles (see role theory above).  Aware of how they are being perceived by their audience, actors manage their behavior so as to create specific impressions in the minds of the audience.  Strategic interpersonal behavior to shape or influence impressions formed by an audience is not a new idea. [[w:Plato|Plato]] spoke of the &quot;great stage of human life&quot; and [[w:Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] noted that &quot;All the world is a stage, and all the men and women merely players&quot;.

==Social Constructionism==
'''Social constructionism''' is a school of thought introduced into sociology by [[w:Peter L. Berger|Peter L. Berger]] and [[w:Thomas Luckmann|Thomas Luckmann]] with their 1966 book ''The Social Construction of Reality''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1967&quot;&gt;Berger, Peter L., and Thomas Luckmann. 1967. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge. First Thus. Anchor.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on Symbolic Interactionist insights about the ongoing production and affirmation of meaning, social constructionism aims to discover the ways that individuals and groups create their perceived reality.  Social constructionism focuses on the description of institutions and actions and not on analyzing cause and effect.  Socially constructed reality is seen as an on-going dynamic process; reality is re-produced by people acting on their interpretations of what they perceive to be the world external to them. Berger and Luckmann argue that social construction describes both subjective and objective reality - that is that no reality exists outside what is produced and reproduced in social interactions.

A clear example of social constructionist thought is, following [[w:Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Freud2009&quot;&gt;Freud, Sigmund. 2009. The Future of An Illusion. CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[w:Émile Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim2008&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 2008. The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. abridged edition. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; religion. Religion is seen as a socially constructed concept, the basis for which is rooted in either our psyche (Freud) or man's need to see some purpose in life or worship a higher presence.  One of the key theorists of social constructionism, Peter Berger, explored this concept extensively in his book, ''The Sacred Canopy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1990&quot;&gt;Berger, Peter L. 1990. The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion. Anchor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social constructionism is often seen as a source of the [[w:postmodernism|postmodern]] movement, and has been influential in the field of [[w:cultural studies|cultural studies]].

==Feminist Theory==
Although women were primarily ignored, barred, and/or disenfranchised within most scientific communities prior to the women's rights movement of the 1960's and 1970's (for a notable exception in Sociology, see [http://www.asanet.org/about/presidents/Dorothy_Thomas.cfm Dorothy Swaine Thomas]), women have contributed to scientific disciplines, methods, and theories since at least the 1830's.  Following the establishment of women's academic conferences and coordinated protests of the American Sociological Association's annual meetings during the 1970's, women made significant inroads into Sociology. For example, women such as [[w: Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy E. Smith]], [[w: Joan Acker|Joan Acker]], [[w: Myra Marx Ferree|Myra Marx Ferree]], [http://www.asanet.org/about/awards/bernard/martin.cfm Patricia Yancey Martin], and [[w: bell hooks|bell hooks]] were all pioneers in Sociology who developed insights and empirical findings that challenged much of existing sociological practice, knowledge, and methods.  These early scholars also founded women's academic organizations like [[w: Sociologists for Women in Society|Sociologists for Women in Society]] to lobby for the admittance and inclusion of minority people and perspectives within scientific disciplines.  The theoretical perspectives these and subsequent scholars developed is broadly referred to as '''Feminist Theory'''. The name derives from the ties many of these individuals had and continue to have with women's movement organizations, the promotion of minority perspectives, their experience in relation to the subjective nature of scientific practice, and commitment to principles of social justice.  Feminist Theory uncovered a vast &quot;herstory&quot; of women's (and other minority) academic thinking, writing, and activism, and integrated insights from these essays and studies into the scientific enterprise.  In so doing, these scholars uncovered many ways that Feminist theorists from as far back as the 1830's had already introduced insights - such as [[w: The Social Construction of Reality|Social Constructionism]], [[w: Intersectionality|Intersectionality]], and the subjective nature and critical possibilities of scientific work - that have become crucial to scientific research and theorizing across disciplines.  

Further, historical research into the history of Feminist Thought has uncovered a litany of social theorists - including but not limited to early abolitionists and women's rights proponents like Maria W. Stewart, [[w: Elisbabeth Cady Stanton|Elisbabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[w: Susan B. Anthony|Susan B. Anthony]]; the first woman pastor of the African Methodist Episcopal Church [[w: Jarena Lee|Jarena Lee]]; early abolitionist writers and activists like [[w: Anna J. Cooper|Anna J. Cooper]], [[w: Harriet Tubman|Harriet Tubman]], and one of the first African American women to earn a college degree, [[w: Mary Church Terrell|Mary Church Terrell]]; early black feminist writers promoting gender and sexual equality like [[w: Zora Neale Hurston|Zora Neale Hurston]], [[w: Langston Hughes|Langston Hughes]], and [[w: Richard Bruce Nugent|Richard Bruce Nugent]]; early 20th Century writers and activists that sought racial civil rights, women's suffrage, and prison reform like [[w: Ida B. Wells|Ida B. Wells]], [[w: Alice Paul|Alice Paul]], [[w: Amy Jacques Garvey|Amy Jacques Garvey]], and [[w: Lucy Burns|Lucy Burns]]; and mid 20th Century writers and activists that challenged unequal labor practices, racial discrimination, women's oppression, and homophobia like [[w: Bayard Rustin|Bayard Rustin]], [[w: Betty Friedan|Betty Friedan]], [[w: Alice Walker|Alice Walker]], [[w: Angela Davis|Angela Davis]], [[w: Gloria Steinem|Gloria Steinem]], and [[w: Robin Morgan|Robin Morgan]].  Many of these individiauls were disenfranchised, ignored, and/or silenced by the scientific communities of their time due to [[w: racism|racism]], [[w: sexism|sexism]], and [[w: heterosexism|heterosexism]].  Feminist scholars across disciplines have continuously sought to expand scientific &quot;facts&quot; beyond their initial (and often continuing) white, male, heterosexual biases and assumptions while seeking knowledge as an entryway into a more just social world.  

Similar to the other theories outlined in this chapter, Feminist Theory is far more expansive than can adequately be explored within one textbook, let alone within a single chapter in a textbook.  Feminist theorists and methods, for example, can be found in wide ranging fields beyond sociology including biology, genetics, chemistry, literature, history, political science, fine arts, religious studies, psychology, anthropology, and public health.  Feminist Theory often dramatically influences scientific theory and practice within such fields.  Below we offer summaries of the major conceptual approaches within Feminist Theory.  It is important to note, however, that while we outline these perspectives under distinct headings and within specific orders for the purposes of clarity and introduction, contemporary Feminist theorists and researchers across disciplines often draw upon more than one of these perspectives in practice and continually seek ways to refine and integrate each of these approaches.  Before presenting this outline, however, it is important to be aware of three basic premises or foundational ideas within and between contemporary Feminist Theories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinman2007&quot;&gt;Kleinman, Sherryl.  2007.  Feminist Fieldwork Analysis.  Thousand Oaks, Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  

* ''Scientific practice is subjective'': If one admits that social experience and environment influence individual and collective perceptions, then one cannot form a question without expressing - implicitly or explicitly - a socially influenced perspective. As long as people are the &quot;doers&quot; of research, all research will ultimately be subjective and open to debate or refinement on some level.  Feminist theorists thus argue that understanding the social or natural world also requires interrogating our own conscious or unconscious bias, perspective, beliefs, and values, and our own positions within systems of racial, class, gender, sexual, political, and scientific social systems.

* ''The personal is political'': Experiences we consider personal are generally shaped by our social locations within existing systems of oppression and privilege. As a result, every personal decision or action ultimately reproduces and/or challenges systems of social inequality.  Feminist theorists therefore argue that understanding and/or changing large-scale systems of oppression and privilege requires examining the ways people think, feel, and act in all aspects of life since all such endeavors will ultimately influence the social and natural worlds they experience.  

* ''Everything is more than one thing'':  Rather than simple one to one relationships or isolated causal patterns, all social and natural systems are interlocked systems that may only be understood, reproduced or challenged in relation to the other systems they depend on.  If one examines women's oppression, for example, one must also explore the ways of thinking and feeling that produce scientific categorization systems, the system of categorization that simplifies the world into only two sexes or genders, the social construction of the term &quot;woman&quot; within historical and contextual power relations, and the other systems that make up a given &quot;woman&quot;.  For example, in order to understand the experience of one woman requires examining the ways her position within racial, classed, sexual, religious, political, scientific, and other systems create the definition of what it means for her to be a &quot;woman&quot;.  Feminist theorists therefore argue that the social and natural worlds cannot be understood via the isolation or control of various parts of social and/or natural experience. As a result, scientific inquiries require attending to the whole entity, system, and/or structure in relation to other entities, systems, and/or structures in the world at that time.  

With these foundational ideas in mind, we now present the primary Feminist theoretical perspectives.  

===Liberal Feminism===
Liberal feminists believe that men and women both are disadvantaged by society’s gender expectations.  They advocate working within institutions to “level the playing field” through changing laws, education, and socialization to bring about gender equality.
 
===Marxist and Socialist Feminism===
Marxist feminists believe that the oppression of women stems primarily from capitalism, which exploits women’s labor and is upheld through women’s unpaid domestic labor.  They believe that economic inequalities are the most central form of inequality.  Therefore, eliminating capitalism would get rid of gender inequalities.

Socialist feminists believe that women’s oppression is inseparable from class oppression.  Therefore, to bring about gender equality, we must work to eliminate both capitalism and patriarchy in all social and natural fields of knowledge and experience.

===Radical, Separatist, and Cultural Feminism===
Radical feminists believe that women are oppressed by our patriarchal society.  They do not believe that men are oppressed.  They seek a fundamental reorganization of society because our existing political, scientific, religious, and social organization is inherently patriarchal. 

Separatist feminists, like radical feminists, believe that women are oppressed by our patriarchal society.  They, however, believe that we can’t get rid of this problem if women and men are together.   In order to achieve equality, women need to separate themselves from men.  Some believe this is a temporary stage while others see this as a permanent goal.

Cultural feminists, like radical feminists, believe that women are oppressed by our patriarchal society.  They, however, focus on empowering women through valuing, emphasizing, and encouraging the positive qualities traditionally associated with women, such as nurturing, caring, cooperation, relationships with others, childbirth, morality, peace, pureness, and women’s connection to nature and the earth.  

===Black Feminist Thought and Queer Feminism===
Black feminists believe that many inequalities are important in society today, not only gender.  In addition to gender inequalities, they focus on race, ethnicity, and class — and sometimes also add sexuality, nationality, age, disability, and others.  They believe that people experience gender differently depending on their location in socially constructed cultural, political, and biological structures of race, ethnicity and class.  Therefore, there is no universal female experience.  This perspective is sometimes referred to as multicultural feminism, multiracial feminism, or womanism. 

Queer feminists - sometimes referred to as Postmodern Feminists - believe that gender and sex (as well as other social locations and systems of social and natural organization and categorization) are multiple, constantly changing, and performed by individuals and groups within situated social, historical, scientific, and political contexts.  There are many (i.e., more than two) genders and sexes, and variations (biologically and socially) within other &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;normalized&quot; categorizations.  They focus on creating social change through challenging the existence and blurring the boundaries of these categories.  This perspective shares many ideas with [[w: Queer Theory|Queer Theory]].

==Integration Theory==
Recently, some sociologists have been taking a different approach to sociological theory by employing an integrationist approach - combining micro- and macro-level theories to provide a comprehensive understanding of human social behavior (while these studies rarely cite Symbolic Interaction Theory, most of their models are based heavily upon [[w: Herbert Blumer|Herbert Blumer]]'s initial elaboration of Symbolic Interaction in relation to social institutions&lt;ref&gt;Blumer, Herber.  1969.  Symbolic Interactionism:  Perspective and Method.  University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Randall.  2004.  Interaction Ritual Chains.  Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;).  Numerous models could be presented in this vein.  George Ritzer's&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2003&quot;&gt;Ritzer, George, and Douglas J. Goodman. 2003. Sociological Theory. 6th ed. McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages. P. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Integration Model is a good example.

Ritzer proposes four highly interdependent elements in his sociological model: a macro-objective component (e.g., society, law, bureaucracy), a micro-objective component (e.g., patterns of behavior and human interaction), a macro-subjective component (e.g., culture, norms, and values), and a micro-subjective component (e.g., perceptions, beliefs).  This model is of particular use in understanding society because it uses two axes: one ranging from objective (society) to subjective (culture and cultural interpretation); the other ranging from the macro-level (norms) to the micro-level (individual level beliefs). 

[[Image:Ritzers integration theory.svg|center|George Ritzer's macro/micro integration theory of social analysis.]]

The integration approach is particularly useful for explaining social phenomenon because it shows how the different components of social life work together to influence society and behavior.

If used for understanding a specific cultural phenomenon, like the displaying of abstract art in one's home,&lt;ref name=&quot;Halle1996&quot;&gt;Halle, David. 1996. Inside Culture: Art and Class in the American Home. University Of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the integration model depicts the different influences on the decision.  For instance, the model depicts that cultural norms can influence individual behavior.  The model also shows that individual level values, beliefs, and behaviors influence macro-level culture.  This is, in fact, part of what David Halle finds: while there are art consumption differences based on class, they are not predicted solely by class.  Displayers of abstract art tend not only to belong to the upper-class, but also are employed in art-production occupations.  This would indicate that there are multiple levels of influence involved in art tastes – both broad cultural norms and smaller level occupational norms in addition to personal preferences.

==XML Web Service Standards==
=== Given XML documents, schemas, and fragments determine whether their syntax and form are correct (according to W3C schema) and whether they conform to the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0a ===

[http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.0-2004-04-16.html Basic Profile Final Specification]

==== XML ====

A simple XML document 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;addresses&gt;
  &lt;address&gt; 
  &lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/addresses&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

''BP'' states that the encoding of XML document should be either utf-8 or utf-16

''BP''  R1010   A RECEIVER MUST accept messages that contain an XML Declaration.

'''CDATA Section'''

CDATA section is used to escape the interpretation of the text by XML parsers. XML Parsers treat certain characters as special characters, like &lt;, &gt;, &amp; ....

If you want parsers to treat this text as simple text, then we can use CDATA Sections.

Example:
&lt;
'''DTD'''

DTD is a document which defines the structure of an XML document class.

''BP''  R1008   A MESSAGE MUST NOT contain a Document Type Declaration.

'''Processing Instruction'''

''BP''  R1009   A MESSAGE MUST NOT contain Processing Instructions

==== Schema ====
It describes the format of the XML document.

=== Describe the use of XML schema in J2EE Web services. ===
XML schema is used to validate an XML document. Unlike DTDs it is a XML file so it is not required to learn a new language to define a rule. The schema defines a set of rules for a XML file. While we use JAXB we give the schema as input to the binding compiler. Then the binding compiler will generate the required interface to parse the XML document.

=== Describe the use of namespaces in an XML document. ===

== SOAP 1.1 Web Service Standards==

SOAP is a lightweight XML based protocol for exchanging information in a decentralized, distributed environment. 
It consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses.

SOAP 1.1 is supported by BP (Basic Profile) 1.0 and SOAP 1.2 will be supported in BP1.1

SOAP supports two types of communication styles.

=== List and describe the encoding types used in a SOAP message ===

SOAP messages can be encoded in four different types.
Encoding is the process in which the attributes convey information about how contents of a particular element are encoded. The encodings supported by SOAP are
* '''SOAP encoding''': The sender and the receiver may not share the same schema. Indeed there are chances where the sender and the receiver may be applications that do not deal with XML at all, in case of which the SOAP architecture will be laid waste. To over come this drawback, the SOAP specifications has its own schema and rules for converting application-level data into a form suitable for embedding into SOAP messages.'''This is known as SOAP encoding'''. http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap-encoding
* '''SOAP Literal''':Instead of encoding header or body content according to the SOAP Data Model, we simply encode according to the rules and constraints of our data model and schema. In essence, we can just slide our own XML documents into a SOAP message, providing we remember to specify the encodingStyle attribute (and of course ensuring that the intended recipients of the message can understand it). '''This style of SOAP encoding is known as literal style'''.Some applications already deal with  xml natively, that are currently xml based vocabularies. SOAP can take advantage of the pre-existing schema, to craft message exchange. This encourages coarser-grained model(You can send all the data in the xml file get the processing done at a single stretch and get the process done at the recipients end and expect the recipient to take some time and send back the complete answer) compared with RPC's fine-grained model(we send a bit of data and get a little bit back, and you make further calls until your business is completed). 

SOAP implementations like Apache SOAP 2.3/Axis support other encodings like Literal/XML and XMI.

'''There are two styles of communicating a SOAP message. 
1) Document
2) RPC
'''

* '''Document''': Document-style SOAP refers a way in which an application payload is hosted by the  SOAP body element. When we use a document style it mean we place the document directly as a child to the soap:body element
&lt;soap:body&gt;
 &lt;inv:invoice ...&gt;
  &lt;inv:orderNo....&gt;
 &lt;/inv:invoice&gt;
&lt;/soap:body&gt; 

* '''RPC''': RPC-style wraps the application content inside an element which can be used to indicate the name of a method to dispatch the content to.
&lt;soap:body&gt;
 &lt;m:purchase&gt;
  &lt;inv:invoice ...&gt;
   &lt;inv:orderNo....&gt;
  &lt;/inv:invoice&gt;
 &lt;/m:purchase&gt;
&lt;/soap:body&gt; 

Combining the communication styles and encodings we have majorly the following messaging modes.

* Document/Literal
* RPC/Literal
* Document/Encoded
* RPC/Encoded.

Only Document/Literal and RPC/Literal are supported in Basic Profile 1.0. According to WS-I standard Document/Literal is the only one standard which is approved.

=== Describe how SOAP message header blocks are used and processed ===

The SOAP header space is where much of the value in Web services resides, since it is here that aspects like security, transactions, routing, and so on are expressed. Every Web services standard has staked its claim on some part of the SOAP header territory, but in a mutually compatible way. The fact that SOAP headers are extensible enough to support such diverse standards is a major win, since it supports flexible protocol composition tailored to suit specific application domains.

A SOAP header has the local name Header associated with the http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap-envelope namespace. It may also contain any number of namespace qualified attributes and any number of child elements, known as header blocks. In the absence of any such header blocks, the Header element itself may be omitted from the Envelope.
 
'''[[Header Attributes]]'''

* '''Encoding Style''': If present, each header block must be namespace qualified (according to the rules set out in the SOAP schema), may specify how it has been encoded (i.e., which schema constrains it) through the encodingStyle attribute.The encodingStyle attribute is used to declare how the contents of a header block were created. Knowing this information allows a recipient of the header to decode the information it contains. SOAP allows many encoding schemes and provides one of its own as an optional part of the spec.

* '''Role''': It may specify its consumer through the role attribute. The role attribute contains a URI that identifies the role being played by the intended recipient of its header block. The SOAP node receiving the message containing the header block must check through the headers to see if any of the declared roles are applicable. If there are any matches, the header blocks must be processed or appropriate faults generated.

* '''MustUnderstand''': It may demand that it is understood by SOAP infrastructure that encounters its message through the mustUnderstand attribute.If the mustUnderstand attribute is set to true, it implies that any SOAP infrastructure that receives the message containing that header block must be able to process it correctly or issue an appropriate fault message. Those header blocks that contain the mustUnderstand=&quot;true&quot; attribute are known as mandatory header blocks since they must be processed by any nodes playing the matching roles. Header blocks missing their mustUnderstand attribute should still be examined by nodes that play the appropriate role. If a failure to act on a role occurs, it is not deemed to be critical and further processing may occur since by missing the mustUnderstand attribute they are not considered mandatory

The SOAP specification stipulates that it is illegal for the role and mustUnderstand attributes to appear anywhere other than in header block declarations.

=== Describe the function of each element contained in a SOAP message, the SOAP binding to HTTP, and how to represent faults that occur when processing a SOAP message. ===

==== Fault ====

The SOAP Fault is a reserved element predefined by the SOAP specification whose purpose is to provide an extensible mechanism for transporting structured and unstructured information about problems that have arisen during the processing of SOAP messages or subsequent application execution. Since the fault mechanism is predefined by the SOAP specification, SOAP toolkits are able to use this mechanism as a standard mechanism for distributed exception handling.

The SOAP Fault element belongs to the same namespace as the SOAP Envelope and contains two mandatory child elements: '''Code and Reason''', and three optional elements: '''Node, Role, and Detail'''.

'''Code:''' The first child element of the Fault is the Code element, which contains two subelements: a mandatory element called Value and an optional element called Subcode. The Value element can contain any of a small number of fault codes as qualified names (sometimes abbreviated to QName) from the http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap-envelope namespace.

'''FaultCode and Description'''

* '''VersionMismatch''': Occurs when SOAP infrastructure has detected mutually incompatible implementations based on different versions of the SOAP specification.       

* '''MustUnderstand''': Issued in the case where a SOAP node has received a header block has with its mustUnderstand attribute set to true, but does not have the capability to correctly process that header block - that is, does not understand the protocol with which that header block is associated.
 
* '''DataEncodingUnknown''': Arises when the content of either a header or body block is encoded                             according to a schema that the SOAP node reporting the fault does not understand.

* '''Sender''': Occurs when the sender propagated a malformed message, including messages with insufficient data to enable the recipient to process it. It is an indication that the message is not to be resent without change.

* '''Receiver''': Generated when the recipient of the SOAP message could not process the                             message content because of some application failure. Assuming the failure is transient, resending the message later may successfully invoke processing.

'''Subcode:''' Though it isn't used in this fault, the Subcode element also makes the SOAP fault mechanism extensible. Like the Code element, the Subcode element also contains a mandatory Value child element and an optional Subcode element, which may contain further nested Subcode elements. The Value element of any Subcode contains a qualified name that consists of a prefix and a local name

'''Reason''': The Reason element associated with a Code is used to provide a human readable explanation of the fault, which in example below tells us that &quot;The specified account does not exist at this branch&quot;. SOAP toolkits often use the contents of the Reason element when throwing exceptions or logging failures to make debugging easier. However, the Reason element is strictly meant for human consumption and it is considered bad practice to use its content for further processing. 

Ex: &lt;env:Reason lang=&quot;en-UK&quot;&gt;The specified account does exist at this branch&lt;/env:Reason&gt;

'''Node''': The optional Node element provides information on which node in the SOAP message's path caused the fault. The content of the Node element is simply the URI of the node where the problem arose.

'''Role''': The Node element is complemented by the also optional Role element that provides information pertaining to what the failing node was doing at the point at which it failed. The Role element carries a URI that identifies the operation (usually some Web services standard) and that the party resolving the fault can use to determine what part of the application went wrong. Thus, the combination of Node and Role provides valuable feedback on exactly what went wrong and where.

'''Details''': The SOAP Detail element, as recapped in example below, provides in-depth feedback on the fault if that fault was caused as a by-product of processing the SOAP Body.

Ex:
&lt;env:Detail&gt;
  &lt;err:myfaultdetails
    xmlns:err= &quot;http://bank.example.org/fault&quot;&gt;
    &lt;err:invalid-account-sortcode&gt;
      &lt;bank:sortcode&gt;
        10-11-12
      &lt;/bank:sortcode&gt;
      &lt;bank:account&gt;
        12345678
      &lt;/bank:account&gt;
    &lt;/err:invalid-account-sortcode &gt;
  &lt;/err:myfaultdetails&gt;
&lt;/env:Detail&gt;



Fault element defines four subelements. BP1.0 allows only the following four elements. But the SOAP 1.1 allows any subelements to fault provided the elements are qualified with namespace.

* faultcode &lt;br/&gt;This is a mandatory element in fault element.
* faultstring &lt;br/&gt;This is a mandatory element in fault element.
* faultactor &lt;br/&gt;This is an optional element in fault element.
* detail &lt;br/&gt;This is an optional element in fault element.Detail element is intended to notify the errors related to the Body content of the message. This element should not be used to notify the errors related to header elements. This element is intended to report any application specific error information.


SOAP 1.1 messages are delivered using HTTP Post and HTTP reply. As HTTP Get does not support payload, HTTP Post is used to transfer the messages (SOAP messages are included as payload to HTTP Post requests).

== Describing and Publishing (WSDL and UDDI) ==

=== Explain the use of WSDL in Web services, including a description of WSDL's basic elements, binding mechanisms and the basic WSDL operation types as limited by the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0a ===

WSDL stands for Web Services Description language. A Web Service client has to know how to call a Web Service, what parameters to send and what messaging mode to use. A Web Service can describe itself in WSDL and publish it so that the clients can understand how to call and use the Web Service.
With WSDL there are several other benefits like a SOAP Implementation vendor(Provider) can automate the process of creating stubs and interfaces required for the client to communicate with the Web Service.

Most J2EE Vendors provide a way to create the WSDL documents automatically by looking in the Web Service implementations.

With WSDL you can describe the Web Service.
* Describe the endpoint interface.
* Describe the operations supported by the endpoint and their signature.
* Address of the Web Service.
* Communication mechanism.

&lt;b&gt;WSDL Basic Elements:&lt;/b&gt;

* import
* types
* message
* portType
* operation
* binding
* service

=== Describe how W3C XML Schema is used as a typing mechanism in WSDL 1.1 ===
=== Describe the use of UDDI data structures. Consider the requirements imposed on UDDI by the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0a ===

&lt;li&gt;businessEntity
&lt;li&gt;businessService
&lt;li&gt;bindingTemplate
&lt;li&gt;tmodel
&lt;li&gt;publisherAssertion
&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;UDDI represents Web service instances as uddi:bindingTemplate elements. The uddi:bindingTemplate plays a role that is the rough analog of the wsdl:port, but provides options that are not expressible in WSDL. To keep the WSDL description of an instance and its UDDI description consistent, the Profile places the following constraints on how uddi:bindingTemplate elements may be constructed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WSDL's soapbind:address element requires the network address of the instance to be directly specified. In contrast, UDDI V2 provides two alternatives for specifying the network address of instances it represents. One, the uddi:accessPoint, mirrors the WSDL mechanism by directly specifying the address. The other, the uddi:hostingRedirector, provides a Web service-based indirection mechanism for resolving the address, and is inconsistent with the WSDL mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3100 REGDATA of type uddi:bindingTemplate representing a conformant INSTANCE MUST contain the uddi:accessPoint element. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UDDI represents Web service types as uddi:tModel elements. (See UDDI Data Structures section 8.1.1.) These may, but need not, point (using a URI) to the document that contains the actual description. Further, UDDI is agnostic with respect to the mechanisms used to describe Web service types. The Profile cannot be agnostic about this because interoperation is very much complicated if Web service types do not have descriptions or if the descriptions can take arbitrary forms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UDDI API Specification, appendix I.1.2.1.1 allows but does not require uddi:tModel elements that use WSDL to describe the Web service type they represent to state that they use WSDL as the description language. Not doing so leads to interoperability problems because it is then ambiguous what description language is being used.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the Profile places the following constraints on how uddi:tModel elements that describe Web service types may be constructed:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Profile chooses WSDL as the description language because it is by far the most widely used such language.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3002 REGDATA of type uddi:tModel representing a conformant Web service type MUST use WSDL as the description language.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To specify that conformant Web service types use WSDL, the Profile adopts the UDDI categorization for making this assertion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3003 REGDATA of type uddi:tModel representing a conformant Web service type MUST be categorized using the uddi:types taxonomy and a categorization of &quot;wsdlSpec&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the uddi:overviewURL in a uddi:tModel to resolve to a wsdl:binding, the Profile must adopt a convention for distinguishing among multiple wsdl:bindings in a WSDL document. The UDDI Best Practice for Using WSDL in a UDDI Registry specifies the most widely recognized such convention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3010 REGDATA of type uddi:tModel representing a conformant Web service type MUST follow V1.08 of the UDDI Best Practice for Using WSDL in a UDDI Registry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be inconsistent if the wsdl:binding that is referenced by the uddi:tModel does not conform to the Profile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3011 The wsdl:binding that is referenced by REGDATA of type uddi:tModel MUST itself conform to the Profile.
&lt;/p&gt;

== JAX-RPC ==

=== Explain the service description model, client connection types, interaction modes, transport mechanisms/protocols, and endpoint types as they relate to JAX-RPC ===

The following material is based on JAX-RPC 1.1 Spec.

JAX-RPC is Java API for XML based Remote Procedure Call mechanism. JAX-RPC supports any kind of protocol which is based on XML Infosets. JAX-RPC is independent of any communication protocol like SOAP(which is an XML based protocol using XML Infosets). JAX-RPC is also independent of any transport protocol like HTTP, SMTP.

But some aspects are more biased towards WebServices technologies like SOAP and WSDL. So may be that's the reason why the named the new version of JAX-RPC as JAX-WS(Java API for XML based WebServices). JAX-WS 2.0 is updated version of JAX-RPC 1.1.

URL for JAX-WS http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=224

'''Service description model'''

JAXR-RPC 1.1 specifies programming model for a service endpoint developed and deployed on a Servlet container based JAX-RPC runtime system.

'''Client connection types'''

There can be three types of client,
* Static Stub based client
* Proxy Client
* DII

'''Interaction modes'''

The following are the application interaction modes supported by JAX-RPC, the JAX-RPC providers may use any kind of low-level interaction modes to support the Application interaction modes.

* Synchronous Request Response Mode
[[Image:Jaxrpc_modes_req_res.jpg|center|Request-Response Mode]]

In this mode the service client makes a request and waits(the current thread executing the request) for the response from the server. The JAX-RPC APIs and service client programming model supports this mode through both the stub(or dynamic proxy) based model and DII Call interface.

* One-way RPC Mode
[[Image:Jaxrpc_modes_one_way.jpg|center|JAX-RPC One Way Application Interaction mode]]
In this mode the service client invokes a remote method and continues without waiting for the response from the service endpoint. The service client does not get any response(either return values or remote exceptions) from the Service endpoint. The JAX-RPC supports this one-way mode through DII Call interface.

* Non-blocking RPC Invocation
[[Image:Jaxrpc_modes_non_blocking.jpg|center|Jaxrpc_modes_non_blocking.jpg|JAX-RPC Non-blocking application interaction mode]]
In this mode the service client thread invokes a remote method and continues processing without waiting for response. It later processes the response by performing blocking receive. The JAX-RPC runtime does not need to support this mode.


'''Transport mechanisms/protocols'''
* Protocol will be SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
* Transport can be HTTP / JMS 

'''Endpoint types'''
There are two types of endpoints,
* Servlet Based Endpoints
* EJB based Endpoints (JAX-RPC spec does not specify. R08 p24)

=== Given a set of requirements for a Web service, such as transactional needs, and security requirements, design and develop Web service applications that use servlet-based endpoints and EJB based endpoints. ===
=== Given an set of requirements, design and develop a Web sevice client, such as a J2EE client and a stand-alone Java client, using the appropriate JAX-RPC client connection style. ===
=== Given a set of requirements, develop and configure a Web service client that accesses a stateful Web service. ===
=== Explain the advantages and disadvantages of a WSDL to Java vs. a Java to WSDL development approach. ===

'''WSDL to Java'''

'''Java to WSDL'''

* Advantages

* Disadvantages
** Java supports inheritance for Interfaces(Service Endpoint Interface) which can not be directly translated in to WSDL definitions(which does not have inheritance concept for portType definitions).

=== Describe the advantages and disadvantages of web service applications that use either synchronous/request response, one-way RPC, or non-blocking RPC invocation modes. ===
=== Use the JAX-RPC Handler API to create a SOAP message handler, describe the function of a handler chain, and describe the role of SAAJ when creating a message handler. ===


== SOAP and XML Processing APIs (JAXP, JAXB, and SAAJ) ==
=== Describe the functions and capabilities of the APIs included within JAXP ===

==== JAXP ====
JAXP, Java API for XML Processing leverages the XML Parsers SAX and DOM. It also provides the support for XSL transformations.

SAX is an event based parser model.
DOM builds an Object representation of XML.

JAXP API which is packaged in javax.xml.parsers provides implementation independent interfaces to use SAX, DOM and XSL Transformers.
It provides this by using Factory Design Pattern.

xml packages

*javax.xml.parsers - which provides an implmentation independent API for using SAX, DOM and XSL Transformers.
*org.w3c.dom - API using Document Object model for parsing XML.
*org.xml.sax - API for event based XML parsing model.
*javax.xml.transform - XSLT APIs which are used to transform XML documents in to different formats(XML, HTML..)


'''javax.xml.parsers'''
It provides the implementation independent classes for accessing the Parsers.

*javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory
*javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory
*javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory

You can define which concrete implementation to use by setting the System properties using System.setProperty or by setting them as JVM parameters using -DpropertyName=propertyValue. If we don't define the properties, it uses the Sun's implementation.

====SAX====

SAX parser is an event based serial parser, in the sense it reads the given XML document line-by-line (serially) and generates event when it comes across the XML elements.

SAX packages

*org.xml.sax
*org.xml.sax.ext
*org.xml.sax.helpers

SAX is based mainly on two interfaces, XMLReader and ContentHandler

XMLReader is the xml parser(which is a replacement for Parser of SAX1 model) which reads the XML document and calls the event callback methods of the ContentHandler. org.xml.sax.Parser is used in SAX1 model.

XMLReader has two new functionalities
*it adds a standard way to query and set features and properties
*it adds Namespace support

Instantiating a parser factory implementation using JAXP is done using

&lt;pre&gt;
  SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
  SAXParser parser = factory.newSAXParser();
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above instantiation is independent of the implementation.

For example, Xerces-J from Apache is an implementaion of SAX.

Using Xerces-J we can instantiate using
&lt;pre&gt;
  SAXParserFactory factory = new org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl();
  SAXParser parser = factory.newSAXParser();
&lt;/pre&gt;

But by using JAXP, we get independence from the vendor specific API.


'''Simple SOAP message parser'''

Lets look at a simple example of the whole story around using SAX..

The following presents a simple example parser(SAXTest.java) which reads a SOAP message (SOAPMessage.xml) and uses DefaultHanlder(SOAPMessageHandler.java). 

Simple SOAP Message(SOAPMessage.xml)

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;&gt;
	&lt;soap:Body&gt;
		&lt;getProductDetails xmlns=&quot;http://www.javaspirit.com/pr&quot;&gt;
			&lt;productID&gt;827635&lt;/productID&gt;
		&lt;/getProductDetails&gt;
	&lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sample code to read the SOAPMessage.xml using SAX model

&lt;pre&gt;
package com.javaspirit.tutorial.sax;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException;
import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser;
import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler;

public class SAXTest {
    
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(SAXTest.class);
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Gets the SAXParserFactory implementation
        // In this case we get org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl
        // We configure this using the JVM property 
        // -Djavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl

        SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
        
        if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) logger.debug(factory.getClass());
        
        SAXParser parser;
        
        try {
            
            // We get Xerces implementation of SAXParser which is org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl
            parser = factory.newSAXParser();
            
            if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) logger.debug(parser.getClass());
            
            DefaultHandler handler = new SOAPMessageHander();
            
            // Read the SOAPMessage.xml ( which contains a simple SOAP Message )
            InputStream in = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()
                    .getResourceAsStream(
                            &quot;com/javaspirit/tutorial/sax/SOAPMessage.xml&quot;);
            
            // Register the DefaultHandler with the parser/
            // The SAXParser will invoke the callback methods defined by the DefaultHandler
            parser.parse(in, handler);
            
        } catch (ParserConfigurationException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (SAXException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

A simple Handler which extends DefaultHandler, which prints a debug message when the callback method is invoked.

&lt;pre&gt;
package com.javaspirit.tutorial.sax;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.xml.sax.Attributes;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler;

public class SOAPMessageHander extends DefaultHandler{
    
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(SOAPMessageHander.class);
    
    /* (non-Javadoc)
     * @see org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startElement(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, org.xml.sax.Attributes)
     */
    public void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName,
            Attributes attributes) throws SAXException {
        logger.debug(&quot;in startElement() method&quot;);
        super.startElement(uri, localName, qName, attributes);
    }
    
    /* (non-Javadoc)
     * @see org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#endElement(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)
     */
    public void endElement(String uri, String localName, String qName)
            throws SAXException {
        logger.debug(&quot;in endElement() method&quot;);
        super.endElement(uri, localName, qName);
    }

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''SAXParser'''

SAXParser is a wrapper class for the org.xml.sax.XMLReader. As the content is parsed by the SAXParser implementation it invokes the callback methods of the HandlerBase or DefaultHandler.

SAXParser several overloaded methods for parsing

&lt;i&gt;Note: Some of the API documentation is taken directly from the Sun API Documentation.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
 void 	parse(File f, DefaultHandler dh)
          Parse the content of the file specified as XML using the specified DefaultHandler.
 void 	parse(File f, HandlerBase hb)
          Parse the content of the file specified as XML using the specified HandlerBase.
 void 	parse(InputSource is, DefaultHandler dh)
          Parse the content given InputSource as XML using the specified DefaultHandler.
 void 	parse(InputSource is, HandlerBase hb)
          Parse the content given InputSource as XML using the specified HandlerBase.
&lt;/pre&gt;

the parse methods have mainly two input parameters,
*source - source of the XML document, the possible sources are File, InputStream, String
*hanlder - HandlerBase or DefaultHandler ( or their subclasses)


Validation 
&lt;pre&gt;
abstract  boolean 	isValidating()
          Indicates whether or not this parser is configured to validate XML documents.
&lt;/pre&gt;


Namespace Awareness
&lt;pre&gt;
abstract  boolean 	isNamespaceAware()
          Indicates whether or not this parser is configured to understand namespaces.
&lt;/pre&gt;


Setting and Getting properties
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;


'''Handlers'''

As the SAXParser parses the document it will call the callback methods of the handler classes. The Handler class implementations must register with the SAXParser before receiving notifications.

There are four types of Handlers (interfaces)

'''org.xml.sax.ContentHandler'''

As the SAXParser parses the XML document it will call the methods of registered ContentHandler. ContentHanlder has callback methods for major events in parsing like startDocument(), endDocument(), startElement, endElement, processingInstruction, characters.


'''org.xml.sax.EntityResolver'''

This has only method

&lt;pre&gt;
InputSource 	resolveEntity(String publicId, String systemId) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Parser will call this method before opening any external entity except the top-level document entity.

'''org.xml.sax.DTDHandler'''


'''org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler'''

The SAXParser invokes the methods of ErroHandler implementation as it gets XML Processing errors, rather than throwing the exceptions itself.

it has the following methods.
&lt;pre&gt;
 void 	error(SAXParseException exception)
          Receive notification of a recoverable error.
 void 	fatalError(SAXParseException exception)
          Receive notification of a non-recoverable error.
 void 	warning(SAXParseException exception)
          Receive notification of a warning.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Given a scenario, select the proper mechanism for parsing and processing the information in an XML document ===
=== Describe the functions and capabilities of JAXB, including the JAXB process flow, such as XML-to-Java and Java-to-XML, and the binding and validation mechanisms provided by JAXB.===
=== Use the SAAJ APIs to create and manipulate a SOAP message ===

The following documentation is based on SAAJ 1.2

SAAJ - SOAP with attachments API for Java

SAAJ can be used to create, read, update and send SOAP messages. The API is standalone, in the sense that it can be used within and without the JAX-RPC context.

javax.xml.soap is the package which holds all the SAAJ API. 

MessageFactory is the main abstract class where we start creating the SOAPMessages. MessageFactory is implemented by the SAAJ vendors. For example, in Axis the MessageFactory is implemented by org.apache.axis.soap.MessageFactoryImpl

&lt;pre&gt;
public abstract class MessageFactory {
    public static MessageFactory newInstance() throws SOAPException {
        // Implementation
    }

    public abstract SOAPMessage createMessage() throws SOAPException;

    public abstract SOAPMessage createMessage(
        MimeHeaders mimeheaders, InputStream inputstream)
        throws IOException, SOAPException;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;


newInstance() creates a new instance of the MessageFactory.

createMessage() is used to create SOAPMessage object, usually used to create new SOAP request messages.

createMessage(MimeHeader mimeHeaders, InputStream in) creates a SAAJ SOAPMessage model (DOM) from an existing SOAP message.

As SAAJ supports Attachments with SOAP messages, a SAAJ SOAPMessage object contains one SOAPPart object and one or more AttachmentPart objects.

The following class diagram provides the overview of the major components.

== JAXR ==
=== Describe the function of JAXR in Web service architectural model, the two basic levels of business registry functionality supported by JAXR, and the function of the basic JAXR business objects and how they map to the UDDI data structures. ===

&lt;p&gt; JAXR is Java API for XML Registries. JAXR API to registries is similar to JDBC API for databases. JAXR API provides common interface to communicate with different registries instances (even different registry models).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAXR Provider is the vendor who provides the JAXR API Specification implementaion. There are several Registry models, out of which JAXR specifies to only UDDI and ebXML registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JAXR API is divided into two main packages (components), one javax.xml.registry contains API to provide Query and LifeCycleManagement API for registries and javax.xml.registry.infomodel provides business objects which are similar to the objects maintained by the registries. JAXR infomodel is the confluence of the object models from both ebXML and UDDI registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JAXR Specification does not mandate JAXR Providers to implement support for all API(or Registries). The Spec divided the API into Capability Levels. Capability Level 0 means support for UDDI registries and Capability Level 1 means support for ebXML registries. JAXR Spec requires the Provider to implement alteast Capability Level 0(support for UDDI).&lt;/p&gt;

=== Use JAXR to connect to a UDDI business registry, execute queries to locate services that meet specific requirements, and publish or update information about a business service. ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Hint and the solution, in my opinion, do not answer the question. The question is about average speed and not about average time it takes to travel around a circle.


100km at 100km/h = 1 hour

100km at 200km/h = 1/2 hour

100km at 300km/h = 1/3 hour


Suppose this is a Formula 1 race (the lenght and shape of the circuit are the same in both laps...not like the example given in the answer):
A racer completed the first lap with an average speed of 100km (say for example that the lap took him 3 minutes to complete); on the second lap he goes at 300km average(he will take 1 minute and not 3 again, to make the lap);
if we do a simple calculation of the average speed and/or time for the 2 lap race: 200km and 2 minutes. Note that only the time is depending on the lenght of the circuit. the average speed is the same even if you choose Sahara as the circuit.

The example given on the answer says that on the begining of the second lap we don't have any more time. Why? There is no time limit. only speed...

A point should be made that the words velocity and speed are NOT interchangable.  Velocity is defined as displacement/time and speed as distance/time.  In a straight the two will yield the same magnitude answer.  In this example the train travels in a circle and therefore the displacement of the train is actually zero.

:Perhaps a more mathematical answer is in order.

:If the distance is &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and the initial speed is &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;t_1 = \frac{d}{s_1}&lt;/math&gt; which leads to &lt;math&gt;t_1 * s_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, if the goal is to double the initial speed (the first of two constraints) on average, then

::&lt;math&gt;(s_1 + s_2)/2 = 2*s_1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;s_1 + s_2 = 4*s_1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;s_2 = 3*s_1&lt;/math&gt;

:This is the obvious answer: 300 km/h.  But, use the distance equation (the second of two constraints)

::&lt;math&gt;t_2 * s_2 = d&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;t_2 * s_2 = d&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;t_2 * 3 * s_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{s_1} * 3 * s_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;d * 3 = d&lt;/math&gt;

:which has no non-trivial solutions (i.e., &lt;math&gt;d=0&lt;/math&gt;).  If &lt;math&gt;d=0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;t_2=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is stated in the solution.

:But, for the fun of it, let's say you did the first 100 km lap at 100 km/h and did the second 100 km lap at 300 km/h (the &quot;obvious answer&quot;): how long would it take?

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{100 km}{100 km/h} = 1 hr&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{100 km}{300 km/h} = 1/3 hr&lt;/math&gt;

:So the total time is 1.3333 hours.  The average speed is then
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{200 km}{1.3333 hours} = 150 km/hr&lt;/math&gt;
:which is clearly contradictory. [[User:Cburnett|Cburnett]] 19:40, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Solution to the puzzle with example  ==

A train goes around a circle, the first time with an average velocity of 100 km/h. How fast should the train be when going around the circle again a second time, so that in total the average velocity for both loops is 200 km/h?

The obvious answer of 300 kms per hour is wrong . The writer is right . The train will have to go infinitely fast to be able to reach average speed of 200 kmph . I am illustrating the solution with an example below .



Lap 1  distance 100 kms avg speed 100 kmph time taken for first lap is 1 hour

Lap 2 distance 100 kms avg speed say 600 kmph Time taken for second lap is 10 minutes . 

Total distance travelled in two laps is 200 kms in one hour 10 minutes this the average speed is 200/1hr 10 minutes which is below 200 kmph . 

Double the speed in the second lap . See the picture now . 
Lap 1  distance 100 kms avg speed 100 kmph time taken for first lap is 1 hour

Lap 2 distance 100 kms avg speed say 1200 kmph Time taken for second lap is 5 minutes . 

Total distance travelled in two laps is 200 kms in one hour 5 minutes this the average speed is 200/1hr 5 minutes which is below 200 kmph . 

Thus if the first lap is travelled in one hour , no matter how much speed you pick up , you cannot reach the average speed of 200 kmph in the circuit .

Bend the fourth straw partially in half. Place it around the third straw so that its tip (in the middle of the straw) goes under the piece of paper in the shape of a V. Bend the fourth straw fully in half so it grips the third straw. Lift it up carefully, pulling up the first and second straws as well.



I think a better solution -- it doesn't involve modifying the fourth straw -- is this: 

Place the fourth straw through the pyramid under the third straw. This means that the fourth straw goes through both &quot;faces&quot; of the pyramid that adjoin the third straw, and does not go through the face formed by the first two straws.

Holding the fourth straw parallel to the surface of the table and parallel to the face formed by the first two straws, move the fourth straw toward the first two straws. This will push the first two straws away from the third straw.

The third straw will fall. If you have positioned the fourth straw correctly, the third straw will hit the fourth straw rather than falling to the table.

The fourth straw forms a triangle with the first two straws, and the end of the third straw (leaning against the fourth straw) is pointed toward this triangle. Move the fourth straw down a bit and toward the third straw. This will allow the first two straws to fall toward the third straw. The end of the third straw should now go up and through the first two straws.

Now if you lift straight up, the third straw will lock with the first two straws over the fourth straw. You can lift all the straws at once.

----
All but the last one can tell what colour hat he/she is wearing.

First, they agree on a way for the last person to count the number of hats in front of himself.  An excellent way is for him (we'll assume it's a guy) to count the number of red hats.  Then, he'll guess the colour of his hat based on that count:  He'll say &quot;red&quot; if it's odd or &quot;blue&quot; if it's even.

Then, as each person goes down the row, she (to be fair) looks at the hats in front of her.  She knows if there is an even number of red hats *including her own*, and can see how many red hats are in front of her.  If there are an even number in front of her, and there are an even number including her own, then hers must be blue!  When she answers with the colour of her hat, then the person in front of her will know whether to adjust the current count of red hats, and the puzzle can go on to completion.

Another way to look at the solution is counting in base 2, mod 2.  Red hats are 1s and Blue hats are 0s.  The last person in the row tells what the sum of everyone's hats in front of him is.  He announces &quot;Red&quot; (Total = 1) or &quot;Blue&quot; (Total = 0).  Then, the next person sums up the hats in front of her, and gets Total-In-Front-Of-Me.  She knows that Total - Total-In-Front-Of-Me (mod 2) = Color-Of-My-Hat, and can announce her hat colour.  The person in front of *her* can then figure out NewTotal = Total - Color-Of-Her-Hat (mod 2), and work out what colour his hat is, etc...

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is wikibook detailing generally accepted international latin dance technique. A resource for newcomers to the dance style and as a reference guide for the more experienced dancer who just needs to look up footwork, placement, shaping, timing or styling on a certain figure.

== Introduction ==

=== Choosing a dance school ===
There is two different styles of ballroom and latin dancing. Depending on which style you choose your progressing and variations that you learn will be different.

The major sub division to start with is American Style vs International style. So to differentiate this we generally talk about '''Latin American''' (International Style Latin) , '''Standard''' (International Style Ballroom), '''Rhythm''' (American Style Latin), '''Smooth''' (American Style Ballroom)

In the ballroom category Standard and Smooth borrow heavily from each other, the styling is the similar but Smooth allows for a wider range of variations because of slacker rules in terms of hold. When starting out the dances seem completely different but as you progress you will find that the different styles and dances borrow heavily from each other.  

Another major differentiation in Ballroom and Latin dancing is Social dancing vs Competitive dancing.

Dancing schools that present social dancing concentrate on variations. (Teaching you new steps). Moving to the beat and getting the basic step right is more important than having the step look beautiful. In general these schools will not work on routines but allow you to combine steps as you feel. Most of these schools concentrate on the entry level dancers and as such will skip on basic technique that will make the more advanced steps possible.

Competitive studios on the other hand concentrate on dancing competitions. In many cases they will have a large number of social students as well but the style of teaching competitors is completely different than social dancers. Where a social dancer will spend 10 minutes learning a waltz Natural Turn it is quite common for competitors to learn that step and practice it for hours making sure that the timing, direction, foot position, foot work, rise and fall, shaping, posture, head and hold is as close to perfect as you can get it. 

I will always suggest that a dancer join a studio with competitive students in it. The reason is simply that the knowledge needed to teach these students are considerably more and if you, at some stage, wish to progress or become more serious about your dancing, you can!

=== Competition dancing ===
The reason that I touch on what competitive dancing is, is to encourage you to start competing. The fact that you are reading this book already means that you are interested in improving your dancing. Doing medal tests if you do not have a partner or competing if you do is the perfect way to do this as it gives you a goal to work towards. 

The important thing to remember is that you have to start at the beginning and work you way up. The competition systems is designed to allow you to start at the beginning and progress through the levels at your own pace and competency level. 

So if you do decide to join competitions this is how this strange new world is organized. 

Competitions are divided into a '''syllabus''' section and an '''open''' section. 

'''Syllabus''' sections is the part where you still learn what the top dancers calls basic work. So if they where to refer to a basic Waltz it would mean a waltz consisting of syllabus steps. This would mean the variations indicated in this book as Bronze, Silver and Gold. 

The '''open''' sections are the advanced work. Dancers are not limited in what steps they can use as long as it falls into the generally accepted style of the dance. Dances and indeed dancers will borrow from each other and fashion plays a big role in the actual dancing and styling. 

==== Syllabus Sections ====

To order the variations presented in the dance sections of this book I have ordered them into sections called. Beginner, Bronze, Silver and Gold. This is the designation I am used to but is somewhat arbitrary as every dance organization differs in what they place in each category. Also some organization use a different level structure. 

Although the variations are relatively easy to learn. The technique is not and it takes time to get used to the way of doing them with confidence, poise, style. I suggest not trying to move up a level to fast. Most organization actually limit the amount of exams you are allowed to take at the same time. Allowing you to ingrain the variations and the technique before attempting more difficult work. 

As such I will try to introduce techniques in a the Beginner, Bronze, Silver, Gold as they are needed. So for example in a cha-cha-cha the inside foot is moved and placed in the cha-cha part of the basic allowing the hips to make an 8 movement. This is not strictly necessary in the beginner level but a Silver dancer should know this and put it into practice.

* Beginner - This is the level that we all started from. Advanced dancers will be well advised to join beginner group classes. It is not only a great way to practice but you will pick up small nuances and statements from your teacher that you missed the first time around.
* Bronze - This is about the level you should be at if you have been receiving continues instructions for a year.
* Silver - Continues instruction for two years.
* Gold - Instruction for three years.


Although each person learns at their own pace, you will probably master the variations faster than indicated above. Most organizations will not allow you to advance faster. Keeping this in mind if you learn the steps quicker practice the technique. If you are comfortable with the technique read the comments for the next level and start practicing this. It will be applicable to your level as well.

If you are interested in competing you will probably have to put more hours in as you advance. The syllabus sections can generally be divided into Bronze, Silver, Gold, some dancing organizations have renamed these sections but the basic requirements are the same.

==== Open Sections ====

After you have completed the syllabus work mentioned in this book you will advance to the dress sections or the open sections. Here what you dance is open to you. There is no variation that is out of bounds and you can start wearing extravagant outfit. Like the syllabus section you accumulate points to move up each level. But unlike the syllabus section you fall under the same rules, does not matter in which of open levels you are dancing. In the open section there is no restriction in syllabus so any legal variation can be danced. It is also quite common that the Championship sections can be danced by any dancers that is in the open sections. The open sections are: 

* Novice
* Pre-championship
* Championship

=== Age groups ===
  
Depending on the dancing organization. For purposes of this book it is not important but make sure that you know what the age divisions are for your organization. Your age group will influence you choice of partner.

Here is an example of age categories. 

* Juvenile I:		reach 	9th birthday or less in the calendar year
* Juvenile II:		reach	10th and 11th birthday in the calendar year
* Junior I:		reach	12th and 13th birthday in the calendar year
* Junior II:		reach	14th and 15th birthday in the calendar year
* Youth:			reach	16th , 17th and 18th birthday in the calendar year
* Adult:			reach	19th birthday or more in the calendar year
* Senior I:		reach	35th birthday or more in the calendar year
* Senior II:		reach	45th birthday or more in the calendar year

=== Competition points vs exams ===

Again depending on you're organization the exact method of promotion might differ but in general there are two systems that are used, either independently or together.

===== Test promotion systems =====
The test promotion system is basically a system where you have to dance a test or exam. This exam then entitles you to move onto the next level. 

In general for each exam the criteria are simply the variations and techniques that you can perform at a high enough level.

This system works very well for both social dancers and competitive dancers and ensures that basic techniques are mastered before a dancer can move onto the next level. It also gives a student something to work toward. The weakness of this system is that like everything in dancing the marking is subjective. Also the bar for promotion is really very low and it is very easy to pass onto the next level even with rudimentary dancing skill.

===== Points promotion system =====

This system is generally used in competition latin dancing. The system work on the principle that for each competition you compete in, you earn points. This is based on you placing in the competition size of the competition etc. Once you have earned enough points you will be advanced to the next level. 

The advantages in this system include that a dancer must compete and gain enough experience in each level to get promoted to the next level. It forces a dancers to compete and is a great motivator to keep competing. Because the competitions are adjudicated by several judges the promotion is less subjective and is measured on you ability against other dancers with approximately the same proficiency level. The major disadvantage is that the bigger the sections are the longer promotion from one level to another can take. Couples can be promoted purely based on the fact that there are no good couples in the sections they are competing in. This is mitigated somewhat by the way the points systems are structured.



[[/General Dancing Technique/]]

This section describes hints and techniques that is applicable to all dancing. They will be explained as it relates to latin dancing though.

==Dancing Etiquette==

Although this book mostly describes International Latin Technique related to competition dancing. It is important to have a basic understanding of Dancing Etiquette. This will help you interact when you do get a chance to practice in a social setting or simply want to go and have some fun. 

Dance etiquette can largely be summarized by the word &quot;politeness&quot;. Partners must keep a good connection and counter-balance one another in fast-moving partner dancing such as the Latin dances; yet still grant the other dancer his or her personal space where appropriate within the choreography. Although many of the standard dancing Etiquette rules apply to social situations it should be considered when doing competitions as well. As even competitive dancing was born out of the social dancing scene.

=== Social Etiquette ===

There are certain etiquette rules off and on the dance floor. Here are some of the general rules for both ladies and men that will make your evening more enjoyable. 

==== For Ladies ====
1. ''Do not refuse a gentleman when he asks you to dance.'' - Most men take offence when you refuse to dance with them and will ask their friend not to dance with you. It can cause you to sit the whole evening without dancing. If you have to refuse for what ever reason, be as polite as you can, smile and if the refusal does not preclude you dancing with the gentleman, ask him to ask you again at a later time. There are certain situations where it is acceptable to refuse. Most notably when the person asking you to dance with him is drunk, you can politely refuse. If you are refusing because you are tired do not dance with another gentlemen on the same dance. Please remember ladies that when a man asks you to dance with him it took some courage and that he will certainly spread the word if he enjoyed dancing with you. The same goes for when you refused. If a lady refused to dance with a gentlemen without providing a valid reason she can be assured of not being asked to dance again by that gentlemen for the rest of the evening. 

2. ''Close body contact is not required'' - Although certain latin dances lends itself to dancing very closely you are definitely not required to dance closely with a partner that you do not know. It is acceptable to move away from your partner to a more comfortable distance in the hold or to politely ask to be excused if the gentlemen are insistent. 

3. ''Follow the lead'' - Follow your partners lead. If you are unsure of the what to do, do what you feel is the right movement. It is important to realize that when leading a lady a man will interpret not only the music and choreograph the dance as you go along but also constantly scan your environment and decide which steps will work there. It is the man's responsibility to read the lady's ability and choreograph the dance appropriately. Don't be discouraged if you cannot feel a gentleman's lead immediately - there are some differences in the ability of the gentlemen to lead. If a gentleman has been dancing with a partner for a long time the lead becomes very soft and subtle and it takes some time to get used to leading a bit more strongly for a new partner.   

4. ''Leave the dance floor at the end of the dance'' - It is impolite to leave the dance floor before the song is complete. It is general practice to ask a lady to dance about halfway through a song and then continue onto the new dance. If for some reason the lady does not enjoy the dance she can politely thank the gentleman while the music is changing. It is generally considered an indication that a lady does not want to dance with you if she only dances one song. 

5. ''Do not teach'' - Do not try to teach your partner on the social dance floor. It is considered impolite.

==== For the gentlemen ====
1. ''Ask politely'' - Say please and thank you when asking a lady to dance. It not only makes a good impression but makes the lady feel more comfortable that she is in good hands when dancing with you.

2. ''Strong lead'' - Like asking a lady with confidence, you also have to lead with confidence. Do not guess what needs to be done - lead the lady strongly and early so she can react appropriately.

3. ''Do not force yourself on a lady'' - Most ladies will dictate the dance position when you offer your arm; do not pull her closer than she is comfortable and the same rule applies you are allowed to make more distance to make it more comfortable for you.

4. ''Floor craft'' - Try and steer clear of trouble where ever possible. In terms of floor craft it is important to remember that the less experienced the other dancers on the floor, the more space you need to leave. There are dance floors that are filled with experienced couples with no incident the whole evening, while others with three inexperienced couples constantly crashing into each other. It is not considered good practice to break another persons feet or jaw on the dance floor. If you do crash into another couple ask their forgiveness and continue to dance.

== Dress ==

As with the non-dancing world, dress in Latin dancing is subject to fashion and changes gradually over time, but can be split into three categories, The basic principle is to dress appropriately to the type of dancing you are going to do. 

=== Lady ===
==== General Rules ====
If dancing socially it is generally accepted that you can wear almost anything. 

Keep in mind that the latin dance styling is done with a short above the knee skirt in mind so wearing a long dress or jeans does not show off the movements as well. Wearing the wrong pants can subtract from the dancing so test your skirt and outfit doing some basic latin movements in front of the mirror. You will see that most dancers that have been dancing for a couple of years have very specific skirts that they dance with specifically for this reason. 

As a general rule it is a good idea to wear a short skirt. Keep in mind that the skirt will lift and you have to wear appropriate undergarments or a skirt that will not lift when turning rapidly. As far as shoes go, a medium heel sandal is recommended with straps to hold the foot in place, paying special attention that the straps hold the ankle in place. 

==== Practice Wear ====
If you are practicing the best shoes are the shoes you'll be wearing when competing; unfortunately you will be spending many hours practicing and this will use up your shoes quite quickly. A good practice is to have a pair of practice shoes with the same fit and balance as the shoes you will be wearing on the competition floor. Most couples migrate their old competition shoes to the practice floor as they buy new shoes. 

There are some practice shoes available that are softer. This is not a good idea if you are still competing but they are very useful when you have sustained some injury or are just quickly rehearsing your routines. If you are actually practicing try to use shoes as close to the competition floor as possible. In lessons always wear competition shoes.

As far as skirt goes please wear one especially to class. It is important to see the legs move to get the right movement. As the ladies' legs are showing when competing, the leg should be showing when practicing as well. The skirt is also important as this can be used to enhance the dance and the lady needs to get used to the feel of a skirt and what it does in certain movements. 

Again follow the general rule of keeping in mind that your skirt will be lifting. If you are comfortable with you body a leotard with a dancing skirt is the best outfit to practice in as you can see the body movement properly. If you are uncomfortable with your body come in a tight fitting top. Also keep in mind that you have to wear the leotard at some stage in class so your teacher can help you with the correct body movement. 

Hair preferably in a bun or similar; in practice you can loosen it and tighten it as necessary. The idea is to see the neck so hair up is always better. Depending on what you are working on this is not always necessary but do it if at all possible. 

The general rule when practicing is come as a dancer. 

==== Lounge/Party Dress ====

If you plan on dancing again a medium to high heel sandal or shoe that holds the foot firmly is preferred. Obviously if your dancing shoes are of an appropriate type you are welcome to wear them. Do not wear heavy shoes, shoes with high base or boots. 

Keep in mind when choosing your footwear that this is one of the criteria gentlemen use to choose a lady to dance. Foot wear appropriate to dancing indicates a willingness of the lady to dance. It also indicates an ability and some knowledge of dancing. 

I personally prefer a skirt or short dress as it shows of the movement of the body much better. Also most ladies look good in dresses. Obviously you have to dress appropriately for the situation but avoid denim and non stretching outfits that restrict your movement. It looks and is uncomfortable to dance in especially if you move around the floor. 

As far as the top goes avoid strapless dresses or tops. Make sure that the top will not move easily when a hand moves on your back. Loose tops only work if you have appropriate undergarments as they will move while dancing. Keep in mind that you will be perspiring at some stage and both your dress and top must be chosen appropriately if this might embarrass you. 

Undergarments are very important for the lady, especially when wearing a dress. Keep in mind that you will be moving quite a lot and you need to plan for your skirt and top to move. So expect glimpses of your undergarment to show. Make the assumption that your dress will lift and that your top will move. Therefore dress with what you are comfortable having other people see.

I have danced with some really brilliant ladies that simply would not go to a club after being embarrassed by tops moving more than expected and skirts lifting higher than expected. Try and avoid this from the beginning.

=== Competition dress ===

Here things become a bit different and we will dress according to the regulations of the dancing body that we have joined.

The general principles guiding you are:

1. Try to emphasize your good physical attributes - show off a beautiful stomach or back if you have it.

2. Try to deemphasize your bad physical attributes - if you are a tad overweight do not show the hips. 

3. Make sure that your outfit attracts attention. Judges want to see you and if your outfit does not stand out it automatically puts you at a disadvantage.

4. Make sure the outfit moves as expected, dance a dress rehearsal and make sure any items that can come off are secure.

==The Dances==
Because latin dance is a visual and emotional medium it is very hard to describe the actual movements. It is much easier to understand and copy a step when it is presented in a DVD, video or instruction. There are a couple of drawbacks to this though. 

'''Instruction''' depends on the experience of your teacher and although most teachers will mention everything, as dancers we tend to forget and often a small thing mentioned years ago makes a big impact when you dance the more advanced work. 

The drawback of '''DVDs and videos''' is that as an unexperienced dancer you miss the actual movement. You will see a huge hip movement and try to emulate it although the movement is a result of balance point changes on the feet. Videos also tend to be short on details.

So in books we describe in diagram form all these little nuances. But we miss out on the visual and emotional aspects as these can only be expressed in a medium like video. 
 
===Describing Variations===
The standard way to describe latin and ballroom dances is to build a diagram with each beat of a step defined in terms of different aspects eg. foot placement, heel foot, weight distribution etc. Unfortunately for beginner dancers, it is almost impossible to keep all this in your head and not feel overwhelmed. It also frequently happens that beginner dancers would focus on the wrong aspect of the movement, not developing the most important points first. So in describing the figures later in this book we will also use a diagram system but we will attempt to modernize it firstly. Secondly we might in the Bronze (Beginner) section only mention the feet placement and mostly leave out the hip movement that we will describe in later chapters more fully. 


==== Bronze ====

1. Basic balance
2. Foot placement and action
3. Partner relationship and direction
4. Posture
5. Basic timing
6. Musicality
7. Rhythm

==== Silver ====

1. Basic hip movement developed from feet
2. Partner contact 
3. Suggested basic arm movements
4. Stretch and feel of variations
5. Basic leg movement
6. Timing

==== Gold ====
1. Development of hip movement
2. Upper body movement
3. Interpretation of dance music and performance
4. Advanced timing
5. Head movement



=== [[/Cha Cha Cha/]] === 

Cha Cha is often the first dance a beginner will learn when they take up Latin dancing. The &quot;two-three-cha-cha-cha&quot; rhythm and 'chasse' (often called by instructors as side-close-side, though technically, the second step is only a partial close {This depends on the technique book used}) characterize this dance. It is danced in 4/4 time, usually at a 30-32 bars per minute tempo. The tempo, coupled with the character of the music leads to a dance that is often characterized as &quot;cheeky&quot; with the woman adopting a flirtatious manner, teasing the man.

=== [[/Rumba/]] ===
Rumba is often danced as a &quot;cha cha without the cha chas&quot;, and whilst this may appear correct, there are major differences, largely in the presentation of the dance. It is known as the dance of love, danced to sexy, sultry 4/4 music at a tempo of 26/27 measures per minute (105 bpm).

=== [[/Samba/]] ===

Originally a carnival dance from Rio de Janeiro, Samba is one of only two traveling dances in this genre. Like most traveling dances the dancers travel counter-clockwise around the floor.

=== [[/Jive/]] ===
Fastest of all the Latin dances and the least Latin as well. Jive and swing are similar in patterns but the Jive basic starts with a back rock instead of a triple step. Jive is know for the quick, pulsating leg action with a calm, steady upper-body. As with most Latin dances, the upper body remains at a fairly steady level.

=== [[Paso Doble]] ===
A dance based on the Spanish bullfights but actually originating in French nightclubs. Not at all like the &quot;Two Step&quot; American country dance, Paso focuses on pageantry and flamboyance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cha Cha Cha is often the first dance a beginner will learn when they take up latin dancing. The &quot;two-three-cha-cha-cha&quot; rhythm and 'chasse' (side-close-side step) characterise this dance. It is danced in 4/4 time, at competition to a tempo of 30-33 measures per minutes (120 bpm). 

==History of the Dance==

Cha cha cha is a true latin dance. Originating in Cuba, it developed from the danzon, an older form of Cuban dance. In 1952, dance teacher Pierre Margolie visited Cuba and saw what appeared to him as a Rumba with extra beats. On returning to England he started teaching this dance separately, and the cha cha cha became a popular dance in its own right.[[http://www.bbc.co.uk/strictlycomedancing]]

The name is said to arise from the sound of sandals slapping against the floor in the cha cha chasse.

==Mood of the Dance==

The cha cha should be a very cheeky, sassy dance and quite fast with your feet. The dancers should be lively and interplay should be strong, though independent. Eye contact is important throughout the dance, and conveys the sexual tension between dancers.

==Basic Steps==
As dance instruction studios started springing up they often developed their own names for various steps.  Names also differ if you are taught using an International syllabus.  Therefore the names below may be very different than those you are used to.

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''Measure, Beat'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align='center'&gt;'''Man'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align='center'&gt;'''Woman'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1 : 1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Place weight onto RF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Place weight onto LF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1 : 2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; LF forward, slightly across body, toe lead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; RF back&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1 : 3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Replace weight onto RF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Replace weight onto LF&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Close LF to RF&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2 : 1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Slightly larger Side step with LF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Slightly larger Side step with RF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2 : 2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; RF back&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; LF forward, slightly across body, toe lead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2 : 3'''&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Small Side step with RF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Small Side step with LF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2 : '&amp;''''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Close LF to RF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Close RF to LF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Slightly larger Side step with RF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Slightly larger Side step with LF&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

Start again from Measure 1, Beat 2.

==General Technique Tips==

===Footwork===

In general, the footwork technique in latin dances is to place the ball of the foot first, then to lower the weight onto it, whilst squeezing down the heel. Feet should be placed a comfortable distance from the base (i.e. below the hips), not too close as a full movement cannot be developed; but not too far as though this can look impressive, the recovery from a wide step can take too long and therefore leave a person chasing the music.

===Legs===

In general, the basic technique taught to beginners is to keep the supporting leg straight. A more advanced dancer however might like to try to keep both legs as straight as possible throughout the dance. As with all latin dances, knees and thighs should pass one another quite tightly, and though feet should be turned out, this should not be to the extent of exposing the inner thigh. If the inner thigh is exposed the legs can bow, and an undesirable gap between legs is often visible, breaking the line from head to toe.

On taking a step in front of the body, like in the [[International Latin Technique/Cha Cha Cha#Basic Steps|basic step]], knees should lock together - you should feel the knee of the trailing leg in the crook of the leg that is in front (whilst remembering to keep them straight).

===Hips===

For a cha cha, hips should move smoothly in a figure of 8 movement. It is from hip motion that leg and weight placement should arise. Again, taking an example of the basic figure of this dance: On the back step, commencing it weight should be totally over the supporting leg. Foot and  thigh should then be glided backwards away from body, and weight transferred onto them by rolling the hip round in front and out past the leg. To recover from the position, the hip should be rotated across the other leg, bringing weight back over the stationary leg and completing a figure of 8 with the hips.

In general, hips should not rise or fall, but stay on approximately the same horizontal level. The bottom half of the body (i.e. navel down) should be isolated from the chest and shoulders, which should remain primarily still. Movement should still be carried through, e.g. from the feet, but in a main, arms and chest line should be strong, focussing on opening out his body and asserting masculinity. The lady can afford to be more insular, using her arms to focus attention on her womanly bosom, wiggling her hips and bottom somewhat more with this movement carrying through her body.

===Timing===

As a beginner, spending a whole beat on steps 2 and 3, and half a beat each on 4, &amp; and 1 is perfectly acceptable. However, as your dancing improves and matures, then so will the phrasing of your cha cha. There are a few considerations to take into account here, which generally are accepted as advanced technique:

*The moving step (i.e. forward or backward on a basic - generally beat 2 of a bar) earns more of a developed movement than a simple replacement of weight and so spend more time on this.
*On a cha cha chasse, the first two steps should be slightly smaller than the final step (see [[International Latin Technique/Cha Cha Cha#Basic Steps|basic steps]]) and this lends more time to be taken over the final step, which produces a more developed cha cha phrasing.

==Basic and Standard Figures==
As previously mentioned the figures are grouped in on interpretation of what should be learned at what level. This gives a good indication for a dancer still learning the ropes the order and difficulty level of each variation.

=== Beginner ===
==== Basic Movement (Closed and in place) ====
===== General Notes =====
The cha-cha-cha basic is danced with the lady in the closed position. The lady is held in closed hold with the man stepping to the side on the 1. Forward on 2 back on 3 and to the side on 4&amp;. This happens in the opposite for the back step. Like most descriptions it is difficult to imagine without you actually seeing it. 

One of the main things a beginner should learn is the straight leg action on the 123 of the cha-cha-cha. The leg is actually locked which translates quite naturally into the hip action. To get the movement sharper the 1 can be delayed to allow the foot to shoot forward for the to or backwards for the 2. Keep the foot not carrying the weight straight and pointed.
 
===== Feet and Legs =====
Man
1 side with R foot
2 Forward left foot
3 Back R foot
4 Side left foot (small step)
&amp; Close R to Left foot
1 side with L Foot
2 Back with R Foot
3 Forward with L Foot
4 Side right foot (small step)
&amp; Close L foot R foot



===== Head =====
This figure is dance in the closed hold therefore the partner are in front of each other and they are looking into each others eyes.

===== Arms =====
This is a closed hold therefore the mans left hand is holding the ladies right hand and the mans right hand is placed on the ladies left shoulderblade. The ladies left hand is placed on the man's upper back, behind his shoulder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Personal Example

Problem: I could not come up with one satisfactory way to store my personal email addresses and phone numbers.  I kept changing systems using scraps of paper, etc.  This has been going on for years and was very frustrating for me.  Finally my professional organizer and I designed a system that I am using and am very happy with.

The requirements were:
That the system had to be accessible electronically from both work and home and that each place also had to have back up hard copies.  The system had to be periodically updated by the reminder system and collection storage folders until updated.  

We decided to use Yahoo! address book, note book, calendaring and email system. I store my pieces of paper with addresses, etc., in a file folder which we use to update the address book once every three weeks at a minimum and print out hard copies that I store in my work notebook and my home collection folder.  That was the clincher which sold me on the approach, when my professional organizer agreed to help me update the file.  That was the part I was dreading.  (Note: look for those personal barriers that are lurking in the shadows!).

What I love about it is that I can access my personal system on-line from both work and home and any place that I can be on-line.

I also consolidated all my bookmarks from outlook onto Yahoo! and use that one system to store my common bookmarks.

My thought keeps going to the hand-held phone/PC that can access on-line pretty much anywhere.  But I am happy with my system for now as is.

Another example of the use of technology is our use of Amazon.com to locate books. Some of us are especially fond of using the book reviews and &quot;Lists&quot; feature to locate interesting books.  People who like books I like tend to recommend other books that I like.

We can &lt;control&gt;C to copy the title then switch to our local library home page and search.  If the book is found, I can request that the book be sent to my local branch. They email me when it has arrived.  If my local library system does not have the book I can request it through the library via interlibrary loan. Then, if I must own my very own copy, I can purchase it via Amazon.

Amazon also can be used to inventory your books, by creating lists of 25 books each.

Just a quick question. What timezone are you in?

[[User:Aya|Aya]] 22:37, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I'm in New Zealand, so, lessee... GMT + 12. Yeah. So you'll see me up all &quot;night&quot; editing. 'course when I actually get the flippin' game (they say it reaches NZ June 20th!) I'm guessing my edits are gonna drop right away...

:[[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 01:09, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== GTA Pages ==

Hi Aya, been doing some patrols of the edits. Can you check the GTA pages for consistency/ correctness? Some newbies had been tinkering around with some pages (and not all are nice cuddly newbies either). There's way too many edits over the weekend for me to look through while at work. :P

Please let the other GTA contributors know as well.

== Comfortable Words ==

I haven't even finished the page with the link back to [[Christianity]] the Wikibook I am spearheading and you already put it up for Speedy Deletion, what gives?

Sorry, then it's an issue of non-conformity. If I try subpage [[Christianity/The Comfortable Words]] then you delete the other, is that preferable. Or should I or you use redirect?[[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 8 July 2005 20:50 (UTC)

Saw your vote on John 2, thanks. I will redirect all pages to Christianity/... That was the problem and this is the solution, I think. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 8 July 2005 21:05 (UTC)

Thank you again, when I got back to it, you did all the work. The move function, not redirect, worked for a remaining page [[Palestine map]] and now I understand the naming convention. What a switch, to say, you may have saved Christianity (the book).

== [[Car Terms]] ==

If the book expands, it will be necessary to split it into sections; furthermore, short pages take less time to load. Remember that we don't all have broadband yet! How would you recommend naming the sections? If it gets big enough, one section for each letter of the alphabet might be a good idea - then something would always stay in the same section. Let me know what you think... [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 16:25, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
*I did consider how to link different entries together, and it seems either a single page or one per letter (in the future) is the best idea. For now it's all on one page. [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 09:04, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== category hierarchies ==

Hi, I perused your critique of wikibooks and since you're one of the more active people on here, I wonder what your opinion is on hierarchical category schemes. The [[Wikibooks Pokédex]] uses a &quot;namespace enabled&quot; categorization scheme:
* [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Baby Pokémon]]
* [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Cute Charm Ability]]
I belive the Cookbook should use such a scheme (about 1/5 of all the categories are related to the cookbook), though I tend to think it should be even more highly structured. Any thoughts? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 21:35, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

== Indentation on talk pages? ==

Hi Aya. I noticed that you changed the indentation on [[User talk:Chaturganj]]. Have a look at the standards and conventions of writing and layout on [[Wikibooks:Talk page]]. The convention is for the second contributor to use one colon, and the third to use two, etc.; but if the first contributor comes back, then they don't use any colons (as with their first post), etc. It also avoids the need for an insane number of colons in long discussions. I hope that you don't mind, but I changed it back again. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 02:34, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

: Not a problem. I guess the indentation makes no odds really, but I ought to stick with policy as long as it exists that way. Problem is the page is not clearly marked as such, so I shall fix that. So far I've made NPOV the only enforced policy, since it's reasonably short, fairly well worded, and it feels like the least contentious. Everything that looks like a policy, I've added to the a category to make them easier to find.

: I'm a bit concerned that these policies (with the exception of WB:WIN which relates solely to Wikibooks) were inappropriately forked from Wikipedia about 2 years ago, and have consequently evolved much more on Wikipedia than they have on this site. I'm wondering if they should all be moved to Meta, or in the meantime converted to redirects to Wikipedia policy. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:20, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, it's difficult to learn all of the policy. I'm sure there are some cases where our policy differs needlessly from Wikipedia, Meta, etc. (like capitalisation rules ;). But, be sure that the differences are not there for good reason, before replacing a page with a redirect. That said, I'm all for consistency between Wikimedia projects. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 01:27, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

: Understood. I'm taking quite a lot of time reading through all the policy documents on Wikipedia (if the Manual of Style is to be included as well), and separating them into policies which seem to apply to all Wikimedia projects vs. those which apply only to Wikipedia. This process may take days/weeks, but I'm gonna try gradually transferring them to [[m:Policy]]. e.g. the aforementioned NPOV policy which appears to be fairly universal seems to exist on meta as well, although it claims the Wikipedia version is more authoritative. In the same location on meta are many distinct interpretations, and counter-arguments to NPOV. Just gives me a headache. Why did I decide to get involved in politics? I must be retarded. :-/ - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:11, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

I think you're correct to have deleted that.  I don't recall getting a dildo except by picking one up deliberately somewhere.

== Proposal to overhaul policy ==

As an interested user in the policies of Wikibooks in general, you might be interested in the fact that I've started to think about changes to existing policy and project scope so that policies are more clearly defined (as you suggested) and more open (as suggested by [[User:Robert Horning]] over the biography debacle).  I've made a post on textbook-l ([http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html]) as a result, please reply to my talk page for feedback. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:46, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

: Sure. I'll take a look. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

== Admin ==

Hey Aya. You seem to be very active...would you be interested if I were to nominate you for admin? [[User:Serge|Serge]] 08:57, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

: You can if you like, but see also the appropriate part of [[User talk:Geocachernemesis#Template:Top 10 active]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:23, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

And, speaking of admins, you said &quot;''In fact I'd probably support anyone who isn't obviously a vandal.''&quot; So, could I get you to consider a support vote for [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]]? He's certainly no vandal, and has helped out a lot. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 14:34, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

== oops sorry ==

I rv'ed a bit too much on the Missions page.

Also, not sure all those changes were really damage... see the talk page.

--[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 21:23, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

: No probs. Not quite sure what you mean by 'all those changes'. If you mean the last few by the same IP address, that looked a lot like me to common phenomenon of 'incremental blanking'. The previous anoymous IPs were reasonable edits, so watch out - not all anonymous IPs are vandals. I think the last version I submitted is the correct one, but I may have misinterpreted your comment, so feel free to disagree.

: Note than generally, '''any''' deletion not explained in the edit summary is considered revert-worthy, including those made by registered users, unless you happen to know better. Even if it was someone you trusted, they may still have submitted it in error. If you want to delete something because you feel it's redundant or incorrect information, you must specify in your edit summary, else someone else may revert it.

Yeah, I also presumed that all IP addresses were false changes.  I rv'ed it again from a different baseline.  Apparently, only one IP was evil. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 21:28, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

== Congradulations... Hail the new Bureaucrat! ==

Like that normally is something you really want to call yourself. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:06, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

: Seems like a bit of a crappy name really. In my mind the word 'bureaucracy' is nearly the antithesis of 'activity'. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:33, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

There is some stuff that needs to be accomplished here on Wikibooks, and hopefully there are some other people who can help do some of the cleaning up here.  You'll do a good job.  Hopefully we can get a few more admins here on Wikibooks as well, to deal with some of the backlog.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:06, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

: One of the first things I did was process the backlogs in [[WB:RFA]], and admin'd [[User:Geocachernemesis]]. He got on with blocking linkspammers, while I got through about half of the speedy deletions (they take a lot more time than you think). Also reformatted the [[Main Page]] (although I'm still not happy with the layout), and rewrote [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] so it makes some sort of sense. Still loads more to do. Suggestions always welcome in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:33, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

== Bookshelf policy ==

Part of being the new bureaucrat is that you have more force in approving revisions to existing policy, since you have to be aware of them.  [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves]] is meant to replace [[All bookshelves]], [[Wikibooks:Why move books?]], and perhaps [[Help:Development stages]] (and also maybe a few other pages I haven't mentioned) into a centralized policy page on bookshelves.  See if you like it, and make changes as appropriate. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 18:35, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

PS. Part of this change is moving all bookshelves to the Wikibooks namespace, so that explains the red links.

: Good work. I've tried to tag all the current policies with a template, to make it easier to keep track of them. If you come across any more pages which look like policies, stick the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{proposed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag on them.

: I like the idea of moving all the organizational content out of the main namespace, which ought to be reserved for actual books. I was still putting some thought into the canonical index for the organization of books, e.g. using dewey codes or categories, but I think I've come to the conclusion that dewey codes can't keep up with the evolution of human concepts (far too many books would end up in the 'Generalities' section), and categories should be used for modules rather than books. By choosing our own concepts and scope for bookshelves, they can be more easily modified to keep up with trends, and thus be more future-proof.

: It's probably best if we don't differ too much from Wikipedia's use of categories, since the Wikipedia mind-set seems commonplace amongst Wikibooks users. The thing I most want to crack down on, is the correct use of subpages, to prevent Wikibooks slowing turning into a fork of Wikipedia. We will end up with oddities like...

:* My Computer Science Book/Electronics Section
:* My Physics Book/Electronics Section

: ...but we can't avoid it. Besides, the pages in both sections will likely differ somewhat in their scope (analog electronics is rarely mentioned in computer science). What I want to avoid is...

:* Computer Science
:* Physics

We do have [[Bookshelves/test]] as a really old Dewey categorization at Wikibooks, but it's an archaism that can be easily removed.

The use of categories right now is either for book specific purposes, for fine-tuned bookshelf categorization, and possibly common elements of different books (answer keys, etc), although we don't exactly have any real category policy.  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 17:46, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

This is just an FYI for you, but I've created [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] as an attempt to try and help organize classification policies, as well as try to actually implement those policies.  Not much is happening right now on the main page, but the talk page does have a somewhat lengthy discussion going on.  This discussion is discussing a category heirarchy change that is going to be somewhat radically different than Wikipedia's, and certainly something more fitting for a book project than encyclopedia articles.  That is not to say that Wikipedia-style categories can't be used, but this is supplimental to them.

We are also proposing a &quot;Card Catalog Entry&quot; that can be applied to each Wikibook (self-generated within each participating Wikibook) that would help with this organizational effort.  Your thoughts and ideas would be appreciated.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:56, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

''when marking a copyvio you remove the violatory text''

: Any particular reason? It occurs to me that the violatory text is still easily available from the history, so it's not as if removing it makes any odds from a legal standpoint. From a functional standpoint, I think leaving it in makes it easier for other users to confirm that the page is indeed a copyvio. When I re-wrote [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] (hopefully much clearer now), I specified that the template should just preprend the text, not replace it, but I didn't change the template to match. What do you think? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:47, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I just worry that changing our policy won't work, cos Wikipedia users will just assume it's the same.

== Could you re-christen me? :) ==

Yes this is a strange request. According to [[w:Wikipedia:Changing username]], bureaucrats can rename users. I was originally keeping the same username on each wiki in anticipation of the global login, but plans for that seem to have fallen through. [[User:Garrett]] on Wikibooks is vacant (it wasn't on WP), so if you have a spare moment (and the process isn't too arduous) I'd like to become just plain &quot;Garrett&quot;. Thanks! :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:46, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

: I can, providing you have made less than 5000 edits, and the new username you want is not in use. If this is the case, then let me know '''when''' you'd like the changeover to happen, so that you're aware that you need to login with your new username. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:04, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Okay. Forget that. I interpreted &quot;if you have a spare moment&quot; to mean &quot;ASAP&quot;, so I've made the change. Be aware that [[User:Master Thief Garrett]] has been protected so it remains a redirect to [[User:Garrett]] (same with talk page), and the old account name has been re-created and blocked to prevent someone else masquerading as you. I've renamed all your other user pages (Temp and Great War), updated all backlinks, and deleted the old pages. Make sure you update your sig to point to the new user page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:41, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity ==

You put some commentary on [[Wikiversity]] that suggests Wikiversity should be moved off from Wikibooks, and that an '''&quot;authorized member of the Wikimedia Foundation&quot;''' asked you to talk about the scope of the project on meta first.

IMHO, that discussion on meta is irrelvant as what is happening here on Wikibooks should govern what is going on with Wikiversity, not the discussion on meta.  The meta discussion should only be about putting it on a seperate server, which I also think is a bad idea at this time.  I don't think there is sufficient &quot;demand&quot; to move it elsewhere.

Like the Card Catalog Office that I propsed earlier, I think Wikiversity ought to be a &quot;Wikibooks project&quot; with its own subset of pages and organization.  Wikiversity has been an integral part of Wikibooks from the beginning and was one of the parts of the original proposal for Wikibooks.  Indeed, Wikibooks was supposed to be the adjunct auxiallary &quot;library&quot; for Wikiversity, essentially Wikibooks was a sub-project to Wikiversity, not the other way around.  Wikibooks, on the other hand, was easier to implement in the beginning.

As far as the &quot;authorized member&quot; was concerned, I think you need to spell out very clearly who that was.  One of the foundation board member, [[User:Angela|Angela Beesley]], is very upset over the whole thing.  I would strongly reccomend that you contact her immediately to calm down her feelings on this issue, and try to resolve any complaints she may have over the content that you have added, including the decision to protect the main page for [[Wikiversity]].  She has moved the discussion of this to the Foundation Board mailing list, and did not have very good words to say about you. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:20, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

== Suggested changes to avoid vandalism of the main page ==

The ass pus vandal decided it would be fun to replace the images in both the [[Wikibooks:Book of the month/August 2005]] and [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month/August 2005]] templates. Because you seem to be creating the templates at the moment, I will suggest my solution to you. If the image is from the Commons, then you simply create a local copy of the image that you are going to use on the template, called something like [[:Image:Book or the month August 2005]]. After using the local image in the template, simply protect both the image and the template page, at least as long as it's displayed on the main page. Do you think that's a good idea? [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:14, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:Bah. We shouldn't have to work around the AP vandal. It's like terrorism. If we react by locking down the site too much, or creating lots of extra work for us to do, then he wins. What I've been doing recently is telling one of the server admins in irc://irc.freenode.net/#wikimedia the username of the most recent vandal attack, then they mass-block the IP on '''all''' Wikimedia wikis, since he seems to attack all of them, not just us. Note that this can only be done for attack in the last 30 days, since they only keep logs for that long. For now, just block the account, add the username to the list in [[WB:VIP]], and revert the damage. The best solutions should require the least amount of effort to implement. If you can think of an easier way, let me know. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:59, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I'm not overly worried, because the vandalism is easily fixed. But if we do ever track them down, then there would be a strong case for punishing them for subjecting minors to obscene material.

:::Because we already protect the main page, like many other Wikimedia projects, it would probably be best to go the whole hog, and protect all of the content shown on it (like Wikipedia?). I'm not just thinking of the AP vandal, it may be targeted by others too. I know that it would be slightly cumbersome, but we could write it into our procedures. But, I also agree that we shouldn't automatically protect every page that has been vandalised only once.

== Wikiversity and its role in Wikibooks ==

The first mention of something like Wikiversity (that I can find) was back in August 2003 by Daniel Mayer when he suggested even a [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-August/002096.html namechange for the whole project to become Wikiuniversity].  Remember that back then the URL to the site was http://textbook.wikipedia.org/ and not the current method.  The current &quot;sister project&quot; setup with Wikimedia projects was still being pounded out, and Wikibooks was only a couple of months old at the time.  The issue regarding formal textbooks that would be organized for internet classes was also discussed there as well.  Similar threads around that time clearly seperated the fiction from non-fiction, and another project was supposed to pick up the fiction content.  That still hasn't happened except on Wikicities (where the fiction wiki really is kind cool).

Another interesting discussion can be found [http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/28/1351230&amp;tid=146&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=11 on Slashdot] where none other than Jimmy Wales himself gave an interview about Wikipedia and other related projects including Wikibooks.  Unfortunately that was just a quick on-line blurb, but does also indicate the educational direction of Wikibooks instead of pure non-fiction.

I wish I could give you something more concrete.  There have been other discussions I've read over time, and if you want, I can try to dig them up.  Reading through the Textbook-l mailing list (particularly at the early postings when the mailing list was very active) will give some enlightenment over early Staff Lounge discussions, where most of the major dicussion about the organization of Wikibooks seems to be at right now.  The mailing list at the moment seems to be a bully pulpit of malcontents and occasional &quot;news articles&quot;, and major announcements.  Generally rather low volume, but monitored by all of the long-time users at meta and the foundation board (including Jimbo).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:35, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Muggles guide to Harry Potter ==

Hi, I noticed your name attached to ending the VFd on muggles guide. I came to the discussion rather late, and certainly from the position of expecting wiki (somewhere) to include detailed information about HP. i have read the whole debate twice and finally it seemed to me that contributors had made valid points about why this should be considered encyclopedic, rather than textbook. It seems regrettable that some people who have been reorganising HP on 'pedia do not agree, but it remains inevitable that there will be large bodies of work covering the same ground in both wikis. This seems to me why the arguments that it should have been deleted here will persist. I remain in the dark about definition of 'macropedia' and 'forking', which were both cited as reasons for deleting.  (I read the 'what wikibooks is' page, but it is quite short). Do you see these two continuing as rivals or that one will largely die? [[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 08:17, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

:First of all, be aware that I am also quite new to the project, and, in fact, all Wikimedia projects. I started on Wikibooks on June 12th of this year, in an effort to enhance the [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] Wikibook with a FAQ containing much of the little-known information that had been cropping up repeatedly on the [http://www.gamefaqs.com GameFAQs] forum. During this time, I met [[User:Garrett|Garrett]] who was also working on this Wikibook, and together we discussed, restructured and expanded the the whole book into the much more comprehensive guide that it is today. You may also notice striking similarities between the structure of this Wikibook, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]].

:As a new user to the site, I found the site's rules and policies difficult to find, and somewhat confusing and contradictory, which I found off-putting, and worried that this may have had a similar effect to other new users, so I then turned my attention to making an effort to sorting this out. I then drafted the document [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks|A critique of Wikibooks]], utilizing the power of wiki to analyse these problems, and come up with some solutions to help solve these problems once and for all.

:As a consequence of this, and the fact that there seemed to be very few administrators to combat the ongoing vandalism, I requested bureaucrat status in order to get some more administrators to help out. I got promoted within 3 days of my request, and immediately started processing the backlogs of vandalism, and the backlogs in [[WB:RFA]] and [[WB:VFD]]. If you read my 'critique', you'll notice I already identified the problem of overlapping scope between Wikimedia projects, and, although I have made some changes already, this is still something that needs to be more clearly defined if we don't want this site slowly evolving into a mirror of Wikipedia.

:Back to your original 'questions':-

: ''it seemed to me that contributors had made valid points about why this should be considered encyclopedic, rather than textbook''
:: The problems with using words like 'encyclopedic' and 'textbook' is that they are rather ill-defined, and without clarification, you will find that discussions about the correct location of the Harry Potter content are really just arguments about what these words actually mean in the context of wiki. The best distinction I have come up with so far is more about style than content. Let's use the concept of a 'spoon' for an example. The 'encyclopedia' style is a single page starting with the words &quot;A '''spoon''' is a utensil, blah, blah, blah...&quot;, whereas the 'textbook' style would be the same sort of information, structured over many pages, with a contents page, introduction, and many distict chapters containing infomation about spoons.

: ''I remain in the dark about definition of 'macropedia' and 'forking', which were both cited as reasons for deleting.''
:: These are not my words, but rather an attempt to shift the negative criteria from [[WB:WIN]] into a context containing the positive criteria of what actually constitues a valid Wikibook. This was supposed to be a two-stage process. The first was to deprecate the [[WB:WIN]] page, without upsetting too many people, and shift it to [[Wikibooks:About]]. The second was to re-word these criteria to use less ambiguous language, but I have not done that just yet, to allow other users to chance to get used to the new location. The word 'macropedia' I can't even find in any dictionary, but I guess it's supposed to mean &quot;an extended encyclopedia entry&quot;, or in practical terms &quot;don't dump a page from Wikipedia here, and then extend it, to get around the fact that you're not allowed to extend an article beyond a certain size on Wikipedia&quot;. As for 'forking', it's a common term in Computer Science meaning &quot;to create a duplicate version of&quot;, or in practical terms &quot;don't dump a page from Wikipedia here because the changes you wanted to make to it were voted out and reverted by the community&quot;.

: ''I read the 'what wikibooks is' page, but it is quite short''
:: By this, I assume you mean [[Wikibooks:About]]. I feel it important to keep things fairly concise. If a newbie comes across this document, and finds pages and pages of text, they won't bother reading it, which defeats the whole purpose of its existence. I was hoping the more practical definition of &quot;the sort of book you might find in a library or bookshop&quot; would be meaningful enough to anyone who has ever visited one.

: ''Do you see these two continuing as rivals or that one will largely die?''
:: By this, I assume you mean the Wikipedia articles vs. the Wikibook. One of the few things that I find most Wikipedians agree on is that pages should be kept quite short, so I foresee both continuing to exist, although the Wikipedia version will eventually be limited in its size, whereas the Wikibooks version will continue to expand indefinately, especially considering the popularity of the Harry Potter books and movies.

IMHO, the whole reason for starting a VFD on Harry Potter was bogus anyway. People have been using such meaningless concepts as 'not educational' and 'not instructional' to justify all sorts of nonsense. Much of what I have said here may make more sense if you read http://abelard.org/category/category.htm

You might want to be a bit careful changing God to Allah. Besides, I thought the Old Testament &quot;God&quot; was the same for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - 02:11, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
:Hm... well, yes and no. As far as I know leaving it as Allah is the most common and &quot;correct&quot; way. Not only will you see that throughout historical fiction, but also in phrases ([[w:Allah#Uses of &quot;Allah&quot; in phrases]]). Even though fully translated into English they've left &quot;Allah&quot; intact.

:You'll also see this in English versions of the Qur'an ([[Wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/At-tur]], [[Wikisource:WikiQuran#Chapter 1]]). It's just like the Jews making Tanakh translations and leaving the name Yahweh instead of using God (which to some of their scholars is a term only Christians would use).

== MoC ==

Hey, you never cast a vote either way for the MoC. I am curious what your take is on the issue and how you read Jimbo's comment. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:27, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

:Indeed. I don't really like the voting system. I prefer instead that the community decides what the scope of the site should be, modify the site policy to make it clear what is acceptable based on that, then admins can safely delete content which is not in keeping with policy, without having to go through a tedious voting process. Unfortunately it would seem that not everyone agrees on the type of content that we should be hosting.

:Regarding Jimbo's comment, it would seem very similar to [[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]]'s interpretation, that is that any book which could conceivably be used as a textbook in an academic institution is okay, while everything else is not. However, in order to know which is the case, you'd have to be aware of all courses being taught at all major academic institutions (and define &quot;major&quot; in that context), which seems impractical. There are also some rather crazy courses being taught at some major institutions (&quot;Star Trek Studies&quot; springs instantly to mind). Even if that were possible, there is still the problem that many books are borderline, in the sense that you argue either way that the book is approriate or inappropriate, depending on your POV.

:Personally I think this particular problem is fundamentally insoluable. The &quot;sum of human knowledge&quot; does not fit into nice neat categories for organizational purposes. Even &quot;simple&quot; binary categorization such as...

:* Fiction vs non-fiction
:* Educational vs non-educational
:* Instructional vs non-instructional

:...is not as clear-cut as we might like it to be. As to which category a certain book belongs in, is very much a matter of personal POV, which is no use for a site used by many people whose opinions in this regard differ to a greater or lesser extent. In order for a site-wide &quot;acceptable content&quot; policy to work, it must represent an objective viewpoint (if such a thing can even exist in the real world), with a clearly defined distinction between the two.

:Back to the MoC, this is one of these borderline cases. I could argue such a text might be appropriate in courses such as Law, Psychology, Sociology, Politics, and others, but, similarly, I could argue that it is not appropriate at all.

:Perhaps the problem here is with the community consensus idea (comparable to a &quot;direct democracy&quot;), and that something more akin to a &quot;representative democracy&quot; (i.e. the community votes in a small subset of users to make these sorts of decisions) would prove more effective.

:[[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:47, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

:: I am actually quite in favor of community consensus, but this relies on an understanding that our fundamental goals are the same. Right now, due to a lack of definition of wikibooks ''should be'' from wikimedia, I feel like there is a split in fundamental viewpoints on wikibooks (though to be fair, there's maybe 20 people who regularly read VfD -- maybe polling all contributors would turn out differently) and this split seems along the lines of textbooks versus instructional materials. So we currently lack agreement on what the fundamental goals of wikibooks are, and therefore we are unable to come to consensus about whether or not particular materials fall within our goals.
:: I think Jimbo's comment begins to address this, but I see some inconsistency in his comments on VfD. I do not think that the &quot;wikibooks community&quot; will come to the consensus that all non-textbook materials should be deleted, though this is what some people think is appropriate and desirable. I personally think that the goals of wikimedia may call for only textbook-like materials, but I don't think that wikibooks contributors will be able to come to this consensus on their own, and I tend to think intervention in the form of a clearly defined goal from wikimedia is necessary to resolve VfDs for things like the MoC and &quot;how to cheat...&quot; [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:05, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

:I think that when the fundraising drive is over we should replace [[MediaWiki:Sitenotice]] with a site-wide vote on these issues. Someone just needs to draw them up in an adequate way. Currently we've only had about two or three people discussing what belongs. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:48, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

::Garrett to the rescue (again). Good idea. We could also use [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]]. We need to make votes on such important site-wide issues ''extremely'' visible, otherwise users may feel cheated that they weren't informed that a voting process was going on. This also ties in with an idea I had a while back of a centralized voting index page to link into pages like VFD, and to add in new pages to vote on important policy issues (perhaps we could use [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]]?). We could also use this opportunity to split up VFD into separate pages for each item to vote on (like WP). We will need to ensure that voting is fair. Obviously we'll need to takes steps to avoid sockpuppetry, but we'll also need to ensure that the points being voted on are written in an unbiased way.

I've drafted an example at [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote]]. Feel free to add or alter the points for now, it's not until closer to the vote that these options need to be relatively fixed. For now I've just used quotes by various contributors to illustrate the points, but ideally they'd be rewritten.

== New policy (again) ==

Hi Aya, et al. Looks like I just found this &quot;club.&quot; Inspired by Gerrett's works, I've tried to narrow-in on a WikiBooks policy. Please look at [[User:Mshonle/Policy]], which is based on feedback from those who have already been working on Garrett's page. I will post it there soon, too.

Aya, in particular I was wondering what you felt about video game guides. I think I've found a decent enough reason to exclude them, but I'm also the type of guy who changes his mind when confronted with new thoughts and information. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:51, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:If we've decided to go with academia only, then I can't honestly imagine any academic course which would require the use of guides to specific computer games, although a guide on programming computer games might be appropriate.

:On the subject of academia vs. any non-fiction, it would seem that the site was originally supposed to be only the former, whereas it extended to include the latter as time progressed. I feel that perhaps this was wrong, and we should return to what the site was originally intended for.

:However, such a massive change in scope means that most of our existing content will have to be moved elsewhere, and we must find somewhere for it to go before deleting it. For the computer game guides, I know [[User:Garrett|Garrett]] is looking at getting admin rights on one of the game guide wikicities, and when this is done, we can start moving the game guides there. But what about all the other stuff which no longer 'fits'? This will all need to be moved somewhere else. Is there an existing wiki on which it can all go, or will we need to create one or more new wikis for it? Most importantly, is this going to be practical? This is the main reason I suggested extending Wikibooks to include all non-fiction, since I don't believe that the bulk of the existing content already here fits into the category of 'academia'. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
::I agree with you that a radical shift in policy that would re-move a lot of books would be bad and we should avoid that. The middle-ground I have found, and [[Wikibooks_talk:Policy/Vote#A_directly_enumerated_WikiBooks_policy|put]] on the policy talk page is one that allows course work textbooks, how-to guides, and hobby and vocational guides. I have made [[Wikibooks_talk:Policy/Vote#Existing_Books_that_would_be_removed|a section]] on what books I think would be affected. Some of the books have already gone up for VFD and have been removed since I posted them. I think most important in the new policy, and indeed why we are even having a policy discussion, is to decide the reason why we would not allow future Manual of Crime-like books from being part of this project. I think we must also be midful of [[Wikipedia:Anti-elitism|Larry Sanger's issues]]. For a textbook project to work and create results that are actually used in the classrooms (particularly in developing countries) we need to attract and keep academic contributors. This policy change would only be a part of that.&lt;p&gt;The game guides is a huge issue and if they are to move we'd need it to be as smooth as possible. I'm not sure if an incremental move is better, or an all at once move is better. We could decide to leave the guides up here for a longer period to help us decide. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:18, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

::: I worry that using a term as vague as &quot;hobby guide&quot; could be reasonably extended to include just about anything. Certainly playing computer games is a hobby of many people, so under this wording, they would stay. If the goal is purely to ditch stuff like MoC, then why not &quot;any non-fiction except that which glorifies the breaking of (US) law&quot;.
::::[This worry is addressed in the exclusions and qualifications: any guide that is on fictional creations without any conceivable classroom use is excluded. Because video games are fictional creations, guides to them are not allowed. Similarly, this would disqualify movie triva, except for ''study guides'' for films that film-students would see. The standards of quality section would probably imply there could be a single Film Study book, instead of dozens of smaller books on The Godfather, The Graduate, Kiss of the Spiderwoman et cetera. I'm sure even after all of this time and conversations that some of my policy suggestions could leave holes or exclude good books. A good way to check would be to post a list of books you see as edge or boundary cases, and I'll see how to interpret them, and make changes to the language if neccessary. (That is pretty much what has been going on already.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:50, 9 September 2005 (UTC)]
::: Another possibility (although somewhat more radical), is that (in borderline cases) one of the flaws of the VFD system means that some poor user may spend ages writing a guide, only to have it deleted later. Would it not make more sense to have a &quot;Votes for creation&quot; (VFC), which would allow the community to decide on whether or not they actually want the specified book to be created in the first place. It would work something like this:
::::[I don't think we'll ever find a perfect system. It does suck that some work is &quot;wasted&quot; because they get deleted, but it's not like the authors don't get a chance to post it somewhere else instead. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:50, 9 September 2005 (UTC)]
:::* A user wishing to create a new book (as opposed to adding a new page to an existing book) would add an entry to the VFC page, specifying the title of the book, and some sort of minimal scope that the book intends to cover. Any new page created in the main namespace is assumed to be a new book, and if the page has not been voted in by VFC, it will be speedily deleted.
:::* The community would discuss/vote on the creation of the new book. Something which might crop up frequently is that a book already exists on the subject, and the user should work on that instead. This would also provide a place for users to discuss the structuring of the new book, and the appropriateness of it for the site. If the new book gets the green light, then they can start on it. If the book gets the red light, then they have wasted little time on its creation, and can also be given the URL of a more appropriate wiki to create it on.

::: This is actually similar to the procedure for getting a new Wikicity. It would also mean we don't have to worry about creating a well-worded policy on acceptable content, since each new book would be voted in on a case-by-case basis. We can retain the vague policy &quot;this site is for educational books&quot;, and let the community decide for each new proposed book.

::: How does that sound? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:17, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
:::: I don't like the idea of increasing any barriers to entry. I would rather make it simpler for the &quot;right&quot; people to easily create books and get working on them. One danger is that approvals could take a long time, or people might find it hard to even explain what they are trying to do to non-experts. Also as a result we might instead encourage people to, instead of achieving what they wanted to do by writing book X, that they try to achieve what they want to do by changing or ammending book Y, even though Y really shouldn't cover X.

:::: In terms of wasted time, we could set a procedure that kicks in after a certain period time passes after a book's creation, or after a book grows to a certain length, whichever comes first. That way, the only wasted effort is that certain length of time or bytes.

:::: The procedure I have in mind is that the book would need to have a specific charter proposed, revised, and approved. The charter would state what is and isn't appropriate for the book, the criteria necessary to reach a &quot;first edition&quot;, an explaination of how it would fit the &quot;what is a wikibook&quot; rules, and what the book is trying to accomplish.

:::: Charters would make it easier for contributors because then everyone would have the same idea of the scope and everyone would be aiming at the same target. But charters would not encode decisions that are likely to change. For example, it would not say what the order of the chapters were, because that would make it too hard to change the book (because then you'd have to change the charter and get it reapproved). A charter system would also respect the experts more, because it would prevent just anyone (or a group) coming along and making changes to a book that are counter to the (approved) charter. It's easier for an expert (e.g. an academic) to argue for and against charters than it is for them to fight against pseudo-trolls and other project hijackers. This could also be an enforced policy, which would mean charter deviations can be reverted.

:::: Whatever the case, this sounds more like VFD/book creation policy than it does in defining what ''is'' a WikiBook. But the two can be complimentary. We might not be satisfied until we see both. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:50, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

:I just checked on ''#wikimedia-tech''. The ''favicon.ico'' is not something that you can change via the wiki interface. File a request under the ''Wikimedia web sites'' section on [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/ bugzilla], and attach the new ''.ico'' file to the bug report. N.B. you can't attach the file 'til after you've submitted the report (for some bizarre reason). I can't imagine the .ico file format will ever be added to the allowed list of media types, since it's an MS proprietary format. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:51, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

== Welcome Back! ==

Welcome back, it's been quite a long while since we've seen you around here. I'm glad to see you back! As you've obviously noticed with the [[WB:NP|naming policy]], a lot of things have changed around here in the past few years. We've adopted a de facto policy of minimalism, which is good in reducing needless bureaucracy, but can sometimes raise confusion where helpful or even necessary information has been omitted.

We tried like hell to get in touch with you about the deadminship thing. I hope that doesn't cause any sore feelings, it's something we've been doing more as a bookkeeping measure then as some kind of &quot;punishment&quot;. The general consensus has been that it's better to have an accurate list of active admins, then to have a huge list where many of the names are inactive or have left forever. Plus, we've been viewing adminship more as a toolbox then as a badge of honor: Get the tools when you need them, give them back when you don't. Really, we're hoping it's all ''no big deal'' like jimbo once promised :).

Anyway, it's good to see you. I'd probably like to chat with you a little bit about history, since you were here long before I ever joined and probably know more about this place then I do. But, that's something we can save for later. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:07, 5 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

Sorry for the late reply. I have been on vacation. I'm still not sure how I am going to be running the course, so if you'd like to, you are more than welcome to help out, or even be assitant/co - professor. I know a bit about the Great War but I am not an expert, so having two people might make a big improvement on the course. Since the course is somewhat provisional in nature, I don't know that I am going to have people write essays. I think it might be more appropriate to do it seminar style and have guided discussions where people learn not just from the professor but from other students. Let me know what you think.

''when marking a copyvio you remove the violatory text''

: Any particular reason? It occurs to me that the violatory text is still easily available from the history, so it's not as if removing it makes any odds from a legal standpoint. From a functional standpoint, I think leaving it in makes it easier for other users to confirm that the page is indeed a copyvio. When I re-wrote [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] (hopefully much clearer now), I specified that the template should just preprend the text, not replace it, but I didn't change the template to match.

(answered on user's talk page)

== Programming:C++ ==

Hi, I just noticed your failed efforts at merging the 2 books. I would like to clarify a few things.

I didn't intend the C++ book to be just an overview. [You had said: ''But enough of that, I've just thought of a different solution for these somewhat incongruous projects working together... you could have your content as in-depth examination of his overview.''] What I wanted was to deal with only standard C++ and deal with various C++ libraries, various C++ development environments, etc. in other separate books. But this is a minor point.

My main problem was Panic's obsession with multi-gigabyte pages, and his totally restructuring the talk page, removing (and not archiving) some of my proposals, and his forking of the book as well as the talk page. Also I had already mentioned using transclusions to generate gargantuan pages to Panic (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Paddu/sandbox&amp;oldid=70901]) but he didn't yet split all content into separate pages that can be transcluded in one big page.

A few other problems with Panic that I noticed earlier follow. He wasn't keen on NPOV, being subjective at times. He kept copying stuff from Wikipedia without bothering about the transwiki process, and thus violating the copyrights of the Wikipedia contributors by not making available a history of the GFDL-licensed Wikipedia text. He also kept copying stuff from other C++ books (probably GFDL'd but still the copying was without credit).

I'm not sure if any of the above problems were addressed by Panic since looking at that gargantuan page wastes my time and increases my [[m:wikistress|wikistress]].

Thanks! -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:16, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

:Let me add that one major reason I'm not working on [[Programming:C plus plus]] is to reduce the effort of merging (the other reason being don't seem to find much time to work on it, but even when I find time I work on the 'pedia and other things rather than this book to reduce the effort of merging). I really don't like having 2 forks on which different people would be adding different things, making the merge all the more difficult. It is hence unfair for Panic to say that [[Programming:C plus plus]] is the &quot;dormant&quot; fork and [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] is the &quot;active&quot; fork and hence the latter must not be merged into the former, etc.

:If it can is definite that the two books would never be merged, I would like to know so I can start working on the book. Thanks! -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 19:13, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

Hey Garrett. I noticed some edits to [[Programming:C plus plus]] in July where you said &quot;please don't use transclusions&quot; and then some comments about a merge. Since you seem to know more about this than I do, what's the story? What did you mean by no transclusions (as that would be the solution to the fork problem)? It seems going forward we should have a single C++ book. Or, perhaps two: one as a complete reference, the other as a tutorial on the basics. What are your thoughts and can you fill me in on the story? Thanks! :-) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:06, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

You might want to be a bit careful changing God to Allah. Besides, I thought the Old Testament &quot;God&quot; was the same for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - 02:11, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

== Rollback ==

I see that you are having trouble using the rollback function.;) See my talk page for a discussion Aya and I were having about it yesterday. We were thinking that a guide for new adminstartors would come in handy. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:56, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
:Indeed, Aya just pointed that out on #wikibooks. I guess it makes sense that a vandalism-oriented function doesn't revert your *own* edits, but still it makes history merging take that little bit longer... gah...

== Manual of Crime ==

Hi Garrett: I think we need to step back and ask not if the ''MoC'' is legal or useful, but if it's appropriate for the project. This sounds like something for a wikicity for me. It's not like we're a censor board, with infinite power, determining what can be on the web or not. Instead, we're just voting, What kind of books do we want in this little digital library we're making for ourselves? What would give you more pride, being part of a project that taught kids math, or being part of a project that taught kids to blow things up? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:48, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

== Restructure Christianity ==

Even this heading is thought provoking. To cater to the casual reader I restored links as before. We can flip-flop The Book and The Overview anytime. I can move The Book to The New Testament (Annotated) if the Overview takes off. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] seemed to say that Wikibooks does not want the all-inclusive Christian meeting place which would be the Overview. I propose to leave everything like it is until it cools off. WikiChristian.org is back and that may be where the casual Christian should go. It is worthwhile as well as unique, being a private initiative.  Also, TOC breaks up the background of The Book page[[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 19:34, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

== Help? ==

Garrett,

You've been very helpful with my study group page in the past and we've hit an annoying stumbling block. 
[[Wikiversity:Study_Group_For_Relativity#Help_Request.21_.28By_Jhouse_15:24.2C_25_August_2005_.28UTC.29.29 | Here's a link to our particular problem]].  If you can give any insights, it would be greatly appreciated.  [[User:Jhouse|Jhouse]]

== POMO? ==

I've seen you use the acronym &quot;POMO&quot; on the &quot;Votes for Deletion&quot; page.  What does it mean, please? [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 21:10, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity core service courses ==

Please think about adding a history course to the list of [http://education.wikicities.com/wiki/Wikiversity#Core_Courses Core Courses]. It looks like there are a few [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:NPOV_disputes&amp;from=H history articles on Wikipedia that have disputes]. Maybe a wikiversity history research project would be a good Wikiversity core &quot;course&quot; to help get Wikiversity off the ground while helping to improve some disputed Wikipedia articles. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 04:25, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Thank you for your insightful help on Wikijunior's Dinosaurs, I have almost singlehandedly written the Wikijunior Dinosaur book, but I am pleased that the spark is now begining to spread, and the book is begining to develop.  Any help recieved is much apreciated.  I just you should know this.  It appears as if other editors are jumping on board as well.  Wether or not this was just some side editing or you are going to also contribute in the future, any editing is greatly apreciated, for on Wiki everyone is truly equal, and each edit propells the book to a higher level of perfection.  Hope to come accross your path in future projects.  Peace, and may the edit be with you.  [[user:Pampaeditor|Pampaeditor]]

== Copyright status on [[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]] ==

A note on the discussion page of this module indicates that you have made an attempt to contact the copyright holder for the content on this Wikibook.  I'm just trying to check in with this and try to see if you have indeed done that and if you have recieved any comment on way or the other about the copyright status.  I'm just trying to keep up on what is happening and not to let this book slip through the cracks here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:59, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

== Wikijunior Dinosaurs ==

I can't really picture what you were talking about for the cover, so could you draw something in MS paint then? ;)--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 17:45, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks, I like it!--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 04:39, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

== master thieves ==
I thought it must be the same Garrett here :)  Nice to see you around.  Don't forget to put in an appropriate claim for your name in preparation for [[m:Unified login]] updates.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 00:22, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
: You don't actually make a claim anywhere.  I just mean, garrett is a common enough name; if you want that name rather than the longer one, once there is a unified login, you might ask to have your en: name moved. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 02:42, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

== FFII Page ==

Just so you know, the reason we don't redirect the FFII page to FFIV, going off of the U.S. numbering system, is because we want to distinguish FFII because of the final fantasy template which lists all the games in the series. In the event that we actually get a guide up and running for each game, we'd need to tell them apart.--[[User:BigCow|BigCow]] 17:40, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Re: Videogame transwikiing method ==

You mentioned the use of [[MW:MWDumper|MWDumper]] to transwiki.

Actually, what I am interested in is a way to remove guides from this wiki, Wikibooks, after transwiki. Currently, if we move a guide to Strategy Wiki or elsewhere, then it is a fork; a copy remains at Wikibooks. I would like to have a Wikibooks policy that allows us to delete these guides.

[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] already allows us to use {{tl|transwiki}} to delete stuff, but that only applies for transwikis to other Wikimedia projects. However, if most Wikibookians support it, then we can change the deletion policy to let us delete moved computer and video game guides. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

:I really see no problem in deleting pages that have been transwikied - to my mind, Jimbo's amendment to policy allows them to be deleted anyway as being outside the scope of Wikibooks (point 7 on the proposed [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]), although in practice they won't be deleted until they have been moved elsewhere. As far as the transwiki'ing point is concerned, point 4 on the proposed policy makes no references to the wiki being a WMF wiki.) I'd also be ok about allowing the book title page to contain a link through to the new location for a short while - a year, say.

:Could I ask you, however, to expand on how the process of getting the games books over to StrategyWiki would work? I have a number of questions:

::#When would it happen?
::#How long would it take?
::#How would we know what has been transwikied?
::#How would we know what the entire contents of any one book has been transwikied? (at which point we can delete the book from wikibooks)
::#How would we know what will be transwikied?
::#What would happen if the authors of a book did not want it to go to StrategyWiki?
::#Do you need help from Wikibookians, including Wikibooks admins, for the transwiki'ing to occur? If so, what?

:All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

== FF7 transwikiing - some missing pages ==

Hewwo, you're transwikiing stuff to StrategyWiki? Quite a few templates ended up being missing from StrategyWiki when FF7 wikibook went there, and all of the images of the guide as well, as well as some talk subpages... I've listed them all in [[Talk:Final Fantasy VII]]. --[[User:Wwwwolf|Wwwwolf]] 15:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

== Transwiki'ing ==

Great work so far. I hope the ones you have transferred to StrategyWiki are bedding down well. May I ask about the guides still listed at [[Wikibooks:Books possibly in contravention with WIW]]? Are you intending to move the remaining ones? I saw you instituted a personal moratorium whilst Jimbo answered some questions, but I believe he has now dealt with those issues and that it is clear all game guides have to go. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:59, 29 May 2006 (UTC)


== new user trying to help ==

Hi, 

I was looing at the '''Forth''' book and noticed that it was in the wrong location.   

Since I have spent some time on WP, WB looks familure, and I moved the book to it's new location '''Forth'''.   

I also moved the chapters from '''Programming:Forth:''' to the corrected locations and added &lt;nowiki&gt; {{vfd}}, {{Cleanup-NC}}, and #REDIRECT ((to new location)) &lt;/nowiki&gt; to the top of each page (I know that the REDIRECTS will not work, but they point that the page information was moved.  

I then added the pages to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] so that they could be deleted.

But I still have a link on [[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf]] because I can not edit that page it still points to the [[Programming:Forth]] page. If that was cleaned up, I could then add [[Programming:Forth]] to the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] page since all of the pages have been relocated to the correct spots and once that is done, I can start editing the Forth book.

I looked on the [[Help:Administrators]] for someone who looks like they are on fairly often and found you.

If you would ''please'' help me, with that last piece.

Thank you,

Imp

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:47, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

==Vandalism==

Could you do a favor for me? I need an administrator to delete part of the history of [[The Computer Revolution]]. Someone vandalised this page and the vandalism has been reverted, but they also vandalised the edit summary, so every time I look at the history of this article I see the word ____ written over and over again. I understand if you don't want to do it, you might not want to if you don't want to look at words like that. Thank you! --[[User:24.71.223.148|24.71.223.148]] 03:51, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

One more thing to smooth out the transwiki process... [[Wikibooks:Request_for_enabling_special:import#Additional_request]].

== Transwiki Special:Import question ==

Hiya, I'm trying to learn as much as I can about mediawiki for a work project. I have a running version with extensions and restricted namespaces working. I'm trying to figure out how to make it easy for users to copy a page/article from a restricted namespace to the main namespace.  The transwiki stuff is a little confusing to me, but I think some of the functionality could be adapted to what I need.  In looking at this page [[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook/Importing]], I'm trying to find the functionality displayed in the first screenshot included below.  My installation has the XML import for Special:Import, but I don't see this option anywhere or a way to configure it.  Is this a custom page you have on wikibooks? Please pardon my ignorance, especially if I am way off track even asking you about this.

Also leaving this on SB Johnny's talk page.

== Re:Help books ==

Thanks for the input on the help books, it's good to see an existing example of it, to show that it is a successful and viable idea. I think that making a &quot;help book&quot; makes amazing sense when you figure that wikibooks if full of books, and our members here are probably more familiar with writing books as well. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:39, 17 June 2007 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Master Thief Garrett. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Master Thief Garrett~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

=== Types and Values ===

The following symbols are defined by Xlib and used throughout this part of the book:

* '''Bool''' and '''Boolean''' are variable types with values ''True'' and ''False''.
* '''None''' is the ''universal null'' resource ID or atom.
* '''XID''' is used for ''generic resource IDs''.
* '''XPointer''' is used for ''generic pointers'' to data.</text>

{{:X Window Programming/TOC}}

=== Library Conventions ===

Xlib follows a number of conventions to make it easier to use and remember.

The major conventions are:

* To differentiate the X symbols from the other symbols, the library uses mixed case for external symbol names. It leaves lowercase for variables and all uppercase for user macros, as per existing convention.
* All Xlib functions, user-visible data structures, and anything that a user might dereference begins with a capital X.
* Macros and other symbols do not begin with a capital X. To distinguish them from all user symbols, each word in the macro is capitalized.
* The beginnings of all function names and symbols are capitalized.
* All elements of a data structure are in lowercase. Compound words, where needed, are constructed with underscores (_).
* The display argument, where used, is always first in the argument list.
* All resource objects, where used, occur at the beginning of the argument list immediately after the display argument.
* When a graphics context is present together with another type of resource (most commonly, a drawable), the graphics context occurs in the argument list after the other resource. Drawables outrank all other resources.
* Source arguments always precede the destination arguments in the argument list.
* The x argument always precedes the y argument in the argument list, and the width argument always precedes the height argument in the argument list.
* Where the x, y, width, and height arguments are used together, the x and y arguments always precede the width and height arguments.
* Where a mask is accompanied with a structure, the mask always precedes the pointer to the structure in the argument list.</text>

*Experiment 1: Finding the force required to move an object (static friction)
*Discuss the factors that may affect the frictional forces acting on the block (e.g. load on *the block, surface area in contact with the bench, type of the surfaces in contact …) 
*Attach a force meter to a block at rest on the bench. Pull the force meter and slowly increase *the force until the block just begins to move – record the force meter reading, tabulate data, *repeat, calculate average.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The current rule for dealing with inaccuracy in this book is to simply delete what you don't understand and to note your level of schooling and your country of origin and that you were confused in the summary box. Try to use the &quot;revert?&quot; keyword.

In other words, do not tolerate inaccuracy!

The goal of this book is to help those that want to be a Certified Java Programmer for Java version 5.0 (Tiger). The official exam name is &quot;Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 5.0&quot; (CX-310-055). People who are upgrading from old certifications with the upgrade test, CX-310-056, can use this book too.

We'll follow exactly the program laid out by Sun at this exam official site (see [[Java_Tiger_Certification#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).

For those who know Java but don't know version 5.0 yet, we recommend this Sun article: [http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/j2se15/ J2SE 5.0 in a Nutshell]. And for those who are just meeting Java technology, please consider searching the web for beginners' works.

== Exam Objectives ==

The *Exam Objectives* below, were taken from the Sun CX-310-055(56) exam page and will guide us.

=== Declarations, Initialization and Scoping ===

* Develop code that declares classes (including abstract and all forms of nested classes), interfaces, and enums, and includes the appropriate use of package and import statements (including static imports).
* Develop code that declares, initializes, and uses primitives, arrays, enums, and objects as static, instance, and local variables. Also, use legal identifiers for variable names.
* Develop code that declares both static and non-static methods, and - if appropriate - use method names that adhere to the JavaBeans naming standards. Also develop code that declares and uses a variable-length argument list.
* Given a code example, determine if a method is correctly overriding or overloading another method, and identify legal return values (including covariant returns), for the method.
* Given a set of classes and superclasses, develop constructors for one or more of the classes. Given a class declaration, determine if a default constructor will be created, and if so, determine the behavior of that constructor. Given a nested or non-nested class listing, write code to instantiate the class.

=== Flow Control ===

* Develop code that implements an if or switch statement; and identify legal argument types for these statements.
* Develop code that implements all forms of loops and iterators, including the use of for, the enhanced for loop (for-each), do, while, labels, break, and continue; and explain the values taken by loop counter variables during and after loop execution.
* Develop code that makes use of exceptions and exception handling clauses (try, catch, finally), and declares methods and overriding methods that throw exceptions.
* Recognize situations that will result in any of the following being thrown: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,ClassCastException, IllegalArgumentException, IllegalStateException, NullPointerException, NumberFormatException, AssertionError, ExceptionInInitializerError, StackOverflowError or NoClassDefFoundError. Understand which of these are thrown by the virtual machine and recognize situations in which others should be thrown programatically.

=== API Contents ===

* Develop code that uses the primitive wrapper classes (such as Boolean, Character, Double, Integer, etc.), and/or autoboxing &amp; unboxing. Discuss the differences between the String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer classes.
* Given a scenario involving navigating file systems, reading from files, or writing to files, develop the correct solution using the following classes (sometimes in combination), from java.io: BufferedReader,BufferedWriter, File, FileReader, FileWriter and PrintWriter.
* Develop code that serializes and/or de-serializes objects using the following APIs from java.io: DataInputStream, DataOutputStream, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream and Serializable.
* Use standard J2SE APIs in the java.text package to correctly format or parse dates, numbers, and currency values for a specific locale; and, given a scenario, determine the appropriate methods to use if you want to use the default locale or a specific locale. Describe the purpose and use of the java.util.Locale class.
* Write code that uses standard J2SE APIs in the java.util and java.util.regex packages to format or parse strings or streams. For strings, write code that uses the Pattern and Matcher classes and the String.split method. Recognize and use regular expression patterns for matching (limited to: . (dot), * (star), + (plus), ?, \d, \s, \w, [], ()). The use of *, +, and ? will be limited to greedy quantifiers, and the parenthesis operator will only be used as a grouping mechanism, not for capturing content during matching. For streams, write code using the Formatter and Scanner classes and the PrintWriter.format/printf methods. Recognize and use formatting parameters (limited to: %b, %c, %d, %f, %s) in format strings.

=== Concurrency ===

* Write code to define, instantiate, and start new threads using both java.lang.Thread and java.lang.Runnable.
* Recognize the states in which a thread can exist, and identify ways in which a thread can transition from one state to another.

=== OO Concepts ===

* Develop code that implements tight encapsulation, loose coupling, and high cohesion in classes, and describe the benefits.
* Given a scenario, develop code that demonstrates the use of polymorphism. Further, determine when casting will be necessary and recognize compiler vs. runtime errors related to object reference casting.
* Explain the effect of modifiers on inheritance with respect to constructors, instance or static variables, and instance or static methods.
* Given a scenario, develop code that declares and/or invokes overridden or overloaded methods and code that declares and/or invokes superclass, overridden, or overloaded constructors.

=== Collections / Generics ===

* Given a design scenario, determine which collection classes and/or interfaces should be used to properly implement that design, including the use of the Comparable interface.
* Write code that uses the generic versions of the Collections API, in particular, the Set, List, and Map interfaces and implementation classes. Recognize the limitations of the non-generic Collections API and how to refactor code to use the generic versions.
* Develop code that makes proper use of type parameters in class/interface declarations, instance variables, method arguments, and return types; and write generic methods or methods that make use of wildcard types and understand the similarities and differences between these two approaches.
* Use capabilities in the java.util package to write code to manipulate a list by sorting, performing a binary search, or converting the list to an array. Use capabilities in the java.util package to write code to manipulate an array by sorting, performing a binary search, or converting the array to a list. Use the java.util.Comparator and java.lang.Comparable interfaces to affect the sorting of lists and arrays. Furthermore, recognize the effect of the &quot;natural ordering&quot; of primitive wrapper classes and java.lang.String on sorting.

=== Fundamentals ===

* Given a code example and a scenario, write code that uses the appropriate access modifiers, package declarations, and import statements to interact with (through access or inheritance) the code in the example.
* Given the fully-qualified name of a class that is deployed inside and/or outside a JAR file, construct the appropriate directory structure for that class. Given a code example and a classpath, determine whether the classpath will allow the code to compile successfully.

I've noticed that you have been making a significant contribution to Wikibooks, that's great. But, I've also noticed that you removed the speedy deletion tag from [[Wikiversity:School of Rhetoric &amp; Composition]]. Instead of doing that, you should have added a note to under the Speedy deletion candidates heading on the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] page stating that the page had been added to after the tag was added, and no longer needed to be deleted. You may also like to create a user account, so that others can get to know you better (also, your edits won't be so closely scrutinised ;). Oh Yeah, make sure that you fill in the edit summary when you edit pages, then we know what your intentions were, and we don't have to guess (because we do make mistakes ;).</text>

This has worked well.  Create labels for clean looking files.  Buy a professional label maker and leave in plugged in.  Better yet, have two, one for work and one for home.


Hanging Files

This has worked well.  Label both the hanging file and the folder with the same name. Have one for each folder.  Put in alphabetical order.  Then if a file is removed you know exactly what is missing and where to put it when found.

==Introduction==
'''Dog meat''' refers to edible parts and the flesh derived from (predominantly domestic) dogs. Human consumption of dog meat has been recorded in many parts of the world, including ancient China, ancient Mexico, and ancient Rome.

The eating of dogs has been recommended by officials as a means of dealing with the rampant breeding of the stray animals. In Malaysia the Deputy Directorgeneral of the Veterinary Services Department (DVS) has stated that stray dogs held at pounds should be sold for human consumption as a method of stray management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.thestar.com.my/permalink.asp?id=29513 Eat the dogs in the pounds, says Deputy DG of Vet. Services Malaysia] ([http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.thestar.com.my%2Fpermalink.asp%3Fid%3D29513&amp;date=2011-06-13 Webcitation Archive]), The Sun [Malaysia], March 7 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmail.com.my/content/30043-why-not-eat-dogs 'Why Not Eat Dogs?'] ([http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmmail.com.my%2Fcontent%2F30043-why-not-eat-dogs&amp;date=2011-06-13 Webcitation Archive]), by Darshini Kandasamy, The Malay Mail&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, unofficial dog-collectors collect roughly 30,000 free-roaming strays for export to Vietnam, sparing the country the economic problems of the issue - no overcrowded cells full of animals packed closely together or expensive chambers with no other purpose than to kill animals with meat being wastefully incinerated, but instead turn it into a trade with economic benefit. 

Thailand's Nakhon Phanom province police chief, Maj. Gen. Panamporn Eithiprasert - who claims the highest volume of narcotic seizures in the region - has said &quot;Yes, we could catch dogs. But then they’d become our burden. If someone else collects them, isn’t that a good thing? With drugs, even a small amount can ruin lives. With illegal immigrants, they take jobs from Thais. But stray dogs? Is anyone taking something from us that we value?&quot;&lt;ref name=globalpost&gt;[http://globalpost.com/dispatch/thailand/091123/eating-dogs Eating Dogs], GlobalPost, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor of Baan Pehng province in Thailand compared dog collectors to dustmen in a 2007 Thai TV documentary, saying &quot;Society says those who trade dogs are low-lifes. But I’m a politician and I say it’s an honest business. It’s like selling garbage to foreigners for a profit.&quot;&lt;ref name=globalpost&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, the city's Animal Health Agency head, Phan Xuan Thao, called for greater regulations to ensure dog meat safety, such as ensuring they &quot;must have a clear origin&quot;, be &quot;vaccinated against rabies and other diseases and quarantined 15 days before being slaughtered&quot; on 19 July 2010 in Thanh Nien Weekly, however Vietnam's Inf.VN news network said &quot;the regulations await action from central authorities and the industry in currently remains largely unregulated&quot;.&lt;ref name=Info.VN&gt;[http://en.www.info.vn/society/facts/8645-hcmc-official-calls-for-regulation-on-dog-meat-trade-.html HCMC official calls for regulation on dog meat trade] ([http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.www.info.vn%2Fsociety%2Ffacts%2F8645-hcmc-official-calls-for-regulation-on-dog-meat-trade-.html&amp;date=2011-06-13 Webcitation Archive]), Info.VN, 26 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study by Vietnam's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology showed that 20 percent of sick dogs tested in Hanoi area slaughterhouses tested positive for rabies.&lt;ref name=Info.VN&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In early June 2010, officials from the Hanoi Department of Health closed dozens of dog restaurants and slaughterhouses in Hoai Duc and Ha Dong districts after samples of dog meat tested positive for cholera.&lt;ref name=Info.VN&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korea's capital, Seoul the first ever health inspection of illegal dog meat restaurants was launched in April 2008, with officials stating &quot;Many citizens enjoy dog meat despite the ban. But there have been no hygiene regulations on their slaughter and trade because dogs are not classed as livestock&quot;.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hAGzf2UZcwJmalEggDHdZ08WFiyA Seoul dog meat eateries face first hygiene crackdown] ([http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fafp.google.com%2Farticle%2FALeqM5hAGzf2UZcwJmalEggDHdZ08WFiyA&amp;date=2011-06-13 Webcitation Archive]), Associated Free Press, 13 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The city government has proposed reclassifying dogs as livestock so it can set food safety standards but the proposal sparked angry reactions from animal rights activists, who staged street protests and launched online signature campaigns.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Free Press has stated &quot;slaughtering and processing is carried out in dirty environments and poses a risks to diners' health&quot; and that the reason for driving the trade underground was &quot;to avoid adverse [Western] publicity before the 1988 Olympics.&quot;&lt;ref name=afp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{XWarning|Killing dogs may infringe religious dictates or even be illegal in some jurisdictions, especially if done outside of a supervision center that can perform the killing humanely and attest for the meat quality and sanitation (dogs can transmit rabies). Eating the animal may lead to vitamin poisoning that is potentially fatal.}}

'''Anjing Panggang''' is a specialty from Eastern Indonesia and Southern Philippines and other countries.

== Ingredients ==

=== Meat ===
* Small or Medium-sized [[cookbook:dog|dog]]

=== Marinade ===
* 1 cup [[cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]]
* 3 tbsp [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 6 cloves [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], crushed
* 20 spicy [[cookbook:Chili Pepper|Thai pepper]]s
* 3 [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, puréed
* 3 cups [[cookbook:lemon|lemon]] juice

== Procedure == 
# First kill the dog as humanely as possible. To verify if the dog is dead you can cut the tendon between two of the digital pads of a paw and check for a response.
# Burn off the fur over hot charcoal.
# Carefully remove the skin while still warm and set aside for later. (It may be used in other recipes.)
# Remove the entrails and cut dog up into sections, about 12 to 16 large pieces. 
# In a food processor, mix all the marinade ingredients together. Put dog pieces into this marinade in a large container, then let it sit for at least 2 hours.
# Put dog pieces on a charcoal grill, cover and let it burn over warm coals. Flip and baste occasionally for about 1 hour or until meat is tender.

Serves 12

A vegan cheese that mainly consists of potato, oil and soy.

==Ingredients==

[[Image:Bfast2005_vegan_cheese_2.jpg|frame|right|Vegan cheese]]

*[[cookbook:Potato|mashed potatoes]] (5 large, hard boiling potatoes, 750g - 1kg) (or potato starch)
*[[cookbook:Corn Flour|corn flour]] (or [[Cookbook:breading|breading]] mixture, Paniermehl)
*[[cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] (20ml) or [[Cookbook:Yeast extract|yeast extract]]
*optional:
**[[cookbook:salt|salt]] or celery salt
**Bear's garlic, [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], any other [[cookbook:herbs|herbs]], e.g. [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]], [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:rosemary|rosemary]], [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]] and [[Cookbook:savory|savory]]
**[[cookbook:onion|onion]]s
**seasoning mix (corn flour, salt, [[cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]], onion, garlic, paprika, [[cookbook:MSG|sodium glutamate]]), or Mexican Taco Seasoning Mix
**seasoning mix &quot;Chili&quot; (1-3g), e.g., chilies, [[cookbook:Orange|orange]] [[Cookbook:zest|zest]], [[cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame]], paprika, traces: [[cookbook:celery|celery]] and [[cookbook:mustard|mustard]].
**[[cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]] (1-5g) (salt, yeast extract, corn flour, [[cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sun flower oil]], onions, [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, spices, [[cookbook:parsley|parsley]]) (commercially available)
**[[cookbook:Sugar|unrefined sugar]] (or sugar not refined using the char method)
**[[cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
**[[cookbook:rice|rice]]
**[[cookbook:popcorn|popcorn]]
**[[cookbook:Rapeseed Oil|rapeseed oil]] or other [[cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] (20ml)
**[[cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]] (10ml)
**[[Cookbook:agar|agar]] (that wasn't very successful, it didn't change consistency much)

==Procedure==
#[[cookbook:Boil|Boil]] potatoes until they are not quite done. If the potatoes are not completely done the resulting substance may be sliceable, although it will be easy to spread anyway.
#Take the mashed potatoes and add soy sauce and yeast extract generously and mix it with some margarine and/or some rapeseed oil. Some corn flour, breading mixture or wheat flour help to make the substance drier and, in case of corn flour, add significantly to the taste. (soy flour is unsuitable here due to its taste). A small amount of lecithin powder can be added as an emulgator but is not really necessary. It it's healthy and, being hydrophilic and lipophilic, it binds together the water and the oil.
#Mix the ingredients. The substance should take on the consistency of [[cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]] but have more the color of cheese than anything else.
#The taste isn't yet close to cheese but getting closer. Corn flour, either in a seasoning mix or just plain corn flour gets us closer to cheese now. If you add enough seasoning mix the color will be much closer to peanut butter now but you may opt to leave away the seasoning mix altogether and just add corn flour, separately or with the vegetable stock. Adding cumin is also highly recommended. Another alternative is the Chili season mix, which can also be combined with other spices, for example vegetable stock, sugar and cumin. Vinegar may increase durability in the refrigerator but more than 4 days are not recommended.
#You can add bear's garlic, garlic, onions and/or any herbs you like (e.g., fresh thyme) to the cheese. A pinch of sugar can add to the taste but may not be compatible with all other spices.
#Fill the substance into a small, round form, to give it the form of a cheddar cheese.

[[Image:Bfast2005_vegan_cheese.jpg|frame|right|Vegan cheese with rice]]

==Variant with rice==

In the variant with rice about half (up to two thirds) of the base substance is replaced by mashed rice. The advantage of mashed rice is that it results in a more cheese like substance, which dries better.

==Variant with vegetable stock==

The variant with vegetable stock can be made with less soy sauce. Mexican Taco Seasoning Mix can be used but is not required, because the vegetable stock is already very spicy. The variant can be combined with rice.

==Variant with vegan cheese sauce==

A dairy free cheese flavor sauce mix can be suitable to acquire a stronger cheese flavor.

==Freezing==

Freezing is not recommended. There was a single case where freezing seemed to even have improved the consistency (making it a bit like tofu) but this lacks reproducibility.

== Best served ==

=== With tomato, basil and garlic ===

Best served slightly heated (e.g., on a solar oven) on [[Cookbook:Ciabatta|ciabatta]] with a splash of warm [[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive]] or rapeseed oil, mixed with a mashed clove of garlic and with a slice of [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]] and a leaf of [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]].

=== With onions and grapes ===

Put the cheese on a slice of bread and sprinkle hackled onions on top. Bake in a toaster oven or [[cookbook:grilling|grill]] until the onions turn only slightly glassy. [[cookbook:Grape|Grapes]] cut in halves make a good topping and complement the taste.

*[[cookbook:tofu|tofu]] (250g)
*1 (or more) [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]](s)
*1 (or more) [[cookbook:Paprika|paprika]](s) (may substitute with [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red bell peppers]], [[Cookbook:Pepperoncini|sweet peppers]])
*1 (or more) [[cookbook:onion|onion]](s)

*[[cookbook:Ketchup|catsup]]
*[[cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
*[[cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
*[[w:Soy lecithin|soy lecithin powder]]

==Procedure==
# Take equal amounts of oat flakes and tofu and mix the two ingredients and some water for the base substance. The recommended amount is about 250g of both. You might want to add lecithin powder as an emulsifier. 
# Mash (at least) one carrot, one paprika and one onion. If you prefer larger pieces you can also cut some of it instead.
# Add a spoon of margarine and/or a spoon of rapeseed oil, or any other vegetable oil.
# Add mustard, catsup, garlic and pepper to taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Should the bay leaf really be ground up with the salt and left in the broth, or should it be boiled with the rice and later retrieved?--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 17:57, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Your guess was correct. Do not eat the bay leaf. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:48, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:I always leave the bay leaves in. They're so common in LA cooking that most people know not to eat them. If I'm cooking for non-LA people, I remove them before serving -- no need to grind them. [[User:Alainna|Alainna]] 05:27, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

::Assuming people know what is safe or not in a recipe in a cookbook is not only amaturish, it's dangerous.

==Cooked chicken==
Shouldnt cooking the chicken be part of steps as you dont usually have cooked chicken as part of the ingredients. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:202.53.198.100|202.53.198.100]] ([[User talk:202.53.198.100|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.53.198.100|contribs]]) 2007-02-09T10:50:33.&lt;/small&gt;
:Perhaps, but cooked chicken is something that may be a leftover from another meal, such as a roast chicken dinner. Cooking for two, I often have leftover cooked meat from roasts, which are great for meals like this as well as simple wrap-based foods like [[Cookbook:Summer Roll|summer rolls]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
::Caveat: if you seasoned said chicken the first time you cooked it, the seasoning will flavor the jambalaya. I agree with the person asking about the cooking method. While jambalaya was originally designed to be a raft of leftovers, adding lemon chicken to your jambalaya would be rather gross.

==Peppers==
You didn't complete the trinity in the recipe. This needs some chopped red bell peppers. Jambalaya is the hallmark when you're describing the cajun holy trinity. Not including the red bell pepper is blasphemous.</text>

{{block|ta=left|background=linen|ff=inherit|fs=1em|&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Wikitext&lt;/h2&gt;
*'''This page introduces Wikitext.'''   Wikitext is used to write all of the pages in Wikibooks and is the markup language used for all of the sister projects as well.   Wikitext is intended to be simpler to use than other alternatives.   This simple markup script is translated into the web's HTML language by the software before sending it to each browser.   

*'''Wikitext can be ''mixed'' with HTML,'''  and users can add CSS in-line styles, as well as the usual complement of images, tables and other structures.

*'''Templates can be produced to make the work ''easier,''''' and there is a large store of these already available.  Templates described in these pages work only within ''Wikibooks'' pages; the template set for ''Wikipedia'' does not necessarily include these features.       

*'''Work is ''credited'' to users in their user-names,''' and log-in names can be chosen with the link at the top-right of any Wikibooks page.

*'''Wikibooks is an ''open'' system.'''   It is used free of charge.   Any user can edit pages in Wikibooks, and its mandate is to encourage collaboration in producing written work.   This arrangement does not suit everyone, so the matter needs consideration before making a heavy work commitment.   Some core texts ''are'' protected against editing, though these are comparatively few.

*'''Stable good-quality versions''' of some pages are presented to casual surfers, while other versions of each, to edit, are available to logged-on users.   Reviewers patrol the edits from day to day and update the stable copies of such pages after approving them.  Many pages however, can be edited directly, without review.}}
{{block|background=floralwhite|ta=left|ff=inherit|&lt;h2&gt;How a Page is Made&lt;/h2&gt;
*'''The general method in ''editing'' a page''' is fairly simple.   In summary, the user signs on with a free password and user name, then, on the page of interest, selects the ''edit this page'' tab.   The user is then presented with an editing window that resembles a fairly ordinary word processor.   The text is edited to change the wording, to add images or tables, and at times to introduce additional styles for text and layout.

*'''The method for making a ''new'' page''' is also simple.   A summary of the methods to use for starting a new page can be found at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Pages '''Help Pages''']. 
   
*'''The work can be ''checked'' for its appearance''' by selecting ''Show preview.''   The preview page is then redrawn with an up-to-date version for the user's approval.   When the work is to the user's satisfaction, the new page is saved by pressing ''Save page.''   If ''more'' than one user is changing the same parts of the page, screens are presented to allow the conflict to be resolved.

*'''Saved versions of the page are ''stored''''' and can be viewed via the ''history'' tab on each page.   Previous versions may be restored from these lists.   In addition, there are various pages dedicated to each user for notes, preferences, and so on.}} 
{{block|background=lavenderblush|ta=left|ff=inherit|&lt;h2&gt;More General Points&lt;/h2&gt;
*'''There is a house ''style.'' '''  At the most general level, there are [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|'''guidelines''']] on writing style. The web-page styles however, are provided by Wiki's style sheets, of which there are several.   Within these are to be found the style rules for all Wiki work.   The user ''cannot'' modify these, since changes would affect everybody, but on an optional basis, each user ''can'' have a style sheet of their own that affects only ''their own'' browsers.   Most find no need for it.   Although the house style sheets cannot be user-modified, ''in-line styles'' can still be applied within the Wikitext itself. 

*'''There is no house ''font.'' as such '''  Pages are displayed with entirely ''relative'' font-sizing, and a ''sans-serif'' font.  As such, pages can be scaled with browser zoom and font settings.

*'''There is an ''automatically'' made table of contents (TOC).'''  Each page has a table of contents (TOC) that is updated automatically using the typed section headings.   The markup code is used to identify certain text as headings, and the software does the rest.   The TOC also lists headings created with HTML code, though its use is optional.   An example of listed headings can be seen on this page. 

*'''The white-space around words and punctuation is ''parsed.''''' This means that it is filtered so that it conforms with the browsers' rules.   At a practical level, it makes sure that there is never more than one space following a comma or a full stop.   It ignores a single carriage return, requiring two of these to signify a new paragraph.  The software will do all of the wrapping of text on the page.   This is called ''un-formatted'' text.  

*'''There are HTML-like tags that ''preserve'' white-space.'''   Text that benefits from their use is called ''pre-formatted'' text and is fairly heavily set with spacing and line breaks.   Examples are lyrics, poetry, and code listings.   The aptly named ''poem'' tags or the ''pre'' tags can be used to display text exactly as it is typed.   To display a pre-formatted code module, there are ''source'' tags that also color the code. 

*'''Refer to the links in the top panel''' for the various '''Editing Wikitext''' pages.  

*'''Refer to the links below''' for additional sources on editing.}}

WO is a free Java framework for developing Internet applications. WO supports Rapid Application Development (RAD) of Ajax, web services, streaming media, file transfers, and many other web technologies. WO was originally developed by and for NeXT computers in the mid 1990's. Originally written in Objective C, NeXT ported it to Java in the late 1990's.

WO has an active [http://www.wocommunity.org/ developer community] which provides support through the [http://lists.apple.com/archives/Webobjects-dev WO Developer] and [http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-deploy WO Deployment] email lists. New developers may also find the [http://wiki.wocommunity.org/display/WO/Home WO Community Wiki] helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapter 16. Laboratory Exercises: Grasses ==

As you have already seen, the purpose of a laboratory exercise is to give the student hands-on experience with botanical methods and materials.  To do this laboratory exercise, although not absolutely necessary (photos are provided), you should collect material from outside&amp;mdash;in this case, one or more species of grasses&amp;mdash;to examine as you read the text. You should easily identify a grass plant, but you will want to collect a plant (we call this a specimen) that is in flower.  Try to collect a whole specimen&amp;mdash;that's correct, roots and all. A lawn grass may not be the best choice, but if you can find a tuft with a flower head, then that will suffice. It is best to work from fresh material, so if it be the case that it is the dead of winter, we suggest you may want to repeat this lab late in the spring or summer. However, we provide here a scanned specimen that you can examine very closely by down-loading the high resolution version (click on the photo, then follow link at bottom of image).   
[[Image:Paspalum scan.jpg|300px|left|Grass plant specimen]]

&lt;big&gt;&lt;==&lt;/big&gt; A collected specimen (grass) folded over and scanned to display all of a culm. Note that the culm terminates in an inflorescence and is actually one of two stems&amp;mdash;the other, with but one leaf, is just elongating&amp;mdash;arising at a prominent node along a stolon.  Several roots are starting to form at the same node.

The only meanings in Chambers 20thC, Oxford Paperback and those listed on OneLook are to the effect of a sugary confection (though it's a rather old-fashioned term), plus this entry in OPTED:

* ''(n.)'' A boat shell (Crepidula fornicata) of the American coast.
* ''(n.)'' Fruit preserved with sugar, as peaches, pears, melons, nuts, orange peel, etc.; -- usually in the plural; a confect; a confection.

: &quot;Other beef foods include the tongue, which is used, sliced, for sandwiches; tripe from the stomach; the thymus glands of calves known as sweetbread; the tender testicles of the bull, often called as beef balls or sweetmeat; the brain, used in the fried brain sandwich; the liver, used in liver and onions; and so on.&quot; from [http://www.stargeek.com/buy-steaks-online.php here].

::That's actually a Google spam page violating copyright by stealing from wikibooks. The term &quot;sweetmeat&quot; does indeed mean testicles though, no joke. If old British usage matters, all food is meat... even a tomato. (''see also: mincemeat'') This won't do I think; it would mean that vegans only eat meat! If you ask an american if organ meats are meat, you'll probably get a funny look and a vague answer like &quot;uh... kind of... maybe... but not really&quot;. I'd say yes for the heart and gizzard, but no for everything else. I think it's safest to just leave this vague. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:49, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

::: It is indeed a spam page, but which wiki-books/pedia page is it ripping off? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

I rv'd changes since I believe the intention was that it was _organ_ meat (i.e. not muscle tissue, normally considered &quot;meat&quot;). The change was done by an ip-account and was unexplained. Also see [[w:Meat]]'s note about americans not considering &quot;organ meat&quot; to be meat. Perhaps this is a US-centric bias that should be dealt with, but that should explain my change. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:04, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

I can see I'll not be referencing any wiki cookbooks.  As user smjg correctly points out, sweetmeat is a sweet confection such as a preserve or pastry.  Until multiple references to sweetmeat as testicles are found, I suggest the entry say that. If you find it mandatory to continue the testicle reference, it should be noted &quot;a few sources&quot; refer to sweet . . .&quot; after the common useage as sweet treats.

==Introduction==
===Icon - What is this?===
Icon is a modern high-level programming language. It provides many useful features for managing data, generators and much more. It is not object-oriented, but the UN-icon variant, [[Unicon (programming language)|UNICON]], is object-oriented as is ObjectIcon (code.google.com/p/objecticon)

===Hello world===
Here is a tiny but complete Icon program.

 procedure main()
   write(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
 end

As you see, the code is very simple. Lines '''procedure main()''' and '''end''' enclose the body of the program. The second line is responsible for printing ''Hello world!'' on your standard output (usually screen). Naturally, procedure '''write''' prints the string which is given as a parameter. There is a similar procedure '''read''' which reads a line from standard input (usually keyboard).

===Compiling and running===
Save the program from the previous section to file ''helloworld.icn''. Type
 icont helloworld.icn
in linux shell. The executable file named ''helloworld'' will be generated. You can run it now.

==Basic syntax==
The program consists of procedures. Every procedure begins with '''procedure''' reserved word followed by the name of the procedure and list of arguments (it can be empty). The procedure ends with '''end'''. All the instructions are separated by newline or semicolon.

There must be a '''main''' procedure which is called automatically when user runs the program.

 procedure p1(arg1, arg2, arg3)
   instr1
   instr2
 end
 
 procedure p2()
   instr1; instr2
 end
 
 procedure main(arg)
   instr1
   instr2
   instr3
 end

If you want to put a comment into your code, use ''#'' character. All the text in the line after that character is discarded by the compiler.

==Variables==
===About variables in Icon===
Variables in Icon have no type and can contain value of any data type. That means you can for example assign a number to one of your variables and assign a string to it few instructions later.

There is no need to declare variables (except global ones), they are created when they are used for the first time. There is no need to destroy them too, because there is a garbage collector doing it automatically.

===Assigning value to variable===
To assign value to variable use Pascal-like ''':=''' operator:

 procedure main()
   x := 1                     # assigns 1 to variable x
   y := 3                     # assigns 3 to variable y
   x := x + y                 # assigns 4 (1+3) to variable x
   y := &quot;example string&quot;      # assigns string &quot;example string&quot; to variable y
 end

===Global variables===

==Numbers==

==Strings==
===Introduction to strings in Icon===
A string is a sequence of characters. You can easily put string constants into your code, enclosing them with pair of '''&quot;''' characters. For example:
 str := &quot;abcdefgh&quot;
will create a string constant containing 8 characters and assign this string to str variable.

===Accessing characters and substrings===
Characters in strings are indexed in a very convenient way. As in Pascal, 1 points to the place before the first character, 2 to the place between the first and the second etc. Unlike many other languages, strings are indexed from the end too. 0 points to the place after the last character, -1 to the place before the last character, etc.

[[Image:Programming-Icon string indexing.png]]

To access the part of the string you want, use the brackets '''[ ]''' operator:
* ''variablename'''''['''''from''''':'''''to''''']'''
* ''variablename'''''['''''index''''']'''
The first method returns a substring placed between points pointed by ''from'' and ''to''. If you place only one number in the brackets, it is equivalent to ''variablename'''''['''''index''''':'''''index''+1''']'''.

 str := &quot;sample string&quot;
 str[1:7] := &quot;SAMPLE&quot;    # str := &quot;SAMPLE string&quot;
 str[3] := &quot;m&quot;           # str := &quot;SAmPLE string&quot;
 write(str[8:0])         # write(&quot;string&quot;)

===Special characters===
===Operators===
* '''*'''''str'' - produces the length of ''str''
* '''?'''''str'' - produces the random one-character substring of ''str''
* '''!'''''str'' - generates the sequence of one-character substrings of ''str''
* ''str1'' '''||''' ''str2'' - concatenates two strings: 
 str := &quot;Hello&quot; || &quot; &quot; || &quot;world&quot;       # str := &quot;Hello world&quot;
 str ||:= &quot;!&quot;                           # str := &quot;Hello world!&quot;
* strings case-sensitively comparison:
** ''str1'' '''==''' ''str2'' - produces ''str2'' if those strings are equal, fails otherwise
** ''str1'' '''~==''' ''str2'' - produces ''str2'' if those strings are not equal, fails otherwise
** ''str1'' '''&lt;&lt;''' ''str2'' - produces ''str2'' if it is greater than ''str1'', fails otherwise
** ''str1'' '''&lt;&lt;=''' ''str2'' - produces ''str2'' if it is greater or equal than ''str1'', fails otherwise
** ''str1'' '''&gt;&gt;''' ''str2'' - produces ''str2'' if it is less than ''str1'', fails otherwise
** ''str1'' '''&gt;&gt;=''' ''str2'' - produces ''str2'' if it is less or equal than ''str1'', fails otherwise
* ''str'' '''?''' ''expr'' - sets ''str'' as '''&amp;subject''' for ''expr'' expression

===String scanning===

==Lists==
===Overview of lists===
Lists are similiar to strings, although they are able to contain much more various data. Like strings, lists are indexed from the beginning and from the end (read the [[#Accessing characters and substrings|Accessing characters and substrings]] section related to strings).

===List creation===
You can create list constants enclosing its elements with brackets and separating them with ''',''' character. For example:
 lst := [1, &quot;hello&quot;, 44]
creates three-element list constant and assigns it to the ''lst'' variable. To create empty list do not put anything between brackets:
 lst := []                     # lst value is now an empty list

There is a special function for creating lists of desired length:
* '''list''' (''i'',''x'')
''i''-element list is created and all its elements are initialized with ''x'' value. By default ''i'' is 0 and ''x'' is '''&amp;null'''.
 list(5, 7)            # [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
 list(3, &quot;text&quot;)       # [&quot;text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;]
 list(6)               # [&amp;null, &amp;null, &amp;null, &amp;null, &amp;null, &amp;null]
 list()                # []

===Operators===
===Arrays===
There are no arrays in Icon. Use lists instead. If you need multi-dimensional arrays, use lists of lists.
 matrix := list(3)                # makes a list of 3 rows
 every !matrix := list(5, 0)      # each a different list of 5 zeroes
 matrix[2][4] +:= 5               # adds 5 to the element
                                  # in 2nd row and 4th column 
 every write(!!matrix)            # writes all the elements

===Stack and queue===
Very useful functions are given to manage stacks and queues as lists.
* '''push'''(''list'', ''elem'') - adds ''elem'' to the ''list'' list at its beginning.
* '''pop'''(''list'') - produces the first element of ''list'' and removes it from ''list'' or fails if ''list'' is empty.
* '''put'''(''list'', ''elem'') - adds ''elem'' to the end of ''list''.
* '''get'''(''list'') - produces the first element of ''list'' and removes it from ''list'' or fails if ''list'' is empty, it is identical to '''pop'''.
* '''pull'''(''list'') - produces the last element of ''list'' and removes it from ''list'' or fails if ''list'' is empty.

 queue := []                      # creates an empty queue
 put(queue, 1)                    # puts 1 into the queue
 put(queue, &quot;it is a string&quot;)     # puts &quot;it is a string&quot; into the queue
 write(get(queue))                # writes 1
 write(get(queue))                # writes &quot;it is a string&quot;
                                  # queue is now empty
 stack := []                      # creates an empty stack
 put(stack, 1)                    # puts 1 into the stack
 put(stack, &quot;it is a string&quot;)     # puts &quot;it is a string&quot; into the stack
 write(get(stack))                # writes &quot;it is a string&quot;
 write(get(stack))                # writes 1
                                  # stack is now empty
 write(*queue)                    # writes length of the queue

==Characters sets==

==Tables==

==Record types==
===Record type declaration===
To declare record type use '''record''' reserved word, for example:
 '''record''' ''person''(''firstname'', ''lastname'', ''age'')
===Construction of the record variable===

When you declare a record, a constructor for it is defined automatically. A constructor is a procedure, which arguments are initial values for record fields and returns the created record. The constructor 's name is the same as record's.

 '''record''' ''person''(''firstname'', ''lastname'', ''age'')      # declaration of ''person'' record
 jd := ''person''(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Doe&quot;, 47)              # create and assign record value

===Operators===
* ''rec''.''fieldname'' - produces a value of the ''fieldname'' field of the ''rec'' record
* *''rec'' - produces a number of fields of the ''rec'' record
* ?''rec'' - produces a value of a random field of the ''rec'' record
* !''rec'' - generates values of all fields of the ''rec'' record

==Procedures==
A procedure which forms part of the Icon language is conventionally referred to as a &quot;function&quot;.
A function which is added by the user as part of a program are referred to as a &quot;procedure&quot;.
A procedure may have a return value by preceding an identifier with the reserved word &quot;return&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
#example of the use of the reserved word return
procedure ex-ret(var1, _Var2)
b := &quot;a_proc succeeded&quot;
if a_proc(var1) then return b else c_proc(_Var2)
end
&lt;/source&gt;

==Generators==
Generators, which are so fundamental to newer languages such as Ruby and Python, were first used in ICON shortly after CLU.

==Goal-directed execution==
Many ICON expressions are called &quot;conditional expressions&quot; and their evaluation results in success or failure.
Three important examples are 
  read(res) 
  find( Str_target, Str_source)  
  match( Str_target, Str_source)
Comparison operators form expressions which succeed or fail such as
  write(count &gt; 0)
If count is not greater than zero then the comparison in the conditional expression fails; without an expression, the enclosing expression which is a call to the function write(), is never evaluated and in that sense, inherits the failure of the conditional expression.
By way of comparison
  b := &quot;paused&quot;
  if count &gt; 0 then b := &quot;running&quot;
  write(b)  # will write &quot;paused&quot;
Goal-directed execution is not the very basis of Icon as it is in , say, Prolog.  Icon is rather more like Oz, where backtracking is an option.  In Icon, backtracking is available, but within the limits of a particular context.
ICON also has the concept of &quot;data backtracking&quot;

----

There are two cities, one of them is called City of Lies, and the other - City of Truth. Those who were born in City of Lies always lie. Those who were born in City of Truth always tell truth. Residents of each town visit the other town from time to time, so when you ask someone a question you don't know if he would lie or not.

You are in one of these cities, and your task is to determine which city you are in by by asking a random bypasser one question. What question should you ask?

You should ask: &quot;Were you born in this city?&quot; if answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, this is the City of Truth. If &quot;No&quot; - City of Lies.

== Reasoning ==

For &quot;yes&quot; given as an answer:

If the person is honest, then the person was born in the city, so it is the city of truth

If the person is dishonest, then that person was born in the other city, so this is the city of truth

For &quot;no&quot; given as an answer:

If the person is honest, then the person was born in the other city, so this is the city of lies

If the person is dishonest, then the person is lying and was born in this city, so it is the city of lies

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Feminist Theory''' is a way of looking at the social world through the lens of gender inequality. The focus is on male and female 'power.' Feminist theory addresses the roles women have in society and the ongoing battles women face. Most importantly, this way of thinking about the social world focuses on the rights of women, including: economic, sexual, reproductive, property, and voting rights.

==Detailed Discussion==
===Assumptions===
Scientific assumptions are taken-for-granted truths about the world that do not need to be confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chafetz1978&quot;&gt;Chafetz, Janet Saltzman. 1978. Primer on the Construction and Testing of Theories in Sociology. F.E. Peacock Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Assumptions serve as the building blocks of theories.  Although many flavors of Feminist Theory exist, there are some similar key assumptions.  Riley (1999)&lt;ref name=“Riley”&gt;Riley, Nancy E. 1999. “Challenging Demography: Contributions from Feminist Theory.” Sociological Forum 14(3):369-397.&lt;/ref&gt; lists three:
*gender is an organizing principle of all societies
*gender is a social construction
*gender theory necessarily involves the politics of inequality

Chafetz (1997)&lt;ref name=“Chafetz1997”&gt;Chafetz, Janet Saltzman. 1997. &quot;Feminist Theory and Sociology: Underutilized Contributions for Mainstream Theory.&quot; Annual Review of Sociology. 23:97-120.&lt;/ref&gt; adds a fourth assumption:
*men and women think differently

===Concepts===
[[w:Concepts|Concepts]] are the building blocks of theory.  They are cognitive units of meaning— abstract ideas or mental symbols sometimes defined as &quot;units of knowledge.&quot;  There are a number of key concepts in Feminist Theory.  While [[w:social movements|social movements]] and [[w:protests|protests]] are often associated with feminism, there are other, more central concepts, like: gender, politics, power, violence, and the [[w:division of labor|division of labor]]. Each of these is discussed in turn below.

====Gender====
&quot;Studying gender means learning about both men and women because of their interdependent nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;&gt;Peterson, Spike and Runyan, Anne. 1993. Global Gender Issues.&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|page number?}} Unlike sex, gender is learned.  Gender is reflected in [[w:masculinity|masculine]] and [[w:femininity|feminine]] identities.  Cultures differ in what it means to be masculine or feminine, illustrating that these identities are socially constructed and learned. &quot;(These characteristics) are defined in oppositional relation to each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}} For example, men who display emotions are considered weak in the United States and are ascribed feminine qualities. In contrast, women who display determination are considered to be masculine. Feminist theorists point out that the responses to men and women crossing gender lines differ. &quot;If a woman achieves success, she is applauded but men who enter in traditional female arenas are often treated with suspicion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}} By dressing up in a pantsuit or acting like males, females are breaking the stereotype of women since they are perceived to be chasing an unattainable dream. &quot;They are attempting to improve their status by 'moving up' and aiming for something valued.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}} Men who act like women are &quot;moving down&quot; the social ladder. This suggests that male reputations depend heavily on negative female stereotypes.

====Politics====
A place where women are not completely absent but rarely found is in [[w:politics|politics]]. Women are underrepresented in political institutions in most countries, though women do seem to be increasing their rates of participation in many of these countries.  However, even when women do gain entry into politics they tend to be concentrated in positions with less power and lower prestige. This is suggestive of the [[w:glass ceiling|glass ceiling]] effect, which basically argues that women rarely ascend to the top of social hierarchies, bumping into an invisible, glass ceiling (some unstated boundary) that keeps them from moving into the upper echelons of power. &quot;This is confirmed by studies that find a strong correlation between percentages of women in legislative bodies and in ministerial positions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}}  Women in those occupations are typically found at the bottom of the hierarchy, not the top. According to Peterson and Runyon, &quot;gender socialization, situational constraints and structural obstacles interact in discriminating against women in political office.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}}

Given the power of politics and politicians, the low levels of female participation in politics maintains their secondary status in society.  Of course, it is women's lack of power that continues to prevent them from gaining power, resulting in a self-reinforcing process of limited access to power preventing the attainment of power.  Women are underrepresented in politics within nations, but also in international relations where women are generally not taken seriously (though see [[w:Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] and [[w:Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]] as prominent exceptions).  Historically, nations have limited women's participation in politics through formal means, &quot;States do this by limiting citizenship to those who perform military duty and/or are property owners.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}}  Such restrictions were argued to be rooted in biological differences between men and women,&lt;ref name=&quot;Domovan&quot;&gt;Donovan, Josephine. 1985. Feminist Theory. Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; claims now known to be wholly without merit.

====Military====
&quot;Conventional definitions of power stress that to have power, to exercise control over others, one must have certain resources at one’s disposal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1993&quot;/&gt;{{fact|page number?}} In a male dominated world that means having strength. Engaging in aggressive behavior, such as military action, suggests to onlookers that the person engaged in such behavior is powerful. At present in the U.S. military, there is a gendered division of labor - women are not allowed to fight on the front lines but are, instead, relegated to subordinate and support roles. This gendered division of labor is often justified with claims like, the following, 'Since women are perceived to be &quot;life-givers,&quot; it is hard to visualize them as life-takers.'  This argument suggests women are not innately violent. Another argument given for the gendered division of labor in the military is that the presence of women on the battlefield will serve as a distraction to men, leading men to focus on sexual rather than military conquest. While ultimately hurting women by removing their power, this justification actually suggests that men are the ones with the problem - an inability to focus on the war effort.  A third justification for this division of labor is that men feel a compulsion to protect women, both on and off the battlefield.  If men are fixated on protecting women at all costs, they will be less effective as soldiers. Thus, while women participate in the military supporting the soldiers and work for defense contractors building the weapons of war, they are prohibited from actually fighting.  As a result, women are disempowered; they are unable to actually exert control over others.

====Division of Labor====
The division of labor in society between men and women is rooted in women’s biological ability to reproduce.  Since women can have children and do most of the child care in most societies, it is assumed that they are automatically more nurturing than are men. In contrast, men are cast as &quot;providers&quot; for women and children and are only considered to be &quot;working&quot; if they are engaged in &quot;productive labor. While many people accept this gendered division of labor as a fact of life today, labor has not always been thusly divided as, during more agrarian times and in largely agrarian economies today women work alongside men on farms.  That women have taken on most of the childcare early in a child's life is not surprising given that they have historically been the primary means of sustenance for newborn children (through breastfeeding).  While breastfeeding is largely encouraged by [[w:pediatricians|pediatricians]] and [[w:dietitians|dietitians]] today and many women strive to follow those guidelines suggest a gendered division of labor will likely continue into the future.

====Religion====
Religion has been a significant contributor to the oppression of women for millenia.  For most religions, particularly monotheistic religions, God is depicted as a male and addressed as “Father”.&lt;ref name=”Reuther”&gt;Reuther, Rosemary Radford. 2007. ''Patriarchy''. Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Biblical creation story, [[w:Adam and Eve|Eve]] is created from Adam’s body, suggesting male superiority.  Eve is also often blamed for committing the &quot;[[w:original sin|original sin]]&quot; because she gave in to temptation and then persuaded Adam to sin as well (other cultures have similar notions; see [[w:Pandora's Box|Pandora's Box]]. In Christianity, God gave the world a &quot;Son&quot; to save mankind, not a daughter. Many of the prophets of [[w:Christianity|Christianity]], [[w:Judaism|Judaism]], and [[w:Islam|Islam]] are men, including [[w:Moses|Moses]] and [[w:Muhammad|Muhammad]]. The majority of religious authority figures are males, and in some religions, like [[w:Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholicism]], women are not permitted to become priests.&lt;ref name=“Winkelman”&gt; Winkelman, Michael. 2007. ''Priesthoods, Priests, and Priestesses.'' Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious institutions and their respective ideologies have contributed to patriarchal cultures around the world.  While some religions are backing away from such patriarch (e.g., [[w:Unitarian Universalists|Unitarian Universalists]], many religions are continuing to repress women.

==History==
A wave of fore runners paved the way for feminism and feminist theory, including such famous women as [[w:Cleopatra|Cleopatra]] and [[w:Queen Elizabeth|Queen Elizabeth]]. Any woman who has stood up against a patriarchal society can be considered a feminist. 

However, it was not until after World War II, with the [[w:second wave feminism|second wave of feminism]], that feminism became an organized movement and developed a corresponding theory of female empowerment, i.e., Feminist Theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2005&quot;&gt;Bonnie G, Smith. 2005. Womans History in Global Perspective Volume 1, Chicago, Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The concept of a common identity of woman was challenged by the number growing of studies of the diversity of woman. With second-wave feminism, lesbians and woman of color within the United States, and woman internationally, also challenged the notion of a homogenous category of &quot;women.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2005&quot;/&gt;

The history of women can be divided into two three strands.The first is that of Compensatory History. Compensatory History deals with instances when woman’s accomplishments are similar to those of men. For example it could be argued that the first woman to attend medical school can be similar to the first African American male to attend medical school. The second strand is Contribution History, which looks at the collective or individual work of women whom have prevailed over a patriarchal society. As mentioned, women like Cleopatra and Queen Elizabeth would fall into this type of history. Contribution History also describes fights fought by women only; such as the fight for the right to vote in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2005&quot;/&gt;  The third approach is called Histories of Gender and describes instances when women and men collaborate. Wars in which women have left their female duties and joined the fight along men equally would fall into collaborative history.  This happened during a battle in the [[w:Mexican revolution|Mexican revolution]]. Women have also disguised themselves as men in order to be taken seriously (e.g., [[w:Joan of Arc|Joan of Arc]]. Women have also, on occasion, taken on the role of men for financial reasons (e.g., &quot;[[w:male daughters|male daughters]]&quot;, who took on the role of a male son when there was no actual male son for inheritance reasons)

There are many notable individuals who have contributed to feminism and feminist theory throughout the waves of the feminist movement. These individuals were motivated by the inequalities and injustices women faced around the world. Their reasons for participating varied, but generally included a desire for economic, sexual, reproductive, property, and voting rights.  

Even before the waves of feminism began, [[w:Mary Wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraft]] proposed the idea of equality between men and women. Wollstonecraft was born in 1759, during a time when women did not receive education and were destined to be treated as inferior. Throughout her life she met many people, including many scholars who would help her to pursue her career as a writer and an activist for women. She wrote numerous books, including ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', which laid out early feminist thoughts on gender egalitarianism. In this book, she argued that women were equal to men in their intellectual and rational abilities and it was women’s lack of education that created the appearance of inferiority. This lack of education is a result of societal norms, not natural ability.  

During the [[w:first wave feminism|first wave of feminism]], which started in the late 19th Century, one of focii of women was property rights. Property rights to them included not only the right to own land or other material objects, but also the right to own themselves and their children after marriage. The focus shifted to voting rights, as well as economic and sexual rights by the end of this wave of feminism. Prominent contributors to the feminist ideology during this first wave include [[w:Margaret Sanger|Margaret Sanger]], [[w:Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[w:Susan B. Anthony|Susan B. Anthony]].

Margaret Sanger, born in 1879, was a nurse who devoted her life to creating and improving contraceptives to protect women from the harmful effects of multiple childbirths and dangerous abortions. She was one of eleven children born to Irish Catholic parents, and experienced the tragic loss of her young mother as a result of uncontrolled pregnancies and miscarriages. As a nurse in New York, Sanger cared for women who were recovering from &quot;back-alley [[w:abortions|abortions]]&quot; that were often botched. This increased her desire to discover a way to protect women with better contraceptives, in spite of the societal stigma against contraceptives during the time. Sanger was arrested multiple times during her life for her radical beliefs, including after opening a clinic devoted to providing contraceptives to women, as well as founding the American Birth Control League, which would later become known as [[w:Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood]]. Sanger was not only concerned about the well being and health of women, but she also forecasted the negative effects that would emerge as a result of uncontrolled population growth. Sanger fought for safer, more effective, and simpler methods of [[w:birth control|birth control]], a term that she coined, until the end of her life, and in fact, reached her goal of creating “the Pill” with the help of scientist Gregory Pincus.&lt;ref name=“PBS”&gt; “People &amp; Events: Margaret Sanger (1879-1966).” PBS.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Cady Stanton is best known for the [[w:Seneca Falls convention|Seneca Falls convention]] where she and several other women created the [[w:Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions|Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions]]. This declaration discussed the many inequalities between men and women, including not having the right to vote, property rights, or education rights. Shortly after this landmark convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony met and became close friends at an anti-slavery convention in Seneca Falls. The two worked together throughout their lives, Stanton as a strong speaker and brilliant writer and Anthony as a leader and organizer. Not only did they fight for [[w:suffrage|women’s suffrage]], but they also made African American suffrage a priority, before their own. Together they argued that the [[w:Fourteenth Amendment|Fourteenth]] and [[w:Fifteenth Amendment|Fifteenth Amendments]] in fact granted women the right to vote, which led to the arrests of Anthony and several other suffragists in 1972. Susan B. Anthony started and became publisher of [[w:The Revolution|The Revolution]], a journal dedicated to women’s rights.

[[w:Betty Friedan|Betty Friedan]], author of [[w:The Feminine Mystique|''The Feminine Mystique'']], is also credited with contributing to the ideas of feminism. ''The Feminine Mystique'' exposed the many issues in society that restrain women and keep them from reaching their full potential or equivalency with men. Friedan claimed that women are not fulfilled or satisfied by being only housewives and mothers, but should be challenged and stimulated by education and careers in order to thrive. Friedan also became the founder and first president of the [[w:National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women]], which is still active today in rallying for equal rights for women.&lt;ref name=“Fox”&gt; Fox, Margalit . “Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85. 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Examples==
Women have yet to reach parity with men in most of the world.  For instance, women in Saudi Arabia currently face institutionalized discrimination, in part due to laws rooted in [[w:Sharia|Sharia]]. Sharia laws are religious principles used by [[w:Muslims|Muslims]] to govern daily life. In Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed to drive or use taxis unless accompanied by a male escort. This restricts a woman’s mobility and prevents many from pursing professional development. This law makes it difficult for women to pursue education unless they have the financial resources to pay for a male family member to escort the female everywhere she goes. While it would seem like an obvious way to skirt this law would simply be to pursue education outside the country, the government has attempted to restrict that as well.  According to Suad (2001),&lt;ref name=&quot;Suad&quot;&gt;Joseph, Suad. &quot;Women and Power in the Middle East&quot; University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, PA, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the opportunity for women to study abroad brought a rule that government scholarship would go only to a woman who had a male guardian to accompany them.&quot;  These religio-cultural beliefs have the practical effect of confining women in their homes, preventing them from pursuing the education that would allow them to challenge these very beliefs. 

Gender-mixing is another oppressive practice used by the Saudi Arabian government against women. Women are not allowed to work in organizations alongside males, due to the possible sexual tension they may ignite in males. In addition, males also determine the type of employment a woman is given and therefore severely repress and restrict women's potential. The claim is that this practice protects societal mores and prevents any conflict that may arise from men's inability to control their sexual urges. Permission must also be granted by a guardian in order for women to work outside the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suad&quot;/&gt;

In India, girls are discriminated against because they are seen as a financial burden. Because men often work outside the home and make more than women, male children are more highly valued. Despite the illegality of dowry practices – gifts from the bride’s family given to the groom’s family at the time of marriage – the cultural practice continues. This increases gender bias. Infant mortality rates are higher among girls due to discriminatory childcare practices. Gender preferred abortions, while illegal, are widely practiced to prevent the birth of female babies. Feticide otherwise known as female infanticide is, &quot;the illegal termination of a female form when it is detected to be growing inside the womb, (which) results in declining sex ratio.&quot;&lt;ref name=“Ganesamurthy”&gt; Ganesamurthy,V.S. “Empowerment of India: Social, Economic, and Political.” New Century Publications. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; India’s 2001 census revealed an imbalanced sex ration among children in India.  Similar practices are common in China for the same reasons. 

Discriminatory treatment of women continues on the African continent as well. In many villages in Rwanda, girls and women are forced to remain absent from school when they are menstruating. This cultural practice  stigmatizes menstruation and is part of the cultural repertoire of many Rwandans. Additionally, sanitary pads are heavily taxed, contributing to young girls’ inability to afford them. These discriminatory practices create lifelong institutionalized inferiority of females to males. Monthly absences from school result in less education and a concomitant decrease in their earning potential in adulthood. Additionally, lack of education further reduces their employment opportunity due to the anticipated absence from work. Employers prefer to hire males, which reinforces male dominance in the society.&lt;ref name=”Aruthum”&gt;Aruthum, K. &quot;Sanitary Pads too Expensive&quot;. The New Times Daily, Rwanda 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many of the original theories used to explain delinquency were based on research limited to boys, these theories needed to be modified to understand gender differences in delinquency, especially why girls are so much less delinquent than boys. Josephina Figueira-McDonough argued that social control theory explains girls’ and boys’ behavior equally well; predictors suggested by strain theory also work equally well. Some experts have predicted that as the female gender role changes in our society, girls will become more and more like boys in their delinquency, with girls acting more violent and taking part in activities like gang fighting. Because of the importance of girls’ running away and other status offenses, it is important to understand girls’ status offending. According to Chesney-Lind, girls often run away from abuse, and once they are “on the streets,” several negative outcomes are possible.{{fact|reference?}}

On one Sunday morning, a judge came to prison, and said to one man:

:''&quot;You are sentenced to death. You will be executed in the morning of one of the days of next week. We have already decided the day, but you will get to know the day we want you executed during the dinner the day before it.&quot;''

''Explain why the judge's statement is false.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles|Logic puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/False Execution|False Execution]] | Solution
----

The solution to this puzzle is somewhat paradoxical. The prisoner may reason like this:

Days of week are: '''First Sunday''' (the day judge came to prison), '''Monday''', '''Tuesday''', '''Wednesday''', '''Thursday''', '''Friday''', '''Saturday''', '''Second Sunday'''.

Assumption: The judge told the truth.

:Assumption: They want him executed on the second Sunday.

::That means they don't want him executed on any other day of week, and no one told him on the first Sunday: &quot;You're going to be executed tomorrow&quot;, nor on Monday, Tuesday, and so on until Friday.  So after Friday's dinner, he knew he wouldn't be executed on Saturday (he didn't &quot;get to know&quot; it during dinner) or on any other day of this week, because they have passed.  That leaves only the second Sunday, and so exacly after Friday's dinner he &quot;got to know&quot; the day they wanted him executed.  This contradicts ''&quot;you will get to know the day we want you executed during the dinner the day before it&quot;'', because he got to know it earlier.

:That means the assumption is wrong, and there is no way they want him executed on the second Sunday.

:Assumption: They want him executed on Saturday.

::Since the prisoner has established that he cannot be executed on the second Sunday, the same argument follows.  After Thursday's dinner, he knew he wouldn't be executed on Friday, and so he can only be executed on Saturday, again contradicting ''&quot;you will get to know the day we want you executed during the dinner the day before it&quot;''.

:That means the assumption is wrong, and there is no way they want him executed on Saturday.

:The argument can be applied to each day of the week in turn, and so there is no day of the week on which they can have decided to execute him, contradicting ''&quot;We have already decided the day&quot;''.

That means the assumption is wrong, and what judge said is false.


However, this whole argument is false. While it may seem as though the judge cannot be telling the truth, it is in fact impossible to infer from what the judge has said. To understand the reason for this, it is important keep the statements ''&quot;the judge is telling the truth&quot;'' and ''&quot;the prisoner knows that the judge is telling the truth&quot;'' separate.

If the prisoner's argument is sound, then he knows that the judge is lying. Suppose then that one evening the judge tells the prisoner &quot;tomorrow you will be executed, as was decided earlier&quot;, and the prisoner is executed the next day. Since the prisoner thought the judge was lying, he did not anticipate this. But that means the judge was actually telling the truth. Thus, the argument cannot have been sound.

So the real puzzle is, what step of the argument above is not sound?

Task is using any arithmetical operators, and school functions, such as logarithms, trigonometrical functions, square roots, and set of digits, get a specific digit.



== Example ==



&lt;math&gt;{1111111 \over 10000}&lt;/math&gt;

That means using &quot;1&quot; seven times write 10000, and the solution is:

&lt;math&gt;\,10000={(111-11)}^{1+1}&lt;/math&gt;



== Logarithms Puzzle 1 ==



&lt;math&gt;{777 \over 121}&lt;/math&gt;


'''[[Puzzles/Arithmetical puzzles/Logarithms Puzzle/Logarithms Puzzle 1 Solution|Logarithms Puzzle 1 Solution]]'''



== Logarithms Puzzle 2 ==



&lt;math&gt;{11 \over 32}&lt;/math&gt;


'''[[Puzzles/Arithmetical puzzles/Logarithms Puzzle/Logarithms Puzzle 2 Solution|Logarithms Puzzle 2 Solution]]'''



== Logarithms Puzzle 3 ==


&lt;math&gt;{111 \over 10001}&lt;/math&gt;


Since it may be difficult to solve, try solving these first:


&lt;math&gt;{11111 \over 10001}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;{1111 \over 10001}&lt;/math&gt;

===Aspergian Pride's Cure for Ignorance Campaign===

No reasonable person in today’s society would suggest that racial minorities ought to be cured of their skin color or their hair texture. And yet, when the genetic traits of a minority group include a neurological configuration that differs from the majority population to any noticeable extent, society’s tolerance for diversity goes out the window. The Internet and the mass media are filled with profoundly negative and inaccurate stereotypes about the Aspergian population.

The &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;“[http://www.aspergianpride.com/blog/cure-ignorance Cure for Ignorance Campaign]”&lt;/span&gt; seeks to ensure that other people will respect and value our diversity by refuting the stereotypes and developing a cure for the majority's ignorance through advocating acceptance and understanding, To join the Cure for Ignorance Campaign. all you have to do is create your own website or add an extra page to your interesting one, advocating social acceptance of Neurodiversity, explain why you support the Neurodiversity Movement and Aspergian Civil Rights, and include a brief description of the Cure for Ignorance Campaign, a link to the Cure for Ignorance page, and copy Aspergian Pride’s list of links in its entirety (which can be accessed in html format through a link at the bottom of the Cure for Ignorance page). Then, send Aspergian Pride a link to your site, and your site will be added to the links list. The inclusion of any particular site on the list does not imply an endorsement of Aspergian Pride by that site.) These links may be freely copied for the purpose of raising public awareness of the autistic civil rights movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Discussion is open, i myself belive this is correct solution, but i heard other opinions (not like &quot;your whole riddle is stuipd, i don't get it at all!!1~&quot;) [[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 18:47, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

If it was determined he'll be executed on tuesday, the prisoner can't deduce that. Because the logic would lead him to think he can't be executed. Therefor he can't know that any day before, which makes the judge's statement true.
The statement the judge makes to the prisoner is non-informative, it can't lead the prisoner to know when he will be executed, because believing it leads to inconsistent beliefs (even though the statement is true). -- towr [[User:129.125.102.149|129.125.102.149]] 10:32, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: I agree with towr. The judge's statement does not convey any information to the prisoner. It can be either true or false, and it is impossible for the prisoner to know which. This should be explained in the solution. -- [[User:Grahn|Grahn]] 23:07, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: I have now updated the solution to reflect this, but it could definately be written in a better way. I don't have time to improve it further at the moment, but at least it is correct now. [[User:Grahn|Grahn]] 19:14, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: [[User:81.195.24.94|81.195.24.94]], whoever you are: as I said before, my explaination might not have been the best, but you are wrong, and I am quite certain of it. I don't wish to start an edit war, but I will nontheless revert your last edit since it is more of an argument than a clarification. I suggest we keep any further debate here on the talk page, until we can agree on the matter. [[User:Grahn|Grahn]] 18:24, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Copied from the article before revert of [[User:81.195.24.94|81.195.24.94]]'s edit: &quot;''Not true. We're not talking here about what prisoner thinks. You are a god in this puzzle, and if judge says &quot;Tomorrow you will be executed, as was decided earlier&quot;, you might want to ask &quot;When did you decide that?&quot;. No matter what judge answers you, that makes hist first statment wrong, because if he would choose a day, prisoner would already know that he'd be executed on that day.''&quot;

::: But we ''are'' talking about what the prisoner thinks/knows. The judge tells the prisoner that &quot;''you will get to know the day we want you executed during the dinner the day before it''&quot;. That is, the prisoner will be given information about his execution the day before it will happen. Whether or not the judge was telling the truth when he said this during the verdict, the prisoner cannot know. We as the puzzle-god could, however, have that information and in fact know that the judge was telling the truth during the verdict---that the prisoner will not know the time of his execution until the day before it---without there being any problem, since the prisoner still does not know. The only thing that leads to contradiction is the assumption that the ''prisoner'' knows that the judge is telling the truth, which he cannot. But this does not mean that the judge can't still be telling the truth. It only means that the prisoner can't know that he is, if he is. [[User:Grahn|Grahn]] 18:50, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

== Another caveat ==

The solution assumes that judge and prisoner agree on the interpretation of &quot;next week&quot;.  There are two definitions of a calendar week in common usage: Sunday-Saturday and Monday-Sunday.  At the moment, it assumes a Monday-Sunday week.  If Sunday-Saturday is taken to be the definition of a week, the same argument is equally valid, he just has six days to think about it before they might kill him.  But if the judge is using one definition and the prisoner is understanding the other, then I can imagine it being a bit more complicated.

I guess I'll have to think about it a bit more when I've time.... -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 17:52, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

== wrong problem ==

The problem, in its current incarnation, is not correct:

Here is the current problem, stated as follows:

___
On one Sunday morning, a judge came to prison, and said to one man:

    &quot;You are sentenced to death. You will be executed in the morning of one of the days of next week. We have already decided the day, but you will get to know the day we want you executed during the dinner the day before it.&quot;

Explain why the judge's statement is false.

___

The above defined problem is not correct: imagine they decided on tuesday morning:  on sunday, they don't tell anything to the prisonner, so he can't know which of the remaing days will be the one. On monday they tell him &quot;it's tomorrow morning&quot;...

So the judge told him the truth.

The only thing the prisonner can know is that it won't be on the last day of the week!

(Edhel-Dil.)

: Yes, the current formulation is incorrect; whether or not the judge's statement is true cannot be derived from the facts presented in the puzzle. However, your last statement is also wrong: the prisoner cannot conclude that he won't be executed the last day of the week out of what the judge has said. The judge's statement conveys no information to the prisoner. Assuming that it does leads to contradiction. -- [[User:Grahn|Grahn]] 22:08, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

English is'n my home language, so i'm not 100% sure i chose the best word. Original Puzzle is in Russian, and it uses &quot;узнать&quot;, which can mean both &quot;to be told&quot; and to &quot;to find out&quot;. So all i could think of is &quot;get to know&quot;. If you know a better solution, feel free to edit. --[[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 18:52, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: The first time I heard this puzzle it was in swedish and concerned a tutor telling his pupils about a test. I believe it was formulated something like &quot;you will not know the time of the test the day before the test&quot;, which explicitly states that the pupil/prisoner will be lacking the knowledge. This is implicit in the current formulation and could lead to some confusion. But since this is a puzzle, maybe confusion is a good thing. =P -- [[User:Grahn|Grahn]] 23:06, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I also heard first heard this puzzle in the form of teacher/student/test.  It goes like this:

A teacher told his students on friday that a test will be given one of the days next week(monday-friday) and that the students would not know until the day of the test which day it will be.  

One clever student reasoned that the test couldn't be given on friday, because the students would know what day the test was if they had not been given the test that day.  The student continued with the same logic to reason that the test couldn't be on thursday because as long as friday was ruled out, the students would know the day of the test on wednesday if it were not given that day.  In this same way, he reasoned that there could not be a test next week.  

To the student's surprise and dismay, the teacher administered the test on tuesday.  Explain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;I actually think that the solution will be 97,0,1,0,2 split.  If the youngest pirate is being offered 1, he might just way to himself, &quot;Well, pirate #4 will also offer me $1, and I've no reason to leave this old geezer alive!&quot;
fixed --[[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 19:04, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)



== 2 pirates ==

Surely the split would actually be 0-100? The question says there needs to be at least 50% votes in favour, so as long as pirate 2 votes for himself he can't have less than 50% in favour.

: &quot;and all pirates '''remaining''' will vote for or against it&quot;.  I took that to mean apart from the one who proposes. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 17:02, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

== The solution isn't unique ==

I've worked it out, and there's a small difference from what's said here that means that there are two possible solutions, of which one coincides with the one given here.

3 Pirates: Pirate 3 splits at 0, 0, 100.  Pirate 2 will vote for him, since it is his only way to guarantee survival.

4 Pirates: Pirate 4 splits at 1, 1, 0, 98.  Pirates 1 and 2 will vote for.

5 Pirates: Pirate 5 can split at either 2, 0, 1, 0, 97 or 0, 2, 1, 0, 97 and receive two votes in his favour.

-- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:58, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

== This should be right ==

Working backwards

Assuming that each Pirates priority is to stay alive, then get as much gold. 

1 Pirate
1: proposes that he take all the gold, and agree's with himself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2 Pirates&lt;br&gt;
2: proposes that the other takes all the gold and lets him live.&lt;br&gt;
1: Might agree with him, depending on his disposition. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3 Pirates&lt;br&gt;
3: proposes to give himself all the gold&lt;br&gt;
2: votes yes, because this assures that he will live, other wise his life is in #1's hands&lt;br&gt;
1: votes no, but this doesn't matter as the other 2 voted yes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
4 Pirates&lt;br&gt;
4: proposes 98 gold goes to himself, 0 gold to #3, 1 gold to #2 and 1 gold to #1.&lt;br&gt;
3: votes no&lt;br&gt;
2: votes yes because it's more than he'll get if it goes to 3 pirates&lt;br&gt;
1: votes yes because it's more than he'll get if it goes to 3 pirates&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
5 Pirates&lt;br&gt;
5: proposes 96 gold to himself, 0 gold to #4, 0 gold to #3, 2 gold to #2 and 2 gold to #1.&lt;br&gt;
4: votes no&lt;br&gt;
3: votes no&lt;br&gt;
2: votes yes because it's more than he'll get if it goes to 4 pirates&lt;br&gt;
1: votes yes because it's more than he'll get if it goes to 4 pirates&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So the first pirate will propose 96 to himself, 2 to the second youngest and 2 to the youngest and this will pass 3 to 2.&lt;br&gt;</text>

Mind Mapping is a concept invented by Tony Buzan.  This technique can help you organize your life.  MindManager has a software application that is very user friendly.  There is even a open source version that is available for free called '''''freemind'''''.  What would increase the value of the software is to have it running and hosted available on the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ADN animation.gif|frame|150px|right|A section of [[DNA]], the sequence of the plate-like units ([[nucleotide]]s) in the center carries information.]]

Welcome to '''Genetics''' - the study of heredity. More precisely, it is the study of how living organisms inherit characteristics or traits from their ancestors.

It has only been in the past one hundred years that we have begun to understand how information in the form of physical characteristics is transferred from parent to child.

In genetics, a feature of an organism is called a '''trait'''. Some traits are features of an organism's physical appearance, for example, a person's eye-color, height or weight. There are many other types of traits and these range from aspects of behavior to resistance to disease. Traits are often inherited, for example tall and thin people tend to have tall and thin children. 

Other traits come from the interaction between inherited features and the environment. For example a child might inherit the tendency to be tall, but if there is very little food where they live and they are poorly nourished, they will still be short. The way genetics and environment interact to produce a trait can be complicated: for example, the chances of somebody dying of cancer or heart disease seems to depend on both their family history and their lifestyle. Genetics will help to examine the dynamic between the often asked &quot;Nature vs. Nurture&quot; question.

Genetic information is carried by a long molecule called ''deoxyribonucleic acid'', '''DNA''' for short. DNA consists of two long chains of ''nucleotides'' twisted into a double helix and joined by hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases ''adenine'' and ''thymine'' or ''cytosine'' and ''guanine'' that encodes the genetic information which is copied and inherited across generations.

Traits are carried in DNA as instructions for constructing and operating an organism. These instructions are contained in segments of DNA called genes. DNA is made of a sequence of simple units, with the order of these units spelling out instructions in the genetic code. This is similar to the orders of letters spelling out words. The organism &quot;reads&quot; the sequence of these units and decodes the instruction.

Not all the genes for a particular instruction are exactly the same. Different forms of one type of gene are called different alleles of that gene. As an example, one allele of a gene for hair color could carry the instruction to produce a lot of the pigment in black hair, while a different allele could give a garbled version of this instruction, so that no pigment is produced and the hair is white. 

'''Mutations''' are either random or induced events that alter the sequence of a gene and can produce new or different traits. There are some exceptions to this, which will be discussed later. A new trait could be turning an allele for black hair into an allele for white hair.The appearance of new traits is important in evolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Objective-C ===
==== Objects and fields ====
In Objective-C, each class is a struct in C. That is, 

 @interface A
 {
   int a, b, c
 }
 
 @end

would be implemented as like:

 struct A {
   int a, b, c;
   .... // some runtime information
 };

Thus, since each object in Objective-C, a pointer to a memory block in the heap. And so the way to access fields is the same as the way for members of struct. That is,

 id obj = [A alloc];

The implication of this scheme is that while an object naturally fits to non-OOP C program, one disadvantage is that fields cannot be &quot;shadowed.&quot; That is,

 @interface A
 {
   @private
   int a;
 }
 @end
 
 @interface B : A
 {
   @private
   int a;
 }
 @end

This would result in duplicate members error. This contrasts with the situation in Java.

Finally, since the selection of methods occurs at runtime (in contrast to the cases in Java or C++), methods are handled differently than fields.

==== Methods ====
In Objective-C, the selection of methods occurs at runtime. Compilers may issue warnings about likely mistyped names because the compiler can know a set of selector names that are defined in the program. This, however, is not semantically necessary; any message can be sent to any object.

Semantically, the sender of a message checks if a given object responds to the message, and if not, try its super class, and if not again, its super and so on.

A complication may arise, for example, when there are two selectors with the differing return type. Consider the following case.

 @interface A { }
 - (float) func: (int) i
 @end
 
 @interface B { }
 - (int) func: (int) i
 @end

In this case, because the compiler cannot know to which method--(float) func or (int) func--an object would respond, it cannot generate code that sends a message, as returning a float value usually differs from doing an int value.

----
Three.

== Reasoning ==

There'll be a matching pair of socks after three tries because only two socks, of either color, are needed.  Let's say the first sock drawn from the wardrobe is black.  There are only two things that can now happen:  If the next sock is black, there's now a matching pair of socks and you're done.  If the next sock is white, there's now a white and a black sock.  Now, no matter what the next sock drawn will make a pair.  Whether a black sock or a white sock is drawn from the wardrobe, there'll be two socks of one color and one of the other color.  Therefore, there'll always be a pair by the third sock drawn.

Would a link to

== Description ==

X'Address is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any object, program unit, or label, RM 13.3(10/1). [A program unit is either a package, a task unit, a protected unit, a protected entry, a generic unit, or an explicitly declared subprogram other than an enumeration literal, RM 10.1(1).]

'Address may be used to return the address of the first element allocated to X. 'Address may also be used to set the address of X for stand-alone objects and program units, RM 13.3(12).

== Example ==

    {{Ada/--|A 32 bit hardware register}}
    Device_Input_Value: Interfaces.Unsigned_32;
    {{Ada/kw|for}} Device_Input_Value'Address {{Ada/kw|use}} To_Address (16#8000_05C4#);

It's not recommended to use Integer_32 in this case.

__TOC__

== Description ==

Represents the base type of another [[ada Programming/Subtypes|type or subtype]]. This [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] is used to access attributes of the base type. 

T'Base refers to the &quot;base range&quot; of the type, which defines the range in which intermediate calculations are performed.

== Base for Integer Types ==

The standard states that the range of T'Base:

# includes the value 0
# is symmetric about zero, with possibly an extra negative value
# includes all of the values in the subtype T

So for example, if T is:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 {{Ada/dl|..}} 42{{Ada/dl|;}}

then the compiler will choose a hardware supported type that includes this range, in this case probably an eight bit type (on a two's complement machine)

  {{Ada/kw|type}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Base}} {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} {{Ada/op|-}}128 {{Ada/dl|..}} 127{{Ada/dl|;}}

This definition is not to be taken literally, as by Ada semantics, T and T'Base would be incompatible. In effect, the declaraion of T would then be

  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} T'{{Ada/attribute|Base}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 {{Ada/dl|..}} 42{{Ada/dl|;}}

Note that built-in operators go through the base type, and T's &quot;+&quot; op for example is implicitly declared as:

   {{Ada/kw|function}} {{Ada/dl|&quot;}}{{Ada/op|+}}{{Ada/dl|&quot;}} {{Ada/dl|(}}L{{Ada/dl|,}} R {{Ada/dl|:}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Base}}{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/kw|return}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Base}}{{Ada/dl|;}}

There are no constraint checks on T'Base, so for example:

  {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    O1 {{Ada/dl|:}} T      {{Ada/dl|1=:=}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|(}}1{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/op|+}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|(}}2{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
    O2 {{Ada/dl|:}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Base}} {{Ada/dl|1=:=}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|(}}1{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/op|+}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/dl|(}}2{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
  {{Ada/kw|begin}}

then in the first assignment to O1, there is a constraint check to ensure that the result of 1 + 2 is in the range of T, but in the second assignment to O2, there is no check.

T'Base is useful for generics, when you need to able to recover the base range of the type, in order to declare a object with value 0; for example, if this is an accumulator.

It is helpful to know something about the base range of the type, so that you have a guarantee that you don't get any overflow during intermediate calculations.  For example, given type T above then

  {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Op {{Ada/dl|(}}O1{{Ada/dl|,}} O2 {{Ada/dl|:}} T{{Ada/dl|)}} {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Sum {{Ada/dl|:}} T{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Base}} {{Ada/dl|1=:=}} O1 {{Ada/op|+}} O2{{Ada/dl|;}}
  {{Ada/kw|begin}}

This is a problem, since if the sum of O1 and O2 is large (that is, greater than T'Base'Last), then you'll get overflow.  Knowing that you're going to be adding two values together means you should declare the type this way:

   T_Last {{Ada/dl|:}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} {{Ada/dl|1=:=}} 42{{Ada/dl|;}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} T_Base {{Ada/kw|is}} 0 {{Ada/dl|..}} 2 {{Ada/op|*}} T_Last{{Ada/dl|;}}
   {{Ada/kw|subtype}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} T_Base {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 {{Ada/dl|..}} T_Last{{Ada/dl|;}}

That way you know that (sub)type T's range is 1 .. 42, but you also have a guarantee that T'Base'Last &gt;= 84, and hence the sum of two values of type T cannot overflow.

Note that a declaration of the form:

   {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} ''...''

actually declares a subtype, named T, of some anonymous base type.  We can refer to the range of this base type as T'Base.

== Base for Enumeration Types ==

An enumeration type is its own base type, so given this type:

   {{Ada/kw|type}} ET {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/dl|(}}A{{Ada/dl|,}} B{{Ada/dl|,}} C{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}

then the range of ET is the same as the range of ET'Base.  If you need some extra literals in your &quot;base&quot; type, then you have to declare them manually, not unlike what we did above:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} ET_Base {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/dl|(}}ET_Base_First{{Ada/dl|,}} A{{Ada/dl|,}} B{{Ada/dl|,}} C{{Ada/dl|,}} ET_Base_Last{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} ET {{Ada/kw|is}} ET_Base {{Ada/kw|range}} A {{Ada/dl|..}} C{{Ada/dl|;}}

Now you can say ET'Next (ET'Last) and you'll get a meaningful answer. This is necessary when you do something like:

  {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    E {{Ada/dl|:}} ET{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Base}} {{Ada/dl|1=:=}} ET{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|First}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
  {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|while}} E {{Ada/operator|1=&lt;=}} ET{{Ada/dl|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Last}} {{Ada/kw|then}}
      ''...'' {{Ada/--| do something}}
      E {{Ada/dl|1=:=}} ET{{Ada/dl|'}}Next {{Ada/dl|(}}E{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
  {{Ada/kw|end}}{{Ada/dl|;}}

Also when you derive from ET_Base with a range constraint, the base of the derived type will include all values of the base type:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} New_ET {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} ET_Base {{Ada/kw|range}} A {{Ada/dl|..}} C{{Ada/dl|;}}
 
  Correct: {{Ada/kw|constant}} Boolean := New_ET'Base'First = ET_Base_First;

Note that here ET_BASE_First is of type New_ET.

== Example ==

If you declare:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);

and 

 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Sub_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|range}} Enum1 .. Enum2;

then &lt;tt&gt;Sub_Enum'&lt;b&gt;Base&lt;/b&gt;'{{Ada/at|Last}}&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;Enum3&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Description ==

X'Callable is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any [[Ada Programming/Tasking|task]] object.
If the task is completed or has been terminated, this attribute is false. Otherwise, this attribute is true (i.e. the task is callable).

Be warned - calling X'Callable can result in a race condition. X'Callable may be true at the time the attribute value is read, but it may become false at the time action is taken based on the value read. Once X'Callable is false, however, it can be expected to stay false.

== Description ==

X'Image(Y) is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any discrete type and Y is an instance of that type. This attribute returns a string representation of the value passed as input.

This attribute is a useful way to automatically convert from a type value to a string suitable for output.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);
 ...
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Image (Enum1) = &quot;ENUM1&quot;);

'''Idli''' is a round, fluffy bread roughly eight centimetres in diameter. Idli is made from ground rice or rice flour mixed with ground urad dal, salt, methi (fenugreek seeds) and water. The mixture is allowed to [[Cookbook:Fermentation|ferment]] prior to being steamed in an idli steamer. They are traditional to Southern India and are most often eaten with [[Cookbook:Sambar|sambar]].

==Ingredients==

* 4 cups  of Par boiled Rice of short grain variety.[[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|white urad dal]] (black gram, skinless)
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|non-iodised salt]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek seeds]] (methi)
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for soaking rice and urad dal
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Water|chlorine-free water]] for fermenting (see note)
* optional: fermentation starter (see note)

==Procedure==

===Making the Batter===
# wash rice and dehusked Urad whole or urad dal thoroughly.
# Soak methi seeds (Fenugreek) along with urad dal.
# Soak the rice and urad dal in separate bowls for no more than 2 hours. You will need about twice as much water in the bowl as urad dal, as it expands as it soaks up water.
# Drain the rice and urad dal, do not discard soaking water of dal as it helps better fermentation.Discard excess water from rice fully . Do not worry, the rice has soaked up enough water for grinding.
  if you need some water, use soaking water of urad da while grinding rice.
# Grind the urad dal to a fine paste.
# Grind the rice to a not so fine paste with about 1 cup of chlorine-free water, less if you can. Grind coarsely if the batter will only be used for idli, but grind finely if it will later be used for [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]].
# Mix the rice and urad dal pastes together well, with salt and methi. 
# Optional: add fermentation starter and mix well (see note).
# Set aside somewhere warm like pre heated oven (200degrees F for 3 minutes) to ferment for 8 hours(see note).

[[Image:Idli pan.png|right|thumb|An idli pan]]
===Making the Idli===

# Grease one or more [[Cookbook:Idli Pan|idli pans]] well with [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]].
# Spoon the batter into the round indentations of the idli pans.
# Steam for 12 minutes in a steamer, 16 minutes if using brown rice.
# Remove idli from pans with a sharp knife or thin [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]].

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Idli is a very temperamental creature: it is not easy to get soft fluffy idlis. These tips may help.

# A traditional stone grinder is recommended for making idlis. The modern high speed mixer with metal blades won't work as well, but a blender will do a reasonable job.
# Idli is made of black lentil and rice. The southern parts of India use boiled rice, while the rest uses raw rice. It depends on your taste. The black lentil should be the full, round variety. Avoid broken dal.
# The ratio of black lentil to rice should not exceed 1:3 or 1:4  by volume.  If you have good quality dal, you can stretch this ratio by increasing the quantity of rice. 
# Soak dal and rice separately for at least three hours,  You can add half a teaspoon of fenugreek (methi) seeds to the dal for a good twist.
# The rice is typically par boiled short grain white rice, but brown rice works well also and adds flavour, colour, and more nutrition. Brown rice needs to be soaked at least 4 to 6 hours.
# Use plenty of water for grinding the dal and make it a very smooth paste. But grind the rice coarse and granular.
# Add salt to taste.
# Mix the dal and rice batters thoroughly. It takes more time and energy than you might think. Uneven mixing causes many failures. Mixing them by hand works best!
# A warm temperature is essential for fermentation. 25 to 28 °C (77 - 82.4 °F) will be ideal. If the weather is cold, keep some warm water in a large bowl and immerse the vessel containing the dough. To help maintain the temperature of the warm water bath, cover it with a blanket, or better, use a regulated heater, like a heating pad or  aquarium heater. Even easier, turn on the light in the oven, and use that to keep the batter warm.
# Allow at least 8 hours to ferment. If you don't see tiny bubbles the next morning, the dough will not rise and you have to start all over again. 
# If you can't get it to ferment by itself, try adding a fermentation starter like a spoonful of commercially prepared idli batter (commercial idli batters sold under refrigeration may have live culture), or a teaspoonful of yogurt with live culture.Kefir may be used but  yogurt is best . [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]].  Just bread yeast will not make for good flavour, as bacteria are needed also.
# Use chlorine-free water or R/O Water when grinding, as this will be the water that the batter will have in it when fermenting. Tap water will work, but will inhibit the ferment a little. Most modern water filters remove both chlorine and chloramine.
# In the morning, gently scoop the top layer of the batter and steam it. DO NOT stir or otherwise break the batter. The trapped bubbles should not escape; they are necessary for sponginess.
# Steam the idlis in the idli pan. An open stove is preferable over microwave. The vessel should steam like an old locomotive.
# Steam it for 12 minutes. You know it is done from the characteristic smell. If you are not sure, poke it gently with a spoon and make sure the batter does not stick to the spoon.
# Allow it to cool for a minute. Sprinkle the idlis liberally with [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]] and eat them with suitable side dishes, such as [[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|chutni]], [[Cookbook:Sambar|sambaar]] and idli powder.
# Leftover batter that has lost its froth can still be used to make [[Cookbook:dosa|dosa]].

===Ready-made idli batter===

Some Indian groceries may stock fresh ready-to-cook idli batter. Batter can be found in refrigerated section. Simply spoon the batter into idli pans well brushed with ghee, and steam. This produces a very good idli, light and fluffy with a characteristic tangy flavor. However, some of these products are fermented using citric acid and chemical leavening (i.e., baking powder) and may not be as beneficial.  Recent studies indicate that fermented foods are more healthful.( Please remember that readymade batters usually contain preservatives like Potassium Sorbate or Pot. Metabi lulfites)

Idli pans are inexpensive and available in the same Indian grocery stores.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This shouldn't be called &quot;Infinite hats&quot;, since being able to specify whether there are an even or odd number of red hats ahead of you relies on that number being finite.

How about &quot;Arbitrarily large but finite Hats&quot;

A more fool proof solution would be to have a strategy in which each person will call out the color of the hat of the person who is immedietly in front of him/her. That way, except for the last person in the line (I mean, the one who dont have anyone standing behind him/her) every one will be able to tell the color of their hat.

__

you're wrong: they can only tell a hat color, and thus they will tell the person in front of them, but not theirs. Thus the only persons who will correctly tell their hat's color will be the ones that have hats the same color as the person in front of them!

And also 'arbritrary large' is not true: the time needed to count the hats, and then to tell something, and then for the next person to do the same takes time, and we can assume 'people' means humans, and thus the limit is quite low.

And the planet's curvature comes into play too... they can't see too far.

People's sight accuracy are a limit too...

__

They call the hat colour of the person in front of them, then everyone but the first person knows their own colour and is able to say it accurately.</text>

Weights are: 2, 6, 18, 54

== Explanation ==

Put 2kg on one side, your item on the other. If item is less then 2kg, it is 1 kg. if it's more:

Put 6kg on one side, your item and 2kg on the other. If item and 2kg are less then 6kg, item is 3kg. Else:

Put 6kg on one side, your item on the other. If item is less then 6kg, it's 5kg.

...

This way you can weigh up to 81kg.

===Speculation on the Physiology of Depression===

Some interesting speculations about depression:

*Neuron death in the hippocampus has been implicated in depression [http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/000477.html]
*Neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons) may be necessary for recovery [http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/14738/page/4?&amp;print=yes]
*Neurogenesis happens continuously in the healthy adult brain
*Most antidepressants require about 2-3 weeks to have an effect
*Stress may diminish neurogenesis
*People under stress may sleep less than usual
*In some cases those recovering from depression sleep more than normal all though the opposite is true in some cases
*Aging mimics several aspects of depression
*As people age, they sleep less, spend less time in deep sleep, and wake up more often [http://helpguide.org/life/sleep_aging.htm]
*'''Neuron death and birth happens continuously in the adult brain'''

At least certain parts of the brain continuously renew themselves.  Sleep seems to be
fundamental for this renewal process---perhaps neurogenesis happens during sleep.

*'''Stress affects sleep, and by consequence, neurogenesis'''

There is plenty of speculation concerning the exact mechanism by which stress
causes neuron death.  Our own conjecture is based on the fact that when under
stress, people sleep less than normal.  Therefore, rather than directly killing
neurons, stress might simply cause the brain to fall behind on its normal regenerative
process.

*'''Increase in activity fundamental during recovery'''

Some studies show how stimulating environments help with neurogenesis 
[http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/14738/page/4?&amp;print=yes].
The reason might be similar to recovery from an injured limb: one has to gradually
''push the brain'' into continuing its recovery.

==Talk page at en:==

[[w:Talk:Wikipedia_Cookbook]] is rather extensive and worth reading on [[point of view]] and features required.
== A new way of ordering recipes ==

I've been navigating around Cookbook and I find it is not scalable.
Recipe lists will get (I expect) too long to display on a single page and navigating just by one category or alphabetically just wont do it. Mantaining these lists is just not a requisite and recipes could just be hanging there.

As a [http://sourceforge.net Sourceforge] and [http://freshmeat.net Freshmeat] user, I found their way of browsing much more easy.
A project has specific attributes and you can browse/filter by them. You don't have to add it to the different indexes, it is just there.

A recipe could have specific attributes like ingredients, time to cook, region, type of food, calories, etc.
With an automatic indexing system, it would be automatically linked on every category under the attribute specified.
This would avoid mantainance time of index pages and maximize search capabilities.

Searching would by as easy as browsing by region (for example, Asian --&gt; Chinese --&gt; Cantonese) and filtering by ingredient (for example, all that have the ingredient Rice and doesn't have Tuna) and by time to cook (for example, less than 30 minutes).

I don't know if wikimedia can do it, but it would be really cool.

--[[User:Sbenza|SamSam]] 20:25, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:This is what categories do in Wikipedia I think. Categories are just a primitive version of what you are explaining.  It would be a nice feature but I don't know if it is possible at the moment. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 22:55, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Looks like Gentgeen's started to categorize some of the recipes.  Good job man.  What is your plan with this.  I see that the categories so far come from the &quot;National and Ethnic Cuisines&quot; and the &quot;Recipes&quot; section of the first page.  Have any guidance for some of us others when it comes to categorizing? I changed the Midwestern cuisine page so that there was not a list of recipes but a link to the category page to see if that would work well.  What do people think. If it's good, I'll change lists on many such pages.  [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 00:48, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:So far, I've been categorizing recipes by four attributes: by main ingredient under [[:Category:Recipes by ingredient]];  by inclusion in a particular diet under [[:Category:Recipes by diet]]; by which cuisine it belongs to under [[:Category:Recipes by origin]]; and by type of dish under the other subcategories in [[:Category:Recipes]].  Where it seemed reasonable, such as [[:Category:Chicken soups]], I've combined the type of dish and ingredient in one category that can then be included as a subcat in both branches of the recipe category tree, but I've not fully planned that out yet.  We only have a few hundred recipes right now, so the task shouldn't be that hard (compared to when I categorized the chemistry topics at wikipedia), but any help would be appriciated (I'm particularly bad at including text in the category pages. I'd rather get things categorized first, then tend to forget to go back and write the short blurb and link to the module with more information.); additionally categories for ingredients, cooking techniques, and cuisines should be developed. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 03:40, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

As SamSam said about his categorization and filtering suggestion, I have concerns about the cookbook's scalability. From my experience using public recipe sites, I have found that the more recipes they accumulate, the less useful they become. Even with a robust categorization system, the duplicate recipes make it very hard to research what you want to make. Although it may be some work, I suggest that we implement a rating and feedback system as I find this greatly increases a site's usefulness. This idea was inspired by [http://vegweb.com VegWeb], which is a public recipe site that is a pleasure to peruse as compared with other sites such as [http://www.cooks.com cooks.com]that seem sterile due to the lack of public feedback. An open feedback forum on the recipe page is vital for the testing of the recipes and for the opening of dialogue that is so much a part of the creative process of cooking. Variations of recipes can be posted here and a rating system can be implemented for the feedback entries to prioritize entries that people found most useful/informative and to highlight variations on recipes that are most popular. This system should be on the front end and easily accessible to the public, thus not in any way restricted to active builders of the book's content. This would be an excellent way of dealing with the philosophical issue raised by Snowspinner (above) about open-ended vs fixed recipes. I am an advocate for the open-ended approach, but a recipe can get too overwhelming with too much information at once. The original author of a recipe should still be allowed to put in as much extra information as they would like such as variations, cooking techniques, ingredient information, etc. However, a feedback system would be an indispensable way of building this extra information that everyone can learn from.

--[[User:Gothicsurf|Gothicsurf]] 19:01, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

* I know it's not perfect, or designed for exactly this purpose, but each page has an associated talk page (like this one) where feedback, questions, results, ect., could be recorded.  Also, the recipe template asks for a variations section, where either a simple variation can be fully explained, or links to seperate recipe pages for complex variations can be listed.  Additionally, if you look at our page on [[Cookbook:Guacamole|Guacamole]] or [[Cookbook:Empanadas|Empanadas]] you'll find three or four recipes all on the same page.
*I aslo hope for a better way to organize recipe, but right now wikibooks is the little sister of wikipedia, and we're just a part of wikibooks, so the developers aren't spending a lot of time working on software upgrades targeted at us.  I think if we have an organized plan when we ask for new features, we'll get a better responce.  To help that along, I'm going to create a page called [[Wikibooks:Cookbook feature requests]], where we can organize the various things we'd like to see. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:52, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Oven temperatures ==

Hi everyone. I've created a page called [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|Gas_mark]] with a conversion table for F, C and gas mark. Can I suggest that when anyone uses a gas mark in a recipe, they link to this page (eg 'cook at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|gas mark]] 7 for 20 minutes. (Could also do this from F and C?) (Might be better to rename the page?) [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 19:58, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)
Oh well, in the face of indifference, I've done so. There's now a page called [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures]] where you can refer all baking settings. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 23:20, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Ingredients ==
=== Wikipedia entries ===
When listing ingredients, should I be linking them to the local [[Cookbook]] ingredients pages, e.g. [[Cookbook:Milk]], or to the Wikipedia pages? I would think that the Cookbook should be more self contained, if possible. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 1:32, 7 Jan 2005 

I'd say without doubt, link to the Cookbook: entry, for the reason that entries for ingredients in Cookbook should concentrate on the culinary aspects of the ingredient, rather than anything else. For example [[Cookbook:Potato]], where I've done a fair bit of work, is all about cooking and eating, rather than the social history of the potato, or how to grow potatoes. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 20:02, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

=== Structure ===
Is there an obvious structural way to refer to the ingredients within the recipe? It would be nice to be able to say, &quot;I have kale and tumeric, give me a list of recipes&quot; ... or should I just use the basic search function? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 1:34, 7 Jan 2005 (datestamp?)

I can't think of a way to do this for two ingredients, but if you're looking for, say, tofu-recipes you can go to the tofu page and click 'what links here' on the bottom-left of the page. [[User:Risk|risk]]
:If we added each ingredient as a category then it shouldnt be too dificult to create a search script to give back possible recipes from a list of ingredients. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 09:39, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Cookbook not well-bounded ==

The cookbook is not distinct enough from the rest of the wikibooks stuff. It's a mess. When I go to look at recent changes, I see stuff about brain scanner technology and such. Often, links take me to some generic wikibook page. Grrrr.... I just want the cookbook! When I list the catagories, same problem. Most of the catagories are very much not appropriate for cooking.

I think there may also be some bad link structure, making it hard to drill down to a desired recipie. It is hard to tell now though, with the cookbook being drowned out by unrelated stuff.

== Template ==

Ok, first i made this template before i saw that there was already a template used on some recipes. Second it is the first info box style template i have ever made.
Anywho, you can all see what it looks like at [[Cookbook:Creme_Anglaise/trial]]. Any ideas how it can be improved, or merged with the other template? Do people mind if i start adding it to recipes? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 07:41, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC) oh, also i forgot to add, i thought that there should be different colours for different types of recipes, as i see it there would be three obvious choices. Type of dish (ie. dessert, entree, etc.), Origin of dish (ie. Indian, southern european, etc.) or difficulty of dish (ie. easy, medium, etc.); anyone have thoughts on that question? [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 07:46, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Putting the ingredients in such a box is terrible. Many ingredient lists are too wide. Some recipies have multiple ingredient lists, either from variations or from grouping distinct parts of the recipie (filling vs. shell, etc.) for easier understanding.

It would be nice if you could pick a more appetizing example too. I'm sick of looking at that snot.
How about pizza or brownies?
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:09, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:OK, I'll change the featured stuff.  I got a bit behind.  Any suggestions? Oh, as we've got the five dot rating system, I think having the color scheme based on dificluty would be redundant. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 03:35, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I can't find even one other recipe with a picture. Somebody should send me a digital camera. The [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]] would make for wonderful photos. Anybody else want to cook them? Come on all you Iron Chefs! The [[Cookbook:Tamales|tamales]] would make for nice photos too, if you can take close-up photos in good light. (one broken open, and one intact)
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]]

== small text ==

I think it is bad to mark text as being small. Some people have bad eyesight.
It is especially bad to have a major portion of a page in small text.

== Category merge, any objections? ==

Category:Poultry_recipes has only two sub-categories, for turkey and chicken. I can not think of any case in which it would not be completely resonable to substitute one bird for the other.

So, both categories should go. The recipes move up into the poultry one.
:Sounds fine to me. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 05:13, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Main Page - Change suggested ==
The Sauces section contains things like chutney, which are not sauces, but condiments. I was going to add the category Condiments and move the chutney recipes, but there is a notice that says No edit....I am not sure if the no edit section applies to the entire page, or where it ends.

:How about a &quot;sauces and condiments&quot; section? Many foods are both: soy sauce, ketchup, gravy... Ones that are not both include: salt (condiment only), the yummy goop in many Chinese dishes (sauce only), black pepper (condiment only), teriyaki sauce (sauce only)...

::Yeah, that sounds ok. And recipes can be subcategorized as more appear.

*to answer one of your earlier questions, the &quot;no edit&quot; section tells the html engine that the little sectional &quot;edit&quot; buttons on the right of section headers are not displayed, not that the page shouldn't be edited. If we didn't want the page edited, it would be protected, which doesn't appear in the wikitext section. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:30, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Interesting recipe format ==

''[http://www.cookingforengineers.com/ Cooking for Engineers]'' has an interesting recipe format that combines the ingredients list with instructions into a 2-D table. I think the site was /.ed a while back. Some examples (scrol down to bottom of the page);

:I emailed him last year some time about the possibility of us using his instruction style, he was very happy for us to use it, but he was looking into copyrighting (or patenting or something) and licensing it for comercial uses, which wouldnt have worked with our GFDL (as in he was willing to release under something like cc-sa-nc). Anyway, i never got around to seeing how his legal wranglings worked out. If he discovered that it was not pretecable under IP law, then i guess we could use it, if it is, then probably not. Anyway, its worth contacting him again. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 16:55, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== excite ==

yeah,this is my first page here.

== [[Cookbook:Cumin]] and [[Cookbook:Caraway]] ==

For the third time (on the [[Cookbook:Goulash Soup]] page), I've seen mention of people confusing [[Cookbook:Cumin]] and [[Cookbook:Caraway]] seed. Is this for real? It's looking like an urban legand to me. Nobody in their right mind could mix these up. One sold as a powder is used in Mexican food, in copious amounts. The other is a somewhat sour seed that goes on rye bread, used to help sell dental floss.

I'm sure somebody could, in theory, confuse these spices. They could also confuse mayonaise and sour cream, beef and pork, or rice and corn. It doesn't seem too likely.

== mixed drinks are a problem ==

There must be a million mixed drinks. Those without obscene names (a few hundred thousand at least) cause horrible conflicts in the cookbook. I certainly don't expect alcohol when I see [[Cookbook:Apricot Pie|apricot pie]]. I expect, well, a pie containing apricots! These &quot;recipes&quot; are mostly all the same too. You pour stuff into a glass, duh.

So, how about kicking all these out of the cookbook? They could be renamed to start with &quot;Cocktail:&quot; at the very least. Probably they should just be a giant table instead of individual entries.

==spam and copyright violation==

First of all, somebody stole our Paella recipe:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
http://www.cellartastings .com/en/food-spanish-recipes-paella.html
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

(URL broken on purpose, to avoid supplying a link to a crook)

Compare that with the [[Cookbook:Paella]] recipe at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Paella&amp;oldid=57846 03:07, 30 Aug 2004]. The body text is identical, and contains expression that may be protected under copyright law. (note: do not consider this to be legal advice, etc.) (the cooking actions and the lists of ingredients are only patentable, but these people copied the sentences of the procedure -- grammer, sentence structure, and all)

Now check the [[Cookbook:Paella]] recipe &quot;External links&quot; section. Somebody is trying to sell paella pans. Nice, but it doesn't seem fair that the cookbook should be marketing for them. The same problem is on the [[Cookbook:Gazpacho]] page, selling gazpacho ingredients.

It looks like the copyright violator might be out of reach for a DMCA takedown, but maybe the info is fake. Here's what I see:

== Category Listing ==

There is no link on the main page to the category lists Recipes by origin, Recipes by ingredient, or Recipes by diet, three very useful categories to use while browsing the recipes.  I think we should try to use the wiki software to categorize the recipes as much as possible.  As the software improves it will become easier to view articles in a subcateogry.  --[[User:Alpharigel|Alpharigel]] 16:24, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Oh, there is. Look at the bottom. What is really missing is a way to view all categories associated with the cookbook. Normally the &quot;Catagories&quot; link would do this, but the cookbook ''still'' doesn't have a wiki to itself. All the special pages suffer from this problem. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:26, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::You can request that &quot;Cookbook&quot; be added as a real namespace.  Once done, that would presumably allow for the creation of special pages listed most wanted, orphans, etc, just within that namespace. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 02:02, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::I thought I did request that ''Cookbook'' become a real namespace several months ago. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 02:13, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::::Oh, well, maybe.  Where did you ask?  I really don't know who's in charge of that -- I think it takes a developer to do it, so I'd ask at meta somewhere. Are there any developers on wikibooks? [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:08, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::Might that allow for non-cookbook links to be marked as external? (the little icon after the link) I'd really like the Wikipedia links to be marked, but also any other wiki books. Anything outside the cookbook should be marked. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:26, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Pasta: one article per type? ==

Somebody just added a [[Cookbook:Macaroni|Macaroni]] stub article, currently linked only from the pasta page. This is looking like a bad trend to me. There are ''lots'' of different types of pasta, all nearly identical except for physical shape. (most of which have pseudo-Italian names, heh)

== Wikipes ==

FYI, there is another wiki site for recipes now.  It can be found at [http://wikipes.com/ Wikipes.com]. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 18:35, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Capitalisation rules? ==

Are there any rules on capitalisation of the names of articles for the Cookbook? In the Equipment section, I've found a mixture of styles. For example, stock pot could be named either ''Stock Pot'' or ''Stock pot''. I prefer the latter, but what are the rules, and should I move incorrectly names articles and the links to them? [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 03:58, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Wikipedia would use &quot;Stock pot&quot; to take advantage of an easy linking feature. You can write your link as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[stock pot]]s&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it'll work, because Wikipedia automatically uppercases the first letter. This doesn't make any sense for Wikibooks, because we nearly always must rename links with the &quot;|&quot; character anyway. We should go with what looks good for page titles, which is titlecase. Examples: &quot;Stock Pot&quot;, &quot;Fish and Chips&quot;, &quot;A Nice Cup of Tea&quot;... [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:33, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::Yeah, I understand that we can choose how the link is displayed with the | symbol. But, I'm more worried about people entering broken links in their recipes when they don't need to. For example, if I add a link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:Stock pot|some text]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in my recipe, it will not work, as the article is currently called ''Stock Pot''. I think that we need to develop guidelines on how articles should be named. Similarly, the [[Cookbook:Cutlery|Cutlery]] list only capitalises the first letter of the name, while the [[Cookbook:Pots and pans|Pots and pans]] list capitalises the first letter of all major words. I'm just saying, that we need to choose one or the other, because the current system is jarring to the reader. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 07:06, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::The point is not that we ''can'' choose how the link is displayed, but that we ''must''. (to ditch the &quot;Cookbook:&quot; prefix) This eliminates the reasons to capitalize the first (and only first) letter. People are going to add broken links no matter what. I had to add ''lots'' of redirects for deep-fat frying. This is life with a wiki that has case sensitivity enabled. Capitalization in a list need not match capitalization in the link target name. I and somebody else (redlentil? I forget) have been lowercaseing ingredients. All-lowercase is generally most readable, but sometimes keeping the link text equal to the target (minus &quot;Cookbook:&quot; of course) is easier to deal with. Cut-and-paste is easier this way. I guess what I really dislike is capitalizing ''only'' the first letter of the link target (article title) or link text. It's rather ugly. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:48, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::As you say, if we have an existing version (like ''Stock Pot''), we can simply create a redirect to it from another version (like ''Stock pot''), or vice versa. So I'll continue to use [[w:Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)]], and change the page titles of a few of my existing pages as I get a chance. I'll have to leave the decision on the global capitalisation of the category lists to others, as it's potentially a hot potato. One wonders what will happen when and if we get to drop the annoying Cookbook: prefix? I suppose that we will have to put a bit more work into it first. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Cheers, Donovan.]] 09:30, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Pulling info off Wikipedia ==

I want to fill out Cookbook with a few topics such as [[Cookbook:Pinot Noir]]. There's a article on Wikipedia for [[w:Pinot Noir]]. First of all, are there any guidelines as to what should be pulled off into a Wikibook and what should be linked? And, secondly, when using text from Wikipedia, do we need to give attribution etc.? —[[User:Christiaan|Christiaan]] 23:09, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:When using Wikipedia text, copy the article history into the new talk page. Yuck, but the GFDL supposedly requires this. As for Pinot Noir though, I don't see any reason why it would belong in the [[Cookbook]]. I don't think it belongs in the [[Bartending]] or [[Gardening]] books either. It belongs in Wikipedia. :-) Maybe something on Pinot Noir could go into the Gardening book, but then your first priority would be to cover the general practice of growning grapes. (rootstock, support wires, pruning, soil conditions, weed and pest control...) Your second priority would be anything specific to Pinot Noir, if there even is anything different about it. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:45, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

:Generally it is best to link as follows:
:*Bartending book: most stuff involving alcohol
:*Cookbook: cooking-related stuff that doesn't relate to bartending
:*Gardening book: info about growing stuff, generally linked from ingredient pages
:*Wikipedia: unusual non-cooking stuff (heart disease, Christmas, aluminum)
:*Wikipedia: tomatoes from the Cookbook:Tomato page (only), etc.
:*nowhere: boring stuff

::Thanks Albert. So what happens say when someone wants to print a Wikibook for instance, shouldn't there be a page in it that describes Pinot Noir with regard to cooking? —[[User:Christiaan|Christiaan]] 09:41, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't believe so. This is a type of grape for making wine, right? Making wine isn't really cooking. You could start a [[Winemaking]] book if you like. For cooking, there are a few recipes that say &quot;red wine&quot;. Some of those might suggest a somewhat more specific wine. I do not think it is generally appropriate for a recipe to demand a specific type of grape. A cook should pick his favorite red wine, having some appropriate balance amongst good quality, low cost, and availability. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:02, 2 May 2005 (UTC)
::::When I say Pinot I'm referring specifically to the wine as a primary food, rather than as part of a recipe. Is Cookbook restricted to recipe related information rather than cuisine in general? My impression was that it was a book on cuisine, hence we have sections such as Cuisine of New Zealand, which includes Pinot Noir wine for instance. —[[User:Christiaan|Christiaan]] 23:11, 2 May 2005 (UTC)
:::::If you mean the wine, not the grape, then that ought to go in the [[Bartending]] book. As you can see above, under the '''mixed drinks are a problem''' header, bartending is a ''big'' subject that leads to namespace conflicts. If you mean the grape though, I think you should start a [[Winemaking]] book. Go right ahead, starting with a rough table of contents and a page about Pinot Noir grapes. BTW, I do hope you have new info beyond what already exists in Wikipedia. Keeping duplicate information in sync is difficult. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:50, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
::::::I'm not talking about the grape, as I said I'm talking about the wine as a part of [[w:cuisine|cuisine]]. Would you mind answering my previous question? —[[User:Christiaan|Christiaan]] 21:30, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
:::::::Wine as part of cuisine would be a very interesting topic.  Wine/food matching, wine as an ingredient, how to host a wine tasting party, etc.  I think there is more than enough information available about wine as cuisine to fill out a chapter or section of the cookbook. As far as using wikipedia content on books, if the article is to remain on the 'pedia, provide a link back to wikipedia article, and cite it as a source, or name at least five of the principal authors of the article (although linking is easier and prefered). [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:18, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
::::::::I hope this doesn't get too elitist. I suspect that line has been crossed once you start to discuss particular varieties of grapes. Note that we don't discuss the different types of wheat, which is far more relevant to a cookbook. (there's hard wheat and soft, red wheat, winter wheat...) I have a strong feeling that the wine info could grow to be very large, while providing little real help in cooking. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:51, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
:::::::::I don't want to get fixated on wine, it was just an example. It would be very helpful if you could answer my inital question Albert. Do you consider Cookbook is restricted to recipes as opposed to the wider topic of cuisine. If you consider it to be restricted to recipes then why do we have a cuisines section? I'm equally interested in how we deal with [[Cookbook:Cervena|cervena]] (venison), [[Cookbook:Bluff_Oysters|Bluff oysters]], [[Cookbook:Paua|paua]] (abalone), [[Cookbook:Mussels|mussels]], [[Cookbook:Scallops|scallops]], [[Cookbook:Pipis|pipis]] and [[Cookbook:Tuatua|tuatua]] (both are types of [[Cookbook:New_Zealand_Shellfish|New Zealand shellfish]]); [[Cookbook:Tamarillo|tamarillo]], [[Cookbook:Sauvignon_Blanc|sauvignon blanc]], [[Cookbook:Chardonnay|chardonnay]], [[Cookbook:Pinot_Noir|pinot noir]], [[Cookbook:Pinot_Gris|pinot gris]], [[Cookbook:Cabernet|cabernets]]. All of these foods, as you may or may not know, are a central part of [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_New_Zealand|New Zealand cuisine]]. —[[User:Christiaan|Christiaan]] 13:05, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
::::::::::Oh, OK. The question is clearer now. I think a cookbook should contain recipes (obviously) and things that are closely tied to recipes. As a rough guide, ask yourself if more than one recipe would link to a particular topic. Getting back to wines (sorry) for a moment, a typical recipe might link to &quot;Red Wine&quot; and then list a few suggestions or desired qualities for the ideal choice. The cookbook does have [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]]; I suggest that you make cervena a redirect if you think it will get used. Buff oysters, assuming they ''are'' true oysters, should get a mention on the [[Cookbook:Oyster|oyster]] page. If a paua is &quot;a kind of green abalone&quot;, it should be a redirect to abalone, where it can have a section to itself if worthwhile. (see the [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]], and [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]] pages for how specific varieties can be handled) Mussels and scallops exist as &quot;[[Cookbook:Mussel|Mussel]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cookbook:Scallop|Scallop]]&quot;; add redirects (**sigh**) if you think they will get used. I guess pipis and tuatua deserve pages... they can't be classified as clams or oysters, right? I think they should get Wikipedia entries first though. Be sure to mention substitutions, because there's no way I could ever find such food at my supermarket. The tamarillo should get a page. The more popular and significant wines should get listed on the [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] page, hopefully without making the page unreadable to those who are not international wine tasters, producers, and purchasing agents. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:08, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
:::::::::::Okay cool. So in your opinion Cookbook should only cover cuisine (by this I mean &quot;describe food&quot; as opposed to recipes) in a cursory manner? Is there any page that describes what Cookbook is and what it is not? —[[User:Christiaan|Christiaan]] 17:31, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
::::::::::::I guess you could call it &quot;cursory&quot;, but that sounds a bit more extreme than I intended. Tomatoes get more than a paragraph, but not a separate page for each variety. I think that a cookbook is fundamentally about recipes, but that a cookbook with recipes alone would be awful. The other stuff is there to support the recipes. The &quot;Cuisine of Somewhere&quot; pages act as shared &quot;see also&quot; sections while also giving a bit of cultural context for serving suggestions and similar. The ingredient pages and tool pages perform similar functions, supporting the recipies with info that might be needed to use the recipes or locate similar recipes. Non-recipe pages should be helpful in finding, interpreting, using, and editing the recipe pages. I think this is the normal definition of a cookbook, so it isn't written down here. I suggest looking at several physical cookbooks in a library if you want to get a better idea. This cookbook is already a bit more detailed than most, which is nice as long as it doesn't get out of hand. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:35, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
:::::::::::::I tend to think the cookbook, gardening guide, cocktail book, etc, should all be part of a single project, distinct from Wikibooks.  Wikimedia projects all go above and beyond what a more typical reference work would do -- wiktionary has not just definition and such, but also translations into and from dozens of languages, for example.  The Cookbook/Cuisine/Gardening/Etc. book should cover everything to do with food, from growing it to preparing it to serving and eating it.  So, absolutely we should include information on different kinds of grapes (and wheat and oysters) -- whether or not this info should be part of a separate Wine book, or whatever, is a distinct issue which I don't really have an opinion on, but I do think it should be part of the same project. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:50, 5 May 2005 (UTC)
::::::::::::::Leaving wikibooks would help a bit with the &quot;special pages&quot; problem. I'd still rather just see cookbook stuff, but at least it wouldn't be mixed in with Ada and Calculus anymore. I think it is important to keep the non-recipe pages under &quot;Cookbook:&quot; related to the recipes, but Cookbook:Wine could provide links to a Wine book for those who want the complex and numerous details. It's not OK to just do a redirect, because the cookbook itself needs a short and really simple page about wine in cooking. This seems like a good time to mention a horrid project that has crossed my mind. Moving the recipes to be under &quot;Recipe:&quot; might someday be very helpful. Besides conflict reduction, a true namespace would probably make recipe-specific wiki features more implementable. Obviously I'm not about to just do this, so don't panic; it's something to think about though. The ability to rate recipes in a ''personal'' way would be useful, similar to the way a music recommendation service will suggest new songs that are highly rated by people with similar tastes to your own. Bayesean might work too, like a spam filter, but I think not as well. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:47, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

:To satisfy the GFDL, I think that you can get away with simply linking back to the original Wikipedia article, see [[Cookbook:Toaster|toaster]] for example, and use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipedia|Article name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to do it. Using the date and time of creation of your article, it's easy for others to view the content of the original Wikipedia article then (and its history before that time). Additionally, it's a good idea to note that you used material from Wikipedia in the comment for your initial edit and/or on the talk page (although, I sometimes forget to do that).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rumba is often danced as a &quot;cha cha without the cha chas&quot;, and whilst this may appear correct, there are major differences, largely in the presentation of the dance. It is known as the dance of love, danced to sexy, sultry 4/4 music at a tempo of 26/27 measures per minute (105 bpm).

==History and story of the dance==

The Rumba originated in Cuba, and tells the story of a man and a woman in love, or more aptly, lust. The man pursues the woman, flirting with her, and she flirts back, but ultimately she rejects him and casts him away.

==Mood of the dance==

This is the dance with the most sexual tension, and movements should convey this. It can either be danced with the couple in lust or love, but lust tends to appear more in competition. Eye contact is essential to convey the story.

==Basic Steps==

==General Technique Tips==

In general, basic technique for Rumba is the same as that for the [[International Latin Technique/Cha Cha Cha#General Technique Tips|Cha Cha]]. Please refer to that page for a basic knowledge. Differences are pointed out below.

===Footwork===

As the music for a rumba has a slower tempo, steps can afford to be fractionally bigger than in Cha cha, for dramatic effect. This should not be overdone, as it can still lead to a dancer chasing the music, but looks effective if correctly achieved.

There is also time for side steps to be developed more. Instead of taking a side step directly onto the ball of the foot, there is sufficient time to roll onto this from the inside edge of it, creating a softer, more sensual dance.

===Legs===

Again, legs are kept straight as much as possible throughout this dance. Tone in the leg, and a pointed foot are what create the sexuality of this dance from the waist down, and this is particularly important with the side step mentioned above. If the tone is not maintained, it can look as though the foot has become sprained, and this is unattractive.


===Hips===

Hips should be softer in Rumba than in Cha Cha. The slower music allows more time for development and hence a woman's hips can be more flowery.

===Timing===

Rumba is less staccato than Cha Cha Cha, but movements are often delayed by more advanced dancers, such as the forward step on a basic. Weight is often not transferred until as late as possible before this step is taken, and so much of the dance is spent on the supporting leg. This is however the accepted advanced technique, and does look impressive.

==Basic and Standard Figures==

===Notes===

==References==

==Introduction==
[[File:Size planets comparison.jpg|250x250px|framed|left|These planets are little bigger than dots in the night sky, but if you call them dots, then Earth(in the marble-sized group, topleft) is smaller than a grain of sand.]]
Wikijunior books welcomes you to the children's book &quot;Solar System&quot;. Outer space is perhaps the final frontier for humanity. Even though the rest of the solar system objects may seem like tiny dots from Earth, our celestial neighbors are still important to learn about. If, when you grow up, you are going to be an astronaut and travel in space, you will need to know quite a bit about the solar system. And even if you don't travel to space, the things other people do there will affect you, so you need to know about it.  Also, if you meet an astronomer or an astronaut, you do not want to sound ignorant! The importance of learning about the solar system has led many experts here at Wikijunior to donate their time and talents to bring this volume together.

Wikibooks is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, aimed at providing free, easily available, quality reading for adults and children to promote the global spread of knowledge. Traditional publishing houses make the bulk of their income from re-issues of classic books, new books by authors with long track records, or celebrities who are famous in their own right. The chances of a truly good new work being published solely on the basis of merit skyrocket when the traditional business model is overturned and the wellspring of new talent out there is tapped using the Internet.

With this project we have reached a crossroads between the books of yesterday and the encyclopedia of everything for tomorrow.  Simply by reading this book and telling others about it, you have advanced the cause of free access to information and of democratizing the field of publishing.  Thank you, and once again, welcome.

==Studying the Solar System==
[[File:1967 CPA 3496.jpg|250x300px|framed|left|A stamp issued by the Soviet Union, showing Sputnik's planned orbit path around the Earth. ]]
Scientists are still exploring the universe. Whether things are very tiny, like the cells of plants and animals, or very big like a solar system or a galaxy, there is still a lot scientists don’t know. 

Scientists who study space are called [[w:Astronomer|Astronomers]] or [[w:Astrophysics|Astrophysicists]].  They explore the solar system in two different ways.  Astronomers do it by observing celestial bodies through telescopes, while astrophysicists (a specialized class of astronomers) try to explain the observed phenomena using physics, as suggested by the name, and theorize about what is still unseen or unknown.

Telescopes were invented in the early 1600s in Europe and allowed curious scientists like Galileo Galilei to look at very distant things in close-up and see details of the solar system and the universe that nobody had ever seen before.  Using his telescope, Galileo was the first person to see the rings around Saturn, and draw a very detailed picture of the moon.  He also saw the four largest moons of Jupiter, sometimes called the Galilean moons, and saw spots on the Sun.  Telescopes on Earth and in space are still used to explore the Solar System.  There are several types of telescopes. The most common ones are optical telescopes, such as Galileo's (''optical'' means relating to light, which what these telescopes see), and radio telescopes, that pick up radio waves from outer space (radio waves occur naturally; they don't have to be made by humans).

Until the 1950s, humans were limited to exploring the Solar System from the ground. However, in 1957 the Soviet Union (now Russia and several other countries) launched the very first satellite, ''Sputnik 1'' (pronounced like ''spoo-tneek''). Since then, humans have been launching vehicles into space to explore the Solar System—some manned (with people) and some unmanned (without people).

Now, the Solar System is full of human-made probes, exploring the planets and moons of the solar system. The probes send back information to Earth that scientists study to figure out what it means. Every year, scientists are learning more about the Solar System. Sometimes they learn things about other worlds that remind us of Earth. Other times, the things they learn are very strange. Everything they learn helps us to understand more about Earth, Earth's history and Earth's neighborhood.

==How is the Solar System measured?==
It’s important that scientists use measurement to tell how big, how hot or cold, or how far away something is. In science, people use the '''metric system''', which is named after its basic unit the metre. Below is a description of all the types of measurement used in this book. 

=== Distance or length/width ===
For indication of measurements, how distant something is, or how long or wide it is, scientists use '''kilometres''' or '''metres'''. Units of the metric system (a kilometre is 1000 metres, a metre is little more than 3 feet in the old imperial unit system still in use in some regions). Kilometres is often shortened to '''km''' and metres is often shortened to '''m'''. Kilometres and metres can also be spelled as ''Kilometers'' and ''Meters'', but the International Bureau of Weights and Measurements uses the -re versions as the official spelling.

Since distances outside of the Earth get so vast, scientists have also invented new units of measurement to make it easier to measure large distances in space. They invented the '''Astronomical unit''' (㍳) which is equivalent to 149 597 871 kilometres. One Astronomical Unit is the approximate distance between the Earth and the Sun. The mean distance between the sun and Neptune (the farthest planet from the sun) is 30.1 ㍳, or 4.503 billion kilometres.  This is why it's good to use ㍳ for a big distance like that: 30 distances from the Earth to the sun is easier to understand than four and a half billion kilometres. You might not realize there was something wrong if someone told you the distance from the sun to Neptune was 45.03 million kilometres, but if you thought of it as 0.301 ㍳, you would know it couldn't be right.

In astronomy, they have leveling-up scales similar to the metric (10 mm in 1 cm, 100 cm in 1 m) and customary (12 in. in 1 ft., 3 ft. in 1 yd.) scales. Usually these distances are not used within the solar system, but they are important to know if you want to be an astronomer or astrophysicist. 
: 1 Light-year (ly)=63241.077 ㍳
: 1 Parsec (pc)=3.26 ly
: 1 Kiloparsec (kpc)=1000 pc
: 1 Megaparsec (mpc)=1000 kpc
: 1 Gigaparsec (gpc)=1000 mpc
To help you visualise just how big some of these are, 
: 4.22 ly=The distance from Earth to the nearest star (Proxima Centauri) other than the sun
: 1.3 pc=The distance from Earth to Proxima Centauri
: 34 kpc=The length of the Milky Way
: 0.76 mpc=The distance from Earth to the nearest Galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy
: 14 gpc=The radius of the observable universe

===Mass===
In order to measure how big something is, scientists measure the '''mass''' of an object in kilograms or grams. There are 1000 grams in a kilogram. Scientists do not use weight, because weight is a measurement that means how hard gravity is pulling on an object. An object’s '''mass''' is the same wherever you are in the solar system because it measures how much stuff, or matter, a thing is made up of. Your weight will change because the amount of gravity there is varies from place to place.

On Earth, mass and weight are the same. If you weigh 30kg (short for kilograms) on Earth, your mass is 30kg. If you are floating around in space, your weight if you try to stand on a set of scales will be 0kg, but your mass is still 30kg. You are still made up of the same amount of matter.

===Temperature===
Temperature is a numeric reference, in a scale of degrees, on how hot or cold something is in relation to a &quot;constant&quot; reference. There are several [[w:Temperature conversion formulas|scales]]. In our everyday lives we measure temperature in degrees Celsius, written &amp;deg;C for short (the little circle &amp;deg; means &quot;degrees&quot;); or degrees Fahrenheit, written &amp;deg;F for short.  But scientists, especially astronomers, use '''degrees Kelvin''' to measure temperature, written K for short (with no &amp;deg;).  Don't use Celsius or Fahrenheit for temperatures in astronomy!

Some important temperatures to know in Kelvin:
* 0K (−273.15&amp;deg;C) is maximum coldness, also called absolute zero.  This is a great thing about measuring temperature in Kelvin, that the number is always positive, and tells you how much warmer things are than the coldest they could possibly be.
* The freezing point of water is 273.15K (0&amp;deg;C), and the boiling point of water is 373.15K (100&amp;deg;C).
* A sunny day of 30&amp;deg;C, 86&amp;deg;F, would be 303.15K.  This is 273.15 + 30, because degrees change equally in Kelvin and Celsius.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The triple carbon bonds is formed in alkynes, due to the absence of hydrogens, thus allowing carbon bonds to become stronger, due to the nucleus central force which pulls in nearby atoms

[[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes|&lt;&lt; Alkenes]] |'''Alkynes'''| [[Organic Chemistry/Dienes|Dienes &gt;&gt;]] 

[[Image:Ethyne-2D-flat.png|right|250px]]
'''Alkynes''' are hydrocarbons containing carbon-carbon triple bond. They exhibit neither geometric nor optical isomerism. The simplest alkyne is ethyne (HCCH), commonly known as acetylene, as shown at right. 

=Multiple Bonds Between Carbon Atoms=
As you know from studying alkenes, atoms do not always bond with only one pair of electrons.  In alkenes (as well in other organic and inorganic molecules) pairs of atoms can share between themselves more than just a single pair of electrons.  Alkynes take this sharing a step further than alkenes, sharing three electron pairs between carbons instead of just two.

===Two &amp;pi; Bonds===
As you should know already, carbon is generally found in a ''tetravalent'' state - it forms four covalent bonds with other atoms.  As you know from the section on alkenes, all four bonds are not necessarily to ''different'' atoms, because carbon atoms can double-bond to one another.  What this does is create the appearance of only being bound to three other atoms, but in actuality four bonds exist.

Alkenes are molecules that consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms where one or more pairs of carbon atoms participate in a double bond, which consists of one sigma (&amp;sigma;) and one pi (&amp;pi;) bond.  Alkynes are also molecules consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, but instead of forming a double bond with only one sigma (&amp;sigma;) and one pi (&amp;pi;) bond, the alkyne has at least one pair of carbon atoms who have a &amp;sigma; and '''two''' &amp;pi; bonds -- a ''triple bond''.

The carbon-carbon triple bond, then, is a bond in which the carbon atoms share an ''s'' and two ''p'' orbitals to form just one σ and two π bonds between them.  This results in a linear molecule with a bond angle of about 180ﾟ.  Since we know that double bonds are shorter than single covalent bonds, it would be logical to predict that the triple bond would be shorter still, and this is, in fact, the case.  The triple bond’s length, 1.20Ǎ, is shorter than that of ethane and ethene’s 1.54 and 1.34 angstroms, respectively, but the difference between the triple and double bonds is slightly less than the difference between the single and double bonds.

The chemistry is very similar to alkenes in that both are formed by elimination reactions, and the major chemical reactions that alkynes undergo are addition type reactions.

===Index Of Hydrogen Deficiency===
If we compare the general molecular formulas for the Alkane, Alkene, and Alkyne families as well as the Cycloalkane and cycloalkene families we see the following relationship: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
 ! Family !! Molecular Formula
|- 
| Alkane || C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-     
|Alkene || C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;
|-     
|Cycloalkane || C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;
|-     
|Alkyne || C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n-2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-     
|Cycloalkene || C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n-2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

We see that for a ring structure or a double bond there is a difference of two hydrogens compared to the alkane structure with the same number of carbons. If there is a ring + double bond (cycloalkene) or a triple bond (alkyne) then the difference is four hydrogens compared to the alkane with the same number of carbons. We say that the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is equal to the number of pairs of Hydrogens that must be taken away from the alkane to get the same molecular formula of the compound under investigation. Every π-bond in the molecule increases the index by one. Any ring structure increases the index by one. Here is a list of possibilities: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
! Per molecule !! Index of Hydrogen Deficiency
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|One double bond  || 1
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|1 ring  || 1
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|1 double bond and 1 ring  ||  2
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|2 double bonds  ||  2
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|1 triple bond  || 2
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|1 triple bond + 1 double bond  || 3
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|3 double bonds  || 3
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|2 double bonds + 1 ring  || 3
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|2 triple bonds  || 4
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|4 double bonds  || 4
|}

Just remember that double bonds have 1 &amp;pi; bond, triple bonds have 2 &amp;pi; bonds and each &amp;pi; bond is an index of 1. 
We can use the index and the molecular formula to identify possibilities as to the exact nature of the molecule. For example, determine the molecular formula and speculate on what kind of Pi bonding and/or ring structure the molecules would have if the Index was given to be 3 and it is a 6 carbon hydrocarbon. 

Identify the Alkane molecular formula for six carbons. 
For n = 6 we would have C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;. That would be C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Since an index of 3 means that there are 3 pairs(2) of hydrogen atoms less in the compound compared with the alkane we determined in step 1, then we would have C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14-6&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. 

In speculating as to what the bonding and structure could be with an index of 3 that could mean: 
**Three double bonds in a non-cyclic structure like hexatriene 
**Two double bonds in a ring structure like a cyclohexadiene 
**One triple bond and one double bond in a non-cyclic structure 

Clearly the answer cannot be determined from the formula alone, but the formula will give important clues as to a molecule's structure.

=Cycloalkynes=

Cycloalkynes are seldom encountered, and are not stable in small rings due to angle strain.  Cyclooctyne has been isolated, but is very reactive, and will polymerize with itself quickly.  Cyclononyne is the smallest stable cycloalkyne.

Benzyne is another cycloalkyne that has been proposed as an intermediate for [[elimination-addition reactions]] of benzene.


=Preparation=

In order to synthesize alkynes, one generally starts with a vicinal or geminal dihalide (an alkane with two halogen atoms attached either next to one another or across from one another).  Adding sodium amide (NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) removes the halogens with regiochemistry subject to Zaitsev's Rule, resulting in a carbon-carbon triple bond due to the loss of both halogens as well as two hydrogen atoms from the starting molecule.  This is called a double dehydrohalogenation.

==Dehydrogenation of an alkane or alkene==
 R-R -(H^2)⇒ CH^2=CH^2

==Dehalogenation of a tetrahaloalkane==
Dehalogenation of tetrahalides in the presence of Zn yields Alkynes. When the vapors of tetrahalides are passed over heated Zinc. However this reaction is not so much useful for the preparation of Alknes. Because tetrahalides required for this reaction are prepared from alkynes. So, this reaction can be used as a purfication for the alkynes.

==Dehydrohalogenation of a dihaloalkane==

==Through Kolbe's Electrolysis==
The starting compound is a salt already containing a carbon-carbon double bond. One such compound is maleic acid. Mechanism is similar to that of formation of ethane using kolbe's electrolysis.&lt;br&gt;

 CH-COONa
 ||          (sodium maleate) (maleic acid)
 CH-COONa
 
 At Anode:                  At cathode:
 CH-COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;         2Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; 2Na
 ||
 CH-COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;         2Na + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 -&gt; 2NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 
 -2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt;
 
 CH-COO*                                    CH*           CH
 ||         -&gt;    -2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;              -&gt;     ||     -&gt;     |||
 CH-COO*                                    CH*           CH
 (free radical formation)

In this manner, alkyne is obtained at anode, while NaOH is formed at cathode and hydrogen gas is liberated.

Vicinal dihalides may be converted into alkynes by using extreme conditions such as sodium amide NaNH2 typically at 150°C or molten/fused potassium hydroxide KOH typically at 200°C.

==From Calcium carbide==

Calcium carbide is the compound CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which consists of calcium ions (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and acetylide ions, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;. It is synthesized from lime and coke in the following reaction:

CaO + 3C &amp;rarr; CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO

This reaction is very endothermic and requires a temperature of 2000&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C. For this reason it is produced in an electrical arc furnace.

Calcium carbide may formally be considered a derivative of acetylene, an extremely weak acid (though not as weak as ammonia). The double deprotonation means that the carbide ion has very high energy. Instant hydrolysis occurs when water is added to calcium carbide, yielding acetylene gas.

CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;!-- to be added --&gt;

=Properties=

==Physical properties==

Most alkynes are '''less dense than water''' (they float on top of water), but there are a few exceptions.

==Chemical properties==

Liquid alkynes are '''non-polar solvents''', immiscible with water.  Alkynes are, however, more polar than alkanes or alkenes, as a result of the electron density near the  triple bond.

Alkynes with a low ratio of hydrogen atoms to carbon atoms are '''highly combustible'''. Carbon-carbon triple bonds are highly reactive and easily broken or converted to double or single bonds. Triple bonds store large amounts of chemical energy and thus are highly exothermic when broken. The heat released can cause rapid expansion, so care must be taken when working with alkynes such as acetylene.

One synthetically important property of '''terminal alkynes''' is the acidity of their protons.  Whereas the protons in alkanes have p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'s around 60 and alkene protons have p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'s in the mid-40's, terminal alkynes have p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'s of about 25.  Substitution of the alkyne can reduce the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the alkyne even further; for example, PhCCH has a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; around 23, and Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCCH has a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; around 19.  The acidity of alkynes allows them easily to be deprotonated by sufficiently strong bases, such as butyllithium BuLi or the amide ion NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  More acidic alkynes such as PhCCH can even be deprotonated by alkoxide bases under the right conditions.

=Reactions=

Alkynes can be hydrated into either a ketone or an aldehyde form.  A (Markovnikov) ketone can be created from an alkyne using a solution of aqueous sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and HgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the anti-Markovnikov aldehyde product requires different reagents and is a multi-step process.

==Oxidative Cleavage of Alkynes==

==Hydrohalogenation of Alkynes==

Alkynes react very quickly and to completion with hydrogen halides.  Addition is anti, and follows the [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes#Markovnikov's_Rule|Markovnikov Rule]].

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
RCCH + H-Br (1 equiv) --&gt; RCBr=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
RCCH + H-Br (2 equivs) --&gt; RCBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Adding a halide acid such as HCl or HBr to an alkyne can create a geminal dihalide via a Markovnikov process, but adding HBr in the presence of peroxides results in the Anti-Markovnikov alkenyl bromide product.

==Halogenation of Alkynes==

Adding diatomic halogen molecules such as Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in 1,2-dihaloalkene, or, if the halogen is added in excess, a 1,1,2,2-tetrahaloalkane.

Adding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O along with the diatomic halide results in a halohydrin addition and an &amp;alpha;-halo ketone.

==Combustion==
Alkynes burn in air with a sooty, yellow flame, like alkanes.  Alkenes also burn yellow, while alkanes burn with blue flames.  Acetylene burns with large amounts of heat, and is used in oxyacetylene torches for welding metals together, for example, in the superstructures of skyscrapers. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; 4 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Reduction==

Alkynes can be hydrogenated by adding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a metallic catalyst, such as palladium-carbon or platinum or nickel, which results in a both of the alkyne carbons becoming fully saturated.  If Lindlar's catalyst is used instead, the alkyne hydrogenates to a Z enantiomer alkene, and if an alkali metal in an ammonia solution is used for hydrogenating the alkyne, an E enantiomer alkene is the result.

===Complete Hydrogenation of Alkynes===

As mentioned above, alkynes are reduced to alkanes in the presence of an active metal catalyst, such as Pt, Pd, Rh, or Ni in the presence of heat and pressure. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
RCCR' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Pt cat.)--&gt; RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===Syn-Hydrogenation of an Alkyne===

There are two kinds of addition type reactions where a π-bond is broken and atoms are added to the molecule. If the atoms are added on the same side of the molecule then the addition is said to be a &quot;syn&quot; addition. If the added atoms are added on opposite sides of the molecule then the addition is said to be an &quot;anti&quot; addition. Hydrogen atoms can be added to an alkyne on a one mole to one mole ratio to get an alkene where the hydrogen atoms have been added on the same side of the molecule. Isotopic identification allows chemists to determine when this syn-hydrogenation has occurred. 

As mentioned above, alkynes can be reduced to ''cis-''alkenes by hydrogen in the presence of Lindlar Pd, i.e. palladium doped with CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
RCCR + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub (Lindlar Pd)--&gt; ''cis-''RCH=CHR&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Anti-Hydrogenation of an Alkyne==
In regards to the syn-hydrogenation, anti is hydrogenation when one hydrogen is added from the top of the pi bond and the other is added from the bottom.

==Anion formation==

Because of the acidity of the protons of terminal alkynes, they are easily converted into alkynyl anions in high yield by strong bases.

'''Examples'''
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; RCCH + NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; RCCNa + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;               C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li + RCCH -&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; +RCCLi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Alkynes are stronger bases than water, and acetylene (ethyne) is produced in a science classroom reaction of calcium carbide with water.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 --&gt; Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Alkynyl anions are useful in lengthening carbon chains.  They react by [[w:nucleophilic substitution|nucleophilic substitution]] with alkyl halides.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
R-Cl + R'CCNa --&gt; RCCR' + NaCl&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The product of this reaction can be reduced to an alkane with hydrogen and a platinum or rhodium catalyst, or an alkene with Lindlar palladium.

== Description ==

The 'Pos attribute is defined for all discrete types. It is a function returning the argument's position number as a universal_integer; the prefix S must be a subtype name.
(Universal integers are implicitly converted to any specific integer type as required by the context.)

 {{Ada/kw|function}} S'Pos (Arg: S'Base) {{Ada/kw|return}} ''universal_integer'';

For enumeration types, position numbers start at 0; if the argument does not denote a valid value (perhaps because of an uninitialized 
variable), the exception Program_Error is raised.
For integer types, the attribute returns the value converted to universal_integer. Note that the actual argument need not belong to the subtype S.

Note that representation clauses do not affect position numbering. Whatever underlying value the enumerated value has, the position number will remain the same.

== Example ==

 I: Integer := -30;
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Integer'Pos(I) = -30);  {{Ada/--|of type universal_integer}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}}  (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);
 {{Ada/kw|for}}  My_Enum {{Ada/kw|use}} (Enum1 =&gt; 2, Enum2 =&gt; 4, Enum3 =&gt; 6);
 ...
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Pos(Enum1) = 2);  {{Ada/--|Wrong}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Pos(Enum1) = 0);  {{Ada/--|Right}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Pos(Enum3) = 2);
 
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} My_Enum_Sub {{Ada/kw|is}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|range}} Enum1 .. Enum2;
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum_Sub'Pos (Enum3) = 2);  {{Ada/--|Enum3 does not belong to My_Enum_Sub}}

== Description ==

'Position is a record type component attribute. It represents the address offset of the component from the beginning of the record. The value returned is represented in storage units, which is machine-specific.

== Example ==

If you declare:
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Record {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       Component1 : [[Ada Programming/Types/range|Integer]];
       Component2 : [[Ada Programming/Types/range|Integer]];
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
then 

 My_Record.Component2'Position = 1

This assumes an integer occupies one storage unit.

== Description ==

X'Pred(Y) is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any discrete type and Y is a value of that type. This attribute represents the discrete value that has a position number of one less than the input parameter.

The returned discrete value type is the base type of discrete type. If the input parameter is the {{Ada/attribute|First}} value of the discrete type, then a CONSTRAINT_ERROR [[Ada Programming/Exceptions|exception]] will be raised.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);

== What makes kitkatsavvy an Aspie ==

Hi, I am kitkatsavvy and I will list the points that make me an aspie:

I tend to obsess over mental health information.. i.e. phobias, disorders, and I was so bad that I believed everything I read and actually started 'feeling' real symptoms cause i was so absorbed in what i was reading.

I have a very good concentration span. I haven't timed it but once I spent 10 hours making a model without any breaks.  I could go longer but I love my sleep.

I can sight-read music VERY VERY well (on brass instruments that is - I'm a brass player).  Some people have told me I'm gifted in it, but all I see is just that the notes are just mathematical symbols in the language of music.

I am a very honest person and I don't know how to lie because I don't know how to read body language very well and I always give myself away if I lie anyway.

This isn't a direct one.. but I don't drink because I don't see the point of people drinking alcohol and then spewing up.. WHY?

Certain high pitched noises such as fire alarms, mobile phone ringtones, people touching me when I don't know they are there etc., make me JUMP in the air because I am very sensitive to sounds like that.

== What makes Sibylle an Aspie ==

Well, what is it that makes me an Aspie?

I have a hell of a time if somebody does things different than I do, especially when it is at my home. I used to think this is because I think things through and do them on a logical way, but now I think it is more likely because of Aspergers.
I have a hard time watching someone's eyes. I got used to it, but when I'm tired it gets harder to do (some people are easy and some are very hard work to watch their eyes).
I used to believe every word exactly as it was said when I was younger. When I found out that people almost always do kind of comforting lies, I began to be very critical on everything someone sais and try to find out what his or her intentions might be.
I need to think about peoples motives instead of just feeling them, but then I got quite fast in that so nowadays almost nobody notices.
I had to learn to smile, frown and make the face that would meet my feelings when I was a teenager. I found out at that time that my face did not look as lifely as anyone else's face (especially of cause actresses faces) seemed to look like and so I sat down in front of a mirror and tried out what looks I liked and what not.
Whatever I'm interested in, starts to become an obsession after a short while. I got so much things now, I had to drop a lot of them because I don't have enough time. I try to know everything about a subject I'm interested in. Over the years this have been: cats, dogs, wool/spinning/weaving, pottery, doing water color paintings, doing portraits (very hard thing to watch a face for such a long time), gardening/plants, biology (especially genetics), kids (when I started to have some), healthy food and a lot more I forgot over the years.
I feel uncomfortable in any crowd (that is more than at least 6 people). And I have the biggest personal space of all people I know, that means when talking to someone else it's me who walks backwards to keep distance.
There are times that I think it would be ok if one put me in single-prison, giving me enough to eat, all the books I want and a computer with internet. But then I remember I would miss my garden-plant-obsession thing, so this is no option.
I put a lot of time and work into being able to act normal only to be accepted when I was a child and teenager, but never was.
I am very sensible to smell and it makes me sick going to a perfumery or smelling someone's aftershave/perfume too intense (well, I can smell it even when nobody else does, so it's me and not only people who put on too much of that stuff), on the other hand I love smelling flowers and natural odours (no, not the ones sweating men produce) like grass and the woods after rain and so on. I'm also sensible to certain sounds.</text>

__TOC__

== Description ==

The meaning of the [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] depends on the meaning of the prefix X.

If X is a scalar subtype, X'Range represents the range of valid values for that subtype, i.e. it is the same as the subtype itself.

If X is a constrained array subtype or an array object, X'Range denotes the index range of X.

In any case, X'Range is equivalent to X'{{Ada/attribute|First}} .. X'{{Ada/attribute|Last}}, but X is only evaluated once.

If X is multidimensional, the attribut needs a ''static'' parameter N to identify the N-th index; 'Range (1) is the same as 'Range.

X'Range (N) is equivalent to X'{{Ada/attribute|First}}(N) .. X'{{Ada/attribute|Last}}(N), but X is only evaluated once.

== Examples ==

 type T is range 1..10;  -- T'Range is equal to T

 type A is array (T) of S;                  -- these three     A'Range is the same as T
 type A is array (T'Range) of S;            -- declarations
 type A is array (T'First .. T'Last) of S;  -- are equivalent
 
 type B is array (T range &lt;&gt;) of S;  -- B'Range is illegal (B is unconstrained)
 subtype SB is B (2 .. 5);           -- SB'Range is the same as 2 .. 5
 
 type M is array (Boolean, T) of S;  -- M'Range is equivalent to M'Range (1), which is Boolean
                                     -- M'Range (2) is the same as T
 
 OA: A;           -- OA'Range is the same as T
 OB: B (2 .. 5);  -- OB'Range is equal to 2 .. 5

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Stack-based representation ===
In this chapter, we discuss the stack-based representation of intermediate code. It has a number of advantages, some of which are:
* An interpreter for the stack-based language tends to be more compact and straightforward.
* A syntax of the language tends to be simple.

But the representation also has the following disadvantages, which make it unsuitable for manipulating and improving code:

* It is not trivial to change the order of instructions.
* Little research has been done to the stack-based code.

Complications with the stack-based code arises often with control flows.

==== Conversion algorithms ====
It is usually trivial to convert representations like three-address code to the stack-based code, so the case is left as an exercise. It is the inverse of this that is a challenging problem.

The main task behind the algorithm converting the stack-based code is to identify dependencies among operations. And it is conditional and unconditional jumps that make hard to figure these dependencies. So the code without them can be transformed into the three-address code in a straightforward way, as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
push 2
push 3
push 4
add
mul
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can see each stack position has a corresponding temporary variable. Put in another way, store and load are done only by push and pop, respectively, and a temporary variable that can be accessed at a time is limited to only the top as opposed to a usual case in which variables are specified freely.

&lt;pre&gt;
s0 = 2
s1 = 3
s2 = 4
s1 = s1 + s2
s0 = s0 * s1
&lt;/pre&gt;

When a variable is typed, it may be beneficial to adopt [[Compiler construction: static single assignment form|SSA form]]. This dispenses with the need to analyze what type each variable holds at a moment, which, as illustrated below, can be quite tricky. The adaptation can be done after the conversion or simultaneously as the code is being converted.

Now, suppose the execution may not go from top to bottom. In that case, we basically have to analyze the control flow before translating the code. More specifically, we calculate how each instruction contributes to the depth of the stack. For example,

&lt;pre&gt;
...
goto A // unconditionally jump to label A
...
A:    // a label
add  // push the sum of two values popped from the stack.
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

As we can see, at label A, the status of the stack depends on the operation before instruction &quot;goto A&quot;. 

One conservative approach is to annotate the byte-code before converting it. The basic idea is that when we interpret the code, we know both where we are and how tall the stack is. So by pretending as if we were evaluating the code, we can calculate the height of the stack for each position. An algorithm for this would be like (in actual writing one has to arrange the code so that it will terminate.):

 '''procedure''' eval(start, depth)
 {
   '''for''' i '''from''' start '''to''' code.length
   {
     depth_at[i] = depth
     '''case''' code[i]
     {
       'push': depth = depth + 1
       'pop':  depth = depth - 1
       'goto': i = code[i].target
       'if_so_goto': eval(code[i].target, depth)
       ...
     }
   }
 }

 eval(0, 0) // start the calculation

Coding the above solution may be tedious in practice, especially when a number of instructions in the language is large. Java byte code is a notable example of this. So a radical alternative below is to convert the stack-based code not in the usual sequential way but per basic block (i.e., a block that has no jumps). To see this, consider the following:

 0 (A): push 10
 1 (A): push 13
 2 (A): less_than // pop &lt; pop
 3 (A): if_not_goto 6
 4 (B): push '10 &lt; 13'
 5 (B): goto 7
 6 (C): push 'it is not 10 &lt; 13; your computer is broken!'
 7 (C): print

In the above we can identify three basic blocks: the first (A) from 0 to 3, the second (B) from 4 to 5 and the third (C) from 6 to 7. We first compile A, then we know the height of the stack with which either B or  C begins. After each block is compiled, we output blocks in the order they appear in the source code.

--------
Astute readers would notice that throughout this section we are assuming the depth of the stack is fixed at each instruction position and thus can be determined at compiler time. If the assumption does not hold, then we have to have some kind of stack at runtime.

==== Exercises ====
# Write the stack-based code for each of following high-level expressions:
#*10 * (20 + 30);
#*If a &lt; b then -a else -b;
#*case a % 3 { 0: x; 1: y; 2: z; }
# Write a piece of stack-based code so that the depth of the stack may vary after the piece, depending on an execution path.
# Sketch the algorithm for converting three-address code to the stack-based code, assuming no jumps. Hint: view each position in the stack has a corresponding temporary variable.
# Write a stack-based code such that the height of the stack at each position cannot be determined at a compiler time.

I'm inserting some preliminary information on hybridization into the article, as requested on the organization page. I'm not really sure how to do the fancy formatting stuff, I did as well as I could.  What's a good way to explain why the atoms hybridize? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 03:42, 23 August 2006 (UTC)


Please be aware that HYBRIDIZATION and MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY are two entirely DIFFERENT CONCEPTS. You currently have them lumped together in the same discussion, but they are not the same.

==Molecular Orbitals==
The molecular orbitals sections seems to be very incomplete and confused; it uses models for orbital hybridization, which, as previously pointed out, are not the same thing as Molecular Orbital Theory, and also seems to be referring to the allocation of electrons within a single atom's orbitals, rather than hybridized orbitals.

'''Pennsylvania Pot Pie''' is a Pennsylvania Dutch soup, with meat, vegetables, and squares of pie crust.

==Ingredients==
Dumplings/noodles:
* 2 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 t [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 t ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 c [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 1/3 c plus 1 T cold water
Soup:
* 2 quarts water
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]]
* 1 to 3 lb. stewing [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* salt and pepper to taste

==Procedure==
#Boil chicken in water until tender.
#Meanwhile, prepare noodle dough following the first 5 steps of [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|Flaky Pie Crust]] procedure, from the ingredients above.  ''Note: [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] are replaced with pepper and shortening, respectively.''
#On a floured board, roll dough about twice as thick as ordinary pie crust (about a 9&quot; circle or 8&quot; x 10&quot; rectangle).
#Cut dough into roughly 2&quot; squares.
#Remove chicken from broth.  Shred chicken, discarding bones and skin.
#Stir pot pie squares into boiling broth a few at a time, being careful not to let them stick together.  Simmer 6 minutes.
#Add chicken and green beans.  Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
#Remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Note: Pot pie squares will dissolve into the broth around the edges, but remain relatively firm in their centers.  This is normal.
*A range of fresh vegetables including fresh green beans, cubed [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], finely diced [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], etc. can be added after the chicken if cooking times are planned carefully.
*Cooked chicken or [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], or bite-sized pieces of [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] can be substituted for the raw chicken.  In this case, substitute chicken [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]] for water.

I do wish you at least reconsider your vote. We need more admins around, and Geo would be great for the job. Lots of mistakes can be made, it's part of the [[w:Be bold|Be bold]] spirit. I think what's more important is that you noticed the mistake, changed it, and didn't have to get in an edit war over it. (Such an edit war would have been much more negative, and if I heard of that I probably would change my vote to a negative too!-- but that's not the case here.) Thanks.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Messi. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Messi~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two main methods of facilitating a freewheel mechanism in a bike's drivetrain.  Either with a freewheel that threads onto the hub or a cassette that slides on to the freehub body.  In the former, the cogs and freewheel mechanism are part of the same object, the freewheel.  A '''cassette tool''' (also called a '''freewheel remover''') is used to spin the freewheel off the hub.  With the cassette system, the cogs are separate from the freewheel which is housed in the freehub body.  The cassette tool is used in conjunction with a [[Bicycle Repair/Chain whip|chain whip]] to remove the cassette lockring from the freehub body.

[[Image:Blender_softbody_donut.jpg|thumb|300px|The donut falls on the plane.]]

''A quick softbody tutorial just to demonstrate the new system. Needs some work.''

The softbody system in Blender makes each edge of your object behave like a spring, and gives each vertex a weight.  It is thus a very effective way to simulate physics.  The easiest (and coolest :) way to explain it is to give a demonstration.

We'll make a donut shape, and then make it springy and let it drop onto a plane.

Donut shape:  Ctrl-x for a new blender file if you haven't already.  Be sure to delete the default cube, you won't be needing it.  Goto the front view and add a circle with 8 vertices.  Move the circle 5 squares to the right (holding down ctrl).  Top view, press F9, and in the Mesh Tools window (in editmode) set Degr to 360, Steps to 8 and Turns to 1, make sure the 3D cursor is at the origin, and hit Spin.  Select all vertices, and hit Rem Doubles.  Turn on Subsurf, (which I won't bother mentioning is a modifier, found in the modifiers/shapes panel, inside the editing window) and set it to 2 iterations.  We have achieved donut.

Add a plane (as a separate object) under the donut, and scale it up so that the donut has something to fall on to.  It should be about 3 grid units under the donut.  Press F7 and find the Particle tab, then turn on Deflection.  This will make our donut bounce off the plane.

Select the donut again.  Press F7 and find the Softbody tab.  Hit Enable SoftBody and set Grav to 9.8 (this puts a downward force on each vertex).  Turn off Use Goal (Goals are used to give each vertex a (partly) predefined position, and are too complicated for this tutorial) and turn on Stiff Quads.  Hit Alt-A to animate... amazing! :)

Now some fiddling with the settings... Put E Stiff up to 0.9 to get a nice jelly effect.  Alt-A again.  With some objects (e.g., spheres, cylinders), if E Stiff is too low the object will collapse.  This can be remedied by putting edges inside the object (i.e. through the volume) to help them keep their shape.  Stiff Quads means that quads (the four-sided faces) get diagonal springs to help keep them in shape too... (insert joke about quads and working out here :).  

There is huge potential in the softbody system.  Try rotating the donut and the plane to get the donut to roll along the plane :)   Things tend to roll better if softbody damping on the Deflection tab is turned up high.

To see a collapsing object, use a cylinder instead of a donut.  

As of version 2.37a, Blender has no support for softbodies colliding into other softbodies.  

Note also that the normal of the plane must be pointing towards the donut.

Mambo users are the same as logins, and can be used to many great things. Here is an explanation of the management of users, not what you can use the user system for.

== Basics of user management ==

There is not much that you can do with mambos integrated user management. You can add or edit users, force logout of users, apply global checkins and mass mail user groups. That is pretty much it, here is an explanation of each.

All these actions are done in the backend.

===Add, edit or remove a user===

Go to &quot;site &gt; user manager&quot; in the drop-down menu. There, you will get a list of all the users in the database. In the toolbar, press new, delete or edit to do the corresponding action.

Note: if you delete a user, you cannot revert it unless you have a backup of the xxx_users table in the database.

===Global checkin===

If items are erroneously checked out, you can perform a [[Mambo Open Source/Global Checkin|global checkin]] with the &quot;system &gt; global checkin&quot; function in the drop down menu. Now, all items will be checked out.

==Extended user management==

A text about the possibilities to extend user management will come here (components, hacks etc).</text>

This is an explanation on how to create a module. The functions of the module will be very limited, but this article shows you a little bit about the framework of modules.

==Creating the files==

For this module you will need two files: ''mod_testing.php'' and ''mod_testing.xml''. Create these two files and move on to the next step.

The PHP parameters are values that can be changed in Mambo's admin interface, with no need of coding etc.

==The XML file==

The xml file is a reference file for Mambo that gives mambo info about author of the modules, the parameter list, installation guides and so on.</text>

Marksmanship refers to the art or skill of using a firearm, such as a rifle or a pistol.

== Marksmanship principles ==

===Fundamentals overview===

The basic fundamentals of marksmanship can be described in a number of ways.

Possibly the most succinct version of the principles of marksmanship is that used by the British and Australian Army:

# The position and hold must be firm enough to support the weapon.
# The firearm must point naturally at the target without physical effort.
# Sight alignment must be correct.
# The shot must be released and followed through without disturbance to your shooting position. 

The US Army similarly breaks marksmanship principles into four fundamentals, however states them more verbosely:

*Steady position - Regardless of stance or position, the weapon must be held the same way for each shot and in a manner that will facilitate the least wobble (natural movement of the body as indicated by the sights.)  The basic method of firing taught to novice-level shooters and soldiers is the prone supported position; that is, on your stomach with the position supported by another object, usually a sandbag.
*Aiming - Sight Alignment (the relationship of the front and rear sight or clear, centered reticle in an optical sight) is most important to accuracy as it helps eliminate angular error.  The aligned sights placed on target is Sight Picture.  The front sight or reticle should always be positioned in the same spot. These two factors ensures that shots fired, if the other fundamentals are correctly applied, will hit in the same general area. Normally a center hold (center mass of the target) is preferred but other hold points may be used.
*Breathing Control - [Not everyone agrees that this is] The least important factor.  Normally, the firer should press the trigger during the natural pause after exhalation. The breathing sequence should be as follows: inhale, exhale, hold, squeeze.
*Trigger Control - The trigger is the interface between shooter and &quot;machine&quot;, and therefore requires careful attention.  The shooter must smoothly squeeze the trigger straight back with increasing pressure without attempting to anticipate when the round will fire.  Once the grip/hold is achieved, only the index finger of the shooting hand moves during the trigger squeeze.  During initial training a marksman should strive for a &quot;surprise break.&quot;  There is no &quot;wrong&quot; way to place the index finger on the trigger provided that the shooter is able to consistently move the trigger straight rearward.  Begin with the pad of the trigger finger and adjust positioning as needed.

===Stance or position overview===

The weapon should point toward the target, without effort or strain. The ideal position is attained by &quot;natural point of aim&quot; in which no undue muscular tension is required to keep the sights on target.

In order to ascertain the natural point of aim (POA) and to adjust the natural POA to the desired POA the shooter undertakes a procedure called &quot;test and adjust&quot;.

The test portion consists of the shooter closing their eyes and relaxing the grip on their weapon while still holding it in the firing position. The shooter then re-firms his grip and opens his eyes. Where the sights are now pointing is the natural POA. 

To adjust the natural point of aim when shooting from the standing or squatting position, the shooter alters his/her position by moving his/her feet. With other positions, the shooter moves their body. For example, in the sitting position the shooter would move their backside. In the kneeling position the rear leg/foot is moved. Moving back foot (standing) or body (prone) forward generally lowers the point of aim. Moving it rearward raises the point of aim. Similarly, moving the rear foot or body to the right moves the point of aim left and vice versa. The shooter continues to test and adjust until the the natural POA coincides with the target.

===Fundamentals of Rifle Marksmanship===

; Breathing Control : Oxygen deficit leads to an unsteady hold as the muscles require more oxygenated blood.  Therefore, the trigger should be pressed at a point in the respiration cycle (inhale, hold, exhale) when the shooter is steadiest.  Various techniques work for different individuals: usually after exhaling half a breath or exhaling the entire breath.  Since it is almost impossible to measure half a breath with consistency, the latter technique is most popular. 

; Support : The rifle is held at two points: with the firing hand and with the support hand.  The firing hand not only grasps the portion of the stock around the trigger group, but exerts steady rearward pressure into the “pocket” of the shoulder.  The support elbow is held directly under the rifle, without a hard grip by the hand which may introduce lateral “wobble”.
The rifle should never directly be rested on a hard surface  such as a vehicle roof, window frame, rock or sandbag wall. Instead the support hand should rest on the hard surface and the rifle should rest on the support hand. The reason for this is that laying the rifle directly on a support will introduce changes to the vibration pattern of the rifle when firing. Placing the hand between the rifle and the support surface, reduces (but does not eliminate) the changes to the vibration patterns of the weapon.

; Cheek Weld : Consistency in sighting begins with proper “cheek weld”, positioning the cheek at the same place along the stock.  Besides before and after placement of the “weld”, it also determines the height of the eyes in relation to the sights or scope.

; Natural Point of Aim : Every marksman has a natural point of aim (NPOA), the optimum position of the body in any shooting stance.  For instance, in prone, the shooter aligns himself with the target in such a manner that his sights rest comfortably on the bull’s eye without excessive muscular tension to maintain a desired sight picture.  The position may be “fine tuned” by subtle movement of the arms, elbows, or feet.  NPOA can easily be checked by finding a comfortable position with sights properly aligned, then closing both eyes.  Inhale and exhale.  When the eyes are opened, the sight picture should remain unchanged.  If not, adjust as necessary.

; Sight Alignment 
: With metallic sights, proper alignment with &quot;U&quot; notch sights places the front sight post squarely within the “notch” of the rear (square) sight. The top of the front sight should remain even with the top of the rear sight, with equal “daylight” on either side of the front site within the notch. If the rear sight is a peep sight ( circular aperture) or “ghost ring”, the tip of the front sight should be centered in relation to the circle.  When shooting at longer distances, the rear sight will be elevated to compensate for the bullet’s ballistic “drop”, but the sight picture should always remain the same.  Make everything consistent.
: With optical sights, such as telescopes, proper alignment is obtained when there is no dark portion or “shadow” at any point in the circumference of the field of view.  This will ensure that you are always sighting through the center of the scope.

; Sight Picture : Sight picture is the placement of the sights (properly aligned) in relation to the target.  In most formal competition, the desired sight picture is the front post tangent to the bottom of the bull’s eye, yielding a “six o’clock hold”.  The six o’clock is almost universally preferred to placing the front sight at the intended point of impact in the center of the target because the resultant picture is inevitably inconsistent. At the time the shooter fires the shot, the tip of the foresight should be in clear focus. This will render the rest of the sight picture blurry. This ensures correct sight alignment.
   
; Trigger Control : Trigger control is commonly considered the easiest aspect of marksmanship to explain and the most difficult to accomplish.  A perfect release or “break” results from steadily 'squeezing' the trigger straight back (usually with the pad of the trigger finger, not at the first joint, although the firing of a revolver in double action may typically be descibed as using the first joint) with no lateral pressure.  It should occur at an instant when the shooter does not expect the rifle to discharge, resulting in a “surprise break” that is immune to anticipation or “flinch” that disturbs the sight picture. More in depth, the ability to control trigger &quot;creep&quot;, as in the dead space before the trigger works the action; overtravel, the distance the trigger travels rearward after it causes the action to fire the gun; reset, the minimal forward movement of the trigger to be made ready to fire again.

; Follow Through : Follow through is important in developing consistency.  While the bullet leaves the rifle’s barrel within milli-seconds of ignition, the shooter benefits from “staying on the target ” in order to determine where the round likely struck.  With experience, shooters can tell with extreme precision whether the projectile has struck the target or elsewhere.

'''Pistol Marksmanship'''

Line of Sight: Some shooters consider aiming with a pistol more challenging than with a rifle due to the smaller sight radius - the distance between the rear and fore sights. The key is, as with shooting rifles, is to line up the front notch at the front of the pistol's slide within the two rear notches at the back of the pistol's slide. Do this, and almost every time your shot will hit its mark.

Control: Many shooters have problems with controlling the recoil of a pistol. This problem is not as often shared by rifle shooters due to the energy of the recoil of their rifles dissipating against their shoulders. However, when shooting a pistol it is far more difficult to control the weapon when it is just held by your hands as it often recoils up and back at the same time.

Posture/Stance: When firing a sidearm it is important, as with firing any weapon, to maintain a proper firing stance at all times. There are several wrong shooting stances that many shooters use obliviously. One common one is that of a shooter holding the pistol and slightly leaning away from the pistol as if afraid it will spring back and hit them in the face. This will not happen unless you let the pistol fly out of your grasp, or place your self directly behind it. A correct shooting stance includes a firm two handed grip, strong hand extending out towards target with the &quot;weak&quot; or support hand slightly pulling rearward as to &quot;lock&quot; in a stable platform for the pistol, knees bent and feet approximately shoulder width apart, upper body slightly leaning forward into firearm. By leaning forward, with the firearm held in such a manner the arms are stable and take up recoil better than not having a fully extended arm, the upper body also dissipates recoil much better, in conjunction with slightly bent knees and proper foot placement creating a very suitable firing platform for a the pistol. Resulting in an improvement in accuracy, and with better recoil management, the ability to put faster follow up shots on target

===Rifle shooting positions===

There are four basic positions for shooting rifles or carbines.

*Standing or offhand: Erect on both feet with the rifle supported by the strong hand and the support hand.  This is the fastest position to assume but is the least steady.

*Kneeling: Generally with one knee on the ground and the support elbow resting atop (improperly) or (preferably) slightly forward of the elevated knee.  Steadier than offhand and faster than sitting or prone.

*Sitting: Two variants include &quot;open legged&quot; or &quot;cross legged&quot; (ankles apart or overlapping) with both elbows supported on the knees or thighs.  The best all-round supported position, as it permits a fast, steady platform suitable to rough terrain. 

*Prone: Lying on one's stomach with the support hand beneath the rifle.  Feet may be splayed or closer together but most shooters find it helpful to bring the strong-side knee forward. The steadiest position, but requires more time to assume than any other and may be unsuitable for some terrain or where ground cover obscures the target.

Other nonstandard positions include the squat (&quot;rice paddy prone&quot;), &quot;speed kneeling&quot; with both knees on the ground, and &quot;supine&quot;, where the firer lies on his/her side, with the rifle lying on the bent lower leg; the sight is usually mounted on the end of the stock and as such the rifle is designed to be shot in this position only.

===Grip or hold===

The grip or hold depends on the shooting discipline (i.e. what is allowed under the rules of competition) and what is practical.  For instance, in the IPSC pistol discipline, the most used grip is two handed, although some stages will be designed such that the shot must be taken with either the weak or the strong hand only.

When gripping a handgun, &quot;shake hands&quot; with the grip.   Take a firm and high grip, wrapping the three lower fingers around the grip with the trigger finger resting along the slide away from the trigger and trigger guard.

When using iron sights, the firer must focus on the tip of the foresight at the moment they release the shot.
The rear sight and the target itself will not be in focus.
This assists in assuring correct sight alignment.

==Accuracy &amp; Precision==
Two methods of looking at the success of a shot group involve accuracy and precision, where accuracy is defined as 'the ability of a measurement to match the actual value of the quantity being measured,' and precision is defined as 'the ability of a measurement to be consistently reproduced' (www.dictionary.com).

===Precision===
Precision also referred to as &quot;intrinsic accuracy&quot;, is measured by the group, where hitting close to bulls eye does not affect precision rather than the fact that all bullets in the group landed very close to one another.
Hence, the smaller or &quot;tighter&quot; the group, the better the Precision.

Major factors that affect precision are:
* shooting position
* the rifle
* the shooter
* the weather (within the span of the group)
* ammunition  (especially in competitions, and surgical sniping. However, ALL firearms have particular likes and dislikes, causing malfunctions for even the highest quality ammunition. It's up to the firearm owner to test for what his or her firearm can reliably feed and function with while using)
* elevation
* humidity
* Coriolis effect
* breathing pattern
* parallax (scoped rifle)
* execution of proper marksmanship fundamentals

The intrinsic accuracy (precision) of each of these components can be measured separately.  The typical unit of measurement for rifles and scopes is MOA (Minute of Angle).  There are 360 degrees in a full circle and 60 minutes per degree.

&quot;Mechanical Accuracy&quot; refers to the accuracy of the rifle and the ammunition.  For example, if a rifle is capable of performing at 0.5 MOA, but the ammunition you are using is only capable of 1.1 MOA, the ammunition is the limiting factor.  But this will be of little consequence if the shooter is only capable of 4 MOA.
The intrinsic accuracy of the combination of shooter, rifle and ammunition can be no better than the intrinsic accuracy of the worst performing of these components.  Therefore, in this example the combination of rifle, ammunition and shooter can never be better(lower) than 4 MOA.  The best intrinsic accuracy of the worst performing component.

We have the least control over the weather and other environmental factors.  We have the most control over the accuracy of the individual shooter.  Do not be overly concerned about upgrading your rifle or ammunition (to a lower MOA) until your own MOA approaches a similar degree of accuracy.

The intrinsic accuracy of all these components is measured by the tightness of the group as discussed below.

===Accuracy===
The ability to hit the target (as opposed to shooting a small group) is probably the more commonly perceived measure of accuracy amongst new or non shooters. I refer to this ability to hit the target as practical accuracy, because, generally speaking in field shooting, hitting the target is the point of the practice of shooting.
This accuracy is a measure of the shooter's ability to cause the group to hit the target, by adjusting the point of aim.  
The operation or exercise of causing the group to fall on the target, by adjusting the point of aim is called &quot;application of fire&quot;. Also you must know as with any weapon when firing and aiming for your target you must know that the bullet gradually moves downward when fired so when aiming at a target it's best to aim a little above it to get a accurate shot at your target.

===Precision Leads to Accuracy===
Without precision, or repeatability of the above-mentioned components of precision, a high degree of accuracy is nearly impossible.  In order to accurately strike a target, the shooter must adjust the aim to account for several variables, and to the extent the repeatability of the firearm or conditions is poor, this adjustment becomes correspondingly uncertain --- in other words, with poor precision the shooter simply will have to guess.  For example, suppose a given cartridge produces a wide and unpredictable variation in muzzle velocity, and that all other elements of the firearm are highly precise.  In this case, the shooter has very little idea of where the shot will go, as the amount of drop for which to compensate is highly uncertain, and the shooter will simply have to hope for the best.

===Maximum effective range vs. accuracy===	 
Firearms are considered ineffective beyond the distance a carefully fired shot is guaranteed to strike the target. At longer ranges, a miss could occur that might endanger the marksman's mission. In those instances, other weapons may be preferred over marksmen/snipers equipped with special sniper rifles, even though the situation may be an otherwise ideal job for a sniper.

For example, in counter-sniper roles a sniper might spot a target that is out of range for a sniper rifle, and so the sniper may need to call upon a machine gunner to attack it. A machine gun using the same ammunition as the sniper rifle can be effective at a much greater range due to lower accuracy requirements for effective use.


Here is a simplified example to illustrate why, counter-intuitively, a less accurate weapon of the same calibre may actually have a greater effective range than a sniper rifle: 
For human targets in military sniping, snipers aim at a &quot;target circle&quot;. The equations that describe the approximate relationships between range, accuracy, and the target circle, as used in this section, are as follows:
* (Target circle (inches) / Accuracy (MOA - Minute Of Angle) * 100 = Range meters
* (Range meters * Accuracy (MOA) / 100) = Target circle inches

Also note that &quot;target circle&quot; is used exclusively even when &quot;cone of fire&quot; or &quot;group size&quot; may technically be more accurate. These terms have subtle differences that are not important for the purpose of this section, and they are left out to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity in illustrations and examples that have been intentionally simplified.

The target circle is typically about 8 inches in diameter, corresponding to an imaginary circle on the vital area of a person's chest. For a common sniper rifle capable of 1 MOA accuracy, the maximum effective range (the range at which the bullet impact point is guaranteed to be within an 8-inch circle on the first shot) is about 800 meters.	 


In contrast, a machine gun using the same ammunition with a low accuracy of only 6 MOA will typically have a greater maximum effective range of about 1,100 meters. At that range and accuracy, a machine gun has a larger target circle of about 66 inches. The machine gun's target circle is much larger due to its rapid fire capability, which allows a machine gun to strike with one or more hits and numerous misses at random locations within the target circle.

While a machine gun's large target circle means that its effective range can be longer than a sniper rifle's, note that the design of a weapon is more likely to determine its effective range than the maximum range of its ammunition. The maximum range of common 7.62 × 51 mm NATO ammunition is a comparatively large 3,725 meters, and both machine guns and sniper rifles are not able to use even half of the maximum range of the ammunition effectively, largely due to unpredictable atmospheric disturbance of the bullet's flight path. The maximum range is much larger than the maximum effective range. The corresponding disadvantage is that the machine gun may need to fire dozens, and perhaps hundreds of rounds before scoring a hit.

== Theory of the Group ==

=== What is a Group?===

A group is defined as a series of shots fired at the same POA, or point of aim, from the same position and hold. Generally speaking three shots is the minimum considered necessary to form a group and groups of three, five, ten or more are commonly used for measuring accuracy for testing and comparative purposes.
Generally speaking the more shots fired in a group, the more useful the data is for comparative purposes.

Certain shooting disciplines, styles, shooter accuracy, or experience may define the number of shots required for a group in their competitions or practice (as in teaching trigger control).It may also benefit newer shooters to use a higher round count group, to increase their probability at placing multiple rounds together(encuraging confidence) , and highlighting the ones that have &quot;pulled&quot;, to reinforce what has been learned earlier in the fundamentals.  

====How is a group measured====

The group is a measure of the angular dispersion of a series of rounds. There are two methods commonly used to describe a group:

* The first and perhaps easier to understand for the lay person is the absolute size of the group and the range. E.g. &quot;4 inch group at 100 yards&quot;.

* The second and more succinct method is to simply state the angular dispersion of the rounds in the group as an angle. The usual units for this  are &quot;minutes of angle&quot; (MOA). A minute of angle is 1/60th of a degree of angle.

It is important to remember that both methods describe the same thing, i.e. the angular dispersion of the shots.
Generally speaking MOA is the preferred way to describe a group as it is a single range neutral number.

For most purposes shooters approximate 1 MOA to be a group of 1 inch at 100 yards which is accurate enough for all but the most precise measurements.

Note however that the size of a group may vary at different ranges, e.g. a rifle may fire 4 MOA at 100 m but fire 2 MOA at 600 m. Reasons for this might include different stability at different ranges in the trajectory.
However despite this when comparing accuracy it is usual to discuss the size of the group at a given range, often 100 m.
Also despite the fact that, in reality, the accuracy of a rifle may vary at different ranges, it is common to interpolate the accuracy of a rifle at one range from the known accuracy at another range.
I.e. it is commonly assumed that a rifle that shoots 1 MOA when measured at 100 yards, i.e. a 1 inch group at 100 yards, will still shoot 1 MOA at 200 yards, i.e. a 2 inch group at 200 yards.

====How is a group useful?====
As indicated above, the group is the measure of the intrinsic accuracy of a rifle, ammunition, shooter or some other component in the shooting combination in a given set of conditions.
By this we mean the accuracy potential of the combination when ignoring, removing or otherwise canceling, as far as possible (perhaps by conducting all testing in the same environment at the same time), external factors, such as weather.

=== What exactly does the group measure? ===

The size of the group is in fact a measure of the &lt;i&gt;consistency&lt;/i&gt; of rifle, ammunition and shooter.
The smaller the group, the more potentially accurate the variable or variables being measured.
This is because the smaller the group is the greater the chance of a round striking the same place as previous shots fired in the group.
Here's the way to measure a group accurately: You need a caliper (digital-readout calipers are much easier to use than dial-readout models) and the ability to subtract. First, measure the outside spread of the two widest shots in the group. Then, subtract from that figure the diameter of the bullet you're shooting. Let's say you take your .270 and shoot a group that measures 1.313 inches. Subtract from it .277, which is the actual diameter of the bullet, and you get 1.036 inches, which is your group size.

===What does a group NOT measure?===

A group does not measure the ability of a rifle/marksman/ammunition or any other single component or combination of components to actually hit a target.

== Theory of Small Arms Fire ==

The accuracy of small arms fire is affected by several factors. These include:
* The inherent mechanical accuracy of the rifle,
* The inherent mechanical accuracy of the ammunition
* The firer's ability
* Weather conditions

===Mechanical Accuracy of Weapon===
The mechanical accuracy of the rifle is affected by several factors including:
* The quality of manufacture, eg the closeness and consistency of the construction.
* The design of the rifle, including the stiffness of the barrel, the action, the amount of play if any between components, the barrel mounting, eg free floating, dampened, locking mechanism
* The materials that the rifle is constructed of, especially their environmental stability (i.e. their stability in the face of changing environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity and the like).

=== Mechanical Accuracy of Ammunition ===

The mechanical accuracy of the ammunition is dependant on several factors including:
* The quality of the propellant
* The quality of the projectile
* The quality of the case

=== The firer's ability ===
* The firer's knowledge - affects the firer's ability to apply the principles of marksmanship to the practice of marksmanship.
* The firer's strength - affects the firer's ability to hold the rifle correctly and with minimal effort, which reduces shake/tremor.
* The firer's fitness - the fitness of the firer affects the firer's ability to breathe, and control the breath and shaking/tremor due to breathing and oxygen levels in the blood and muscles.

=== Weather ===

There are several environmental (weather) factors that affect accuracy. 
These include:
* Temperature. Affects:
** the burn speed of the propellant
** the air density (and therefore the trajectory)
** the expansion or contraction of the components of the rifle
** mirages
* Humidity. Affects
** the air density
** the burn rate of the powder
** the expansion or contraction of the components of the rifle, especially natural materials like wood and leather
* Air density. This is a function of temperature and humidity. Affects:
** the projectile in flight
** velocity of the projectile in the barrel
** burn speed of the powder
* Precipitation. Affects:
** visibility
** wet or moist ammunition/chamber or barrel can also affect the chamber pressure
** the expansion or contraction of rifle components
* Wind. Affects:
** the lateral trajectory of the projectile (drift)
** the velocity of the projectile, which affects both the lateral and vertical trajectory of the bullet
** the temperature of the physical components of the weapon
** visibility, e.g., blowing up dust or water

=== Factors Affecting The Mechanical Accuracy of the Rifle ===

When a rifle is fired the state of the rifle changes. Most of these changes are not perceptible to human senses, yet each of them has a real and definite effect on the accuracy potential of the rifle.
For example when the rifle is fired the barrel flexes along its axis. This flexing is called whip. In order to obtain maximum accuracy this whip should be as consistent as possible each time the shot is fired. One way of achieving this is to minimize the whip. This can be done by stiffening the barrel, a condition usually achieved by adding more material to the barrel, i.e. making it heavier. In some cases the rifle is fitted with longitudinal flutes (ie grooves cut into the barrel along its length). These flutes increase the stiffness of the barrel, while reducing the weight - or at least reducing the weight compared to a solid barrel of similar stiffness.
At the same time the barrel flexes along its length, the muzzle of the rifle moves, probably in a circle or oval, but possibly in some other pattern, across a plane at right angles to the bore. Maximum accuracy demands that the round leaves the muzzle at the same position on this plane every shot. Many factors affect the pattern described by the muzzle on this plane, the most controllable of which is the pressure exerted on the barrel by the receiver and the stock.

==Application of Fire==

Application of fire is the act of applying a group to a target.

I.e. is the ability of the combination of rifle, shooter and ammunition to place the group where desired.

===Zeroing===

Zeroing is the act of mechanically aligning the point of impact with the point of aim at a given range.

===Holdover===

Holdover is the practice of aiming at a point other than the desired point of impact (POI) to allow for factors such as range, weather, zero (in particular the range at which the weapons is zeroed, but also perhaps to allow for the fact that a weapon may have been zeroed for a person other than the current firer).

====Advantages of Holdover====

* The holdover technique is fast to apply and does not require the shooter to break his shooting position.
* Holdover is especially useful when the shooter needs to engage several targets at different ranges or a target whose range is changing, as the shooter is not required to break his position to adjust his sights for each range change.

====Disadvantages of Holdover====

* The holdover may be difficult to apply at longer ranges, where the sights may need to be held several target heights above the point of aim. With a telescopic sight this can result in the target not being visible in the field of view.

* The holdover, especially at longer ranges, requires a higher level of skill than sight adjustment.

===Sight Adjustment===

Sight may be adjusted to allow for lateral movement. Wind may affect the round and range, resulting in a vertical drop of the round in flight. By adjusting the sights at the time of firing, the need to apply holdover can be reduced or entirely eliminated.

====Advantages of Sight Adjustment====

* Does not require as much experience of practice to master.
* Allows the shooter to aim directly at the desired point of impact.

====Disadvantages of Sight Adjustment====

* The shooter needs to memorize or have available (perhaps on a card or similar device) the characteristics of the sight adjustments and the trajectory for the ammunition rifle combination.
* The shooter needs to keep track of how much adjustment is applied so that the sights can be re-adjusted back to zero when the current firing session is complete. For this reason, many firers choose not to adjust their sights unless the target is at such a long range that holdover is impractical, or if a first round hit is crucial, e.g., with a police or military sniper.
* Requires the shooter to break their shooting position to re-apply their adjustments for each range over which a target is to be engaged.

==Glossary  ==

* Application of fire - the act of superimposing a group on to a target
* Beaten zone - the intersection of the cone of fire with the ground
[[Image:Beaten_zone.png]]
* Cone of fire - volume of space described by the outermost projectiles in a burst of fire.
[[Image:Cone_of_fire.png]]
* Dangerous space - the area between first catch and first graze.
[[Image:Dangerous_space.png]]
* Enfilade - the application of the length of the beaten zone to the longitudinal axis of the target.
* First catch - the first point where the trajectory of a projectile intersects with a target
* First graze - the first point where a the trajectory of the projectile first intersects with the ground.
* Grazing fire - fire where the trajectory is largely or approximately parallel to the ground
* Group a measure of angular accuracy, defined as a series of three or more shots fired at the same POA, from the same position/hold.
* Mean Point of Impact (MPI) - the center of a group, ignoring any obviously &quot;pulled&quot; or &quot;jerked&quot; shots.
* Mechanical accuracy - the accuracy of a rifle or ammunition discounting as much as possible inaccuracies introduced by other components. E.g. when trying to gauge the mechanical accuracy for a rifle you might fire the rifle from a mechanical rest, using the same load of ammunition for each firing, and ideally under the same environmental conditions.
* Plunging Fire - fire where the firer is higher than the target and therefore looks and fires down upon the target. Plunging fire results in a  - small beaten zone not significantly larger than the cone of fire.
* Point of Aim (POA) - the point at which the firer aims with sights
* Point of Impact (POI) - the point on the target where the round impacts
* Whip - the axial flexing of the barrel at firing.
* Zero - the act of superimposing the point of aim with the point of impact at a given range.

There is a 0.5 (50%) probability of seeing exactly two sides of the Pentagon.

The blue area in the diagram represents the Pentagon. The red areas are ones from which only one of the walls is visible, namely the wall forming one of the triangle's sides. The yellow areas are ones from where exactly two walls are visible, and the green areas are where three walls are visible. 

Each of the green and yellow areas form a 36° sector of the plane, because the angles at the outside vertices of the red triangles equal 36°. Since there are five yellow sectors, they form a 180° sector of the plane, which is exactly 1/2. When the distance from the Pentagon becomes large, the initial difference between the yellow and green sectors becomes negligible, and so the probability of being in a yellow sector (and seeing exactly two walls) is 50%.

----
Another solution: If you see two sides of building, your friend at opposite side sees three of them. For each spot where you can see two sides, there is one spot where you can see three sides, and for each spot where you can see three sides, there is one spot where you can see two sides. This gives us exactly 50%.

If ''only'' one of them had lied, we'd have to conclude that both are boy or both are girl. This is impossible, so both of them must have lied. Therefore, the child with the black hair is the girl, and the child with the white hair is the boy.

A boy, a girl, and a dog simultaneously begin movement from one point. Boy and girl are heading in one direction, boy - with speed 5 km/h, girl - 4 km/h. The dog runs from boy to girl and back with speed 10 km/h. Given that it takes no time for the dog to change direction, ''how much will the dog travel in 1 hour?''

----

Put a mathematical character between &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; to get a number that is more than two and less than three.

(You can't change their order, so &lt;math&gt;\,3/2 &lt;/math&gt; is not a correct answer) &lt;- Which is not more than two anyway

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anyone who can add to this feel free. use this page for discussions. A lot of knowledge needs to be written here, and I am not a LINUX expert (that is why I am making this book)

As with most wiki changes, before making a major change or addition, please discuss it here first.

For additions..... Be VERY detailed. if you add, describe why the command or procedure is being used. The goal of this book is to be extremely detailed, documenting all possible paths or variables.

--[[User:Espo111|Espo111]] 19:31, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)


===What needs to be done===
---------------------------

-anything that would make this independent of LFS.org (procedure, package list, etc...)
-verify all procedures
-add to the existing procedures
-explanations of why a certain command or procedure is being done
-more instruction always
-ways to verify what you did was accomplished in linux (via a command)
-updating package versions, kernel
-putting descriptions for all packages used

===merger with linux guide===

my vote is '''no''' because i intended this book to teach one all the steps neccesary to create a linux OS from source code. the linux guide referenced merely tells one what linux is, and then points them to a bunch of premade distros. Even though Gentoo is from sopurce code, they modify and release their own patches. this book differs in that it uses the code from the original developer


===all discussion of this book should go here===
------------------------------------------------

===changing title===
The &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; book already exists. See [http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/ http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/] for more information. I think that two books with the same title may be controversial.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. I'm a new user of Wikibooks (as of June, 2005). I was writing the [http://pt.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grego_Moderno Modern Greek] Wikibook in the Portuguese version of this Wiki, but as the book got no attention at all, I thought writing it [[Modern Greek|here]] was the best option.

For now, I only want to get to know this place a little better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An entity in an object graph usually represents a table in a [[relational database]]. For example, suppose one is working with a school. One may have a database with one table of students and a list of classrooms. In standard SQL-ish notation, the table of students might be called [[STUDENT]] and the table of classrooms may be called [[ROOM]]. One would have a &quot;Student&quot; entity and a &quot;Room&quot; entity.

It was a deliberate choice to call our ROOM table by that name. It could have been called [[CLASSROOM]]. One may see, though, that a classroom is really any room in which one puts students and in which one hopes they can be taught. Thus, the rooms are just rooms. There may be other more abstractions one can use. One may decide that students are just instances from a list of [[PERSON]], and this would not be wrong. How abstract one chooses one's entities to be is a matter of choice and experience.

[[EOF]] uses the class [[com.webobjects.eoaccess.EOEntity]] to manage an entity.

An entity may be something other than a table. An entity can represent any group of things, when it is useful to look just at that group, as a group.

For example, one may decide to use a PERSON table. One may have a column in the table for 'isStudent'. There are other ways to do this, but this is one method. In this case, an entity &quot;Student&quot; can be defined as the objects in the PERSON table which satisfy the [[qualifier]] defined as &quot;(isStudent == YES)&quot;. Indeed, this is how one sets up an entity using [[single-table entity inheritance]].

One may also have some external data source through which one gets information. For example, an external tool could be retrieve price information from the New York Stock Exchange. The list of &quot;prices received from NYSE today&quot; could be modelled as an entity, though an entity with volatile contents. One could have a telescope reporting to a data service with &quot;objects in field of view that are moving&quot;. This would be an extremely volatile entity. It might be likely that no object will appear twice in this entity, which is not at all how a relational database would be expected to behave, but it can be viewed as an entity nonetheless.

In this lesson you are going to learn how to read and write &quot;ゐ&quot; and &quot;ゑ&quot;.  These characters are not used in modern Japanese but are found in old Japanese texts. They are included here mostly for completeness. The student can choose whether to memorise these. Most study aids will not practise these.

{{Japanese kana
| kana = ゐ
| sound = Exactly the same as &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;I&lt;/big&gt;, but in ancient times there was a clear difference.  Scholars guess that the sound was something like &lt;big style=&quot;font-size: 150%;&quot;&gt;Wi&lt;/big&gt;.
| example =
* ゐ (i) well (normally written in hiragana as い, but sometimes written in the former way to differentiate it)
}}

| example =
* ゑびす (ebisu) Ebisu, one of the seven lucky gods, and also the name of a Japanese beer.

== To do ==
(1) Extend the theory section on culture to include:
*Structural-Functionalism
**Culture is a complex strategy for meeting human needs.
**Ignores cultural diversity
*Social-Conflict Analysis
**Culture and inequality; any cultural trait benefits some members of society at the expense of others
**Understates the ways in which cultural patterns integrate members of society
*Sociobiology and Symbolic Interactionism
**Explores how human biology affects how culture is created; cultural universals reflect the necessities of continued life
**Non-eugenicist; lack of evidence?

(2) Include cultural universals:
*The Family
*Funeral Rites
*Smiling and Humor
*Deviance

(3) Add section on norms, values, and sanctions.

(4) Add section on language and gestures.

=Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation=

Why does the Earth stay in orbit around the Sun? Shouldn't it fly off tangentially into outer space?

These questions intrigued Newton and inspired his study of gravitation.

Newton realized that a force must be constantly pulling on the Earth, redirecting its motion and preventing it from being flung off. Newton reasoned that this force, which he termed 'gravity', acted between all bodies with mass and varied inversely to the square of the distance between the two bodies.

:&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a universal gravitational constant, &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the 2 masses, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the centers of mass.

Newton also realized that this same force which redirects the path of the Earth around the Sun, was also responsible for an apple falling to the ground. In this case, the two masses, the Earth, and the apple, are attracted each other and this exerts a force which pulls the apple towards the center of the Earth. While we can use the Universal Law of Gravitation formula to solve this problem it is often more convenient to realize two facts:

* The Earths mass, &lt;math&gt;M_E&lt;/math&gt; is constant
* The distance between the apple (or other object) can usually be approximated with just &lt;math&gt;R_E&lt;/math&gt;, the radius of the Earth, because this is the dominating term.

Thus we can rewrite the equations such that
:&lt;math&gt;F = mg&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;g=\frac{G M_E}{R_E^2}&lt;/math&gt;. g is the acceleration on Earth and is &lt;math&gt;-9.8 m/s^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we have a circle inscribed within a square. Now suppose a rectangle
extends from one corner of the square to a point on the circle (see diagram).

If this rectangle is 6 inches by 12 inches, what is the radius of the circle in inches?

'''Given:'''

:&lt;math&gt;x = 12 in&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = 6 in&lt;/math&gt;


'''Find:'''
:&lt;math&gt;r = ?&lt;/math&gt;

We realize that every point on a circle is equidistant from the origin. This implies
that the rectangle's corner touching the circle must be r inches away from the origin, where r is the radius. We can then draw a right triangle with sides &lt;math&gt;r - y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r - x.&lt;/math&gt; Now apply the [[:w:Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]] to this triangle and solve for r.

:&lt;math&gt;(r-x)^2 + (r-y)^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r^2 - 2r(x+y) + x^2 + y^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation is quadratic and can be solved by applying the
[[:w:Quadratic Formula|Quadratic Formula]].

:&lt;math&gt;
r=\frac{2(x+y) \pm \sqrt {(4(x+y)^2-4(x^2+y^2)\  }}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Which simplifies to,

:&lt;math&gt;
r=(x+y) \pm \sqrt {2xy}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can plug in our numbers and solve,

:&lt;math&gt;
r=(6+12) \pm \sqrt {2(6)(12)}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
r=18 \pm 12
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r=30&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r=6&lt;/math&gt;


Thus the radius of our circle is 30 inches. Notice that 6 inches is not a valid answer. Why?

Comment: Simply making a statement that &quot;we can then draw...&quot; is confusing. Need more explanation on why r-x and r-y are valid descriptors for the triangle sides. This is easier to see with the r-x side than with the r-y.

[[Image:Wall_clock.jpg|center|500px]]

Imagine we have a standard analog wall clock. How many times in a 24 hour period will the minute hand cross the hour hand?

What time is it when the minute hand has passed over the hour hand exactly 4 times?
''This second part is meaningless - it all depends when you start from. I imagine that the puzzle setter was assuming a start from 12:00, but that is ambiguous, it would be better to select one of 11:59 or 12:01 to start from!''

Think about the first time the minute hand crosses the hour hand. Suppose the clock started just after
midnight, would the first cross be at ''exactly'' 1:05?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Answers:
1: The hands pass 22 times in a 24-hour period.

Imagine we start at 00:01 and end at 24:01, the minute hand will cross the hour hand exacly 22 times. The first time a little after 01:05, second time - a little after 02:10, then after 03:15, 04:20, 05:25, 06:30, 07:35, 08:40, 09:45, the tenth time after 10:50 - almost at 10:55 and the 11th time after 11:55 in fact at 12:00. The whole sequence repeats for the next 12 hours.

2: Starting from 00:01, after 4 passes it will be a little after 04:20. More precisely 04:21:49.

----

After &quot;H&quot; hours and &quot;M&quot; minutes (where H&lt;12 and M&lt;60):

1. The hour hand has moved just a fraction of the first turn (in one 24-hour period it will make two 12-hour turns),
   it will be at ( H + M/60 )/12

2. The minute hand has made &quot;H&quot; complete turns and will be in its way to complete the next turn,
   it will be at ( M/60 )

3. To cross, the two hands ought to be at the same place:
   ( H + M/60 )/12 = ( M/60 )   =&gt;   M = 11H/60

4. Therefore, before noon (remember, H&lt;12) the two hands cross at:

   H=01, M=05.45 =&gt; 01:05:27 AM (because 0.45 minutes = 60(0.45) sec = 27 sec aprox.)
   H=02, M=10.91 =&gt; 02:10:54 AM
   H=03, M=16.36 =&gt; 03:16:21 AM
   H=04, M=21.82 =&gt; 04:21:49 AM
   H=05, M=27.27 =&gt; 05:27:16 AM
   H=06, M=32.73 =&gt; 06:32:43 AM
   H=07, M=38.18 =&gt; 07:38:10 AM
   H=08, M=43.64 =&gt; 08:43:38 AM
   H=09, M=49.09 =&gt; 09:49:05 AM
   H=10, M=54.55 =&gt; 10:54:32 AM
   H=11, M=60.00 =&gt; 12:00:00 PM (this is like 60 minutes after 11, which is actually noon)

5. After noon you can use the formula M = 11(H-12)/60 (H in a 24 hour format can be greater that 12) or assume that the cycle repeats itself (just interchange AM/PM).

'''Conclusion: they cross 22 times a day.'''

About the 4th pass, this is a little ambiguous. It depends whether you consider the first pass at 00:00:00 AM (H=0, M=0) or the last one at 12:00:00 AM (H=23, M=60).

There are 6 operations that can be done in any order to arrive at one pint.  These are: Filling the 5 pint mug, filling the 3 pint mug, pouring the contents of the 5 pint mug into the 3 pint mug, pouring the contents of the 3 pint mug into the 5 pint mug, empyting the 3 pint mug (presumably by drinking it), and emptying the 5 pint mug.  Using these operations, there are two ways to arrive at 1 pint.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
! !!5 Pint Mug !! 3 Pint Mug
|-
!1 ||5 ||0
|-
!2 ||2 ||3
|-
!3 ||2 ||0
|-
!4 ||0 ||2
|-
!5 ||5 ||2
|-
!6 ||4 ||3
|-
!7 ||4 ||3
|-
!8 ||4 ||0
|-
!9 ||1 ||3
|}


Or, much more quickly:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
! !!5 Pint Mug !! 3 Pint Mug
|-
!1 ||0 ||3
|-
!2 ||3 ||0
|-
!3 ||3 ||3
|-
!4 ||5 ||1
|}

== Keeping Score ==

On 04 July 2005, I've done 48 contributions. Most are edits/ reverts to various articles suffering from linkspams, vandalism, newcomer tests and experiments as Geocachernemesis is AFK'ed. Gotta be a record somewhere. :) - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 4 July 2005 11:48 (UTC)

05 July 2005, 45 noted contributions. I realised that this can be used to help me track where I left off each day, so it's not for ego that I do this.. well, maybe a bit. :P - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 5 July 2005 11:16 (UTC)

06 July 2005, 44 noted contributions. ''Very'' heavy edit traffic today; religion, blender, languages and the ever-present GTA Newcomers are hot pages. There must have been over 1000 edits in the last 24 hrs. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 6 July 2005 11:18 (UTC)

07 July 2005, 33 noted contributions. Strange drop in traffic, but more vandalism, inclusive of a repeat linkspammer. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 7 July 2005 11:33 (UTC)

== Re: GTA Pages ==

Hi Aya, been doing some patrols of the edits. Can you check the GTA pages for consistency/ correctness? Some newbies had been tinkering around with some pages (and not all are nice cuddly newbies either). There's way too many edits over the weekend for me to look through while at work. :P

Please let the other GTA contributors know as well.

[[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 4 July 2005 02:29 (UTC)

:See: [[Talk:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas#GTA Pages|response on discussion page]].

:[[User:Aya|Aya]] 4 July 2005 14:34 (UTC)

== Another thing ==

Apologies if it seems a bit arrogant, but I've changed all your '=' headings to '==' to make them consisent with [[m:Help:Editing#Sections, paragraphs, lists and lines|Wikimedia convention]], and so that the '+' button works as desired. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 4 July 2005 14:34 (UTC)

: Sure, that's not a problem. I'm just not aware of the convention, is all. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 5 July 2005 01:31 (UTC)

== Vote count summaries ==

I advise you to not put in vote summaries in [[WB:VFD]].  As discovered on Wikipedia, it introduced an element of bias into the way users cast their votes, especially in hotly constested debates.  Furthermore, admins ultimately have the final say on what stays and what goes, as per deletion policy (yes, admins can go against consensus, but by convention they do not since that's considered abuse of power).  Here in wikibooks, convention dictates that pages with no consensus remain on VFD for further debate until a consensus is reached.  I have removed all of these summaries. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 6 July 2005 05:48 (UTC)

: Okay, thanks for the heads up, I will stop adding it then. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 6 July 2005 05:55 (UTC)

== Thanks and adminship ==

Thanks for helping to fight vandalism while I was away. Keep up the good work, because every bit helps.

Do you think that you are ready for nomination as an administrator? I don't see why you shouldn't succeed, because you have over 500 decent edits, and a willingness to do some of the less glamorous tasks involved. I'll nominate you if you like. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 01:48, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

: No problem. I couldn't do anything on Friday because work picked up, so unfortunately we have a large backlog over Friday and the weekend.

: No need for the adminship -- I think we got a good system here, we patrollers would flag things up for the admin, then admins like [[User:KelvSYC|Kelv &quot;MonsterKill!&quot; SYC]] would zap them. I think it's a good system without introducing too many admins into the broth. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 01:38, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

I thought that I should offer, but as you are happy as you are, I won't nominate you.

Maybe we should introduce a system whereby we create a new page where people on RC patrol can list blocks of time that they have screened, that would make it easier for us to spread the workload (there have not been so many attacks recently, so It's not obvious what has already been screened). So, when you started scanning, you could add a message like ''Scanning anonymous edits backward from 03:00, 11 July 2005 (UTC) [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]]''. When you finish, you could change it to ''Completed scanning anonymous edits 00:00-03:00, 11 July 2005(UTC) [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]]''. And, when a whole day is finished, you could add '''Completed scanning anonymous edits 11 July 2005 (UTC)'''. That's pretty rough, but it's a starting point. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 05:39, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

: I'm doing something akin to that on my Talk page so that it'll bookmark the Recent Changes. It helps me to know where I left off.. putting a new page for this isn't a bad idea though, especially if we extend one of the Special Pages so that it's easier to remember where to go.

: As for the coverage issue, typically on weekdays you, Aya and myself would be lurking and poking around. Aya and the Master Thief does a good job patrolling the GTA pages (which draws a good portion of the Newcomer Experiments), so that's already a huge load off from the rest of us. 

: The problem on weekdays is I think the two of us overlap in our timings, so there is a period of maybe 6~8 hours where the two of us aren't patrolling.. but in the main problem edits stick to about 10% of volume, so it's not unsurmountable.

: However, I think we may have a coverage issue on weekends only, as I personally do not really want to spend weekends doing this. :P Unfortunately, I can't expect anyone else to do so give that this is a &quot;hobby&quot; and not a job, so Mondays tend to be hectic. The situation's managable now (with only about a few thousand edits over a weekend?), but if Wikibook picks up the weekend backlog would be overwhelming. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:49, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

Hopefully, in the future, there will be enough of us patrolling so that we all naturally overlap (like with Wikipedia now). For now, it doesn't really matter if we don't get around to scanning the edits for a day or two. Except for the sustained attacks, and fixing those while they are in progress can simply encourage them. It doesn't matter a whole lost if we miss some edits, because they should be picked up by the people interested in the corresponding book (in theory ;). And most of us regular patrollers watch the often vandalised Wikibooks pages, like [[Wikibooks portal]], [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in Progress]], etc. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 08:17, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

----
This is a classic puzzle attributed to [[w:Buffon|Buffon]]. Here it is:

Assume you stand on a floor with a pattern of parallel lines on it which are spaced at unit distance. Now you throw a needle of length D with D &lt; 1. What is the probability that the needle intersects one of the lines?

This puzzle assumes ideal lines and needle of extend zero.

The [[w:Buffon%27s needle|solution]] is given in Wikipedia.

Science is about puzzles and often riddle like situations have given rise to entirely new fields in science, e.g. probability theory (c.f. [[Puzzles:Statistical puzzles|Statistical puzzles]]). This page is to highlight the tight relationship of puzzles and science.

One first observation is that a lot of puzzles are listed in Wikipedia and are closely related to scientists and scientific problems (Spoiler warning: the solution is usually given on the page being referred, so look up the riddle on on of the Puzzle book pages first). We here define &quot;puzzle&quot; rather broadly including also paradoxes and puzzling thoughts.

=== Probability theory ===
* [[w:Buffon%27s needle|Buffon's needle]], [[Puzzles/Statistical puzzles/Buffon's needle|Buffon's needle (Puzzle book page)]]

=== Paradoxes ===
Paradoxes have been essential in making of the foundations of mathmatics. All of these have striking semblence to the situation where a person says: &quot;I'm lying&quot;. Does the person lie? This puzzle has its roots in the Liar Paradox but reappears in set theory (Russel's paradox), logic (Gödel's theorem) and informatics (Turing's halting problem).

* [[w:Liar_paradox|Liar paradox]]
* [[w:Russell%27s_paradox|Russel's paradox]]
* [[w:Halting_problem|Turing's Halting problem]]

=== Informatics ===
* [[w:Halting_problem|Turing's Halting problem]]

=== Physics ===
The [[w:Eleatics|Eleatics]] had some philosophical ideas about motion that they even put into puzzles. All these puzzles are meant to show the impossiblity of motion and they can be considered to be an excercise of scientific model building. Many people in the world do believe that motion in fact exists, on the other hand modern quantum theory postulates a discrete space that would in fact bolster the ideas of the Eleatics. In fact their puzzles boil down to philosophical debates. Explore:

* [[Puzzles/Physics puzzles/Eleatic School|Eleatic School (Puzzle book page)]]

=== Geometry ===

Using only pencil, straight-edge and compass alone, is the quadrature of the circle a possibility? Can any angle be trisected? These questions led to [[w:Galois_theory|Galois theory]] which finally gave the answer to the problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An organisation is a group of resources that join together to fulfil a purpose. For example, it may produce goods (as in a business), or provide a service to help people (such as a charity).

==Levels of management==
Most organisations typically have a hierarchical structure, and different aspects of an ICT system are required to fulfil the different aspects of the hierarchy. A simple hierarchy may consist of:

* Senior management (strategical)
* Middle management (tactical)
* Workers/staff (operational)

===Senior management===
Senior management are interested in strategies and objectives – setting goals to meet and timeframes to meet them - this is over a long time period - years.  This means that the information they require must be broad, but doesn't have to be detailed.

===Middle management===
Middle management prepares the tactics – the means in which to achieve these strategies - this is over a medium time period - months.  This means they require information that is less broad than senior management, but is more detailed.

===Workers/staff===
The workers perform the tasks assigned to them by middle management to fulfil the objectives of the organisation, and they communicate between themselves the operational data required to perform their task- this is over a short time period - days.  The workers only require information that is very specific about their area of work, so lacks breadth, but is very detailed

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Information Systems ==

Data processing systems are systems which capture data and store it in a more useful form for later use, such as an EPOS system storing a list of items sold in a transaction file.

Information systems (IS) take data (generally taken from the data capture system) and turn them into information which can be used to make decisions. For example, a supermarket information system may take the transaction files of the EPOS and turn them into a “best selling” list for decision making.

Information systems are important in decision making as they help managers collate the large amount of data that is at their disposal into the more usable form of information. Good quality and efficient processing of information results in better decision making.

== Management Information Systems ==

Management Information Systems (or MIS) exist to take information from internal (such as EPOS data) and external (such as market research) sources and turn them into useful information. Appropriate information is then relayed to managers at different levels, for the task they are responsible for.

An effective MIS becomes an integral part of the organisation to work together to meet the business objectives.

Taking the systems approach to the MIS, we have the Inputs (external and internal data), Processing, and Outputs (reports, query results and expert systems)

== The development and lifecycle of an IS ==

The systems lifecycle is a convenient lifecycle most systems follow (not just IS). The stage of the system in the lifecycle depends on which type of development is currently taking place on the system.

The systems life cycle has 6 stages.

=== Feasibility Study ===

Why have a new system? The feasibility study aims to identify the reasons for having one (or not having one, if the existing system works well).

* The current system may not meet the requirements of the organisation &lt;br&gt;This could occur if the needs of the business change, or the previous system was not implemented correctly.
* The current system may be outdated &lt;br&gt;Technological advances may mean that the current system is inefficient, and potentially incompatible and becomes hard to maintain. For example, an old EPOS system may not be able to take advantage of the new &quot;Chip &amp;amp; Pin&quot; systems being deployed.
* The system may be become difficult to maintain&lt;br&gt;Old systems running on dated hardware may become difficult to locate replacements for, and developers who can develop in COBOL (for example) may be difficult to find.

The feasibility study primarily checks 5 areas of feasibility, called ''TELOS''.

* '''T'''echnical feasibility - Does the technology exist to be able to create the system?
* '''E'''conomic feasibility - Is the capital available to develop the system? Are there cheaper ways of developing the same system?
* '''L'''egal feasibility - Has the law been taken into account? (For example, the [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT1/Legal Framework|Data Protection Act]])
* '''O'''perational feasibility - Can current work practices support the new system?
* '''S'''chedule feasibility - Can the system be developed in the required timeframe?

=== Analysis ===

An analysis of the current system and user requirements must be performed at an early stage when developing the system.

Staff at all levels of the organisation must be involved in the analysis stage for an accurate analysis to be performed. This can be done with

* Interviews
* Document inspection
* Questionnaires
* Observation (such as a ''Time and Motion'' study)

The finished analysis report will:

* show '''what''' (not '''how''') the new system will work
* document the data flows of the organisation (including the inputs and outputs)
* analyse the costs and benefits of the system
* explain how the system will be implemented
* explain how the system will fit in with the organisational structure, and any changes to working practices required
* consider alternatives (hardware configuration, software design, etc.)

=== Design ===

This is where it is explained how the system will work. An explanation of hardware and software requirements should be included in the design document.

It should contain how the inputs and outputs of the system will be captured/output - including any validation checks for the input data, and an explanation of the processes of the system should be included.

The user interface should be described (usually with the aid of diagrams) here also. 
&lt;br&gt;Most modern systems are developed modually, so a breakdown of the modules and tasks of each will also be part of your design document.

Your design should also include your test plan. Your test plan should cover extreme, erroneous and normal data for each input, and the expected output of such.

The final section of the design document is the [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/The Management of Change|changeover plan]]. Here, we should be considering how we'll be implementing the finished system and changing over from the new one.

=== Implementation and Testing ===

This stage is where the creation of the system from the design plan is performed. Ideally, the system should be tested continually with the test plan to identify problems as soon as possible for correction. There should also be milestone targets, where the system should be tested again.

=== Installation ===

Once the system has been created, it should be implemented into the organisation (as per the changeover plan).

=== Maintenance ===

Sometimes referred to as evaluation.

Once the system has been successfully installed, it needs to be reviewed to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the organisation as laid out in the analysis. If it is not, then there are types of maintenance that can be performed:

* Perfective - Improvements to the system not originally identified in the analysis
* Adaptive - Alterations to the system, say if the needs of the organisation change
* Corrective - Solving problems in the system that were not identified during testing

== Success or failure of an MIS ==

Developers might only have one indicator of the success of a MIS. Whether or not it works. However, just because it works doesn't mean the MIS is successful. No-one may use the completed MIS, for example.

There are better indicators of MIS success.

* Does the system get used?
* Are the end-users happy with the system?
* Does the system meet the original objectives laid out in the analysis?

=== Factors leading to success ===

* User involvement
** Involving users in the analysis and testing phases tends to lead to a better system that will increase end-user satisfaction
* System complexity
** Highly complex systems tend to fail if they're undertaken by inexperienced teams
* Development management
** A poorly managed project is more likely to suffer from
*** Cost over-runs
*** Delays
*** Performance problems
* Support from the management
** New systems must be backed by the management of the organisation the system is being developed for
*** Correct funding must be made available
*** Manpower must be made available
*** Changes to the existing system must be supported

=== Factors leading to failure ===

MIS can fail at any point in the lifecycle, but failures often become more apparent later on the lifecycle, when it becomes very expensive and difficult to correct them.

The most likely point of failure is at the analysis stage.

* A poor analyst was appointed with poor analysis skills
* The wrong type of research was done, especially with regard to the current system
* Poor staffing levels for the analysis to take place
* Users were not sufficiently involved

Failure at the design stage can be because of

* Inability of the system to meet future needs
* Major changes to working practices are required
* Users were not sufficiently involved

At the implementation stage, the failure could be due to

* An underestimate of coding time
* Lack of necessary software development skills
* A poor design
* Poor internal communication
* Low level of allocated resources
* No proper test plan is designed, and therefore no proper testing occurs
* The end-users are not involved in testing, and there are no acceptance tests

At the installation stage,

* No conversion plan was developed
* Insufficient funds allocated to conversion
* Poor documentation of the new system
* There are no performance evaluations

* The business objectives in the mission statement
* A SWOT analysis of the business (this shows the '''s'''trengths, '''w'''eaknesses, '''o'''pportunities and '''t'''hreats of a business)
* Substrategies for separate parts of the business (marketing, sales, operations, IS, etc.)

Obviously, we'll be focussing on the IS strategy. The IS strategy should be allocated resources and should be ''needs-led'', not ''technology-led''. (This means the IS strategy should be fulfilling the needs of the business, not just supplying the latest technology).

The IS strategy should consider:

* Resources
** People
** Technology
** Organisation
* Threats to the business (as identified in the SWOT analysis)

== Information flow ==

We can deduce 3 types of information flow in an organisation:

* Strategic
* Tactical
* Operational

Many organisations rely on a constant flow of information, both up and down the layers of hierarchy. Information can flow either:

* Formally (through meetings, etc.) – where the information flow is standardised and consistent
* Informally (phone calls, discussions over the water cooler, etc.) – this is where the information flow does not follow a set of rules and can be inconsistently distributed, and therefore unreliable.

How information is dealt with is dependant on where the end-user is in the hierarchy.

Unless information has a free flow, there can be constraints on the way the information flows and it could be limited.

== Personnel ==

As we discussed [[AQA Information and Communication Technology:ICT4/Organisational Structure|| earlier on]], most hierarchies can be broken down into 3 types.

As such, we have the following levels of the heirarchy making different decisions:

* Senior management make the strategic decisions
* Middle management make the tactical (or implementation) decisions
* The workers make the operational decisions.

Or, what we're going to do, how we're going to do it, and the specifics of production.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We originally covered this in the [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT1/10.1 Knowledge, Information and Data|very first topic]] of the specification. We'll be building on what we already know in this topic.

== Data ==

Transcription is what occurs when data is formatted and entered onto the system. This can affect the accuracy of the data though, as errors occur during transcription.

Electronic Data Interchange (or EDI) is the most error free method of transcription. It is the movement of data from one system to another electronically.

You should select the most appropriate data capture techniques for the quantity and quality of data. Remember GIGO! Garbage In = Garbage Out. We've already covered [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT2/Data Capture|data capture]] and [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT2/Verification and Validation|verification and validation]], so reviewing those areas are important.

== Information ==

We originally looked at the importance of data in [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT1/Value and Importance of Information|ICT1]]. In ICT4, we're going to be covering the characteristics of information.

For information to be of use, it must be:

* Accurate
* Up-to-date
* Complete
* Relevant to the needs of the organisation
* Easily interpretable (turning it into knowledge)

Information has 8 characteristics

=== Source ===

Information can originate

* Internally (as a result of processing transactions inside the organisation, for example)
* Externally, either in the forms of
** General external information (Treasury reports on the economy, for example)
** Operational external information (Information from suppliers, for example)

Additionally, we can say that information is

* Primary, where the information is first hand and gathered from the raw data by the business
* Secondary, where information has already been collected by other people

=== Nature ===

Information is either:

* Qualitative (judgements and comments)
* Quantitative (numerical)

and can be collected

* Formally (collected through official channels, and tends to be more precise)
* Informally (through channels such as newspapers, where information may be more vague)

=== Level ===

We already know that information can be:

* Operational (as a result of events and transactions)
* Tactical (such as how fast lines are selling so they can make decisions)
* Strategic (showing the &quot;bigger picture&quot; and helping to make long-term decisions)

=== Time ===

Here, we can classify information into:

* Historical (records from the past)
* Current
* Future (for predicting trends)

=== Frequency ===

Information is provided to us

* In real-time, where the information is up-to-date as of that moment
* Periodically, where information is only updated after a certain length of time (minutely, hourly, daily, etc.)

=== Use ===

What is the information going to be used for?

* Planning (strategical)
* Control (operational)
* Decisions (tactical)

=== Form ===

How are we receiving the information?

* Written (reports)
* Visual (charts, etc.)

=== Type ===

Information can be:

* Sampled (snap shots of the organisation)
* Aggregated (built up over time)
* Disaggregated (separating the various functions of the organisation)

== Quality of information ==

Information is required to make informed decisions, but it's only good if it's useful. For information to be useful, there are certain characteristics we should be considering.

=== Brief ===
* Information overload is a major problem
* Only sufficient information is required, so it must be factual, concise, summarised and selective

=== Accuracy ===
* This is fairly obvious. Information is only useful if it's accurate.
* If information is inaccurate, user confidence will be lost, so a ''confidence rating (how accurate it is) must be given to the information.
* Assumptions and probabilities should be clearly stated.''
=== Up-to-date ===
* How up-to-date the data must be vary according to need. Sales figures could be a week old, for example, but booking information must be accurate to a few seconds.

=== Timely ===
* If information arrives too late, it is not useful
* For example, if &quot;best selling lines&quot; figures arrive after a replinishment order has been made this is of little use.

=== Detail level ===
* If the information is made too brief, information is lost.
* If information is too detailed, the meaning may be lost.

=== Appropriate format ===
* Trends may be better shown in a chart
* Tables may be better for some numerical data.

== Effective presentation ==

The way in which information is presented will affect the value that the audience place on it. Information presented in an unprofessional or unplanned way may reduce the impact of the information.

Popular methods of presentation include:

* Computer Printouts
* Presentations
* DTP
* Videoconferencing
* Intranet

The form of presentation depends on what you're trying to present.

* Graphs and charts
** Pie charts are good for showing shares, but too many segments make the chart too cluttered and is off-putting
** Line charts are good ways of showing trends over time

* Printed presentations
** Bullet points are good for this
** Use of charts are effective for displaying numerical information

We already know that [[Information and Communication Technology/ICT1/Value and Importance of Information|information is a commodity]], and like many other commodities, correct marketing will make it easier for an organisation to present its data.

== offering my support ==

I've just done the exam for Massey's course on The Great War, so I've certainly got an interest in the subject! I shan't have the time to take part in your class because of my real-world classes, but I can still help out in other ways.

I've got a crapload of notes and handout summaries and recommended readings and that sort of thing, so if you need any help or ideas with additional material and virtual &quot;handouts&quot; I can pass them on to you, rewritten by me to be GFDL-compliant of course.

As for the recommended readings, my professor listed some excellent books on the subject and I'm sure they would be useful to your virtual students too. Many of them are available for searching at [http://print.google.com Google Print], which could help for faster researching (assuming your students going to write essays).

I'm still not sure how the heck Wikiversity actually works, but regardless I'll be able to help you with the information side of this class, at least until the second semester begins at which point my for-money classes will have to take priority :)

Anyway, if I can be of assistance with getting this Wikiversity test-bed off the ground that's great! [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 02:08, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== re: WWI ==

Sorry for the late reply. I have been on vacation. I'm still not sure how I am going to be running the course, so if you'd like to, you are more than welcome to help out, or even be assitant/co - professor. I know a bit about the Great War but I am not an expert, so having two people might make a big improvement on the course. Since the course is somewhat provisional in nature, I don't know that I am going to have people write essays. I think it might be more appropriate to do it seminar style and have guided discussions where people learn not just from the professor but from other students. Let me know what you think.
--[[User:Polizano|Polizano]] 14:23, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

:As I said I'm going to be busy with my own university courses. I'm not sure how you're going to do the &quot;classes&quot;. If they're just an editable Wiki page I can certainly be in the class each day or week or whatnot and both teach and learn to varying extents, but if it has to be something live like an IRC channel then there's no way I can devote a fixed time to it. Not to mention the timezone issues.
:Seminar style sounds fun, we had those for the Massey paper. They called them &quot;tutorials&quot; but I think &quot;stump the professor&quot; might have been a better name! People kept asking or pointing out the most difficult things... then again that's what you get with a 300-level paper... :) ...but in fact that could be a fun side activity for the class (much like Wikipedia's Reference Desk), with students trying to find the answers to each others' questions. Or something like that.
:Actually I can't seem to find most of the info I had, must be in my drawers or something... but for now I've got some notes on [[User:Garrett/The Great War|my temporary Great War page]]--behold my crappy notetaking skills! This is the entirety of the first lecture (war enthusiasm), so you'll probably find some good ideas in there... if you can make sense of all my abbreviations that is. I'll update this page with more goodies as I find them.
:Anyway, that's all I can think of for now... [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 4 July 2005 03:03 (UTC)

== so... no more course? ==

I was really looking forward to being part of your WWI history course.  Has it now been cancelled?  I see the difficulty in doing a project like this until wikiversity gets more attention, but the potential is incredible and i can really see that in what your course can be like.</text>

      <comment>/* How To Use a Clapper Board */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MMM prodHeader}}

The clapper board (AKA Clap slate) is a well-recognized icon of filming, but serves many purposes beyond its appearance.   A clapper board is made up of two parts: the '''slate''' and the '''clapper'''.

The slate's most obvious purpose is the documentation it provides on what scene is being filmed, when it was filmed, what take it was, which film reel it was, etc. The &quot;clapper&quot; provides an easily identified audio marker, which is useful when filming with multiple cameras and you must synchronize them during post-production, and is more commonly used to synchronize the sound and picture since they are usually recorded on separate devices. The black-and-white stripes on the clapper are designed to show exactly when the clapper is closed. This point is then synchronised with the sound of the ''''clap'''' it makes. 

Increasingly in the modern digital age, the clapper becomes less useful as footage can be digitally marked by the camera and audio synchronization is no longer a problem due to the digital nature of the footage.  However, for the sake of your editor, you may wish to continue using a clapper to make any possible problem easier to fix.

==How To Use a Clapper Board==

While a clapper board seems simple, its use is more complex than it looks.  When motion picture film is developed, the lab technician who is developing the film, printing the film, and syncing the audio to the film, must have all the necessary information to sync the audio to the picture.  If you want to see your dailies the first thing in the morning and you want everything to work properly, you must never confuse the lab technician.

===Verbal Slate===

While the clapper board provides information for the picture, there must also be a verbal slate for the audio.  This verbal slate must provide the scene and take number for the lab technician.  It also usually includes the name of the production and or episode if its for TV. The verbal slate must also make it clear if multiple cameras are used.  The verbal slate must also make it clear if multiple tracks of audio are used.  &quot;Stereo Split&quot; means one track of a stereo track has the audio from one microphone and the other track has audio from the other microphone.  

In film production a letter is generally added to the end of a scene number to designate a change in the camera. This change can be, a lens, a camera move or an angle change. It is also common practice to use the phonetic alphabet when verbalizing the information on the slate.  Sometimes the number of angles requires more than the alphabet can provide and in this case, double letters are used.  

===A and B Cameras===

If there are two or more cameras, sometimes a common slate is used.  Both the slate and the verbal slate must make this clear.

Using a common slate is not good because it can be confusing.  With a common slate, there is no camera number (&quot;Camera A&quot; vs. &quot;Camera B') and no film reel number.  Therefore, each camera should have its own slate.  The slate information for one camera must never be seen by the other camera.  The same rule applies for showing the clapper closing.  Therefore, when one camera is slated, someone puts their hand over the lens of the other camera to block the view of the other camera's slate.

===Tail Slates===

Sometimes, when it is impossible to use a clapper board at the beginning of a shot, someone will yell &quot;Tail Slate&quot; at the beginning of the shot and at the end of the shot, the slate will be clapped '''upside down''' so that the film laboratory will know that this is the slate at the end of a shot rather than the slate for the beginning of the next shot.  The verbal slate is always done at the same time as the clapper board.

===Any Pulse Will Do===

On shots where a clapper board is not practical, the actors will use their arms as a huge clapper.  The film lab can easily see when the actor's hands come together. This noise is loud enough and concentrated enough to be accurate for syncing the audio to the picture.

===Wildtrack===

If there is no clapper for a shot, then the sound is wild.  The lab technician might try to do a rough sync.  Or the technician will create a separate section of the dailies for the audio from wildtracks.  When you hear a wild track on the dailies, you see only a card saying Wildtrack as you hear the audio.

===Re-syncing Sound===

For motion picture film, the closing of the clapper (as seen on the film) must be aligned with the audio pulse (which shows up on the audio tape as a blip).  Since audio travels at about 40 feet/13.8 meters per frame of motion picture film (1/24th of a second), the audio pulse should be less than one frame after the closing of the slate unless the microphone is far from the camera (and the audience.)  Yet, when you watch dailies made using digital slates in Hollywood, you will find that most film labs sync the audio so it is late by one or two frames because the electronics in the slate are slow.  Therefore, before you begin editing your movie, you must resync each take based on the actual clapper closing and the pulse on the audio track.

===DV Camcorders===

DV Camcorders often are supplemented with a separate audio recording device in order to record better sound quality. In this case it is necessary to use a clapper in the beginning (or at the end if you are tailslating) in order to sync the sound up with the video.

===Executing the Slate===

There are three important parts to execution of the slate.
# The information on the slate needs to be readable. This means the handwriting is a factor and letters should be bold, large, clear and in the best focus as possible. With dry erase type slates, a black marker is the best color to use because of the high contrast.
# The clapper must close while in frame. The operator should take notice to hold the slate steady. The upper portion of the clapper should be the only thing moving. This helps during the sound syncing process so that it makes it very clear when the slate is closed, as there will generally be motion blur while the upper portion of the clapper is moving. The board needs to be held so that the information is not obstructed by the person holding it.
# The audio of the take number and the sound of the slate closing must be clearly recorded. Background noise should be kept at a minimum.
The first and second portions don't have to occur at the same time but the second and third MUST. 

It is common to hold the information portion of the slate in frame then back up to get the clapper closing in frame. Optionally, A pocket-sized version of the slate can be used if there isn't room for the entire slate to fit in frame. The pocket-sized version is usually only the slate portion of the unit. Also, the clapper portion of the slate, although rarely removable, can be used separately as well. Three-foot-long versions of a clapper are available for extreme wide shots that need to sync sound and the operator must be a good distance from the camera. 

When using the slate near actorS, it is common courtesy to add to the call, &quot;soft sticks&quot; and close the slate more softly so that the actors' hearing is not effected. The clapper closing can be quite loud and creates a very large spike on the audio, which is why it's used. 

On set there are calls that occur to let everyone know filming is about to begin. When the 1st AD calls picture up, it's best for the slate operator (2nd Assistant Camera) to already know where he will be executing the slate. This should be with the slate portion in frame with the clapper up and ready to go. The camera should be aiming at the slate when they start the film so that the slate can be the first image seen on the take (even more helpful to editors in the digital process). The camera(s) will give a call of &quot;rolling&quot; and sound will give a call of &quot;speeding&quot; at which time the operator will be told to &quot;mark it&quot;.  The operator then says the name of the film, the scene number with letter designation, the take number, and &quot;marker&quot; then closes the slate. If it wasn't clear, the sound or camera operator might ask for &quot;second sticks&quot;, in which case the slate operator would open the clapper and start again. This will be repeated until everyone is satisfied with what's on camera and sound.

In low-light situations it may be required to shine a light on the slate so that it's visible on camera.
 
===MOS (with out sound)===

Although the origin of MOS is debated, recording picture without sound happens often.  It is common practice to leave the clapper portion closed and put two fingers over the clapper portion of the slate to indicate that no sound is being recorded.

===Watch Dailies===

If you want to see how the clapper board is used, simply look at film dailies from motion pictures and television dramas.  You can buy motion picture and television drama dailies on tape at almost any second-hand video store in Hollywood (Southern California residents only).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The introduction of [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/IS Within Organisations|information systems]] will result in change. If this change is not managed, it is likely the IS will [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/IS Within Organisations#Factors_leading_to_failure|fail]].

As a result of the 1996 OASIG study, it was discovered that
* 80-90% of IS's do not meet performance targets
* 80% are late or other budget
* 40% are never completed.
* Less than 40% fully address training and skills requirements
* Less than 25% properly integrate business and technology objectives
* 10-20% meet all their success criteria

== Issues which need management when a system is changed ==

* Skills of a workforce may not be needed under a new IS, meaning they need to be reskilled
** They will need to be retrained to use new skills, which may be of a higher order
** They will need to be retrained in the operational procedures, in additional to IT skills.
** They will need to understand the consequences of not using the new system correctly.

* Workforce attitude
** Most people are resistant to change
** The changes need to be completely explained
** Users should be involved in change from an early stage.

* Organisational structure
** Not only may the system change, but the organisation around it may need to update their working practices for the new system
** If responsibilites and delegations change, people may feel &quot;left out&quot; of the new system (middle managers may be disillusioned if their responsibilities are delegated lower down, etc.).

== Why people may react badly to change ==

* They fear redundancy
* They fear a reduction in status and job satisfaction
* Changes in organisational structure may result in a loss of promotion opportunities
* People feel their aims and ambitions are threatened
* People may fear that their proposals are criticising their past efforts
* General distrust of technology
* no one likes change especially old people

== How to successfully manage change ==

* Changing too much at once is a recipe for disaster.
* Encourage people who are affected by the change to participate in the change
* Ensure all your senior management are publically supportive of the change, and are repeatedly demonstrating this support
* Ensure everyone has had proper training on the change
* Make sure everyone knows why they're changing
* Share all information and plans to everyone as soon as possible
* Make sure that public information is not too technical for people to understand
* Make sure everyone participates and is properly consulted
* Divide the change into small steps to make sure people don't feel rushed into the change
* Minimise surprises
* Encourage motivation
* Minimise people who &quot;lose&quot; from the change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Several of the glossary words here are links to wikipedia articles: Atmosphere, Centaur, Erosion, Lagrange point, Near Earth Asteroid, Silicate, Tectonic Plate, and Trojan Asteroid.

In addition, some of the definitions may be too complex for the targetted audience of children: Equator, Planet.

Some of the terms themselves may also be too complex:  Lagrange point.

Finally, some of the definitions are difficult or misleading:  Crater, Mass, Radar, Surface Area, Star, Volume.  Volume and Mass share the same definition, for example.

I'd like to help by manually editing, but I haven't familiarized myself with the policies governing editing and probably won't until this weekend.  If nothing more, this can serve as my note to go back later and do so.

------

I feel that this needs to be substantially cleaned up.  Be '''bold''', and don't worry about governing policies, at least for this page.  This was a pet project and was updated randomly at that.

IMHO, there should be no links to Wikipedia articles, as is the case now.  This is intended to be an appendix for the Wikijunior Solar System book, and if printed there would be a need to grab information about the hyperlinked terms and write them out.  Eventually I want to kill the links entirely and replace the entries with a simplified definition that would be understandable for a kid that is roughly 8-14 years old (what I try to keep in mind for a target audience when I write entries for this series).

==If you have multiple people downloading a file==
The easiest way to transfer a large file (and my interpretation of large is &gt;50GB) would be to use [http://www.bittorrent.com BitTorrent] and use your computer as a seed for the file, put a link to the seed on a free webspace provider (GeoCities, MySpace, etc.) and then communicate to the recipient where to find the link. A high speed connection would be a definite requirement, attempting this with a dial-up connection would take approximately 121 days. On a good cable connection, it would take around twenty-four hours.

Another possibility is the use of a P2P network, such as KaZaA, iMesh, or Morpheus. You could host the file, and give it a cryptic name, such as a series of numbers. Give the numbers to the recipient and have them search for it. Once their program finds your file, it will allow the recipient to download it.

==Sending a large file to just a few people==
The above methods will not help for transferring one file to only one or two people. In that case you have to just put it up on a (hidden) web url and just send the recipient the link to the file. Be sure that this url is not linked from other web pages or you may have search engines and webcrawlers downloading your file.

Generally, e-mail servers will not accept files larger than ten megabytes. 

'''But if you have very huge files like 1GB , 10GB, 1000Gb files, you can use [http://www.dorotheus.com/123go.html 123Go v3.0] which is found on [http://www.dorotheus.com dorotheus.com], to transfer single file upto 16000GB. That's incredible. This program is in fact a next-generation file transfer program. You can even resume the large file transfer at your own time.'''

===Your own FTP server===
* [[w:FTP|Wikipedia article on FTP]]

You could also run a free FTP server on your computer and ask your collaboraters to connect to your FTP server.  There are free servers for both Windows and Linux.   If you're running Linux then give [http://www.pureftpd.org pureFTPd] a go - it's very simple to setup.  Don't forget to unblock port 21 on your firewall and/or router.  If your're running Windows, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/ FileZilla] produces an ftp server.

===Your own SSH server===
SSH is a secure and fast way to send files (and commands to a Linux shell).

* [[w:SSH|WikiPedia article on SSH]]

It's pretty easy to setup an SSH server on a Linux system.  Almost all Linux systems have SSHd installed.  First you have to log in as root, then add a new user with &quot;useradd -m jack&quot; then give the user a password &quot;passwd jack&quot;.  If you're using a router or a firewall then you'll have to open port 22.

It is worth noting that the encryption offered by SSH could be considered an unnecessary CPU overhead. However, there are compression features offered by SSH, so your choice to use FTP or SSH should be made based on the speed of the hardware on both ends of the line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Corporate Information Systems Security Policies ==

A corporate [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/IS Within Organisations#Information Systems|information systems]] (IS) security policy exists to protect the company from threat. This security policy should be part of the organisations strategic management. It is important to get it right as

* costs are involved in providing the security the company needs to protect itself
* users are sceptical of computer systems for security and are highly aware of the risks involved&lt;br&gt;People don't want to be involved in a company that is known to be insecure

IS security policies exist to

* secure systems against loss of availability, integrity or confidentiality
* prevent and detecting misuse, both against the relevant Acts and the company's internal policies
* investigate and deal with any misuse based on the procedures laid out in the policy
* limit and recover from damage

The three lines of defence in IS security are:

# prevention
# detection
# recovery

The corporate IS policy should include considerations to training and promoting awareness of general security to the end-users of the system, as that is where lapses in security are likely to happen.

They should be educated on matters such as downloading unknown executables from the Internet, or not using easy to guess, common passwords.

== Audit Requirements ==

An audit is a survey taken by a company of its software and hardware. An audit exists to minimise errors of the company's resources database (often used for insurance purposes), to monitor efficiency of systems and to ensure that their software is complying with the appropriate licenses.

The results of an audit are used to increase the accuracy of the company hardware database, allowing for better support and capacity planning.

Many companies use external auditors to minimise the chance of internal fraud, but some companies do internal auditing for the sake of cost. An audit of financial records is required every year under law (for registered companies).

Audits may also cover the accuracy of systems, especially financial systems. There are three type of auditing techniques, where the auditor calculates by hand the expected output of a system and checks that it matches.

* Live data testing - where the auditor uses the actual data the system is figuring at this time. This has the disadvantage of being unable to check all possible data types.
* Historical data testing - in this situation, the auditor puts old data through the system again, so in addition to the manual checks the auditor can check the system agrees with itself both times.
* Dummy data testing - here, the auditor generates fake data that can test all eventualities

This kind of auditing has the problem of whilst the system is being made available to the auditor, it can not be used for its normal functions, and it only provides a snapshot of the system at that moment in time.

=== Audit trails ===

An audit trail is a log created by a system that shows what's been changed and who did what. (The Mediawiki has a great example of this, see the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=AQA_Information_and_Communication_Technology/ICT4/Legal_Aspects&amp;action=history history page] for this page, for example.)

== Disaster Recovery Management ==

=== Threats to security and integrity ===

* Human error (mistakes in data entry, program errors, operator errors)
* Computer crime (Hacking, illegal modification of data, virii and logic bombs)
* Natural disasters (Fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood)
* War and terrorist activity (Bombs, fire)
* Hardware failure (power failure, disk head crash, network failure)

Building security tends to protect the premises against break-in, unauthorised visitors, etc.

Authorisation software involves user ID's and passwords. It forces a user to log in to access their computer and network, and can enforce &quot;access rights&quot;, limiting rights to certain files and folders.

Communications security can use call back (when triggered, dials you, instead of you dialling in – confirms your identity), handshaking (a predetermined exchange between two computers, often following an algorithm) and encryption – altering text by a set algorithm only known by the two communicating systems.

Operational security involves using logs to show usage of the system and creating an audit trail. 

Personnel security is necessary because personnel are often the most exploitable part of an IS. Basic user knowledge on security is required in order to prevent access using “social engineering”. Unmotivated employees may also become destructive to company data. By splitting the tasks in a transaction so multiple people are required to be involved, this reduces fraud.

=== Risk analysis ===

This is part of the overall corporate ICT security policy, and is something which managers, rather than technical staff need to do. The risk analysis could include finding answers to questions such as:

* What is the nature of the data being stored in the system?
* How is the data used?
* Who has access to the system?
* How much money does the company stand to lose if the data is lost, corrupted or stolen?

=== Disaster planning ===

Disaster (see natural disaster) planning generally only concerns the mission-critical aspects of the business, with less vital functions generally being too costly.

To guard against the failure of a business in a catastrophe, two “controls of last resort” can be put in place – insurance and a disaster recovery plan. Insurance is not a prevention method, but it does help to reduce the financial impact of loss.

A disaster recovery plan has to contain provision for backup facilities which can be used in the event of a disaster. Some possibilities are:

* A company owned backup facility, geographically diverse – sometimes known as a “cold standby” site.
* A reciprocal arrangement with another company that runs a compatible computer system.
* A subscription to a disaster recovery service.

How do you select an appropriate recovery plan? Various criteria are used:

* The scale of the organisation and its ICT systems
* The nature of the operation: an on-line system may need to be restored within a few hours, whereas a batch billing process could survive being offline for a few days.
* The relative costs of the different options: a company with several sites linked by telecoms may be able to formulate a DRP which temporarily moves operations to an alternate site.
* The perceived chance of disaster occurring. A company in Intake may need a plan to cope with theft, but not with earthquakes.

== Legislation ==

We've already touched on the legislature covering ICT in [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT1/Legal Framework|ICT1]]. For ICT4, you'll need to be able to recall the Data Protection Act, the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act, the Computer Misuse Act and the Health and Safety Act. When designing a corporate IS strategy, the company should ensure that it complies with the relevant legislature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Steady State ==
That can be said to be the condition of &quot;rest&quot;, after all the changes/alterations were made. This may imply, for examples, that nothing at all happens, or that a &quot;steady&quot; current flows, or that a circuit has &quot;settled down&quot; to final values - that is until the next disturbance occurs.

If the input signal is not time invariant, say if is a sinosoid, the steady state will not be invariant either. The response of a systematic convergence can be considered to be composed of a transient response: the response to a disturbance, and the steady state response, in the absence of disturbance. 

The transient part of the response tends to zero as time since a disturbance tends to infinity, so the steady state can be considered to be the response remaining as T -&gt; infinity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">User support is now a crucial part of most commercial packages available today. As software becomes more and more complex, users require support in order to use the software.

A good level of support will cost the company more money, but this can be passed on in either the purchase costs, or in a yearly subscription. However, the company's reputation will improve if it has a reputation for good support.

Support comes in various forms.

=== Help desk ===

A help desk is a form of expert system, or knowledge base. It contains a clever search system, and users can also browse categories to see if their problem has been documented. All common problems, and a lot of not-so-common problems are documented on a help desk.

=== Technical support line ===

This is a telephone support line manned by real people, who normally access a knowledge base and walk people through procedures.

Technical support lines are often manned by experts who may have difficulty communicating with managers and business users.

=== On-screen help ===

This is normally context sensitive. For example, pressing F1 will bring up the help screen for the task you're currently attempting to perform.

Also, on-screen tutorials and wizards exist to make the package easier to use by walking the user through tasks.

=== On-site support ===

This is where the developers attend on-site to assist people with their software installations. This only typically happens with large/complex orders, or with custom software, as the cost of such support is very high.

=== Patches/bug fixes ===

If a company discovers a bug in their software, they may release a patch that fixes that image. Patches are typically distributed over the Internet, or on CD-ROM from a technical support line.

=== Peer support ===

This is where usergroups exist (mainly on forums or Usenet) who help people with problems.

=== BBS ===

This is an area of the Internet where files and upgrades to items are shared, there are typically also message boards here where peer support and also technical support takes place

=== Mailing lists ===

Similar to a message board, if you subscribe to a mailing list, then you receive a copy of all e-mails sent to it.

=== Documentation ===

There are different levels of documentation for different levels of user. This is typically paper or PDF based.

* Installation documentation
* System documentation (explanation on dataflows, database schema, etc.)
* Software documentation (how to use specific features)
* Operational documentation (day-to-day running of the system)

== Training ==

A company needs well-trained employees who can execute their job efficiently. Training can either be for new employees (induction training) or existing employees (if jobs change, there's new technology or new procedures).

Well trained employees are more likely to get promoted (and are therefore better motivated) and have a better-defined career path. Training can lead to:

* Increased sales
* Better service
* Better products
* Better safety
* Lower staff turnover

Different levels of users need different levels of training (workers, middle management, senior management, etc.).

Senior managers who understand ICT are more likely to make better informed decisions than their less well informed colleagues on matters such as the [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/Corporate IS Strategy|corporate IS strategy]].

Middle managers need to ensure that IT systems are used efficiently, and also implement the IS strategy.

For workers, the level of training depnds on their level of responsibility and skill. They can use

* skills-based training, for developing general IT skills
* task-based training, for things specific to the IS employed

Even experienced users need to learn new skills if the system changes, so skill-refreshing is also an important part.

There are two main training methods:

# Computer based - this it is often very cost effective for large groups of people and ensures a consistent standard of training. Users can also work at their own pace and when work is slow.
# Instructor based - delivered by experienced instructors and has a personal touch, meaning people are more motivated.

There are other training methods, mainly:

* Video training
* Interactive video training
* On line tutorials
* Step by step guides

      <text xml:space="preserve">A project is a set of activities with a defined goals that comes to an end at some point. That is, a project has finite length. A typical project team will comprise individuals with different skills and experience.

A projects will have one or more of the following characteristics:

* Specified objectives
* Specific budgets
* Specified schedule
* Temporary teams

Projects are lead by the project manager. The project manager does not need any technical skills as their role is to plan and manage the activities the technical specialists on the team must perform, not to perform this work themselves. However, it is normal for a project manager to have at least some background in the technical areas as this makes their job easier. The project manager plans the project, identifies and manages risks, issues and changes, assembles the team and ensures they are engaged on the right activities. The project manager monitors and controls project progress and reports the status to the sponsors of the project. The project manager sometimes controls budgets, prepares performance appraisals and acts as an intermediary between the users, the managers and the developers. In some cases the project team will have a line manager who is not the project manager - the project manager having only matrix responsibility for them. In these cases the project manager would not prepare performance appraisals.

The project manager assembles the development team and has to balance the size. Small teams have shorter lines of communication, are more agile and easier to manage. Larger teams can deliver more work at the cost of a higher management overhead and greater communication problems. These communication problems can lead to serious problems where different parts of the team are not fully synchronised.

The characteristics of a good team are:

* The leadership provides inspiration and motivation
* Tasks are allocated well (the best person for each job)
* Standards are set and observed (procedures, documentation, etc.)
* The costs, schedules and progression of the project are monitored and controlled.

The project plan should cover a task definition (what needs to be done), skill identification (who can do it) and training (who needs to be able to do what).

There's a great deal of redundant information between them, and I really can't imagine any good reason to keep them separate. Though it might be nice to have a quick summary one place and a detailed elucidation elsewhere, the separate pages we have now are almost identical. Besides, there's already a &quot;Quick Sheet&quot; on the overview, complete with one-sentence explanations of each step, and our current overview isn't yet large enough to require separate summaries.

Also, unless we decide against my recommendation and instead make the separate overviews noticeably different in scope, we should probably rename the overview page from &quot;Quick overview of the seven habits&quot; to &quot;Overview of the seven habits&quot;. An overview is brief by definition, and I don't think what we have qualifies as a brief overview anymore &amp;mdash; certainly not in comparison to the other, split summary.

Thanks for your effort on this wikibook.  Please keep up the good work.  I will be sure to come back for more. [[User:213.112.182.70|213.112.182.70]] 10:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== Practical Application (and I'm a newbie) ==

I've skimmed the currently written sections of this wikibook, and being someone who had some trouble fully applying the principles in a coordinated way, should we perhaps add comments about how to &quot;personalize&quot; the approach so it works for you?  I think I'm finally starting to get it, but I'm sure others would have found it easy to &quot;give up&quot; at some point rather than sticking with it until they found a way for it to work.  I strongly think one of us should either create a new section, or put into one of the sections something about how to personalize.  For example, I had to do something more intense than just apply Habits 4, 5, and 6 to get the interpersonal &quot;sharpening the saw&quot;; I needed to have at least a few relationships with people that met certain criteria for me, what I consider &quot;close friendships,&quot; in order to effectively not go insane :-).  The thing is it took me 2 years after seriously trying to apply the 7 Habits to figure this out!  This happened during a time in my life where I did not have friends of sufficient closeness for a long period enough period of time that I noticed how essential they are, at least for me.  I'm sure other people may have similar-type problems in other areas that interfere with their ability to apply the principles in Covey's book.  I think addressing this in some way for a &quot;study guide&quot; would be helpful.

Also, some people I've talked to after they read the book still had the perspective of &quot;quick fix,&quot; in applying Covey's principles, rather than the non-quick fix nature of these principles he is attempting to promote.  This is despite the fact that they could repeat back to me that Covey is trying to communicate that they are inviolable principles.  Perhaps something can be added for this as well?  I'm rather new to wikibooks, and trying to think through how I should edit them. (is there a guide for this?) - [[User:Gabriel Koulikov|Gabriel Koulikov]] 07:15, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

== Complicated ==

I do feel Covey's book is complicated and is in need of reorganization and prioritisation of topics. I strongly feel that success books should NOT have stories of people -- that's hardly useful. What matters are the principles. You want to tell me how John succeeded at tennis? Fine, write the techniques or attitudes rather than the whole story!

I can see why you wouldn't want to have to read stories to learn a new concept. However there is a variety of learning styles. Not all people can grasp a concept unless given examples, often anecdotal, that illustrate those concepts. Reading stories that illustrate concepts in different ways, also reinforces learning, and helps some people to learn more deeply and better retain information.  - [[User:twight|Terence Wight]] 14:12, 2 May 2011 (UTC-5)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''&quot;All parts of the brain may well be involved in normal conscious processes but the indispensable substratum of consciousness lies outside the cerebral cortex, probably in the diencephalon&quot; Penfield 1937.''

''&quot;The brain stem-thalamocortical axis supports the state, but not the detailed contents of consciousness, which are produced by cortex&quot; Baars et al 1998.''

==Introduction==

''It is recommended that readers review [[../The Philosophical Problem/]] before reading the sections on the neuroscience of consciousness.''

One of the most exciting discoveries of neuroscience is that nearly all of the brain performs functions that are not part of conscious experience. In everyday life we are usually unaware of breathing or heartbeats yet there are parts of the brain dedicated to these functions. When we pick up a pencil we have no experience of the fine control of individual muscles yet large areas of cortex and cerebellum implement this. Things do not appear as greyscale and then have the colour poured into them although this strange colour addition is done in the visual cortex. Most of the brain is non-conscious but how is the &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;, the mind, created by and linked into the mostly non-conscious brain? 

Although most of the processes in the brain are non-conscious there can be little doubt that the output of sensory processes contribute to experience. For example, although we do not experience the process of adding colour to visual data in cortical area V4 we do experience coloured forms and although we have little inkling of the hugely complex creation of words in the temporal/frontal lobes we do experience verbal thoughts. Our experience is an integrated output of most of the brain processes that deal with sensation as well as dreams, thoughts and emotions. But how and where does this experience occur?

The signals that compose phenomenal consciousness have not been elucidated. Perhaps the least likely signals for this role are electrical impulses in nerve fibres because they are distributed unevenly in time and space and can even be absent for relatively long periods. Furthermore, electrical impulses across the membranes of neurons have an all or nothing character; they cannot be easily superimposed on one another. There are many other possibilities however, such as: the electrical fields on the dendrites of neurons, the fields of chemicals spreading out from synapses, the radio-frequency emissions of action potentials, events in the microtubules in cells, the depolarisations of glia, the varying fields measured by EEG devices, the quantum superposition of brain states etc...

Phenomenal consciousness could exist in the dendritic field of ten neurons receiving 100,000 synapses or as an oscillation of fields over the whole brain. The substrate of phenomenal consciousness could be staring us in the face as a state of the whole brain or be like a needle in a haystack, lurking in a tiny region of brain, unsuspected and undiscovered.

Given that there is no widely accepted theory of phenomenal consciousness Crick (1994) and Crick and Koch (1998) approached the problem of the location of the substrate of consciousness by proposing that scientists search for the '''Neural Correlates of Consciousness'''.  These neural correlates consist of events in the brain that accompany events in conscious experience.

==Neuroanatomy==

===General layout of the CNS===

The Central Nervous System (CNS) consists of the spinal cord, the brain and the retina. 

The CNS consists of two major groups of active cells, the '''neurons''' and the '''glia'''. The neurons conduct short impulses of electricity along their membranes called ''''action potentials''' and encode data as frequency modulated signals (i.e.: different intensities of stimulation are converted into different rates of firing).  The glia modify the connections between neurons and can respond to neuron activity by a change of  voltage across their membranes.  Glia also have many other roles such as sustaining neurons and providing electrical insulation.

Neurons have three principal parts: the '''cell body''', the '''dendrites''' and the '''axon'''.  Impulses flow from the cell body to the axon. The axon can be over a metre long and bundles of axons form '''nerve fibres'''.  Where an axon makes contact with the dendrites or cell body of another neuron there is a special sort of junction called a '''synapse'''. Transmission of data across synapses is usually mediated by chemical signals.

Areas of the brain where there are many cell bodies have a beige/grey tinge and are called '''grey matter'''.  Areas that contain mainly nerve fibres are called '''white matter'''.  Masses of grey matter outside of the surface of the cerebral cortex or the cerebellum are called '''nuclei'''.

The brain is of central interest in consciousness studies because consciousness persists even when the spinal cord is sectioned at the neck.

The brain can be divided into five distinct divisions or '''vesicles'' on the basis of embryological development. These are the myelencephalon, metencephalon, mesencephalon, diencephalon and telencephalon (See the illustration below).

[[Image:Constuddivis.png]]

:Myelencephalon: Medulla oblongata.
:Metencephalon: pons and cerebellum.
:Mesencephalon: midbrain (tectum containing the superior colliculus and inferior colliculus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, cerebellar peduncles.
:Diencephalon: thalamus, epithalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus.
:Telencephalon: corpus striatum, cerebral hemispheres.

These divisions tend to obscure the physical anatomy of the brain which looks like a rod of spinal cord with a swelling at the top due to the thalamus and corpus striatum. Around the top of the rod is a globe of deeply indented cerebral cortex and at the back there is the puckered mass of cerebellum.  The physical anatomy is shown in greater detail in the illustration below where the thalamus and corpus striatum have been splayed out to show more detail.

The thalamus is a complex organ with numerous nuclei. These are listed below:

&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

The location of these nuclei is shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:constudthal.gif]]

The cerebral hemispheres consist of a thin layer of nerve cell bodies on the surface (the cerebral cortex) with a mass of white, interconnecting fibres below (the cerebral medulla). Each hemisphere is divided into four principle '''lobes''' as shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:Main brain lobes.gif]] 

The cortex is a set of interconnected processors.  The general layout of the cortex with the location of the processors is shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:Constudproc.png]]

The pathways in the brain tend to preserve the '''topography''' of the sense organs so that particular groups of cells on the retina, cochlear or body have corresponding groups of cells in the thalamus or cortex. The retina is said to have a topological mapping onto the thalamus so that the projection of the optic nerve is said to be '''retinotopic'''.  

Nerve fibres that go to a part of the brain are called '''afferents''' and fibres that come from a part of the brain are called '''efferents'''.

The cortex and thalamus/striatum are intimately linked by millions of connecting fibres and there is also a direct connection from the motor cortex to the spinal cord.

===Sensory pathways===

Information from the sense organs travels along the appropriate sensory nerve (optic, auditory, spinal etc.) and once in the brain is divided into three principal paths that connect either with the thalamus, the cerebellum or the reticular formation.  

There are thalamic nuclei for each broad type of sensation and these have reciprocal connections with specific areas of cortex that deal with the appropriate mode of sensation.  The large mass of nerve fibres that mediate the connection between the thalamus and cortex are known as the thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic tracts. There tend to be more sensory nerve fibres returning from the cortex to the thalamus than connect from the thalamus to the cortex so it is difficult to determine whether the cortex is the destination of sensory data or a region that supplies extra processing power to thalamic nuclei.

The cerebellum mediates reflex control of complex movements and receives input from most of the sense organs. 

The reticular formation is a group of loosely distributed neurons in the medulla, pons and mesencephalon.  It receives a large amount of autonomic input and also input from all the sense organs.  The intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus are the principal destination of reticular output to higher centres.  In the most primitive vertebrates the reticular formation performs most of the higher control functions of the animal. The reticular formation is implicated in the maintenance of sleep-wake cycles and activates the higher centres.  This activity has attracted the label '''ascending reticular activating system''' (ARAS) to describe how the activity of higher centres is controlled by reticular input. This title is unfortunate from the point of view of consciousness studies because it implies that conscious experience is a result of activating the cortex when it could be due to turning on or off particular systems all the way from the reticular formation to the cortex. Destruction of the reticular formation leads to coma.

===Motor and output pathways===

Motor control of the body below the skull is accomplished by three principle routes. 

The motor cortex of the frontal lobes and related cortex in the parietal lobes can control movement directly via nerves known as the cortico-spinal tract (also called the pyramidal tract).  The activity of the motor cortex is modified and controlled by a loop that passes through the corpus striatum, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus and returns to the cortex.  These controlling nuclei are, along with the amygdala, known as the '''basal ganglia'''.

The cerebellum and the corpus striatum provide complex reflex control of the body through nerves that travel through the red nucleus and form the rubro-spinal tract.

The vestibular nucleus, which processes signals related to balance and posture, has direct connections with the periphery via the vestibulo-spinal tract. 

Apart from the routes for controlling motor activity there are also other outputs from the brain, for instance the autonomic nervous system is intimately linked with the reticular formation which has areas that control blood pressure, respiratory rhythm etc.

==Topological mapping and cortical columns==

[[Image:Homunculus-de.svg|thumb|400px|right|Sensorimotor homunculus]]The cerebral cortex has a highly convoluted surface that provides a large area of tissue. The parts of the cortex that are used for motor and sensory functions are organised so that different areas correspond to different zones of the body.  This '''topological''' organisation is shown classically by a drawing of the ''sensorimotor homunculus'' such as that shown on the right.

Within a given area of the cortex there are further subdivisions.  For example, the occipital cortex corresponds to the eyes of the sensorimotor homunculus and it is further organised so that areas of the retina have corresponding areas on the cortex.  This mapping of the layout of the retina onto the cortex is known as '''topological mapping'''.  It results in a corresponding mapping of the receptive field of the eye onto the cortex.  The mapping is like an image on the surface of the brain tissue and the visual scene that is presented to a subject can be recovered by using fMRI along with computer analysis (Miyawaki ''et al.'' 2008).

The human cortex is fairly deep, containing 100-200 neurons from the surface to the white matter.  It is divided into six histological and functional layers.  These layers can be further subdivided.  In 1957 Mountcastle used microelectrode measurements to show that activity of small zones of cortex about 0.1 to 1 mm in diameter corresponded to particular points in the receptive field.  These functional columns of cortical tissue are called '''cortical columns'''. 

[[Image:Corticalcol.png]]

The diagram above shows the organisation of '''ocular dominance columns'''. Each column represents a particular part of the receptive field of a single eye. The columns for left and right eyes are linked together in lines.  The lines of ocular dominance form a pattern like a fingerprint on the surface of the cortex.

The same part of cortex can have overlapping columns for different functions.  For instance there are columns that react to particular orientations of edges at particular places in the visual field.  These columns tend to be located together on the cortex forming a '''pinwheel''' of columns that cover all orientations at a particular receptive field position.

[[Image:Corticalorient.GIF]]

There are also topologically arranged columns for colour, spatial frequency etc.

The cerebral cortex consists of a set of specialised areas that process different aspects of sensation and motor control. There are about ten times as many nerve fibres going from the cortex to the thalamus as there are from the thalamus to the cortex (Destexhe 2000). 
 
[[Image:constudconn.gif]]


Histologically the cerebral cortex is a layer of greyish neurons overlying a huge mass of white nerve fibres, the cerebral medulla. The cortex consists of six main layers. The upper layers receive input from the relays in the thalamus such as the lateral geniculate, from the thalamus in general and from other areas of cortex plus a few specialised inputs from other locations. The lower layers give rise to output fibres that largely connect with the thalamus and other areas of cortex although particular specialised processors in the cortex may also have direct connections elsewhere such as to motor nuclei.

[[Image:Constudcortex2.png]]


The cerebral cortex has many functions and is divided up into numerous separate processors. The most important function of the cortex from the point of view of consciousness studies is that it creates models. As was seen in Part I, philosophers debate whether these models are actually experienced consciously but in the neurophysiological literature it is normally assumed that we do experience models and rehearsals such as inner speech and imaginings. There is considerable evidence that the parts of the brain that deal with imagining (modelling) things are also the parts that deal with perception (i.e.: modelling the world). The overlap between imagination and normal perception is not complete because, as Tong(2003), in a review of visual consciousness, put it: &quot;Internally generated experiences share some, but not all, of the phenomenal properties of actual perception&quot;. There is also considerable overlap between the areas used for imaginary speech (thought) and actual speech, areas dealing with the control of sensation and of the tongue etc. being used in actual speech but not in imagined speech (Fu ''et al.'' 2002). Kreiman ''et al.'' (2000) investigated the activity of single neurons in humans and also found that the brain activity evoked by visual imagination overlapped that which occurs upon direct stimulation by the same image. 

Our conscious experience consists of the output of the cortical modelling and perceptual processes. The cerebral cortex itself appears to be non-conscious. The evidence for the non-conscious nature of the cerebral cortex consists of lesion studies in which large amounts of cortex can be removed without removing consciousness and physiological studies in which it is demonstrated that the cerebral cortex can be active without conscious experience.

Lesion studies have shown that up to 60% of the cerebral cortex can be removed without abolishing consciousness (Austin and Grant 1958). An entire hemisphere can be removed or much of the front or back of the cerebral cortex can be cut off yet consciousness persists. 

Fiset ''et al.'' (1999) and Cariani (2000) have shown that cortical activity can be normal or even elevated during the  unconscious state of general anaesthesia. Alkire ''et al.'' (1996) also showed that cortical activity related to word recognition occurred during general anaesthesia.

Libet ''et al.'' (1967) found that there could be cerebral cortical activity in response to weak stimulation of the skin without any conscious awareness of the stimulus. This work provides a neurophysiological basis for subliminal (non-conscious) perception and also shows that large areas of the cerebral cortex can be active without conscious experience. The insensitivity of experience to cortical activity has been further confirmed by Libet ''et al.'' (1979). They electrically stimulated the cerebral cortex of conscious patients and discovered that the stimulus must be continued for about 0.5 seconds for subjects to report a conscious experience of the stimulation.  Libet's findings have been analysed at length but there still appears to be a 0.25 to 0.5 secs delay (Klein 2002).

It has been demonstrated that cerebral cortical activity is not synonymous with conscious experience but why should there be a delay of up to 0.5 seconds or so between cortical stimulation and a conscious percept? What is the cortex doing in the 0.5 seconds between the start of stimulation and the report of awareness of the stimulation? It is probably synchronising its various processors and creating a waking dream, a structured set of events that accounts for the activity.  The synchronisation of cerebral cortical processes will be discussed later, but what evidence is there for the cerebral cortex constructing a waking dream, or model, to describe the world?

The 'Attentional Blink' (Raymond ''et al.'' 1992) is consistent with the concept of the cerebral cortex being a device that creates models. In the 'Attentional Blink' the identification of an object impairs the identification of a second object that is presented within 0.5 seconds of the first. Raymond ''et al.'' used a stream of letters (11 letters per second) and the identification of a first letter impaired the identification of a subsequent 'probe' letter in the stream. If the probe letter followed the first letter within about 180 msecs it could easily be identified, suggesting that chunks of about 180 msecs of data stream are modelled together. Christmann &amp; Leuthold (2004) have theorised that the 'Attentional Blink' involves perceptual and central components of visual processing. This is supported by the fMRI studies of Marois ''et al.'' (2004) who presented subjects with faces mounted on scenes of places. The scenes of places often went undetected by subjects but they activated regions of the medial temporal cortex involved in high-level scene representations, the parahippocampal place area (PPA). When the scenes of places were detected by the subjects there was activity in the frontal cortex and the PPA activity was increased. These experiments are consistent with the idea of a cerebral cortex that is a multiprocessor system that creates consistent models of the environment.

Bregman's (1990) auditory continuity illusion is another example of how sensory events are modelled. If a pure tone is followed by broadband noise and the noise followed by the same pure tone it seems as if the tone occurs throughout the period of noise. If the noise is not followed by the pure tone there is no sound of the tone during the period of noise. This effect is similar to the results found by Libet because a delay of several hundred milliseconds between sensory stimulation and conscious experience is needed to account for the apparent rewriting of history after the second tone appears. 

Dennett and Kinsbourne (1992) argued strongly against modelling as the source of conscious experience.  They discussed two illusions, the &quot;cutaneous rabbit illusion&quot;, in which the subject is tapped successively in such a way that some illusory taps appear and the &quot;phi illusion&quot; in which successively illuminated lights appear as a motion of the light.  Dennett and Kinsbourne declared that there should be no cerebral cortical filling in of the gaps in the these illusions. Both these illusions have now been investigated. Blankenburg ''et al.'' (2006) found that cerebral cortical activity occurred at the locations expected for the missing taps in the &quot;cutaneous rabbit&quot; illusion and Larsen ''et al.'' (2006) found that the areas of cerebral cortex that would be stimulated  by a moving light were active during the &quot;phi illusion&quot;.

==The delay before consciousness of &quot;voluntary&quot; actions==

The 0.5 second delay required for the cortex to model an event has implications for the role of conscious experience in the control of our lives. If experience is about 0.5 seconds behind the true present instant then how can we be said to control anything? The brain must be acting automatically whilst performing most tasks. The 0.5 second delay also seems to contradict our everyday experience. We certainly feel like we are aware of things in less than 0.5 seconds, for example, the direct stimulation of sense organs seems to be experienced much more rapidly than the delayed experience of cortical stimulation. In fact subjects report that they are conscious of stimuli, such as being touched or seeing flashing lights, within 0.1 to 0.2 seconds of the event. So how can subjects report events within 0.2 seconds even though it seems to take 0.5 seconds for the cortex to generate activity that can be experienced? The simplest explanation is that the reaction occurs automatically within 0.2 seconds and then the conscious experience of this reaction occurs 0.3 seconds later. This gives a total 0.5 seconds delay before conscious experience whilst allowing fast reactions.

Libet ''et al.'' extended their experiments by stimulating a &quot;relay nucleus&quot; in the thalamus that intercepts signals from the senses before they reach the somatosensory cortex. It was found that when this nucleus was stimulated for 0.5 seconds the subjects reported that the stimulus occurred 0.2 seconds after it had begun. When the nucleus was stimulated for less than 0.5 seconds the subjects did not report any sensation. This supports the concept of a 0.5 second delay whilst the cortex puts a stimulus in context before it is experienced. 

These experiments show that our experience is an output of cortical processing rather than the processing itself. If our conscious experience is non-cortical then this raises the possibility that the non-conscious cerebral cortex can perform actions without conscious control. Of course, the cortex does this all the time when we are indulging in skilled or routine behaviour. The ability of the non-conscious cortex is quite remarkable; for instance car drivers sometimes discover that they have driven for several miles without conscious experience of driving, even at the level of having no recollection of the route.

[[Image:Bereitschaftspotenzial_fig1.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Typical recording of the readiness potential.]]Although it might be accepted that much of our everyday behaviour is automatic is there any behaviour that is definitely initiated by conscious experience? This is probably a pointless question because consciousness is about observation, not action; however, despite this there have been several experiments that have attempted to determine the relationship between consciousness and action. 

In 1964 Kornhuber and Deecke performed a series of experiments that measured the electrical activity from the scalp (EEG) during voluntary actions. They averaged many EEG's from subjects who were about to move a finger and discovered that there is an increase in scalp potential before the movement takes place. The increase in potential can start as long as 2 seconds or so before the movement and is known as the &quot;readiness potential&quot; (Bereitschaftspotential). The readiness potential is strange because it seems to contradict our conscious experience; we do not decide to move a hand and then wait 2 seconds before the hand moves. It seems that the non-conscious brain may be taking things into its own hands.

Libet ''et al.'' (1983) extended the readiness potential experiments by asking subjects to observe a Wundt clock whilst flexing a finger. The Wundt clock had a spot of light that moved around a circle every 2.56 seconds and allowed the subjects to obtain timings that were related to their mental experiences. When the subjects flexed a finger it was found that the readiness potential occurred about 0.5 seconds before the finger moved and the subjects reported they were going to move the finger about 0.2 seconds before the movement. This suggested that a subject's cerebral cortex was preparing for the movement about 0.3 seconds before the subject was conscious of this. Libet's experiments have been reproduced elsewhere (see Keller &amp; Heckhausen 1990). (It is important to note that the subjects in Libet's experiment were asked to wait until they felt the urge to move the finger.) These results are consistent with the idea of the cortex as a modelling system that constructs a consistent model of events to pass on to whatever mediates conscious experience.

More recently fMRI and direct electrode recording have borne out the readiness potential experiments.  Soon ''et al.'' (2008) allowed subjects to decide to press either a left or right button. They used fMRI to show that there was spatially organised activity in the polar frontal cortex and parietal cortex (from precuneus into posterior cingulate cortex) that predicted the conscious left/right decision and preceded it by about '''seven seconds'''. Rektor ''et al.'' (2001) used direct electrode recordings to show a 2 second latency. Haggard &amp; Eimer (1999) and also Trevena and Miller (2002, 2009) have identified a &quot;Lateralized Readiness Potential&quot; that is correlated with the movement of a particular hand (left or right) in their EEG experiments and Trevena and Miller claim that this potential always follows the making of a conscious decision and precedes the actions being studied.  However, Soon ''et al.'' (2008) showed that fMRI can predict which button will be used well before any conscious decision is reported. (See Haggard (2008) for a review of conscious volition).

==Perception, Imagination, Memory and Dreams==

===More about Models===

Our dreams are clearly models that form a 'dreamworld' but the idea that perception might be like a dream that is updated by sensation is not so obvious. Experience seems to be an active model of the world (virtual reality) based on sense data rather than a simple mapping of retinal and other sensory data. This is demonstrated by visual illusions such as the Ames Room, Spoke Illusion and Muller Lyer illusions shown below:

[[Image:Constudame.png]]

Notice how the circle is distorted without any distortion in the 'spokes', it is as if the circle has been treated as a separate object by the processes in the brain that rearranged it. In all of these illusions the brain has rearranged large areas of the visual field and has managed the input as a collection of 'objects' that are manipulated separately. Even movement seems to occur in some figures showing that the brain models the position of things:

[[Image:Constudcafe.png]]

The creation of a model is also demonstrated by the illusion of movement experienced when we watch the cinema or television. This is due to the cortical modelling that is known as 'short-range apparent motion' rather than flicker fusion or persistence of vision. It is intriguing that, although it has been known for decades that the joining together of static images in our minds is due to modelling activity in the brain the myth that it is due to persistence of vision or flicker fusion is universal. As Anderson and Anderson (1993) noted:

 Indeed, in the past decade, psychoanalytic-Marxist film scholars 
 have retained the  model implied by persistence of vision: theirs 
 is a passive viewer, a spectator who is &quot;positioned,&quot; unwittingly 
 &quot;sutured&quot; into the text, and victimized by excess ideology.

Our experience of the cinema is like a dream updated by sensation rather than sensation updated by interpretation. In fact the most compelling evidence for the modelling power of the brain is the existence of dreams; our dreams are often models of worlds that do not exist and involve little or no sensory input yet can involve effects as powerful as any television drama. 

Short range apparent motion occurs when the interval between presentations of an object is brief (c. 50-100 msecs).  Motion modelling in response to longer intervals is known as long range apparent motion. There is evidence that the modelling in short range apparent motion is enhanced if the moving patterns are similar to moving human forms (such as patterns of dots outlining a person)(Thornton ''et al.'' 1998). The accuracy of predicting movement can actually improve if the interval between presentations is increased when human forms are used.

Motion modelling can also be seen in visual illusions such as the ''Waterfall Illusion'' (motion aftereffect).  The waterfall illusion is commonly seen after viewing a sequence of scrolling credits on the television; when the credits stop rolling it appears as if they briefly move in the opposite direction. Tootel ''et al.'' (1995) have used fMRI to show that this is correlated with activity in the motion modelling area of visual cortex (area MT/V5).  The waterfall illusion is also associated with an intriguing aftereffect known as '''storage of the motion aftereffect'''. Normal motion aftereffects last for up to about ten seconds after the stimulus, however, if the subjects close their eyes for the normal duration of the aftereffect then reopen them they see the illusion for almost the normal duration. Culham ''et al.'' (1999) used fMRI to show that activity in area MT/V5 was low during the period when the eyes were closed then increased dramatically when the eyes were opened.  This is strongly suggestive of a modelling mechanism outside MT/V5 that has adapted to motion and then models stationary data with movement in the wrong direction.

Visual area MT/V5 is also involved in the separation of moving visual scenes into ''sprites'' or objects that move together as a whole within a scene (Muckli ''et al.'' 2002).

The way that mental models may be the basis of ordinary reasoning was outlined by Johnson-Laird (1980), based on earlier work by Kenneth Craik.

Studies of 'change blindness' and 'inattentional blindness', where subjects fail to spot outrageous changes in their environment, also demonstrate that we experience a model and suggest that the brain must analyse an object to incorporate it fully into the model (See for instance Rensink (2000), Simons &amp; Rensink (2005)).


===Brain areas used in perception overlap those used in imagination and recall===

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has shown that similar areas of brain are used during perception involving the senses as during imagination (Tong 2003, Kosslyn and Thompson 2003).  The substrate of the mental images that occur in both modes of brain activity has not yet been found.  This overlap of the brain areas used in perception with those used in imagination, memory and recall has been demonstrated in a wide range of experiments.

Ganis ''et al.'' (2004) used fairly complex perceptual and imagination tasks that activated large areas of the brain, they found an overlap between the brain areas activated during perception and imagery. The principle areas that were different in the two tasks were found in the primary sensory areas of the visual cortex. Other areas in the visual cortex and activity in the rest of the brain showed a remarkable degree of overlap. The authors suggested that the differences in the activity of primary visual cortex may have been due to differences between the perceptual and imaginary stimuli such as speed of onset etc. The hippocampus was not activated. 

It is intriguing that, contrary to object imagery,  spatial imagery such as predicting when a cross on a screen would fall on an imaginary letter actually seems to inhibit activity in sensory visual cortex (Aleman ''et al.''). Both fMRI and blocking with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) showed that the posterior parietal cortex was involved in the spatial imagery.

Imagery involving places and faces activates the place and face areas that are activated during perception (Ishai ''et al.'' 2000).

The recall and recognition of things also seems to involve very similar brain areas to those used during perception. Wheeler and Buckner (2003) showed that areas involved in perception were also involved in the recall of the perceptual stimuli. 

Recall causes activation of areas used in perception but also seems to use areas that may be particularly related to the process of recall iself, such as the left parietal cortex (Konishi ''et al.'' 2000) (Brodmann's area 40/39). Frontal and parietal regions are involved in the recognition of whether stimuli have been experienced before.

Image generation during sleep seems to differ from that during imagination and recall. In particular it seems to involve a few well defined areas of cortex and considerable activation of the posterior thalamus. 

Sleep studies have shown that people dream throughout sleep. However, dreams are more frequent during the REM (rapid eye movement) periods of sleep than the NREM (non-REM) periods. Dreams are reported after 70-95% of awakenings in REM sleep and 5-10% of awakenings in NREM sleep. REM dreams are more visual than NREM dreams which are more 'thoughtlike' (Solms 2000).  Thoughtlike events (mentation) are reported after 43% of awakenings from NREM sleep.
 
Solms (1997) found that patients who had lesions in the parietal-temporo-occipital junction reported a cessation of visual images in dreams. Solms also found that patients with lesions in the white matter inferior to the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, in the ventromesial quadrant of the frontal lobes, also reported loss of dreaming. Loss of dreaming is also reported by leucotomised patients with frontal ventromesial damage.  Damasio ''et al.'' (1985) and Solms (1997) also reported that some patients with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the basal forebrain became confused about what was real life and what was dreaming (waking dreams occurred). 

Studies using fMRI show that the sensory occipital lobe (BA 18) and posterior thalamus, especially the lateral geniculate nuclei, are activated in REM sleep, weaker activations of the posterior cingulate, putamen and midbrain were also found (Wehrle ''et al.'' 2005, Loveblad ''et al.'' 1999). These findings are consistent with activation of the ponto-geniculo-occipital system (PGO) during REM.

So dreams may be more like primary activations of sensory cortex than imagining or recall.  This suggests that dreams have a thalamic origin or are managed via connections from the cortex through the thalamus to the visual cortex.

Hallucinations seem to differ from dreams. In Charles Bonnett Syndrome patients can have clear hallucinations.  These, like imaginations, seem to involve areas of the visual cortex that deal with processed data, for instance hallucinations of faces activate the &quot;face area&quot; rather than visual cortical area V1 (Ffytche ''et al.'' 1998).

===Suppression of data acquisition during saccades - perception as a patchwork===

If you look at yourself in the mirror you will not see your eyes moving even though they will be darting all over the view of your face.  Even when you deliberately look from place to place your eyes will appear steady.  The natural darting of the eyes from place to place as you view a scene is known as &quot;saccadic&quot; movement of the eyes. The suppression of the visual image during the motion of the eyes is known as &quot;saccadic suppression&quot; or &quot;saccadic masking&quot;.  The suppression of the acquisition of image data extends to suppression of awareness of flashes of light during saccades, this effect is known as &quot;flash suppression&quot;, however, flash suppression seems to apply only to rather dull flashes (Volkman (1962).  The suppression during saccades is probably due to suppression of the magnocellular pathway (the motion sensitive pathway) in the lateral geniculate nucleus (Burr ''et al.'' (1996).

The most intriguing feature of this suppression of data acquisition during saccades is that each snapshot that is obtained between saccades can only contain a relatively small amount of information.  This is because the fovea, which is the most sensitive area of the eye, is tiny (about 1mm diameter) and only receives input from a few degrees of the visual field. As a result what we consider to be a uniform scene in our minds is actually a patchwork of intersaccade snapshots.

Another aspect of saccades is that the timing of events is referred back to the beginning of the saccade. This effect is known as &quot;saccadic chronostasis&quot;.  For example, if an object changes colour during a saccade the observer feels as if the colour change occurred at the beginning of the saccade, so extending the amount of time that the object possesses the changed colour. This effect can extend apparent durations by up to 500 ms and is consistent with the idea that the visual system models events prior to perception (see Yarrow ''et al.'' 2006).

==Blindsight==

Blindsight studies illuminate the relationship between the cerebral cortex and our experience. When the visual cortex is removed subjects become almost totally blind. If the visual cortex on one side is removed subjects become relatively blind in the contra-lateral hemifield. One of the most revealing studies of blindsight is Marcel's 1998 paper: &quot; Blindsight and shape perception: deficit of visual consciousness or visual function?&quot;.

It is useful when considering blindsight to contemplate for a while the appearance of the world with both eyes closed and then with one eye closed. When both eyes are closed our experience is of a darkish space radiating out from our heads, with one eye closed we tend to ignore the darkish areas that cannot be seen even though they are still present. Marcel notes that patients who have a right blind field still have an underlying visual field on the right side and that this can even contain conscious visual experience. This sounds a bit like the darkish space that we all experience if deprived of visual input on one side. As Marcel says: &quot;A question that naturally arises is whether the loss is a 'total' loss of visual consciousness in the blind field. It is often assumed to be so, especially by those who discuss blindsight without carefully reading the literature or working with the subjects. One can immediately respond negatively to the question..&quot;

The consciousness of the completion of Kanizsa figures in blindsight patients is particularly indicative of the preservation of the field even though the content was largely missing. A Kanizsa figure is shown below:

[[Image:Whiter than white illusion.jpg|thumb]]

If we put Marcel's observations together with cortical anatomy and function it seems that the space of our experience is located outside of the cerebral cortex. The cortex generates much of visual and other content but it does not generate the space.

==The Role of the Thalamus==

The thalamus is connected to the entire bottom layer of the cerebral cortex. It is the nexus of the various cortical processors as well as a recipient of independent input from most of the rest of the brain.

[[Image:Constudbrain.png]]

The thalamus is subdivided into numerous small and medium sized nuclei that between them receive inputs from every process in the nervous system (the white fibres in the illustration above largely penetrate the thalamus). The thalamic nuclei are interconnected which means that any of them could, potentially host activity from anywhere in the body or brain. Although the founders of neurology such as Hughlings Jackson and Penfield &amp; Jasper located conscious experience in the diencephalon, including the thalamus, this is no longer the conventional wisdom. The small size of the thalamic nuclei means that they cannot support the processes that are assumed to compose access consciousness, however, even some of the smallest thalamic nuclei host millions of synapses so size would not be an obstacle if the thalamus contains the substrate of phenomenal consciousness. Indeed, the diencephalon and the thalamus in particular can be shown to be excellent candidates for a possible location of phenomenal experience.

If the thalamus contains a location for conscious experience then lesions should abolish this experience. Unlike the cerebral hemispheres, lesions of the thalamus do indeed seem to abolish consciousness. The area that is most sensitive to lesions contains the Intralaminar Nuclei, especially the Parafascicular and Centromedian Nuclei. If these are damaged bilaterally patients suffer death, coma, akinetic mutism, hypersomnia, dementia and other equally serious impairments of consciousness that depend upon the size and placement of the lesions (Bogen 1995, Schiff &amp; Plum 1999). In cases of fatal familial insomnia, in which patients exhibit many of these symptoms, there is marked neuron loss in the Intralaminar Nuclei (Budka 1998). 

The effect of interrupting the blood supply to the medial thalamus depends upon the severity of the damage. There is frequently initial coma. The recovery after coma is often incomplete, Krolak-Salmon ''et al.'' (2000) described bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts as normally being &quot;followed by persisting dementia with severe mnemic disturbance, global aspontaneity and apathy.&quot; The symptoms of bilateral damage to the ILN can be so severe that it is possible that, even after recovery from coma, some patients may cease to be conscious and are being coordinated by automatic cortical processes.

Bjornstad ''et al.'' (2003) and Woernera ''et al.'' (2005) both reported that the initial coma after bilateral paramedian infarct was accompanied by a similar pattern of EEG activity to stage 2 sleep. Woernera ''et al.'' (2005) also discovered that painful stimuli gave rise to a range of EEG activity, transiently breaking the stage 2 sleep pattern but without recovery of consciousness. Unfortunately even in those patients who recover consciousness Kumral ''et al.'' (2001) report that &quot;Cognitive functions in patients with bilateral paramedian infarction did not change significantly during the follow-up, in contrast to those with infarcts in varied arterial territories&quot; although Krolak-Salmon ''et al.'' (2000) did report a single patient who made a total recovery. 

Laureys ''et al.'' (2002) investigated recovery from 'persistent vegetative state' (wakefulness without awareness). They found that overall cortical metabolism remained almost constant during recovery but that the metabolism in the prefrontal and association cortices became correlated with thalamic ILN and precuneus activity. Again confirming that thalamo-cortico-thalamic activity is required for consciousness and that cortical activity by itself is not conscious. Yamamoto ''et al.'' (2005) investigated persistent vegetative state and found that deep brain stimulation (25Hz) of the centromedian-parafascicular complex (19 cases) or mesencephalic reticular formation (2 cases) resulted in 8 of the patients emerging from persistent vegetative state.  It is interesting that zolpidem, a GABA agonist, has recently been found to reverse PVS in some patients (Claus &amp; Nel 2006). The effect is rapid and might be used to demonstrate the correlations that occur on recovery from PVS.

As Bogen(1995) demonstrates, the ILN receive inputs, either directly or indirectly, from every part of the CNS but what do they do?

Interest in the thalamus has recently been revived by the theories of Newman &amp; Baars (1993), Baars, Newman, &amp; Taylor1998) and Crick &amp; Koch (1990). In Baars, Newman and Taylors' (1998) theory it is suggested that &quot;The brain stem-thalamocortical axis supports the state, but not the detailed contents of consciousness, which are produced by cortex&quot;. They also propose that the &quot;nucleus reticularis thalami&quot; (Thalamic Reticular Nucleus, TRN), which is a thin sheet of neurons that covers the thalamus, is involved in a selective attention system. This concept is reinforced by the way that point stimulation of the TRN causes focal activity in the overlying cortex (MacDonald ''et al.'' 1998) and the way the TRN is organised topographically (i.e.: has activity that is like an electrical image of receptor fields).

The thalamus is ideally placed for integrating brain activity, if tiny parts of the thalamus are removed consciousness is abolished and the thalamus is involved in attention and the global integration of cortical activity. Any impartial judge might pronounce that the site of conscious experience has been found, possibly in the ILN of the thalamus, but no one can say how it works.

==General Anaesthesia and the Thalamus==

General anaesthesia should result in a profound depression of activity in the ILN if these are indeed the sites of the conscious state. White &amp; Alkire (2003) administered halothane or isoflurane to volunteers and used positron emission tomography (PET) to monitor brain activity. They found severe depression of activity in the thalamus. The depression appeared to be higher in the non-specific nuclei than in the relay nuclei of the thalamus. In other words the anaesthesia is neither turning off the cortex nor turning off the input to the cortex but it is turning off an important part of the thalamus. Fiset ''et al.'' (1999) have also demonstrated a similar pattern of medial thalamic inactivity and cortical activity in propofol anaesthesia. Suppression of cortical activity is not the cause of unconsciousness; for instance, the anaesthetic agent chloralose leads to increased neural activity in the cortex relative to conscious patients (Cariani 2000).

==The function of consciousness==

When we walk our conscious experience does not contain data about the control of the spinal, cerebellar and vestibular reflexes that keep us on an even keel. When we reach out for a cup our conscious experience only contains data related to the need for the cup, not data about the elaborate control system that enables the action. When we talk the words just come into mind, we do not painstakingly control the syntax and vocal chords. When our attention shifts the conscious experience containing the shift happens after the attention has shifted. This passive nature of experience recurs throughout the neuroscience of consciousness from the &quot;readiness potential&quot; to the &quot;auditory continuity illusion&quot;. So what does conscious observation do?  The medical evidence of the lack of consciousness in some forms of delirium, mutism, PVS etc. suggest that the role of conscious observation is to stabilise the brain so that it acts as a coordinated whole.  Conscious observation is an orderly arrangement of events, a stable groundform that reflects the environment and composes the stage for action. It could be speculated that if quantum events were prominent in brain function then such a groundform would be essential but even a classical brain might require a stabilising form that could be continuously compared with the world beyond the body.

A stable form of neural information that contains bound data from the senses and internal neural processes is likely to have a role in the functioning of the organism. There is now an ''integration consensus'' that proposes that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing that would otherwise be independent (see review in Baars, 2002).  

However, it has remained unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.

Morsella (2005) proposed a ''Supramodular Interaction Theory'' (SIT) that contrasts the task demands of consciously penetrable processes (e.g.: those that can be part of conscious experience such as pain, conflicting urges, and the delay of gratification) and consciously impenetrable processes (e.g.: intersensory conflicts, peristalsis, and the pupillary reflex). With this contrastive approach, SIT builds upon the integration consensus by specifying which kinds of interaction require conscious processing and which kinds do not (e.g., some intersensory processes). SIT proposes that conscious processes are required to integrate high-level systems in the brain that are vying for (specifically) skeletomotor control, as described by the principle of ''parallel responses into skeletal muscle'' (PRISM). Accordingly, regarding processes such as digestion and excretion, one is conscious of only those phases of the processes that require coordination with skeletomotor plans (e.g., chewing or micturating) and none of those that do not (e.g., peristalsis). From this standpoint, consciousness functions above the level of the traditional module to “cross-talk” among high-level, specialized and often multi-modal, systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Everyone has their own view of the nature of consciousness based on their education and background. The intention of this book is to expand this view by providing an insight into the various ideas and beliefs on the subject as well as a review of current work in neuroscience.  The neuroscientist should find the philosophical discussion interesting because this provides first-person insights into the nature of consciousness and also provides some subtle arguments about why consciousness is not a simple problem. The student of philosophy will find a useful introduction to the subject and information about neuroscience and physics that is difficult to acquire elsewhere.

It is often said that consciousness cannot be defined. This is not true; philosophers have indeed defined it in its own terms. It can be described in terms of two principal components: firstly '''phenomenal consciousness''' which consists of our experience with things laid out in space and time, sensations, emotions, thoughts, etc., and secondly '''access consciousness''' which is the processes that act on the things in experience.  Phenomenal consciousness is much like the “perceptual space” of psychological and physiological research.  It is the many simultaneous events that become the space of experience in general and it is now a legitimate target of scientific research.  

As will be seen in the following pages, the issue for the scientist and philosopher is to determine the location and form of the things in phenomenal consciousness and even to consider whether such a thing could exist.  Is phenomenal consciousness directly things in the world beyond the body, is it brain activity based on things in the world and internal processes — a sort of virtual reality — or is it some spiritual or other phenomenon?

== A note on Naive Realism ==

The study of consciousness may seem to be esoteric or outside of the main stream but it includes some very real problems in science and philosophy.  The most obvious problem is how we can see anything at all.  Many people with a smattering of geometry tend to believe that they have a 'point eye' that sees the world and this idea is known as perceptual &quot;Naive Realism&quot;. Physical considerations show that this idea is highly contentious; we have two eyes with different images in each, normally the only images in the world are created by optical instruments such as the eye and the photons that carry light to the observer cannot and do not all converge at a single point. Some of the discrepancies between the physical reality and our experience are shown in the illustrations.

[[Image:Constudnaive1.png|left]] [[Image:constudnaive2.GIF|right]]

The naive realist idea of perception involves a point eye looking at a geometrical form. But the physics is different; there are two eyes with sometimes very different images in each. Light is refracted over the entire area of the cornea and directed over the entire area of the retina - there is no 'point eye'.

The cloud of photons that compose light must get in the way of the view but naive realism neglects this, regarding the photons as somehow transparent yet gathering as an impossible group of millions of photons in a viewing point.

Light rays go everywhere, it is only after light has passed through an optical instrument such as the eye that an image is formed. Hold up a sheet of paper - there are no images on it.

[[Image:Constudnaive4.png|left]]The illustrations show the nature of one of the most difficult problems studied by neuroscience: how can the images on the two retinas become experience? How can we imagine things or experience dreams and hallucinations? Studies on the neural basis of binocular rivalry and MRI studies of imagination are leading the way in our comprehension of these problems but there is still '''no physical theory that is congruent with sensory experience'''.  The problem of ''binding'' also takes us further from Naive Realism; we experience speech at the mouth of the speaker even though we might be listening through headphones, how is sound, touch etc. bound to vision?  The objective of the scientific study of consciousness is to discover how we convert data from the world into our experience.

A degree of Naive Realism is a sensible idea for coping with the everyday problems of working and living. Most physical scientists and people in general are, to some extent, Naive Realists until they study the biology of sensation and the problems of perception and consciousness. There is often a suspicion, or even fear, amongst Naive Realists that any analysis of conscious experience is a suggestion that the world does not exist or everything is imaginary. These fears are unfounded: Neuroscience is a study of the part of the physical world represented by brain activity and is part of medicine.

==Intended audience and how to read this book==

This book is intended as a complementary text for neuroscience and philosophy degree courses.  The book is divided into four parts. If you are not interested in some part, skip to the next. The first part is a detailed historical review of the philosophy of phenomenal consciousness. The second part is a discussion of philosophical theories, it is intended to be challenging and even irritating. Philosophy undergraduates are encouraged to criticise and react to this part. The third part is a review of the neuroscience of consciousness and is suitable for undergraduate studies in the field. The end of the book is a discussion of theories of consciousness.

Being freely available to all students the book can serve as a source for seminars even if you disagree with the content i.e.: “Why is (a given section) an oversimplification/biased/out of date etc.?”

The text covers a difficult area that straddles the humanities and science faculties.  It is probably more oriented towards the scientist who needs a scientific insight into philosophical theory rather than vice versa.  It is suitable as a '''supplementary text''' for the following '''undergraduate''' modules, units and courses:

*Neurophysiology/Neurobiology modules (physiology of perception, physiology of consciousness, neuronal basis of consciousness)
*Neuropsychology modules
*Neuroanatomy modules
*Cognitive psychology/Cognitive science
*Psychology of consciousness
*Psychology - behaviourism vs cognitivism debate
*Philosophy of mind and metaphysics
*Computing - Artificial intelligence and consciousness
*Consciousness studies courses

This is a “Wikibook” and, in this edition, has more breadth than depth. In some areas, particularly in the huge field of the philosophy of consciousness, topics are introduced and the obvious flaws or successes pointed out but a fully referenced, in-depth treatment is sometimes absent at this stage.  We need your help and contributions from scholars in the field are invited.  Please contribute but please, at the very least, scan the book first to ensure that your prospective contribution has not been included already!  In particular contributors who wish to write “all self respecting scientists think that the brain is a digital computer” should read the section on information theory and add their contribution to the section on the possibility of conscious digital computers.

Possible explanations:
* The cell contained nothing, not even oxygen, so the man had asphyxiated.
&lt;!-- * the man had strangled himself
It is impossible to strangle oneself, one would black out and lose motor functions long before any more oxygen could be denied to the brain. --&gt;
* The cell is a coffin, the man was dead before he was put into it and buried (and he was naked because he was a naturist).
* The man was in a mental institution where he took a fatal allergic reaction to medication he was prescribed - or he did not swallow his medicines at the prescribed time but saved it in order to overdose.
* The man was in a mental institution and the temperature drops. Since he was naked he died of hypothermia (this actually happened in a real hospital once)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The philosophical problem of phenomenal consciousness==

Chalmers (1996) encapsulated the philosophical problem of phenomenal consciousness, describing it as the ''Hard Problem''.  The Hard Problem can be concisely defined as &quot;how to explain a state of consciousness in terms of its neurological basis&quot; Block (2004).  A state is an arrangement of things in space over a period of time. It is possible that the Hard Problem has not been solved because the concepts of &quot;space&quot;, &quot;time&quot; and &quot;things&quot; are intensely problematic in both science and philosophy. 

Some philosophers have argued that ''changes'' in state are equivalent to &quot;mental states&quot;.  That consciousness experience always involves acts, such as acts of acquaintance (Russell 1912). But what is a succession of states in the brain or the physical world? 

As an extension of the idea of &quot;acts&quot; as mental states many philosophers have argued that the functional description of a system does not need to contain any reference to qualia within that system. Such ideas, based on nineteenth century materialism, have been expressed by Huxley, Ryle, Smart, Goldman and many others. However, although qualia are not required for classical functions, such as most computations or servo-control, it is far from clear whether this is true for all functions. If a function is described as any thing that mediates a change in state it should be realised that &quot;change&quot; itself is not fully understood in philosophy or science and that some systems, such as quantum mechanical systems, contain state changes that are far from understood. It will be seen below that our scientific knowledge is not yet sufficiently complete to allow the claim that all, or even any, changes can occur without qualia.

Whether a philosopher or scientist is dualist, materialist or physicalist they should have some insight into current theories about the physical world. Certainly, if they are considering the problem of &quot;how to explain a state of consciousness in terms of its neurological basis&quot; then some idea of a &quot;neurological basis&quot; is essential.

The objective of this section is to give an account of the problems of space, time and content and to describe how these affect the problem of consciousness.

==Epiphenomenalism and the problem of change==

Philosophers have noticed since the time of Leibniz that phenomenal consciousness does not seem to be required for the brain to produce action. As an example there are numerous reflexes that can occur without any awareness that they are happening.  In fact it is difficult to think of any response to a stimulus that requires phenomenal consciousness and could not, in principle, be performed in the absence of conscious intervention.  T.H. Huxley is often regarded as the originator of the term '''epiphenomenalism''' to describe how consciousness seems extraneous to processes in the materialist interpretation of the world although the term may have originated in James' description of Huxley's (1874) ideas.

According to nineteenth century science changes in state cannot explain the existence of phenomenal consciousness so superficially it may appear as if phenomenal consciousness is unnecessary.  However, it may come as a shock to the reader to discover that nineteenth century science is also unable to account for any change in state. In the materialist paradigm time is construed to be a succession of instants of no duration, each of which is entirely separate from the others. As a result no instant can cause a change in another instant. It is not only conscious experience that is epiphenomenal, each instant of the nineteenth century concept of the world is epiphenomenal because it cannot give rise to the next instant.    

On the one hand it seems that conscious experience is not required for a nineteenth century model of behaviour and on the other hand nineteenth century science seems to be impossible without extraneous input from a conscious observer who contains the idea of change.

The problem of change is closely related to the problem of time which is discussed in depth below. (See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/change/#inst Change and Inconsistency, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]).

The reader might consider whether phenomenal consciousness is indeed epiphenomenal. Empirical reports describe it as something that is different from the world beyond the body (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_The_conflict2#Direct_Realism direct realism]) - but could we generate empirical reports of an epiphenomenon?  If we do indeed generate empirical reports of phenomenal consciousness is there some non-materialist, physical** connection between phenomenal consciousness and the functional state?

In the analysis that follows it is essential that the reader does not dismiss the possibility that conscious experience is largely non-functional in a classical sense.  The idea that observation is not action should not be dismissed out of hand. Indeed the claim that something cannot be true if it is &quot;epiphenomenal&quot; in a classical sense is astonishing in the context of modern quantum physics. Everettian approaches (and offshoots like the Bohmian, Consistent Histories and operational (decoherence) approaches) to quantum physics all allow that the classical world is epiphenomenal (cf: Page 1997, Stapp 1998).  The Copenhagen Interpretation, however, was less clear on this issue.

It is curious that problems with the nature of phenomenal consciousness are also problems with nineteenth century science - Aristotlean regress in the mind is part of the wider problem of epistemological regress and epiphenomenalism is part of the wider problem of change. Perhaps nineteenth century science is not an appropriate foundation for understanding consciousness.

==The problem of time==

''This section should be read after reading [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity_for_beginners a quick introduction to special relativity]''

===The past century of ideas about time===

McTaggart in 1908 set out some of the problems with our idea of time in his classic paper ''The Unreality of Time''.  He drew attention to the way that a sequence of things in a list does not describe time because a sequence of things is constant yet events are always changing. These considerations led him to propose that there are three different sequences of things, or series, that are commonly used to describe events. McTaggart's three different time series are summarized in the illustration below.  

[[Image:constudseries.gif]]

He argued that only the 'A Series' is a temporal series because it is only in the A Series that change occurs so that events can be given the labels 'future', 'present' and 'past'. He pointed out that although the A Series is used for determining the direction and sequence of events it is not itself 'in time' because it contains relations that are neither a part of the C Series nor the B Series. This led him to propose that time is unreal because change involves a movement along the time series so cannot be fixed within it.

Franck (1994) argued on the basis of Atmanspacher's models of universes with real and imaginary geometries that McTaggart's 'unreality' of time could be avoided by proposing a second, imaginary, time dimension.

 &quot;What McTaggart in fact demonstrates is that it is impossible to 
 account for temporality within a strictly one-dimensional concept 
 of time.&quot;(Franck 1994).

This idea is illustrated below:

[[Image:constudseries2.gif]]

This idea of time being two dimensional is not new and has also been advanced by such luminaries as Hermann Weyl and CD Broad. Weyl (1920) made the following statement that is extremely apposite to consciousness studies, he wrote that reality is a:

 &quot;...four-dimensional continuum which is neither 'time' nor 'space'. 
 Only the consciousness that passes on in one portion of this world 
 experiences the detached piece which comes to meet it and passes 
 behind it, as history, that is, as a process that is going forward 
 in time and takes place in space.&quot; (Weyl 1920).

McTaggart's objection to time is felt intuitively by anyone who has contemplated the ''Block Universe'' of Relativity Theory. If the universe is four dimensional with three space dimensions and one time dimension it would be fixed forever and the observer would be frozen within it.  This would occur whether the time dimension was arranged according to Galilean Relativity or Modern Relativity.

Peter Lynds in 2003 has drawn attention to the 'frozen' nature of the observer in a four dimensional universe. He proposes, like Kevin Brown in his popular [http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath158.htm mathpages], that time must be approached from the viewpoint of quantum physics because simple four dimensional universes would give rise to 'frozen, static' instants and hence no change could occur.  Lynds argues that if quantum physics is introduced then no event can have a definite moment of occurrence and  that change occurs because of this quantum indeterminacy: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;I would suggest that there is possibly much more to be gleaned from the connection between quantum physics and the inherent need for physical continuity, and even go as far to speculate that the dependent 
relationship may  be the underlying explanation for quantum jumping and with static indivisible mathematical time values directly related to the process of quantum collapse. Time will tell.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;(Lynds 2003).

Our knowledge of quantum uncertainty can be traced back to De Broglie's highly successful model of individual particle motions.  This model was based on Special Relativity theory and it predicted a wave nature for particles. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle can be shown to be a consequence of this wave nature.  See the illustration below:

[[Image:constuddebroglie.gif]]

The illustration is based on de Broglie (1925) and Pollock (2004).

So Lynds' argument that change is due to the uncertainty principle is actually an argument that change is due to differing planes of simultaneity between systems that are in relative motion. Kevin Brown is aware of this; he summarises the effect of uncertainty due to special relativity and points out that it provides a resolution of Zeno's arrow paradox:

 &quot;The theory of special relativity answers Zeno's concern over the 
 lack of an instantaneous difference between a moving and a non-moving 
 arrow by positing a fundamental re-structuring the basic way in which 
 space and time fit together, such that there really is an instantaneous 
 difference between a moving and a non-moving object, insofar as it 
 makes sense to speak of &quot;an instant&quot; of a physical system with mutually 
 moving elements.  Objects in relative motion have different planes of 
 simultaneity, with all the familiar relativistic consequences, so not 
 only does a moving object look different to the world, but the world 
 looks different to a moving object.&quot; (Brown 19??)

Another approach to the way that time has a direction is to suggest that the possible outcomes in quantum mechanics are located in &quot;disjoint space-time regions which
exclude one another&quot; (McCall 2000). This does not explain the A Series however because the observer would not have any sense of 'becoming' or temporality as a result of the existence of regions that could not be observed.

===Presentism and Four-Dimensionalism===

In the past century the philosophical battle lines have been drawn between the Presentists, who believe that only the durationless instant of the present exists and the Four Dimensionalists who consider that things are extended in both space and time (see Rea (2004)). There are two types of Presentism, in its extreme form it is the belief that the past and future are truly non-existent, that what we call time is not an axis for arranging things but a series of changes and records in an ''enduring'' present. In its less extreme form, which might be called ''functional presentism'', the present is a durationless instant that can never be connected to the future or past except through predictions and records.

In consciousness studies it is the conventional theory that brain activity occurs in the present instant and that the past can only occur as memories retrieved into this durationless present. So, in consciousness studies functional Presentism seems to be the accepted paradigm.

Presentism cannot explain change. Each instant is durationless and frozen. That said, as seen above, four dimensionalism cannot explain the observation of change although it can explain the difference between moving and stationary objects. Fortunately the debate has been largely resolved by recent scientific experiments which show that time exists and hence Presentism is unlikely.

===The existence of time===

The issue of whether or not time exists is critical to consciousness studies. If we exist at an instant without duration then how can we know we exist? Clay (1882) coined the term 'specious present' to describe how we seem to exist for a short period containing the immediate past:

&quot;All the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time measured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively to human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past, the specious present, the real present, and the future.&quot; 

So conscious, phenomenal experience has things that are apparently extended in time. But does time exist?

Recent experiments in quantum physics should change our view of time forever. Lindner ''et al.'' (2005) have explored the problem of time by investigating quantum interference between interferometer slits that are separated by time rather than space. 

In the famous, spatial 'double slit experiment' in quantum physics single electrons are directed at an apparatus that has the equivalent of two tiny slits separated by a small gap. The electrons pass through the apparatus one at a time and produce flashes of light on a screen or changes in a photographic plate. The electrons produce series of bands on the screen that are typical of interference effects. So each electron is deflected as if it has passed through both slits and interfered with itself. 

[[Image:constudtwinslit.gif]]

This experiment provided some of the earliest evidence for the wave-packet nature of the electron. 

In an amazing technical tour de force Lindner ''et al.'' (2005) have extended the idea of the spatial double slit experiment to an investigation of time. In the double slit experiment in time electrons are produced in an inert gas by extremely short laser pulses. The pulses stimulate a single atom and there is a probability of this atom releasing an electron at each oscillation of the pulse. The apparatus is described by Paulus ''et al.'' (2003). The probability (see note 1) of an electron being ejected to the left or right of the apparatus can be adjusted by adjusting the optical pulse. Pulses can be applied with a duration of a few femtoseconds and these create 'slits' extending over an interval of about 500 attoseconds (500 x 10-18 seconds). A single electron has a probability of being emitted at each of the slits. The probability of the single electron going in a particular direction after both slits have been created depends upon the interaction of the probabilities of being emitted in a particular direction at each single slit. As expected, an interference pattern was generated as a result of single electrons interfering with themselves across different times.

[[Image:constudtimeslit.gif]]

This experiment is remarkable because it provides direct evidence that time exists in a similar fashion to the way that space exists. It is consistent with Feynman's theory of Quantum Electrodynamics where all possible paths, both in time and space, interact to produce the final trajectory of a particle and consistent with modern Special Relativity, on which QED is based, where the trajectories of particles occur in an extended four dimensional space-time. 

The experiment has not attracted as much attention as it might have done because most physicists are not Presentists. To physicists the experiment is yet another confirmation of modern physics. However it has impressed many:

&quot;This experiment should be included in every textbook on quantum mechanics,&quot; says Wolfgang Schleich, a quantum physicist at the University of Ulm in Germany. &quot;It certainly will be in mine.&quot; (PhysicsWeb)

Why should a concrete demonstration that time exists affect consciousness studies? The simple answer is that, as Kant, Gombrich, Clay, James and many others have spotted, there can be no conscious, phenomenal experience without time. The fact that time exists should provide new insights and liberate theorists in the field of consciousness studies from the problems of recursion and regression that are inherent in Presentism. 

Meanwhile Quantum Theorists are pressing on with the problem of how an organised spacetime could emerge from quantum chaos (cf: Ambjorn ''et al.'' (2004)) and even how mind might be involved in the emergence of time itself (cf: Romer (2004)).

===The nature of time===
====The nature of classical time====
In the eighteenth century it became apparent that Euclid's parallel postulate could not be explained in terms of the other postulates. The parallel postulate is equivalent to the statement that exactly one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line in such a way that it is parallel to the given line (this is Playfair's simple version).  It is also known as the fifth postulate.

The attempts to prove the parallel postulate led to the development of non-Euclidean geometry.  It was then possible to show that the parallel postulate is a special case within a range of geometrical forms from spherical geometry, through Euclidean geometry to the hyperbolic geometry of Bolyai and Lobatschefsky.  Furthermore it was shown by Taurinus that the axioms of Euclidean geometry, with the exception of the fifth postulate, applied on the surface of a sphere with an imaginary radius.  This motivated Hermann Minkowski to propose that Einstein's new theory of relativity was in fact due to the universe being a 'space-time' with four dimensions rather than just a space in which things change (see Walter 1999). In 1909 Minkowski said that:

 &quot;Henceforth space by itself and time by itself, are doomed to fade 
 away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will 
 preserve an independent reality&quot;. &lt;/font&gt;(Minkowski 1909).

The earliest idea of the four dimensional universe involved time as an  axis with displacements measured in units of the square root of minus one (cf: Einstein (1920)): time was considered to be displacements along the imaginary plane.  However, from the moment of Minkowski's proposal mathematicians were aware that other interpretations of time could give almost identical physical results.    

According to the differential geometry developed during the nineteenth century a space is defined in terms of a ''metric tensor'' which is a matrix of factors that determine how displacements in each independent direction vary with displacements in the other directions.  The metric tensor then specifies a ''metric'' which is an equation that describes the length of a displacement in any direction in terms of the independent directions, or ''dimensions''.

A derivation of the metric tensor and how it can be used to calculate the metric is given in the [[/Appendix/]].

The metric of the space considered by Euclid is Pythagoras' theorem where the length of any displacement is given in terms of the displacements along the three independent axes, or dimensions:

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2  +  z^2 &lt;/math&gt;

It is interesting to explore ''imaginary time'' from the point of view of consciousness studies. Minkowski's original idea for the geometry of the world proposed that any displacement was a displacement in both time and space given by a four dimensional version of Pythagoras' theorem:

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2  +  z^2 + (ict)^2&lt;/math&gt;

which, given that &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt; equals:

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2  +  z^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''i'' is the square root of minus one, ''c'' is a constant for converting metres to seconds and t is the displacement in time. The space-time is considered to be flat and all displacements are measured from the origin.

The interesting feature of Minkowski space-time with imaginary time is that displacements in time can ''subtract'' from displacements in space.

If we set &lt;math&gt;r^2 = x^2 + y^2  +  z^2&lt;/math&gt; (where ''r'' is the radius of a sphere around the origin then:

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = r^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that &lt;math&gt;s^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;r^2 = (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt; so if imaginary time existed there would be times and separations within a spherical volume of things where '''everything is at a point as well as distributed in space'''.  This idea has distinct similarites with the ''res cogitans'' mentioned by Descartes, and the ''point soul'' of Reid and Malebranche etc., however, this feature of Minkowski's space-time has not been popular with physicists for some good reasons.  Blandford and Thorne point out some of the problems:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt; One approach, often used in elementary textbooks [and also used in Goldstein's (1980) Classical Mechanics and in the first edition of Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics], is to set &lt;math&gt;x^0 = it&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i = \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and correspondingly make the time basis vector be imaginary,... When this approach is adopted, the resulting formalism does not care whether indices are placed up or down; one can place them wherever one's stomach or liver dictate without asking one's brain. However, this &lt;math&gt;x^0 = it&lt;/math&gt; approach has severe disadvantages: (i) it hides the true physical geometry of Minkowski spacetime, (ii) it cannot be extended in any reasonable manner to non-orthonormal bases in flat spacetime, and (iii) it cannot be extended in any reasonable manner to the curvilinear coordinates that one must use in general relativity. For this reason, most advanced texts [including the second and third editions of Jackson (1999)] and all general relativity texts take an alternative
approach, which we also adopt in this book. This alternative approach requires introducing two different types of components for vectors, and analogously for tensors: contravariant components denoted by superscripts, and covariant components denoted by subscripts.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; Blandford &amp; Thorne (2004).

What Blandford and Thorne are saying is that the metric of space-time appears to be the result of the interaction of  two coordinate systems and cannot be explained by a single coordinate system with imaginary time.  When a more complicated geometrical analysis is applied it is evident that there are two possibilities for the time coordinate.  In the first the metric can be '''assumed''' from the outset to be 

&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2  +  z^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the metric tensor simply adjusted by inserting -1 in the principle diagonal so that the negative sign in front of the time coordinate occurs.  With this assumption and adjustment the time coordinate can be assumed to be ''real''.  In the second possibility the time coordinate in the world can be assumed to be imaginary and the time coordinate of the observer can be assumed to be real. This gives rise to the same metric tensor and metric as the first possibility but does not assume the resulting metric from the outset. 

The three ideas of classical time (imaginary, real and mixed) are shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:constudclasstime.gif]]

The light cone is divided into three regions: events on the surface of the light cone, such as photons converging on the observer, are said to be ''lightlike'' separated from the observer, events inside the future or past light cones are said to be ''timelike separated'' and events outside the lightcone are said to be ''spacelike'' separated from the observer. 

The physical '''theory of relativity''' consists of four dimensional geometry plus the assumption of causality and the assumption that physical laws are invariant between observers. It should be noted that space-time could contain preferred frames of reference and is not, by itself, a theory of relativity. The assumption that physical laws are invariant between observers leads to the postulate that nothing can travel faster than ''c'' metres per second.  This means that the constant ''c'', which in Minkowski space-time is the conversion factor from seconds to metres then has a new significance as the maximum velocity. 

A result of ''c'' being a maximum velocity is that nothing can travel from regions of the light cone that are spacelike separated to the observer at coordinates (0,0,0,0). This is problematic for observers if time is real because, as Stein (1968) wrote:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;“in Einstein-Minkowski space-time an event's present is constituted by itself alone.” &lt;/font&gt; (Stein 1968).

However, to each of us it seems that the present is characterised by ''many'' things simultaneously. As will be discussed below, this simultaneity of present things also results in the appearance of phenomenal space. But in Minkowski space-time with real time the plane of simultaneity is entirely space-like separated from the observation point. If real time is accepted it would appear that we cannot have the space of phenomenal experience. The regions of the light-cone and the spacelike separation of present events are shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:Constudcone.gif]]

So can the time in Minkowski space-time be real?  If time were in some way related to the imaginary plane then all the content of the surface of the light cone could be simultaneously at the position of the observer and phenomenal experience containing space is possible, but then general relativity may be problematic. So can the time in Minkowski space-time be imaginary?

There is another problem with Minkowski space-time known as the &quot;Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose&quot; argument or the Andromeda paradox (Penrose 1989). Moving observers have different planes of simultaneity. The plane of simultaneity of an observer moving towards you slopes upward relative to your plane of simultaneity (see the illustration on &quot;De Broglie waves&quot; above). Suppose an alien civilisation in the Andromeda galaxy decided to launch a fleet of spacecraft intent on the invasion of earth just as you passed Jim in your car. Your plane of simultaneity would slope upwards ever so slightly compared with Jim's, Jim's plane of simultaneity could contain earlier events on Andromeda than yours. At the distance of the Andromeda galaxy it could be another week or two for the Andromedean's to launch their invasion fleet in Jim's slice of the universe.  Penrose considers that this example shows that the events in the universe must be fixed:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Two people pass each other on the street; and according to one of the two people, an Andromedean space fleet has already set off on its journey, while to the other, the decision as to whether or not the journey will actually take place has not yet been made. How can there still be some uncertainty as to the outcome of that decision? If to either person the decision has already been made, then surely there cannot be any uncertainty. The launching of the space fleet is an inevitability.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; (Penrose 1989).

If the decision to invade and a time previous to this decision are both part of the present instant on earth then, in a 4D classical universe, the decision to invade must be inevitable. This lack of free will in a 4D universe is known as chronogeometrical determinism (Toretti 1983). However, as de Broglie demonstrated, it is sloping planes of simultaneity that do indeed introduce uncertainty into our universe. It should also be noted that nothing on the plane of simultaneity is observable to the owner of that plane  because, to observe it would involve the transmission of data at velocities greater than the speed of light.

Petkov (2002)considers a version of the Andromeda paradox in depth. He concludes that:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;If the relativity of simultaneity is explicitly discussed in terms of the dimensionality of reality, the fact that observers in relative motion have different sets of simultaneous events can be explained either by assuming that existence is also relativized (preserving the views of the present and objective becoming) or by considering existence absolute which means that reality is a 4D world. Although the option of relativizing existence appears completely unacceptable from a philosophical point of view, that option is eliminated within the framework of SR by demonstrating that the twin paradox would not be possible if existence were not absolute.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

According to Petkov Special Relativity describes the universe as a frozen space-time where things are eternally arranged in four dimensions. Petkov introduces the possibility of change as a feature of consciousness and in support of this quotes Weyl's intuition that only the conscious observer moves in time.

==Relationalism, Substantivalism, the Hole Argument and General Covariance==
===Relationalism and Substantivalism===

The view that the universe could be an extended space and time with things in it, a sort of unbounded container, is known as '''substantivalism'''.  It was championed by Newton and Clarke in the seventeenth century.  The view that the space and time in the universe depends upon the relations between the objects in the universe is known as '''relationalism''' and was championed by Leibniz.

Leibniz attacked substantivalism by arguing that if there were two universes which only differed by things in one universe being displaced by five feet compared with things in the other universe then there is no reason why the two universes should be discernably different.

Newton supported substantivalism by arguing that when the water in a bucket rotates it adopts a concave surface that is independent of other motions and provides evidence of the possibility of absolute motion. This argument is called the ''bucket argument''.  Newton also introduces the ''globe argument'' in which he proposes that the state of motion of two globes connected by a taut thread can be gauged from the tension in the thread alone. When the globes are stationary with respect to each other there is no tension in the thread.

Ernst Mach  in 1893 introduced a relationalist account of the bucket argument by claiming that the water rotates in relation to the fixed stars. He stated this in what has become known as Mach's principle:

&quot;The inertia of any system is the result of the interaction of that system and the rest of the universe. In other words, every particle in the universe ultimately has an effect on every other particle.&quot;

The relationalist position is interesting from the viewpoint of consciousness studies because phenomenal consciousness appears as a projection that overlies physical space.  As an example, the stars on the ceiling of a planetarium appear to be at huge distances from the observer even though they are reflected lights that are only a few metres away.  In general a projection where positions depend upon angular separations will be subject to relationalism.   It is also probable that the space of phenomenal consciousness is a continuum of some field in the brain, if this is the case then the way we conceive of space as an existent entity is actually a conception involving the angular relations between the perturbations of the substance that is the field.  Substantivalism would then literally be space as a substance.  It is intriguing in this respect that Kant believed that space was a form of intuition and hence a property of mind.

Kant raised another type of argument for the justification of absolute space.  He asked whether ''handedness'' was due to relations or a property of space. The right and left hands are enantiomorphs (mirror images). The relations within the right and left hands are identical but they still differ, for instance a right hand cannot be moved on to a left hand so that it exactly overlies it. Kant proposed that handedness was property inherent in space itself rather than a set of relations.

Gardner introduced a version of Kant's problem with the &quot;Ozma&quot; argument:
&quot;Is there any way to communicate the meaning of the word &quot;left&quot; by a language transmitted in the form of pulsating signals? By the terms of the problem we may say anything we please to our listeners, ask them to perform any experiment whatever, with one proviso: there is to be no asymmetric object or structure that we and they can observe in common.&quot; (Gardner 1990).

Although it is probably impossible to provide an answer to the Ozma argument it is possible to relate handedness to a conceptual point observer who spans more than an instant of time. If a point observer is at the centre of a field of inward pointing space-time vectors then relative to any given vector there are positive and negative angular separations. The body is asymmetric and the point observer would lie within this so always have available a 'head' direction or a 'foot direction' and hence a left and right. Unlike the time extended observer an instantaneous observer would not contain vectors that contained directional information and would be no more than a collection of points in space.

Pooley (2002) discusses handedness in depth and introduces the problem of parity violation in the Weak Interaction.

===General Covariance and the Hole Argument===

The proposal that the universe is four dimensional does not in itself produce a full physical theory.  The assumptions of causality and the invariance of physical laws between observers are also required to create modern Relativity Theory.   The second assumption, that the laws of physics are the same for all observers is closely related to the requirement of '''general covariance'''.

The principle of general covariance requires that a manifold of events can be smoothly mapped to another  manifold of the same dimension and back again. This mapping should always give the same result. General covariance is assumed in General Relativity.

Einstein realised that there was an apparent problem with this assumption in certain circumstances. In his '''hole argument''' he considers a special region of space-time that is devoid of matter and where the stress-energy tensor vanishes.  He then labels the same events outside the hole with two different coordinate systems. These coordinate systems could differ by something as simple as having origins that are separate so the difference is entirely passive. Both systems will give the same values for the gravitational field outside the hole. It turns out however that that the systems predict different fields within the hole (see MacDonald (2001) for the calculation and Norton (1993), (1999) for a discussion).   Einstein overcame this problem by considering active mappings where particles are actually transferred through the hole. He concluded that the points where particles meet can be transformed according to general covariance and hence a relativistic theory could indeed be constructed. Solutions to the field equations that were inconsistent with the points defined by interacting particles were discarded as non-physical.

The hole argument led Einstein to abandon the idea of space and time as something separate from the material content of the universe. The General Theory of Relativity becomes a theory of '''observables'''. He wrote that:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;That the requirement of general covariance, which takes away from space and time the last remnant of physical objectivity, is a natural one, will be seen from the following reflection. All our space-time verifications invariably amount to a determination of space-time coincidences. If, for example, events consisted merely in the motion of material points, then ultimately nothing would be observable but the meetings of two or more of these points. Moreover, the results of our measurings are nothing but verifications of such meetings of the material points of our measuring instruments with other material points, coincidences between the hands of the a clock and points on the clock dial, and observed point-events happening at the same place at the same time. The introduction of a system of reference serves no other purpose than to facilitate the description of the totality of such coincidences&quot;.&lt;/font&gt; (Einstein 1916).

This is what would be expected from a four dimensional block universe with real time. It is a frozen universe of the type discussed earlier. As Earman (2002) puts it when discussing change:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;First, the roots of the problem lie in classical GTR, and even if it was decided that it is a mistake to quantize GTR, there would remain the problem of reconciling the frozen dynamics of GTR with the B-series notion of change that is supported not only by common sense but by every physical theory prior to GTR. Second, although the aspect of the problem that grabs attention is that of time and change, no solution will be forthcoming without tackling the more general issue of what an “observable” of classical GTR is.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

In such a universe action at a distance is not possible. From the viewpoint of consciousness studies the limitation of physical concepts to interactions between particles is a restatement of Ryle's regress and the recursion version of the homunculus problem. If events are no more than space-time coincidences then we are doomed to the endless transfer of data from point to point without any conscious observation. This seems to forbid any true simultaneity in experience and means that only measurements are possible.

The reduction of physics to the study of particle interactions is fully relationalist and allows space-time to become a property of these interactions rather than vice-versa. Once it becomes possible to consider space-time as a dependent property it is then feasible to equate ''observation'' with ''measurement''. Observation is normally the representation of an event in an observer's space-time coordinate system. Measurement is the change in state of a system in response to an encounter with an event. If we maintain that space-time does not exist and can be replaced by encounters between particles then observation can be replaced by measurement. This may well be a way forward for some approximations to physical reality and may allow us to understand how a space-time is selected within an observer. As part of this approach the word &quot;observable&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;measurable&quot;.

==Quantum theory and time==
===The general problem of QM and time===

Quantum physics provides many fundamental insights into the nature of time. At the simplest level the energy-time version of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle predicts that Quantum Mechanical (QM) interference should occur between a particle and earlier versions of itself. Such interference has been observed (see &quot;The existence of time&quot; above).  

Two of the most complete reviews of the problem of time in quantum theory available at present are Zeh (2001) and Isham (1993).

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of QM and time is that it can provide an argument that time does not exist in the universe as a whole.  The argument can be approached from many directions (See Rovelli 2003) but is clear in the Wheeler-de Witt equation which describes the wavefunction of the entire universe. This wavefunction has no reference to time. De Witt explained the emergence of time by proposing that the universe can be divided into an observer with measuring instruments and the rest of the universe so that the rest of the universe changes with respect to the observer.

Rovelli (2003) supports this idea of partition, he considers in depth the problems of the &quot;hole argument&quot; and quantum physics and notes that, given the assumption that events are just successions of relations:

&quot;&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;The unique account of the state of the world of the classical theory is thus shattered into a multiplicity of accounts, one for each possible &quot;observing&quot; physical system. Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the world.&lt;/font&gt; (Rovelli 2003).

Barbour (1997) and Hartle and Gell-Mann have both proposed that an observer is a partition or region with memories that contain the trace of histories.  The histories would represent a B Series. Unfortunately this leaves the A Series unexplained so time would have a direction but there would be no 'becoming'.

Hawking introduces the observer into the problem of time by asking what sort of universe is compatible with human life. This application of the '''Anthropic Principle''' leads to constraints on the form of the universe, for instance the universe should have galaxies and last for more than a few million years.  The Anthropic Principle is actually a restatement of the observer problem - if being an observer leads to a certain division of the universe into observer and observed then the observed part will have the form given by the Anthropic Principle. Hartle and Hawking () also tackled the &quot;boundary problem&quot; of cosmology by proposing that there is no boundary. This proposal involves adding a fifth, time-like, dimension on the imaginary plane so that the universe at its beginning is a '''de Sitter''' or '''anti de Sitter''' space-time.

A de Sitter space-time is characterised by the metric:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + (idt)^2 + du^2 &lt;/math&gt;

An anti de Sitter space time has the metric:

&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + (idt)^2 - du^2 &lt;/math&gt;

A de Sitter space time is fascinating from the view point of consciousness studies because it contains three space-like dimensions, one real, time-like dimension (u) and one imaginary time-like dimension. This might give the real and imaginary time-like axes that  Franck proposed were needed to produce the McTaggart A Series. However, the extra dimension could only be related to the observer in the universe as it is at present because the extra dimension does not appear to be required to explain measurables.

===The interpretation of QM===

Time is also of interest in the interpretation of quantum mechanics and entanglement.  There are many interpretations of QM such as the '''Operational Interpretation''' (Decoherence Theory), the '''Transactional Interpretation''', the '''Relational Interpretation''', the '''Many Worlds Interpretation''', the '''Copenhagen Interpretation''', the '''Bohm Interpretation''',  the '''Many Minds Interpretation etc.

Some of these interpretations, such as the Transactional Interpretation, allow the connection of entangled quantum states backwards in time along the path of particles. 

Decoherence theory is of particular interest because it allows the calculation of how long an entangled state can persist. Tegmark (2000) and Hagan ''et al.'' (2002) have used this technique to calculate the decoherence time of entanglement in microtubules and have differed by a factor of &lt;math&gt;10^{10} &lt;/math&gt; because of differing assumptions about the biophysics of microtubules in the brain.

==Time and conscious experience ==

In a four dimensional universe time is an independent direction for arranging things. As an independent direction things arranged in time do not overlie things arranged in space. This also appears to be the case in conscious experience where whole words or &quot;bars of a tune&quot; can be experienced arranged in time. This extension in time is easy to experience but the independence of the time dimension is difficult to conceive, for instance Le Poidevin (2000) reflects that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If events e1 and e2 are registered in a single specious present, then we perceive them both as present, and so as simultaneous. But we do not see, e.g., the successive positions of a moving object as simultaneous, for if we did we would see a blurred object and not a moving one.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This assumes that arrangements in time do not occur in an independent direction for arranging things and hence would overlay space. In fact the mystery of conscious experience is deeply related to how we can experience many things as events that are separate from each other.  Our experience of two dimensional patterns containing many things is as much a mystery as how we experience temporal patterns extended in time. The problem is illustrated below:

[[Image:constudsimevent.gif]]

It is as if patterns in conscious experience are being viewed from a point in at least four dimensions. How our experience can be like the 'view' of a conceptual point observer at the apex of a light cone without the data being overlaid and obscured is a profound mystery, obviously the data cannot be transferred into the apparent observation point and appears as nebulous vectors directed at the point. Some philosophers have noticed this problem.

The '''cuisine of Scotland''' is often neglected and ignored, due to the prevailing view of [[Cookbook:Haggis|haggis]].

It is true that most dishes rely on well-cooked meat, starches and boiled vegetables. However, these can be thought of as comfort foods, as is the case with the [[Cookbook:Scotch Egg|scotch egg]], [[Cookbook:Cullen skink|cullen skink]] or [[Cookbook:Cock-a-Leekie Soup|cock-a-leekie soup]].

In recent times, an emphasis on international and fusion cuisines has seen a rise of dishes that are often healthier and tastier than traditional recipes.

Scotch egg was invented by a department store in London. It has never been a Scottish recipe

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Scotland|Cuisine of Scotland]]

The national dish of Scotland, composed of a [[w:forcemeat|forcemeat]] of the heart, liver and lungs of a sheep mixed with oatmeal, well seasoned and put into bags made from the paunch of the sheep. The haggis is then boiled for 2-3 hours and left to get cold. When required for use it is simmered again for about an hour and is traditionally served with mashed turnips, potatoes and whisky.

The accompaniments, &quot;neeps and tatties&quot;, refer to mashed [[Cookbook:Swede|swede]] or [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]], and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (in this context, mashed.)

In fish and chip shops, a long, sausage-shaped haggis is often available deep-fried in batter with chips.
{{wikipedia|Haggis}}

==Recipe==
'''Major Ingredients'''
*1 pound beef (450g) heart, cut into 2-inch-wide strips
*1 pound beef (450g) liver 
*1/2 pound (225g) lamb stew meat, cut in 1-inch cubes 
*1 1/2 cups peeled and finely chopped yellow onion
*4 tablespoons Scotch
*1 tablespoon of eggnog 
*2 cups oatmeal, toasted on a cookie sheet in a 375F (200°C) oven for 10 minutes 

'''Seasonings'''
*2 teaspoons salt
*1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
*1 teaspoon dried thyme, whole 
*1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary 
*1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

'''Casing'''
*3 beef CAPS (Talk to a sausage shop about these) 
*1 cup distilled white vinegar
*1/2 tablespoon salt for soaking

== Preparation ==
# Place the beef heart in a 4-quart (about 3-3.5 litres) covered pot and just cover with cold water. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour and 10 minutes.
# Add the beef liver and lamb stew meat, and cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove the contents of the pot and cool. Reserve 1 cup of the liquid. Grind everything coarsely.
# In a large bowl mix all of the ingredients, except for the beef caps, vinegar, and salt for soaking. Mix well and set aside.
# Rinse the beef caps in cold water. Turn them inside out and soak them in 2 quarts of cold water with the salt and vinegar for 1/2 hour. Drain them and rinse very well, inside and out.
# Divide the meat mixture into three parts. Fill the beef caps with the meat mixture and tie the ends off with string. Two will have to be tied on just one end, but the third piece will be tied on both ends. Prick the Haggis all over with corn holders or a sharp fork. Place in a steamer and steam for 1 hour and 20 minutes.
#Serve the Haggis, sliced, with beef or lamb gravy.

Hello - I'm new to Wikibooks and I thought I'd contribute to Programming:Ada by filling in some of the blanks in the [[Programming:Ada:Attributes]] area.

I was wondering if I should follow a standard format for Attribute entries. I thought dividing up the entries into &quot;Description&quot;, &quot;Example&quot;, and &quot;See Also&quot; sections was a good idea, so I did so. 

I wasn't exactly consistent with how I wrote the examples. I noticed that Suruena improved the example I attempted for [[Programming:Ada:Attributes:'Size]]. The example as it is now written seems like a good standard for examples (working code, expresses what the values returned by the attributes should be). 

Are there any other suggestions for standardizing the format of 'Attribute entries?

Oops - you can tell I'm new because I don't know what I'm doing. :^) My username is oleszkie.

=== The Aim ===

The Aim is indeed &quot;Description&quot;, &quot;Example&quot;, and &quot;See Also&quot; - where Example should be fully working and compiling. With emphasis on &quot;should&quot; - we don't allways have the time to provide a working example.

See:

* [[Programming:Ada:Control#Working_Demo]]
* [[Programming:Ada:Strings]]
* [[Programming:Ada:Mathematical calculations]]
* [[Programming:Ada:Subtypes#Checked_Conversion]]

There is also a SourceForge Project to manage the sources for the examples: https://sourceforge.net/projects/wikibook-ada.

== Style conventions ==

Ideally we all should follow the same style conventions. There was an aim to define a common style in [[Talk:Programming:Ada#Coding_conventions]], but the discussion faded off. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:10, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This section is about how regression and recursion seem to undermine the idea of conscious experience being anywhere in the universe.''.

==The conflict - supervenience and the location of the contents of phenomenal consciousness ==

When we touch something or look at a view what we are probably touching or seeing is a thing in the world, out there, beyond our bodies. Many philosophers and almost all scientists would agree with this surmise. But is our conscious experience itself directly the things we touch or more like a picture of those things on television or something else entirely?  Furthermore, can we really be certain that what we believe we experience truly occurs?

Suppose for the moment that our experience truly does occur and consists of things laid out in time and space. Conscious experience appears to be a simultaneous set of things (i.e.: things arranged in space) but where are these things and what is this space? The things that occur in conscious experience could be a virtual reality in the brain based on the world beyond the body, or they could be the things themselves, viewed directly through some unknown phenomenon or it has even been suggested that they could be something non-physical. 

The problem of where the contents of conscious experience are located has provoked some of the fiercest battles in the philosophy of consciousness. There are three broad positions, the first is Direct Realism in which it is held that the contents of conscious experience are directly things in the world, the second is Indirect Realism where it is proposed that the contents of conscious experience are representations, usually in the physical brain, based on things 'out there' in the world and the third is idealism where it is held that there is no physical world, only non-physical conscious experience. These three classifications overlap considerably, for instance some Natural Dualists believe that the contents of sensory experience are directly the world beyond the body but some thoughts are based in a non-physical soul and some philosophers introduce the dualist notion of a &quot;logical space&quot; containing disembodied information.

Philosophers often use the concept of 'supervenience' to examine the location of the contents of consciousness.  Supervenience is the relation between two sets of properties. Supervenience can be simple; for example a golden ring supervenes on a piece of the metal gold. Supervenience can also be quite complex such as the idea that life supervenes on the biological processes in a cell.  The most difficult cases of supervenience are where a high level description is related to simpler physical properties such as form and content. There are formal statements of supervenience:

 The properties of A supervene on the properties of B if no two possible
 situations are identical with respect to the properties of A while
 differing with respect to the properties of B (after Chalmers 1996).

Lewis gives a simpler, if less technical, definition of supervenience:

 A dot-matrix picture has global properties -- it is symmetrical, 
 it is cluttered, and whatnot -- and yet all there is to the picture 
 is dots and non-dots at each point of the matrix. The global 
 properties are nothing but patterns in the dots. They supervene: no 
 two pictures could differ in their global properties without 
 differing, somewhere, in whether there is or there isn't a dot&quot;. 
 Lewis, D., 1986, On the Plurality of Worlds, Oxford: Blackwell

One set of properties is said to supervene ''locally'' on another set of properties if the second set is determined by the first. Shape is an example of local supervenience; for instance a gold wire forged in a circle determines a gold ring. A set of properties is said to supervene ''globally'' on another if the entire context of the properties must be included; for instance, two organisms could be physically identical but demonstrate different behaviours in different environments. In this case the physical form of an organism does not totally determine the behaviour. Philosophers also divide supervenience into logical supervenience and natural supervenience.  Logical supervenience deals with possible relations in possible worlds while natural supervenience deals with relations that occur in the natural world.

See [[Consciousness Studies/The Philosophical Problem/Machine Consciousness|elementary information theory]] for a discussion of supervenience in information systems.

A particular problem posed by consciousness studies is whether conscious phenomenal experience supervenes on the physical world and, if so, where. To answer these questions philosophers and neuroscientists must have a good understanding of physics. They should be aware of elementary physical ontology such as kinetic energy being the relativistic mass increase of a particle in a four dimensional universe and Newton's laws being due to the exploration of all paths in space-time.  Without a good knowledge of physics there is the danger that we will be asking whether phenomenal consciousness supervenes on an abstract model of the world which does not supervene on the world itself (i.e.: ''we may be asking if conscious phenomenal experience supervenes on Newtonian physics or supervenes on information systems theory rather than asking how phenomenal consciousness might supervene on the natural world'').

The possibility that conscious experience does not really occur, at least in the form that we believe it occurs, is known as the problem of the &quot;Incorrigibility of the cogito&quot; (Harrison 1984).  If Descartes' idea that &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; is not beyond question (incorrigible) then the idea of phenomenal consciousness may be incorrect.

==The problem of regression==

The philosopher Gilbert Ryle was concerned with what he called the intellectualist legend which requires intelligent acts to be the product of the conscious application of mental rules. The intellectualist legend is also known as the &quot;Dogma of the Ghost in the Machine,&quot; the &quot;Two-Lives Legend,&quot; the &quot;Two-Worlds Story,&quot; or the &quot;Double-Life Legend&quot;. Ralph Waldo Emerson summarised the intellectualist legend in the statement that &quot;The ancestor of every action is a thought.&quot; Ryle argued against the idea that every action requires a conscious thought and showed that this 'intellectualist legend' results in an infinite regress of thought:

 &quot;According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything 
 intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal 
 act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his 
 practical problem. [...] Must we then say that for the hero's 
 reflections how to act to be intelligent he must first reflect how 
 best to reflect how to act? The endlessness of this implied regress 
 shows that the application of the criterion of appropriateness does 
 not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion.&quot;
 (The Concept of Mind (1949)) 

[[image:constudregress.gif]]
 
 &quot;The crucial objection to the intellectualist legend is this. The 
 consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution 
 of which can be more or less intelligent, less or more stupid. But if, 
 for any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical 
 operation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it 
 would be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the 
 circle.&quot; 


Variants of Ryle's regress are commonly aimed at cognitivist theories. For instance, in order to explain the behavior of rats, Edward Tolman suggested that the rats were constructing a &quot;cognitive map&quot; that helped them locate reinforcers, and he used intentional terms (e.g., expectancies, purposes, meanings) to describe their behavior. This led to a famous attack on Tolman's work by Guthrie who pointed out that if one was implying that every action must be preceded by a cognitive 'action' (a 'thought' or 'schema' or 'script' or whatever), then what 'causes' this act? Clearly it must be preceded by another cognitive action, which must in turn must be preceded by another and so on, in an infinite regress unless an external input occurs at some stage.

As a further example, we may take note of the following statement from The Concept of Mind (1949):

&quot;The main object of this chapter is to show that there are many activities which directly display qualities of mind, yet are neither themselves intellectual operations nor yet effects of intellectual operations. Intelligent practice is not a step-child of theory. On the contrary theorizing is one practice amongst others and is itself intelligently or stupidly conducted.&quot; 

Ryle noted that &quot;theorizing is one practice amongst others.&quot; and hence would translate the statement by Emerson into, &quot;The ancestor of every action is an action.&quot; or &quot;The ancestor of every behavior is a behavior,&quot;. Each behaviour would require yet another behavior to preface it as its ancestor, and an infinite regress would occur.

It should be noted that Ryle’s regress is a critique of cognitivism which arises from the Behaviorist tradition. Near the end of The Concept of Mind, Ryle states, &quot;The Behaviorists’ methodological program has been of revolutionary importance to the program of psychology. But more, it has been one of the main sources of the philosophical suspicion that the two-worlds story is a myth.&quot; But Ryle’s brand of logical behaviorism is not to be confused with the radical behaviorism of B. F. Skinner or the methodological behaviorism of John B. Watson. For as Alex Byrne noted, &quot;Ryle was indeed, as he reportedly said, ‘only one arm and one leg a behaviorist’.&quot;

Arguments that involve regress are well known in philosophy. In fact any reflexive, or self referencing process or argument will involve a regress if there is no external input.  This applies whether the agent that engages in the process is a digital computer or intelligent agent (cf: Smith (1986), Yates (1991)). 

Ryle's regress suggests that intelligent acts are not created within phenomenal consciousness. They may have non-conscious components or even be entirely non-conscious.  Ryle argued that this might mean that consciousness is just a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; of the brain because consciousness would be epiphenomenal if it is not the creator of intelligent acts. However, as will be seen below, this conclusion may be premature and certainly cannot be used to dismiss phenomenal consciousness as non-existent or not present in the brain.

==The Subject-Object paradox==

This paradox was clearly enunciated by William James in 1904:

&quot;Throughout the history of philosophy the subject and its object have been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities; and thereupon the presence of the latter to the former, or the 'apprehension' by the former of the latter, has assumed a paradoxical character which all sorts of theories had to be invented to overcome.&quot; James (1904).

The Subject-Object paradox points out that a conscious subject appears to observe itself as an object. But if it observes itself as an object then, as an object it cannot be a subject. As Bermudez(1998) puts it:

&quot;Any theory that tries to elucidate the capacity to think first-person thoughts through linguistic mastery of the first-person pronoun will be circular, because the explanandum is part of the explanans..&quot; 

Thomas Reid uses this paradox to suggest that everything that is observed must be external to the soul and hence proposed that experience was the world itself. 

Wittgenstein (1949) offers a way out of the paradox by denying the existence of the subject:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;5.63 1. The thinking, presenting subject; there is no such thing. If I wrote a book The World as I Found It, I should also have therein to report on my body and say which members obey my will and which do not, etc. This then would be a method of isolating the subject or rather of showing that in an important sense there is no subject: that is to say, of it alone in this book mention could not be made. 5.632. The subject does not belong to the world but it is a limit of the world. 5.633. Where in the world is a metaphysical subject to be noted? You say that this case is altogether like that of the eye and the field of sight. But you do not really see the eye. And from nothing in the field of sight can it be concluded that it is seen from an eye... 5.64 1. ...The philosophical I is not the man, not the human body or the human soul of which psychology treats, but the metaphysical subject, the limit — not a part of the world.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;(Wittgenstein 1949).

Wittgenstein's view is similar to that voiced by Green (2002) in which there is nothing at the point centre of the manifold of events (there is no point eye). James (1904), Lektorsky (1980) and many others have also attempted to resolve the paradox by proposing that there is really no observer, only the observation or 'reflexive act' of perception. This idea reaches its zenith in Brentano's concept of &quot;intentionality&quot; in which the subject and object are fused into a form of &quot;aboutness&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Every psychical phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or sometimes the mental) inexistence of an object, and what we should like to call, although not quite unambiguously, the reference (Beziehung) to a content, the directedness (Richtung) toward an object (which in this context is not to be understood as something real) or the immanent-object quality (immanente Gegenständlichkeit). Each contains something as its object, though not each in the same manner. In the representation (Vorstellung) something is represented, in the judgment something is acknowledged or rejected, in desiring it is desired, etc. This intentional inexistence is peculiar alone to psychical phenomena. No physical phenomenon shows anything like it. And thus we can define psychical phenomena by saying that they are such phenomena as contain objects in themselves by way of intention (intentional).&quot;&lt;/font&gt; Brentano, F. (1874).

These authors have all identified the content of perception with either the world itself, the manifold of events or a synthetic 'about' the world itself in an attempt at avoiding the paradox, however, as will be seen later, there are other solutions to the paradox.

==The homunculus fallacy in philosophy of mind==

A Homunculus argument accounts for a phenomenon in terms of the very phenomenon that it is supposed to explain (Richard Gregory (1987)).  Homunculus arguments are always fallacious.  In the psychology and philosophy of mind 'homunculus arguments' are extremely useful for detecting where theories of mind fail or are incomplete. 

Homunculus arguments are common in the theory of vision.  Imagine a person watching a movie.  He sees the images as something separate from himself, projected on the screen. How is this done?  A simple theory might propose that the light from the screen forms an image on the retinas in the eyes and something in the brain looks at these as if they are the screen.  The Homunculus Argument shows this is not a full explanation because all that has been done is to place an entire person, or homunculus, behind the eye who gazes at the retinas.  A more sophisticated argument might propose that the images on the retinas are transferred to the visual cortex where it is scanned. Again this cannot be a full explanation because all that has been done is to place a little person in the brain behind the cortex.  In the theory of vision the Homunculus Argument invalidates theories that do not explain 'projection', the experience that the viewing point is separate from the things that are seen. (Adapted from Gregory (1987), (1990)). 

In the case of vision it is sometimes suggested that each homunculus would need a homunculus inside it ad infinitum. This is the '''recursion''' form of the homunculus concept. Notice that, unlike the case of regress, the recursion would occur after the event.

An homunculus argument should be phrased in such a way that the conclusion is always that if a homunculus is required then the theory is wrong.  After all, homunculi do not exist.

Very few people would propose that there actually is a little man in the brain looking at brain activity.  However, this proposal has been used as a 'straw man' in theories of mind. Gilbert Ryle (1949) proposed that the human mind is known by its intelligent acts. (see Ryle's Regress).  He argued that if there is an inner being inside the brain that could steer its own thoughts then this would lead to an absurd repetitive cycle or 'regress' before a thought could occur:

&quot;According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his practical problem.&quot; 

&quot;.... Must we then say that for the ..[agent's].. reflections how to act to be intelligent he must first reflect how best to reflect how to act? The endlessness of this implied regress shows that the application of the appropriateness does not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion.&quot; 

The homunculus argument and the regress argument are often considered to be the same but this is not the case. The homunculus argument says that if there is a need for a 'little man' to complete a theory then the theory is wrong. The regress argument says that an intelligent agent would need to think before it could have a thought.

Ryle's theory is that intelligent acts cannot be a property of an inner being or mind, if such a thing were to exist. 

The idea that conscious experience is a flow of information into an unextended place (a point eye) leaves itself open to the charge of inserting an homunculus beyond the point eye. On careful reading few, if any, real theories actually propose a flow through the point eye but suggest some sort of nebulous direct relation with the information in front of the eye. For instance, Descartes has a point soul directly considering the contents of the common sense and Reid has a point eye directly considering the world itself.

&lt;font size=1&gt;Questions: It might be said that the homunculus fallacy means that either the materialist interpretation of conscious experience is wrong or conscious experience does not exist: discuss.  Physicalism is not materialism, discuss. Could physical phenomena such as entanglement or space-time theories of observation, where the observed vectors are constrained to the manifold, avoid the homunculus fallacy?&lt;/font&gt;

==Berkeley's &quot;passive ideas&quot;==

Ryle's regress, when applied to consciousness,  is based on an analysis of conscious intellectual activity as a succession of states. At any moment the conscious intellect contains one state such as 'I will think of a word'. This means that either the state has just popped into mind or there was a previous state that gave rise to it such as 'I will think of thinking of a word'. Descartes and other empiricists have noted that thoughts do indeed just pop into mind.  So if we transfer Ryle's analysis to the real world we discover that the regress is avoided by removing the starting point of a series of thoughts from conscious phenomenal experience. A train of thought just begins, it has no conscious origin and Descartes' implication is that it has probably been synthesised non-consciously.

Suppose Descartes and our own experience are correct, suppose thoughts do just pop into mind, if this happens can there still be a conscious intellectual agent or are intellectual agents largely non-conscious?  One of the simplest intellectual processes is a test for equality i.e.: 'does A equal B?' and a routing of flow as a result of the test i.e.: 'if A = B then goto'. Can an intellectual agent perform an equality test in conscious phenomenal experience?

Consider the test of whether 'A = A', you attend to the left 'A' then the right 'A' and declare them equal. What have you actually done? The feeling that the symbols are equal just pops into mind. Psychologists and philosophers use the word 'intuition' for this popping of answers into mind  (Kant 1781). It is usually accompanied by emotional experience (Damasio 1994, Bierman 2004).

If intellectual activity is actually a succession of things that just pop into phenomenal consciousness then Ryle's conclusion that phenomenal consciousness is like a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; of the brain would to some extent justified.  Phenomenal consciousness would not be intellectual activity. Phenomenal consciousness would contain the stages, or succession of states, of intellectual activity but would not contain the processes that connect these stages. This observation that conscious experience is a succession of '''passive ideas''' is well known in philosophy (cf: George Berkeley, Principles of Human Knowledge, 25).

'''Autonomy, Informed Consent and the Death of Therapeutic Privilege: Lessons Learned from the Jehovah’s Witnesses'''

''An Independent Learning Module for Health Care Workers''

==Authors==
* D. John Doyle  MD, PhD, FRCPC, June 21, 2005, djdoyle{{@}}hotmail.com

==Purpose of This Learning Module==
The purpose of this learning module is to bring readers up to date with some of the more important issues regarding informed consent and patient autonomy, which are discussed from clinical, ethical and legal perspectives. A synopsis of the problem of clinical informed consent is presented, touching on both the ethical and legal issues as well as the various “standards” of consent. The idea that the process of informed consent may occasionally itself be a health hazard is presented.  The notion of therapeutic privilege, a concept declining in acceptance, is also discussed. Finally, old and new developments regarding autonomy and informed consent in Jehovah’s Witness patients are discussed.

==Specific Learning Objectives==
The specific learning objectives for this module are as follows: (1) to understand the philosophical notions of informed consent and patient autonomy, and the relationship between them, (2) to identify the various clinical situations where full informed consent may not be possible, (3) to identify possible clinical situations where informed consent may not be in the interests of the patient’s health, (4) to understand the notion of “therapeutic privilege”, (5) to identify possible clinical situations where conflicting ethical principles which may lead to disagreement between health care workers and patients, (6)  to examine several noteworthy legal rulings in the USA and Canada related to autonomy and consent of which health care workers should be aware, and (7) understand how issues related to the care of the Jehovah's Witness patient has influenced our notions of autonomy and consent.

==Introduction==
Autonomy is one of the four guiding principles of the “Georgetown School” of bioethics, the other principles being beneficence, justice and nonmalfeasance (Beauchamp and Childress 1994). Autonomy implies the right to actively participate in medical decisions concerning oneself without being dictated to or controlled by other parties. Central to the concept of autonomy in this setting is the requirement that a patient understand the various clinical choices available and the risks and benefits associated with those choices. In other words, informed consent is a necessary condition for patient autonomy.  


This notion of autonomy implies that individuals should be given adequate means to make their own decisions - decisions made based on their personal value system.  This also implies that patients must be provided with appropriate information to make informed decision-making possible. The information that should be supplied to establish clinical informed consent usually focuses on the nature, risks and benefits of the proposed intervention with a discussion of the alternatives to the planned intervention, including their associated risks, benefits, and uncertainties.  


Obtaining informed consent also entails ensuring that an adequate degree of patient understanding exists. Thus the clinician must also establish that the patient has sufficient decision-making competence for informed consent to be possible. This is usually accomplished informally, by considering whether the patient appears to comprehend the information presented and establishing that the patient can discuss the issues with caregivers in a reasonable and logical manner. In some cases, however, formal psychological consultation is requested.


Three approaches to the issues of providing informed consent have been described: (Edwards 1999):


• “'''reasonable physician standard''': what would a typical physician say about this intervention? This standard allows the physician to determine what information is appropriate to disclose. However, it is probably not enough, since most research in this area shows that the typical physician tells the patient very little. This standard is also generally considered inconsistent with the goals of informed consent as the focus is on the physician rather than on what the patient needs to know.” 


• “'''reasonable patient standard''': what would the average patient need to know in order to be an informed participant in the decision? This standard focuses on considering what a patient would need to know in order to understand the decision at hand.”


• “'''subjective standard''': what would this patient need to know and understand in order to make an informed decision? This standard is the most challenging to incorporate into practice, since it requires tailoring information to each patient.” 


In recent years Canada and many states in the USA have adopted the “reasonable patient” standard as their legal model. It is interesting to note that under this model the requirement for informed consent does not necessarily require that the patient be supplied with every imaginable detail. For instance, in a 1980 Canadian Supreme Court decision [Reibl v. Hughes [1980] 2 SCR 880] the court decided that both minuscule risks associated with devastating outcomes (e.g., stroke, death) as well as common but minor risks (e.g., damage to teeth with tracheal intubation) must be disclosed to the patient, but that a detailed disclosure of all possible risks is not a legal requirement. 

==Therapeutic Privilege==
The notion of &quot;therapeutic privilege&quot; refers to the withholding of important information by the clinician during the “consent” process in the belief that disclosure of such information would lead to the harm or suffering of the patient (Meisel et al. 1977).  The philosophical basis for &quot;therapeutic privilege&quot; is the notion that beneficence should take precedence over autonomy in cases where a conflict between these two principles exists. Today, with the collapse of paternalism in modern clinical care, and with the widespread adoption of the “reasonable patient” model for legal informed consent, therapeutic privilege is invoked only rarely. This is so both as a result of medico-legal prudence and in response to modern cultural shifts.  Furthermore, some clinicians argue that if a person feels that providing a patient with relevant clinical information may be so upsetting to the patient as to cause extreme psychological harm, the patient should be assessed for mental competency.  


Still, therapeutic privilege has its cautious supporters. For instance, Etchels et al. (1996), discussing the Canadian situation, make the case that therapeutic privilege may sometimes be appropriate. They write:


The need for sensitivity to cultural norms may potentially support the exercise of therapeutic privilege. In some cultures therapeutic privilege is widely invoked, and it is unclear whether patients from these cultures should always be subjected to Western standards of consent. However, given the legal status of therapeutic privilege in Canada, clinicians should avoid invoking therapeutic privilege. It is better for the clinician to offer information and allow the patient to refuse or accept further disclosure.


Further complicating the issue of informed consent is the recognition that there are a number of circumstances where ensuring that the requirements for full informed consent can be problematic. Such situations include (1) the premedicated patient, (2) the parturient in labor, (3) the “psychologically fragile” patient under enormous emotional stress, (4) the patient with known mental illness, (5) the patient with organic brain disease, (6) the immature adult patient, and (7) the hostile and distrustful patient who is angry at the world and places absolutely no trust in authority figures.


There is also an additional consideration to ponder. Some clinicians would maintain that the process of informed consent has health risks in and of itself, and that these risks should be weighed in discussions of the informed consent process. In particular, consider the case of the patient who is impaired at making judgments involving clinical risk management and who refuses a reasonable intervention involving a relatively small risk even though it would substantially eliminate another, much larger, clinical risk. 


The following (edited) posting by a doctor working in the “clinical trenches” illustrates the matter:


I feel that the process of informed consent is not always in the patient's best interests. Many patients clearly need cardiac catheterization and initially agree. But once I inform them of the risks of the procedure, they then refuse. Even when I subsequently inform them that the risk of not doing the procedure is far greater, they persist in their refusal. Thus the process of informed consent has caused the patient to act in a manner deleterious to their health. Many patients cannot understand the concept of risk/benefit ratios. I understand that we wish to avoid medical paternalism and promote patient independence but medical decision making is not the same as a consumer pulling products off a store shelf. Part of what the patient is paying for is our professional judgement. [http://www-hsc.usc.edu/~mbernste/ethics.informed_consent.html]


Another example concerns the administration of blood transfusions. In my own clinical practice as an anesthesiologist, I frequently administer blood transfusions, particularly during surgical procedures with severe blood loss. In fact, anesthesiologists give more than 50 per cent of the nation's blood supply to correct for blood loss during and after surgery. And, associated with every &quot;unit&quot; (about 250 mL) of blood given is a small, but definitely not trivial, chance of transmitting infection or getting some other complication.


I find the decision about giving or not giving blood particularly difficult when a patient asks me to promise not to transfuse during surgery, but has no reason for this request other than an exaggerated fear of becoming HIV infected. So far, I have always been able to convince such patients to allow me to give blood if it is absolutely necessary, usually by asking them about what they would want me to do in the very rare event of unexpected massive blood loss. Typically their response is, &quot;Well, I would die unless I got blood, so of course...&quot;


What should I do, however, if I can't convince a patient to permit me to give blood to save his or her life? One option is to respect the patient's decision. Yet I'm uncomfortable with this position. My discomfort arises from the fact that such people are not making sound judgments about the current risks involved in blood transfusion. Frightened by reports of past blood-transfusion tragedies, people today are inflating the very small risk if HIV or other infection that actually exists. In such an atmosphere of fear, they are making ill-informed decisions about their own health care, decisions by which I fear I must abide.

==How Much Information?==
It was noted earlier that informed consent under the “reasonable patient” standard does not necessarily require that the patient be supplied with every imaginable detail. Still, there are exceptional patients who ask for far more information than usual. While this may reflect reluctance for the patient to relinquish control, it may also indicative of an analytical coping style in an intelligent, curious patient. My approach to such patients is to systematically provide detailed answers to all questions asked, including pointing out those circumstances where there is no well-established answer to a question because of existing limits to medical knowledge. Also, many patients are familiar with using PubMed and other resources to get information via the Internet, and this too can serve as a means for some patients to get additional information. 


Still, some questions may be out of bounds to some practitioners. For instance, some surgeons might be reluctant to disclose the details of their complication rates, or may not even have such information specifically tabulated. As a more extreme example, it would not be considered reasonable to allow a patient considering a particular surgeon to conduct his or her own private chart review of the last 100 cases carried out by that surgeon so as to obtain useful information. 


Many health consumers use the Internet to obtain physician profile information, including malpractice claim data. A number of US states now put malpractice data on the Internet. For instance, the State of Virginia makes practitioner information available at http://www.vahealthprovider.com, while the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States offers a national fee-based service at http://www.docinfo.org. Finally, the Questionable Doctors site at http://www.questionabledoctors.org “contains data on disciplinary actions taken for medical incompetence, misprescribing drugs, sexual misconduct, criminal convictions, ethical lapses and other offences.”


Although many physicians embrace this idea in theory, many are worried about the use of malpractice information as an indicator of competence or quality. Cynics argue that the medico-legal systems in Canada and the USA are so haphazard that good doctors are just as likely to be sued as those who may be practicing below the standard of care. Other opponents of this concept contend that the public may misinterpret malpractice history data and punish capable doctors who happen to treat a large number of high-risk patients. 

==Drawing on the Jehovah’s Witnesses Experience==
A patient has a legal right to decide to forgo “clinically necessary” treatment if the patient is judged to be competent to make that decision. No where is this better illustrated than in the case of the Jehovah’s Witness patient. There are approximately seven million Jehovah’s Witnesses world-wide, with approximately one million in the USA and about one hundred eighty four thousand in Canada. The Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian religion whose followers believe the Bible to be the true and literal word of God whose name is Jehovah and whose son, Jesus Christ, established true Christianity. Witnesses view Jehovah God as the ultimate moral authority and do not salute flags, join service organizations, enlist in the military, vote in public elections, or take an interest in civil government.



Traditionally, orthodox Jehovah’s Witnesses will not accept homologous or autologous whole blood, packed red blood cells, plasma, platelets and white blood cells, even when “clinically necessary”  (Letsoalo 1998, Ridley 1999).  The determination that blood transfusions were a violation of God's law was made in 1945 and is primarily based on three biblical passages:  [[wikisource:Bible_%28King_James%29/Genesis#Chapter_9|Genesis 9:3,4]]; [[wikisource:Bible_%28King_James%29/Leviticus#Chapter_17|Leviticus 17:10-16]]; [[wikisource:Bible_%28King_James%29/Acts#Chapter_15|Acts 15:28, 29]].  


This prohibition can result in a challenging dilemma for physicians because a routine, safe, and potentially life-saving medical intervention is unacceptable to the patient (Benson 1989, Rothenberg 1990, Mann et al. 1992).  Anesthesiologists are particularly affected because they are almost always responsible for intraoperative transfusion management. This sometimes puts anesthesiologists and other clinicians in highly unusual clinical situations (Harnett et al. 2000, Baldry et al. 2000). 


It should come as no surprise that this situation has resulted in a number of legal debates, and most legal issues concerning the medical care of Jehovah's Witnesses center on the issues of autonomy and consent. In Canada, the landmark legal case regarding the clinical care of Jehovah's Witness patients was the case of  Malette v. Shulman [Malette v Shulman (1990), 37 OAC 281 (CA)]. The courts established that clinicians should not administer emergency treatment without consent if they have reason to believe that the patient would refuse such treatment if he or she were capable. In this case, Dr. Shulman administered a blood transfusion to a patient who was unconscious as a result of hypovolemic shock. The patient carried a signed (but undated and unwitnessed) wallet card indicating that she was a Jehovah's Witness and did not want to receive blood transfusions under any circumstances. Despite this, blood was transfused out of clinical necessity. Although the transfusions were almost certainly responsible for saving the patient's life, the court found the clinician liable for battery. The judge stated: “To transfuse a Jehovah's Witness in the face of her explicit instructions to the contrary would, in my opinion, violate her right to control her own body and show disrespect for the religious values by which she has chosen to live her life.”


In the USA, the case that established the competent adults right to refuse treatment occurred in 1914 in Schloendorff vs. Society of New York Hospital. (Schloendorff vs Society of New York Hospital, 105 N.E. 92, (1914).) A woman agreed to an examination under anesthesia but refused consent for surgery. Despite this, surgery was performed, and serious unexpected complications followed. A lawsuit was launched and resolved in favor of the plaintiff. The presiding judge stated that &quot;Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body&quot;. Despite this ruling the patient lost her case because the hospital was a charitable institution and was consequently immune from liability. Still, the case established the notion of informed consent and of the right of a competent adult patient to choose or refuse treatment. Since the time of the Schloendorff case a large number of American legal decisions have reinforced the right of a competent adult to choose his or her treatment, even when the decision is not medically sound.   


A particularly unusual legal case occurred in Pomona, California where a drunken driver rammed his pickup truck into a stationary car, injuring a 55 year old Jehovah’s Witness woman standing by the side of the road (http://www.religiontoday.com/Archive/ NewsSummary/ ). She refused a needed blood transfusion, and consequently died in hospital. Prosecutors said the driver was responsible for the death because he caused the injuries and he was convicted of manslaughter. His lawyers argued that the immediate cause of the woman’s death was her refusal of a blood transfusion, since she very likely would have lived had a blood transfusion been carried out.

==Dissent and Consent - The Jehovah’s Witness “Reform Movement”==
Since 1996, a number of Jehovah’s Witnesses have anonymously expressed their dissent to the Jehovah’s Witness blood policy and formed a group called the Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood (AJWRB), with a Web presence at www.ajwrb.org. Their goal is for a “reformation” of existing blood policy, which they see as a “complicated web of contradictory rules and conditions strictly enforced without biblical basis”. Their actions are for the most part conducted anonymously, since experience shows that for a Jehovah’s Witness to express any criticism often results in expulsion from the church (ecclesiastical disfellowshipping). The existence of this movement presents an ethical dimension that I discuss next.


It was implied earlier that the central ethical dilemma in the management of Jehovah’s Witness patients is in the nature of a conflict between beneficence and autonomy, where autonomy is generally given precedence over beneficence, at least in American and Canadian law. But there is another potential dilemma for anesthesiologists who care for Jehovah’s Witness patients: because many Jehovah’s Witness patients are not likely to be fully informed about possible inconsistencies in church doctrine regarding medical issues, should anesthesiologists attempt an in-depth discussion to encourage a rational and truly autonomous decision  (for instance, using information provided by the Jehovah’s Witness “reform” movement [www.ajwrb.org]), or should they remain silent regardless of the degree to which they might find the patients’ views to be irrational and misguided, so as to avoid the perception of “religious interference”.


Muramoto (1998a, 1998b, 1999, 2000) and others (Savulescu 1995, Doyle 1998, Elder 2000) have taken the position that truly ethical physicians should inform their patients as fully as possible on all matters affecting their care, seeing any discussions centering on possible religious inconsistencies as merely an attempt to ensure that their patients have the opportunity to be fully informed on an important life-and-death issue. By contrast, Shander (1999) has taken the position that one should remain silent on religious issues and focus on purely clinical concerns, citing the difficulties of what he sees as essentially being an attempt at religious conversion.  In short, Shander believes that the anesthesiologist has no business influencing a person’s religious views.


This is not a simple issue since, given that the leaders of the Jehovah’s Witness faith have reversed previous teachings against medical interventions such as vaccination and organ transplantation, and given that some blood products such as albumin, immunoglobulins and clotting factors are already allowed (according to an individual’s conscience) (Bergman 1994), some Witnesses believe that it is only a matter of time and effort before the ban against blood transfusions is removed completely.    


The situation is obviously complex and rich in ethical nuances. Perhaps all that can be said is that patients are more likely to be better served by offering all too much information than too little.

'''More commentary on informed consent'''


Source: http://www-hsc.usc.edu/~mbernste/ethics.informed_consent.html 
(corrections added)


An article in the 1/9/00 NY Times Sunday magazine by Margaret Talbot on Placebos in Medicine also mentioned informed consent and made an interesting point:
 
&quot;Sometimes our contemporary notions of informed consent, important though they are, interfere with a doctor's capacity to offer hope and comfort. 'When, for example, a patient who is about to undergo a straight-forward surgical procedure anxiously asks the surgeon, 'Doctor, am I going to make it?' what should the surgeon say?' asks Walter Brown. 'Traditionally, the response would be to encourage the patient: 'You're in good hands here, everything will be fine.' Yet I have posed this scenario to a variety of physicians, both residents and attendings, and found that some consider themselves obligated to list the possible complications and risk of death, even if the morality rate from the procedure in miniscule.' Medical training that (rightly) values precise expression and a culture that values full disclosure and protection from liability may spur doctors to tell their patients the uninflected and deflating truths even in the most dire circumstances. But surely telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth is not the most humane or practical of counsel for doctors. Someone I know of, a physician herself, was recently operated on for a brain tumor. Her doctor chose his first postoperative visit in the hospital to tell her she would never work again. It didn't help her recovery much.&quot;
 
This same NYT article made an interesting point about another, related topic- that of patients doing internet research and doing their own medical decision making in lieu of following a doctor's advice. It recounts the bout of Dr. Franz Ingelfinger, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, with esophageal cancer. He himself was a gastroenetrologist. He studied all relevant information from the literature and colleagues to make his own treatment decision. This resulted, he wrote, “in he and his family becoming increasingly confused and emotionally distraught. Finally when the pangs of indecision had become nearly intolerable, one wise physician friend said, 'What you need is a doctor.' He was telling me to forget the information I was receiving from many quarters, and to seek instead a person who would dominate, who would tell me what to do.&quot; When he found that person, Ingelfinger felt an &quot;immediate and immense relief.&quot;

Bone scan: not recommended. Chance of positive bone scan is &lt;5% until PSA reaches 30-40. (PMID 9751361)

Prostate re-biopsy is not necessary and The PSA level or threshold seemed to be 1.5 ng/mL.

American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology Consensus Panel.&quot; Cox et al. J Clin Oncol 1999 17:1155-1163.
** The panel judged that prostate re-biopsy is not necessary as standard follow-up care and that the absence of a rising PSA level after radiation therapy is the most rigorous end point of total tumor eradication.
** The panel noted that most data indicate the PSA level at time of salvage radiation may make a prognostic difference in outcome. The PSA level or threshold, based on the data presented, seemed to be 1.5 ng/mL.
** Based on the data presented at this conference, the dose should be 64 Gy or slightly higher with standard fractionation (1.8 or 2.0 Gy per fraction).
** There is no standard role for androgen suppression therapy in patients with or without radiation therapy for rising PSA values after prostatectomy.

**Retrospective. Compared cohorts of pts who had biochemical failure after RP (n=635) from those who had 1) no salvage treatment (397 pts), 2) salvage RT alone (160), or 3) salvage RT + hormones (78). 
**Median f/u 6 yrs after recurrence. Death from prostate cancer in 18% (116 pts). Risk of death with observation, 22% (89 deaths); following salvage RT, 11% (18 deaths); following RT + hormones, 12% (9 deaths). Salvage RT with 3-fold increase in PC-specific survival (HR=0.32) and OS. Addition of hormonal therapy not associated with additional increase in survival. 
**Increase in survival with RT was limited to pts with PSA doubling time &lt; 6 months. Salvage RT after 2 yrs provided no survival advantage. Men who did not achieve bNED after salvage RT did not experience an increase in survival. 

*'''Multi-institutional''' 
**'''2004''' PMID 15026399 -- ''Salvage radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.'' ('''2004 Stephenson AJ''', JAMA)
**Retrospective review of 501 patients at 5 US academic tertiary centers who received salvage RT; median follow-up 45 months
**4-year PFS was 45%
**No risk factors 4-year PFP was 77%
**Multivariate predictors of progression: 
***Gleason Score 8-10 (HR 2.6)
***Pre-RT post-relapse PSA &gt;2.0 (HR 2.3)
***Negative surgical margins (HR 1.9)
***PSA-DT &lt;10 months (HR 1.7)
***Seminal vesicle invasion (HR 1.4)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The Authors conducted a multicenter analysis of 501 patients undergoing salvage radiotherapy for an increasing PSA level after radical prostatectomy in order to reliably identify prognostic variables associated with a durable response. 
*** In this cohort, a Gleason score of 8 to 10, preradiotherapy PSA level greater than 2.0 ng/mL, negative surgical margins, PSADT of 10 months or less, and seminal vesicle invasion were significant predictors of disease progression despite salvage radiotherapy.
*** In their multivariable analysis, only preradiotherapy PSA level greater than 2.0 ng/mL had a significant association with progression after salvage radiotherapy. However, patients receiving treatment at very low PSA levels (&lt;0.6 ng/mL) had an improved outcome compared with patients with a preradiotherapy PSA level between 0.61 and 2.0 ng/mL. But the use of very low PSA thresholds risks overtreating patients whose PSA level is detectable due to residual benign prostatic tissue.
*** A patient with positive margins who relapses is more likely to benefit from salvage radiotherapy than a patient with negative margins, whose PSA level is more likely to represent distant disease.
**** patients with Gleason scores of 4 to 7 and a rapid PSADT, 67% will have a durable response to early salvage radiotherapy if they have '''positive surgical margins''', 
**** compared with 22% for those having '''negative margins'''.
*** Patients with a Gleason score of 4 to 7 and a slow PSADT (&gt;10 months) had a 4-year PFP greater than 70% when radiation was delivered early, when the PSA level was lower.

**Proposed criteria to distinguish local recurrence from distant metastases for patients with an increasing PSA level after radical prostatectomy. A Gleason score of 8 to 10, seminal vesicle invasion, positive lymph nodes, and a rapid PSA velocity were associated with distant metastases. Local recurrence was more frequently observed in patients with low-grade and organ-confined disease, a slow PSA velocity, and a disease free interval greater than 3 years, suggesting that isolated local recurrence has a low metastatic potential.


*'''Virginia Commonwealth University and University of Florida''' -  PMID 15145145 &amp;mdash; ''Comparison Of Adjuvant Versus Salvage Radiotherapy Policies For Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy''. Hagan et al. Int. J. Radiation Oncology Biol. Phys., Vol. 59, No. 2, pp. 329–340,''' 2004'''
** The Authors compared the long-term results of postprostatectomy radiotherapy (RT) from two institutions, one adapting a prospective policy of adjuvant RT (69 patients) and the other salvage RT (88 patients). The salvage group underwent RT after longer postoperative intervals (median, 40.3 vs. 2.9 months; p &lt;0.0001) and had higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values before starting RT (4.5 vs. 0.86 ng/mL; p = 0.003). Both groups were routinely treated to a minimal total dose of 60 Gy. 
** &lt;u&gt;Results: &lt;/u&gt; Of the 69 patients referred for adjuvant RT, 22 (32%) had nonzero PSA values before RT. Multivariable modeling of BRFS found '''only the PSA value before RT to be statistically significant (p &lt;0.0001)'''. RT after prostatectomy was equally effective in either setting when the pre-RT PSA level was &lt;1 ng/mL. '''When the PSA value before RT was &gt;1 ng/mL, the 5-year BRFS for each group was inferior.'''
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;:  Durable biochemical control is re-established in approximately 50% of patients who undergo salvage treatment, and 70–80% of patients in adjuvant series have disease control. Although the adjuvant treatment policy was associated with significantly improved BRFS, this was attributable to low pre-RT PSA values. When the treatment groups were stratified for pre-RT PSA level, the differences in BRFS were not statistically significant. Patients with a rising PSA level after prostatectomy, regardless of their initial risk, should receive prompt referral for RT.

Pts were not included on the study if they had a RIS scan showing distant disease. RT was to median dose 66 Gy and included prostate bed (91% with RIS, 83% without) or pelvis + prostate bed (6% and 17%).
**Patients who had prostate bed-only uptake on RIS did not have improved outcomes, with biochemical control of 40% at 5 years. Positive margins were associated with improved control.

==Radiation Volume==
'''''Whole Pelvis vs Prostate Bed Only:'''''

**Retrospective. 160 pts, treated with adjuvant (21 pts) or salvage RT (139). Androgen suppression in 87. 114 pts considered 'high risk' for LN+ based on: GS &gt;= 8, PSA &gt; 20, SV+, prostate capsule involvement, or pN+. Of the high risk group, 72 treated with WPRT and 42 with RT to prostate bed only.
**Benefit of WPRT limited to high risk pts: 5-yr BRFS 47% (WPRT) vs 21% (PO). Benefit for androgen suppression when given concurrently with RT.
**Conclusion: WPRT confers superior bRFS compared with PBRT for high-risk patients receiving adjuvant or salvage RT after radical prostatectomy. This advantage was observed only with concurrent TAS.


==Timing of Salvage RT==
'''''Systematic Reviews:'''''
*'''2012: UCLA''' PMID 22795730 -- &quot;The timing of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.&quot; (King CR, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Sep 1;84(1):104-11.)
**Review of 41 studies (published 1995-2012) including 5597 patients.
**PSA level before SRT and RT dose associated with RFS. Average 2.6% loss of RFS for each incremental 0.1 PSA at the time of SRT. 
**Conclusion: &quot;This study provides Level 2a evidence for initiating SRT at the lowest possible PSA. Dose escalation is also suggested by the data.&quot;

==High Dose Salvage RT==
''high dose in this context refers to a dose &gt;= 66 Gy''

*'''2012: MSKCC''' (1988-2007) PMID 22300563 -- &quot;Long-term outcomes after high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation treatment.&quot; (Goenka A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Sep 1;84(1):112-8.)
**285 pts treated with salvage RT. Median PSA before SRT 0.4. 60 pts (21%) had MRI-detected local recurrence. 42 pts had pathologic confirmation of local recurrence.
**95% were treated to a dose &gt;= 66 Gy; 72% received &gt;= 70 Gy. ADT used in 31%.
**Median f/u 60 mo. 7-yr bRFS 37%, DMFS 77%. Predictors of recurrence: vascular invasion, negative margins, presalvage PSA &gt; 0.4, no use of ADT, Gleason &gt;= 7, and +SV. RT dose &gt;= 70 Gy was not associated with improved biochemical control. PSA-DT &lt; 3 months was the only indep. predictor of DM. Trend toward benefit of dose &gt;= 70 Gy in decreasing clinical local failure in pts who had radiographically visible local disease at the time of SRT.
**Conclusion: &quot;Salvage RT provides effective long-term biochemical control and freedom from metastasis in selected patients presenting with detectable PSA after prostatectomy. Androgen-deprivation therapy was associated with improvement in biochemical progression-free survival. Clinical local failures were rare but occurred most commonly in patients with greater burden of disease at time of SRT as reflected by either radiographic imaging or a greater PSA level. Salvage radiation doses ≥70 Gy may ultimately be most beneficial in these patients, but this needs to be further studied.&quot;

==PSA measurements during RT==

**41 pts treated to 66.6 Gy. At 30 Gy, 26% of those who would eventually respond still had a rising PSA, but at 50 and 60 Gy, 93% had decreasing PSA. In those who would fail, 75% and 88% had rising PSA at 50 and 60 Gy.

**41 patients with biochemical failure after RP had PSA were treated to 59.4-66.6 Gy without hormone therapy. PSA checked at 30 Gy and 45 Gy.  
**Rising PSA at 45 Gy significantly predicted for poor outcome.  PSA at 30 Gy did not significantly predict for disease outcome.

**Retrospective. 308 pts treated at Mayo-Rochester or Mayo-Jacksonville. Median RT dose 64.8 Gy; no IMRT. Hormonal therapy in 19%.
**Late complication (any grade) in 14% by 5 yrs. Grade 3-4 complication: 4 pts (0.7%). GU toxicity: 3.9% gr 2 urethral strictures, 3 pts with gr 3 cystitis.  GI: 1 pt with gr 4 rectal complication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I look forward to more of your new article on traditional Chinese medicine. But, the page name is a bit confusing. TCM could also mean 
Turner Classic Movies, Trinity College of Music, or Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling. It's normal to spell it out in full. In this case, maybe you could rename the page to ''Traditional Chinese medicine project'' or more simply ''Traditional Chinese medicine''. To do it you simply click on the move tab when looking at your page.

__TOC__

== Description ==

The 'Val attribute is defined for all discrete types. It is a function returning that value of the base type of S having the argument's position number; the prefix S must be a subtype name. (Any specific integer type is implicitly converted to ''universal_integer''.)

 function S'Val (Arg: universal_integer) return S'Base;

If no value of the type of S has the position number Arg, the Constraint_Error [[Ada Programming/Exceptions|exception]] is raised.

Note that representation clauses do not affect position numbering. Whatever underlying value the enumerated value has, the position number will remain the same.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/--|Declare a discrete type; the compiler will assign the internal representation as 0 .. 2}}
 {{Ada/--|identical to the position numbers.}}
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);
 
 {{Ada/--|Declare a discrete type and explicitly set the internal representation.}}
 {{Ada/--|Note that the position numbers are still 0 .. 2.}}
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Other_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Value1, Value2, Value3);
 {{Ada/kw|for}} My_Other_Enum {{Ada/kw|use}} (Value1 =&gt; 2, Value2 =&gt; 4, Value3 =&gt; 6);
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Val(0) = Enum1);  {{Ada/--|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Val(1) = Enum2);  {{Ada/--|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Val(2) = Enum3);  {{Ada/--|OK}}
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Other_Enum'Val(0) = Value1);  {{Ada/--|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Other_Enum'Val(1) = Value2);  {{Ada/--|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Other_Enum'Val(2) = Value3);  {{Ada/--|OK}}
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Val(3)       = Enum3);  {{Ada/--|Wrong}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Other_Enum'Val(2) = Value1); {{Ada/--|Wrong}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Other_Enum'Val(4) = Value2); {{Ada/--|Wrong}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Other_Enum'Val(6) = Value3); {{Ada/--|Wrong}}

The internal representation can only be queried via Unchecked_Conversion.

== Description ==

&lt;code&gt;X'{{Ada/attribute|First}}&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is any [[ada Programming/Subtypes|scalar subtype]] (for example integer, enumerated, real), is an [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] that represents the first value (lower bound) in the range of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;A'{{Ada/attribute|First}}&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is an array, denotes the first index value. For more-dimensional arrays, &lt;code&gt;A'{{Ada/attribute|First(N)}}&lt;/code&gt; denotes the first index value of the Nth dimension (N must be static).
== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Int  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -1 .. 5;
 ... 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'First = Enum1);   {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Int'First  = -1);      {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Int'First  =  0);      {{Template:Ada/comment|Wrong!}}

DHTML ('''D'''ynamic '''HTML''') is a combination of JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

== &lt;code&gt;alert&lt;/code&gt; messages ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    alert('Hello World!');
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This will give a simple alert message.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    prompt('What is your name?');
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This will give a simple prompt message.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
confirm('Are you sure?');
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This will give a simple confirmation message.

==Javascript Button and Alert Message Example:==
Sometimes it is best to dig straight in with the coding. Here is an example of a small piece of code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;&quot;THE BUTTON&quot; - Javascript&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      x = 'You have not pressed &quot;THE BUTTON&quot;'
      function bomb() {
        alert('O-GOD NOOOOO, WE ARE ALL DOOMED!!');
        alert('10');
        alert('9');
        alert('8');
        alert('7');
        alert('6');
        alert('5');
        alert('4');
        alert('3');
        alert('2');
        alert('1');
        alert('!BOOM!');
        alert('Have a nice day. :-)');
        x = 'You pressed &quot;THE BUTTON&quot; and I told you not to!';
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
      body {
        background-color:#00aac5;
        color:#000
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;THE BUTTON - Don't Click It&quot; onclick=&quot;bomb()&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Click Here And See If You Have Clicked ''THE BUTTON''&quot; onclick=&quot;alert(x)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This script is dual-licensed under both, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License&quot;&gt;GFDL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;GNU General Public License&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript&quot;&gt;Wikibooks&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

What has this code done? Well when it loads it tells what value the variable 'x' should have. The next code snippet is a function that has been named &quot;bomb&quot;. The body of this function fires some alert messages and changes the value of 'x'.

The next part is mainly HTML with a little javascript attached to the INPUT tags. &quot;onclick&quot; property tells its parent what has to be done when clicked. The bomb function is assigned to the first button, the second button just shows an alert message with the value of x.

==Javascript if() - else Example==

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The Welcome Message - Javascript&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      function wlcmmsg() {
        name = prompt('What is your name?', '');
        correct = confirm('Are you sure your name is ' + name + ' ?');
        if (correct == true) {
          alert('Welcome ' + name);
        } else {
          wlcmmsg();
        }
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
      body {
        background-color:#00aac5;
        color:#000
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload=&quot;wlcmmsg()&quot; onunload=&quot;alert('Goodbye ' + name)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

See &lt;a href=&quot;http://textbook.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming:Javascript&quot;&gt;Wikibooks&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Two Scripts==
We are going back to the first example. But adding more to the script by also adding a different welcome message. This time a person is made to enter a name. They are also asked if they want to visit the site. Some CSS has also been added to the button.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&quot;THE BUTTON&quot; - Javascript&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      // global variable x
      x = 'You have not pressed &quot;THE BUTTON&quot;';

      function bomb() {
        alert('O-GOD NOOOOO, WE ARE ALL DOOMED!!');
        alert('3');
        alert('2');
        alert('1');
        alert('!BOOM!');
        alert('Have a nice day. :-)');
        x = 'You pressed &quot;THE BUTTON&quot; and I told you not too!';
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
      body {
        background-color:#00aac5;
        color:#000
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload=&quot;welcome()&quot;&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      function welcome() {
        var name = prompt('What is your name?', '');
        if (name == &quot;&quot; || name == &quot;null&quot;) { 
          alert('You have not entered a name');
          welcome();
          return false;
        }
        var visit = confirm('Do you want to visit this website?')
        if (visit == true) {
          alert('Welcome ' + name);
        } else {
          window.location=history.go(-1);
        }
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;THE BUTTON - Don't Click It&quot; onclick=&quot;bomb()&quot; STYLE=&quot;color: #ffdd00; background-color: #ff0000&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Click Here And See If You Have Clicked ''THE BUTTON''&quot; onclick=&quot;alert(x)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

== &lt;u&gt;'''Event Handlers'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

An event occurs when something happens in a browser window. The kinds of events that might occur are due to:

* A document loading
* The user clicking a mouse button
* The browser screen changing size

When a function is assigned to an event handler, that function is run when that event occurs.

A handler that is assigned from a script used the syntax '[element].[event] = [function];', where [element] is a page element, [event] is the name of the selected event and [function] is the name of the function that occurs when the event takes place.

For example:

&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
document.onclick = clickHandler;
&lt;/source&gt;

This handler will cause the function &lt;code&gt;clickHandler()&lt;/code&gt; to be executed whenever the user clicks the mouse anywhere on the screen. Note that when an event handler is assigned, the function name does not end with parentheses. We are just pointing the event to the name of the function. The clickHandler function is defined like this:

&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
function clickHandler(evt) {
  //some code here
}
&lt;/source&gt;

By convention the event is represented by the variable 'evt'. In some browsers the event must be explicitly passed to the function, so as a precaution it's often best to include a conditional to test that the evt variable has been passed, and if it hasn't then to use an alternative method that works on those other browsers:


&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
function clickHandler(evt) {
    evt = evt || window.event;
    //some code here
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Elements within a document can also be assigned event handlers. For example:

&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
document.getElementsByTagName('a')[0].onclick = linkHandler;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will cause the &lt;code&gt;linkHandler()&lt;/code&gt; function to be executed when the user clicks the first link on the page.

Keep in mind that this style of handler assignment depends on the link's position inside the page. If another link tag is added before this one, it will take over the handler from the original link.  A best practice is to maintain the separation of code and page structure by assigning each link an identifier by using the id attribute.

&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;faqLink&quot; href=&quot;faq.html&quot;&gt;Faq&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A handler assignment can then work regardless of where the element is positioned.

&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
document.getElementById('faqLink').onclick = linkHandler;
&lt;/source&gt;
Events are actions that can be detected by JavaScript, and the event object gives information about the event that has occurred.
Sometimes we want to execute a JavaScript when an event occurs, such as when a user clicks a button.
Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs!
JavaScript event handlers are divided into two types:
#Interactive event handlers - depend on user interaction with the HTML page; ex. clicking a button
#Non-Interactive event handlers - do not need user interaction; ex. on load

== Event Handlers as HTML attributes ==

In HTML, JavaScript events can be included within any specified attribute - for example, a body tag can have an &lt;code&gt;onload&lt;/code&gt; event:

&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;body onload=&quot;alert('Hello world!');&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The content of the HTML event attributes is JavaScript code that is interpreted when the event is triggered, and works very similarly to the blocks of JavaScript. This form of code is used when you want to have the JavaScript attached directly to the tag in question.

This type of technique is called inline JavaScript, and can be seen as being a less desirable technique than other unobtrusive JavaScript techniques that have previously been covered. The use of inline JavaScript can be considered to be similar in nature to that of using inline CSS, where HTML is styled by putting CSS in style attributes. This is a practice that is best avoided in favour of more versatile techniques.

==Epidemiology==
Account for only 2% of malignant tumors of the GI tract in spite of the small bowel accounting for 75% of the length and 90% of the surface area of the gut. 

5,000 cases/year. 1,200 deaths.

==Presentation==
Small bowel neoplasms generally present with pain, obstruction, bleeding, anorexia, weight loss and sometimes jaundice.  Small bowel neoplasms are more common in the proximal small bowel (duodenum &gt; jejunum &gt; ileum).  Most occur in the 1st or 2nd portion of the duodenum.  Adenocarcinomas of the duodenum tend to lead to small bowel obstruction.

==Anatomy==
Duodenum is 25 cm in length. Jejunum is 8 ft in length. Ileum is 12 ft in length. There is no abrupt divison between the jejunum and ileum.  The duodenum is retroperitoneal, whereas the remainder of the bowel is encased in mesentery.  The duodenum is divided into four portions.  The first portion of the duodenum is defined as the portion sitting underneath the gall bladder and quadrate lobe of the liver.  The second portion of the duodenum is the concave portion.  The third portion of the duodenum is portion that lies horizontally at the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebral body.  The fourth portion of the duodenum ascends to the 2nd lumbar vertebral body.

==Lymphatics==
Lymph nodes are located along the mesenteric vessels to the root of the mesentery. 

Regional nodes include:
&lt;br&gt;''For duodenum:'' duodenal, hepatic, pancreaticoduodenal, infrapyloric, gastroduodenal, pyloric, superior mesenteric, pericholedochal
&lt;br&gt;''For ileum and jejunum:'' posterior cecal, ileocolic, superior mesenteric, mesenteric NOS

Distant mets:
&lt;br&gt;celiac axis

==Pathology==
45% of small bowel malignancies are adenocarcinomas.  Other histologies include carcinoid, lymphoma, sarcoma and GIST.  Carcinoid is the most common histology of the distal small bowel.

==Staging==
Does not include lymphomas, carcinoid tumors, or GISTs.  Does not include tumors arising from the ileocecal valve or from Meckel's diverticula.  Tumors from the ampulla of vater have their own staging system.

'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)'''&lt;br&gt;
Is similar to that for colon/rectum but has only N1 and no subdivisions of overall stage

''Tumor''
*T1a - invades lamina propria
*T1b - invades submucosa
*T2 - invades muscularis propria
*T3 - invades through muscularis propria into the subserosa or into the nonperitonealized perimuscular tissue (mesentery or retroperitoneum) with extension 2 cm or less
*T4 - perforates the visceral peritoneum or directly invades other organs or structures (includes other loops of small bowel, mesentery, or retroperitoneum more than 2 cm, and abdominal wall by way of serosa; for duodenum only, invasion of pancreas or bile duct)
''Nodes''
*N0 - no regional lymph node metastasis
*N1 - metastasis in 1-3 lymph nodes
*N2 - metastasis in 4 or more lymph nodes
:''regional nodes:'' celiac nodes are considered M1. Regional nodes include: (duodenum) - duodenal, hepatic, pancreaticoduodenal, infrapyloric, gastroduodenal, pyloric, superior mesenteric, pericholedochal; (ileum and jejunum) - cecal, ileocolic, superior mesenteric, mesenteric
''Metastasis''
*M0 - no
*M1 - yes
&lt;br&gt;
''Stage grouping''
*I - T1-T2 N0
*IIA - T3 N0 M0
*IIB - T4 N0 M0
*IIIA - N1
*IIIB - N2
*IV - M1
&lt;br&gt;
''Changes from 6th edition:''
*Subdivided T1 into T1a/b
*T3 and T4 are similar but modified slightly
*N category changed from N0-1 to N0-2
*Stage II subdivided into IIA and IIB, Stage III subdivided into IIIA and IIIB

===Older staging systems===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)'''&lt;br&gt;

*T1 - invades lamina propria or submucosa
*T2 - invades muscularis propria
*T3 - invades into subserosa or into non-peritonealized pericoloic or perirectal tissues
*T4 - invades other organs or structures or perforates visceral peritoneum

*N1 - regional lymph node metastases

''Stage grouping:''
*I - T1-2 N0 M0
*II - T3-4 N0 M0
*III - N1
*IV - M1

''Changes in AJCC staging:''
*No changes from the 5th edition

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the portion of the small bowel affected.  Adenocarcinomas of the 2nd or 3rd portion of the duodenum are treated with pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy.  Adenocarcinomas of other regions of the small bowel may be treated with segmental resection plus regional lymphadenectomy.

The role for adjuvant chemotherapy remains undefined, but 5FU is considered to be the agent of choice.

Indications for adjuvant radiation may include close or positive margins.  Adjuvant radiation is generally given concurrently with chemotherapy.

**Retrospective. 32 patients. Surgery alone (n=16), neoadjuvant chemo-RT (n=11), adjuvant chemo-RT (n=5). Median RT dose 50.4 Gy, concurrent 5-FU based chemo.
**Outcome: 5-year OS 48%, DFS 47%, LC 55%. No difference if surgery alone or surgery with chemo-RT
**Conclusion: Local failure after surgery high, chemo-RT should be considered</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Goldweard. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Goldweard~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Organization ==

It seems many of these topics contain the same information (e.g. Basic Derivative Applications and Applications of Derivatives).  Could we possibly combine the information into one wikibook, and then split off if it grows too large, as opposed to having several smaller books which contain the same information or are needed together to fully understand them?--[[User:SimRPGman|SimRPGman]] 21:52, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:: Hi. Do you have links to the two pages you mention?  Are they separate books or modules in this book?  Do they currently have any useful content? [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 02:21, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

==Thoughts==
I've spent some time going through the material in this section, but I'm out of time to make further improvements--at least for now.  I think overall it's not too bad.  Some of the applied topics are currently underdeveloped.

I've tried to add some proofs of the important theorems.  One difficulty I encountered was the lack of formal development throughout the book that would put some of the more difficult proofs out of the reach of a reader whose only background is the book's prerequisites and the book's material up to that point.  I think a less rigorous treatment is probably best for a book of this nature since a rigorous treatment would probably require a more tightly coupled collaborative effort.  Nevertheless, I think the level of rigor could stand to be raised from its current level, but that would require lots of time and effort starting from the very beginning of the book.

An easier yet significant improvement could be made by adding more exercises (or improving the quality of the current exercises), especially exercises after some new concept has been introduced.  I've tried to move away from having all the exercises at the very end, so I've added solution sub-pages for many of the pages to encourage the addition of new exercises on those pages.

I'm by no means an expert on the subject.  In fact, I'm going through this book now because I'm very rusty, and I'm trying to re-learn the material.  I've tried to double-check the answers I've added using wxmaxima, but it's very possible some of the answers I've given are wrong.  The same goes for the proofs I've added.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 08:22, 24 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Annotation of N.T. ==
Why change the verse?
example &amp;mdash; 2:23 Judeans do sometimes designate their celebrations as Festivals. Suggest return to original &quot;Feast&quot; and maybe &quot;witnessing&quot; instead of watching miracles. Passover revolves around the food or festive meal, others could be, for example, Celebration of Tabernacles.
[[User:Athrash|Athrash]] 05:58, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(few changes since page was up for deletion, evidently on technicalities)

==Finalized==
Findings: &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&lt;br&gt;
* Add &quot;yearly&quot; terminology to Passover of v. 13 because only the Gospel of John gives the length of Jesus' ministry by enumerating three Passovers.
* Greek lessons for beginners when under edit mode the Greek words of the Word Pictures are spelled out as &amp;alpha: to &amp;omega: rather than ISO numbers &amp;#945: to &amp;#969:
* The buildup of Capernaum, Kapharnaoum, Kephar nahûm (village of Nahum) and what happened there.
* Notice an additional bracketed [inline footnote] wherein [prophetic] is appended to words in v. 22. Jesus alludes to himself as a prophet without honor in His own country and also added, no real prophet of the region would perish outside Jerusalem. So the thought here, an afterthought is forethought, stating the obvious.
* The Aramism of v. 23 using the name meaning the person (Acts 1: 15) is the most important sidebar to this translation playing a role in the whole parallel outline considering Aramaic not as primacy but the tie that binds, the original spoken language, part of the oral gospel tradition. The significance is apparent in Chapter 3 (v. 18) and looms large in Chapter 15 where name (v. 21) again becomes &quot;name of Jesus&quot; as in John 1: 12.</text>

This page is for articles pertaining to general cancer epidemiology, such as the role of smoking in causing cancer, etc.  This page should not be used to list the most common cancers.  That should be done separately.

*'''British Doctors Study''' (1951 - )
**PMID 1009386 &amp;mdash; &quot;Mortality in relation to smoking: 20 years' observations on male British doctors.&quot; Doll R et al. Br Med J. 1976 Dec 25;2(6051):1525-36.
**34,440 men. Followed for 20 years. Ratio of death for smokers under age 70 was 2:1. Lung cancer incidence fell as smoking decreased.
**This is the first study to establish a causal relationship between smoking and a number of cancers and heart disease.

==Obesity==
*'''American Cancer Society Prevention Study II'''
**PMID 12711737 &amp;mdash; &quot;Overweight, obesity, and mortality from cancer in a prospectively studied cohort of U.S. adults.&quot; Calle EE et al. N Engl J Med. 2003 Apr 24;348(17):1625-38. 
**Cohort study. 900,000 adults. 16 years follow-up. 
**RR for breast cancer associated with increasing body-mass index &gt; 25.  For men, RR of any cancer was 1.52 for BMI &gt; 25.  For women, RR was 1.62 for BMI &gt; 25.  BMI also associated with higher rates of death due to cancers of the esophagus, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma.

*'''Iowa Women's Health Study'''
**PMID 8419667 &amp;mdash; &quot;Body fat distribution and 5-year risk of death in older women.&quot; Folsom AR et al. JAMA. 1993 Jan 27;269(4):483-7.
**Cohort study. 21,707 women. Follow-up 7 years.
**Increased breast cancer mortality with increased waist-hip ratio.

==Smoking==

      <text xml:space="preserve">I ignore who wrote this recipe, but had to be Valencian like myself.

Full thumbs up on this. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:81.241.236.40|81.241.236.40]] ([[User talk:81.241.236.40|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/81.241.236.40|contribs]]) 2005-06-22T19:42:46.&lt;/small&gt;

: Yes, he is Valencian, I can tell, and everything has been kept unaltered, except from the red wine. I've never seen anyone (at least anyone who is not drunk) pouring red wine into a paella. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:158.42.184.155|158.42.184.155]] ([[User talk:158.42.184.155|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/158.42.184.155|contribs]]) 2007-01-30T02:00:18.&lt;/small&gt;

== Paellera isn't correct ==
The name of the pan itself is paella. Paellera isn't the correct term. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:80.36.45.46|80.36.45.46]] ([[User talk:80.36.45.46|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/80.36.45.46|contribs]]) 2007-02-22T04:14:02.&lt;/small&gt;

:Whilst ''paella'' is Valencian for frying pan, ''paellera'' has come to mean &quot;paella pan&quot; throughout most of Spain. See the [[w:Paella|Wikipedia page on paella]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:04, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

==Changes to recipe==
This recipe has undergone considerable changes since the above comments were made. They no longer apply. Please ignore them and have a look at the recipe. [[User:Moby-Dick4000|Moby-Dick4000]] ([[User talk:Moby-Dick4000|talk]]) 02:46, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

==Garlic==
Garlic is not an ingredient in Valencian (meat) paella. I have changed it to &quot;(seldom)&quot;.
:There are prominent Valencian chefs who use garlic and others who don't. I believe, therefore, the correct word here is '''optional'''. [[User:Moby-Dick4000|Moby-Dick4000]] ([[User talk:Moby-Dick4000|talk]]) 22:26, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

==To anon user 76.121.3.20==
I reverted your change regarding usage of the word '''paella''' for the following reason: The word '''paella''' means pan only in Spain's Valencian community. '''''Paellera''''' is the word for the wide shallow pan used to make paella in all other parts of the world, including Spain outside of Valencia. Also, the [[w:Royal Spanish Academy|Royal Spanish Academy]], the organization which regulates the Spanish language, defines both words as correct for the pan. Please see these links:

==Epidemiology==
*Rare tumor, estimated 3500 patients per year in the US. Incidence ~1/100,000 accounting for 3-4% of GYN malignancies
*Higher incidence in age &gt;70
*Clinical presentation is usually due to symptoms: pruritus, spotting or bleeding, pain, and discharge
*~70% arise in labia majora/minora
*~20% are locally advanced
*Follow predictable lymphatic drainage: superficial inguinofemoral, deep inguinofemoral, external illiac
*Likelihood of LN+ depends on size and depth of primary, it ranges from 5%-60%
**In GOG experience, 24% of patients who had clinically negative LNs were pathologically positive. If the lymph nodes were clinically suspicious, 76% were pathologically positive
*Hematogenous dissemination occurs late
*15% of patients have a second primary tumor in the cervix, vagina, or anus

==Staging==
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
:Is based on revised FIGO staging (2009)
:'''FIGO 2009''' PMID 19329116 -- &quot;Revised FIGO staging for carcinoma of the vulva.&quot;
:''see also:'' [http://www.bgcs.org.uk/media/7f4b5fd0dd26474db0ae97073639d15b.pdf Revised FIGO Staging (2009)(PDF)] (clarifies some errors in AJCC Manual)
''Primary Tumor:''
*Tis - in situ
*T1
**T1a (FIGO IA) - &amp;le; 2 cm in size and &lt;= 1mm depth of stromal invasion
**T1b (FIGO IB) - &gt; 2 cm in size, or any size with &gt;1mm depth of stromal invasion
*T2 (FIGO II) - extension to adjacent perineal structures (lower/distal 1/3 urethra, lower/distal 1/3 vagina, or anal involvement)
*T3 (FIGO IVA) - extension to any of the following: upper/proximal 2/3 of urethra, upper/proximal 2/3 of vagina, bladder mucosa, rectal mucosa, or fixed to pelvic bone

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
:''Regional nodes:'' include femoral and inguinal nodes. Involvement of iliac nodes is Stage IVB.
*N0 - none
*N1 (FIGO IIIA)
**N1a - 1-2 LN mets, each &lt; 5 mm
**N1b - 1 LN met &amp;ge; 5 mm
*N2 
**N2a (FIGO IIIB) - 3 or more LN, each &lt; 5 mm each
**N2b (FIGO IIIB) - 2 or more LN &amp;ge; 5 mm
**N2c (FIGO IIIC) - LN with extracapsular spread
*N3 (FIGO IVA) - fixed or ulcerated LN


''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1 (FIGO IVB) - yes (includes pelvic LN met)

''Stage Grouping:''
*IA - T1a N0 (FIGO IA)
*IB - T1b N0 (FIGO IB)
*II - T2 N0 (FIGO II)
*IIIA - T1-2 N1 (FIGO IIIA)
*IIIB - T1-2 N2a-b (FIGO IIIB)
*IIIC - T1-2 N2c (FIGO IIIC)
*IVA - T3 or N3 (FIGO IVA)
*IVB - M1 (FIGO IVB)

''Changes from 5th edition:''
*Now includes number and size of lymph nodes and presence of extracapsular spread
*Stage III is subdivided into IIIA/B/C

===Older staging systems===
'''AJCC 5th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
'''FIGO stage:''' (AJCC difference in parentheses)
&lt;br&gt;Surgical staging implemented in 1989.
*I
:IA - 2 cm or less in size, and &lt;= 1mm depth of stromal invasion
:IB - 2 cm or less in size, &gt;1mm depth of stromal invasion
*II - &gt; 2cm in size
*III(T3) - spread to lower urethra, vagina, or anus
*III(N1) - unilateral lymph node metastasis
*IVA(T4) - invades upper urethra, bladder mucosa, rectal mucosa, or fixed to pubic bone
*IVA(N2) - bilateral lymph node metastases
*IVB - distant mets (including pelvic nodes)

'''Older staging systems:''' &lt;br&gt;
An older version included N2 (same as now) and N3 nodes (pelvic LN mets).

'''Functional Staging:'''
*Early stage - can treat with primary surgery (WLE, modified radical vulvectomy, radical vulvectomy)
*Locally advanced stage - unable to resect without ultra-radical (exenterative) surgery

==Pathology==
*85% are squamous cell
*The others are: melanoma, basaloid (cloacogenic), adenocarcinoma, etc.
*Tumors may arise in or near areas of premalignant conditions such as [[w:lichen sclerosus|lichen sclerosus]], erythroplasia of Queyrat, [[w:Paget's disease of the breast|Paget's disease]], or [[w:Bowen's disease|Bowen's disease]].


==Survival==
Stage I - 90% at 5 yrs
&lt;br&gt;Stage II - 70-75%
&lt;br&gt;Stage III - 40-50%

'''Vulvarcancer! nomogram'''
*'''Korean KGOG-1010; 2008''' PMID 19471576 -- &quot;Validation of a nomogram for predicting outcome of vulvar cancer patients, primarily treated by surgery, in Korean population: multicenter retrospective study through Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group (KGOG-1010).&quot; (Kim MK, J Gynecol Oncol. 2008 Sep;19(3):191-4. Epub 2008 Sep 30.)
**Validation. 90 cases from 11 institutions. Mean F/U 4 years
**Outcome: RFS 2-year observed 81% vs calculated 79% (R2 = 0.35), 5-year observed 68% vs calculated 72% (R2 = 0.8). Concordance index 0.79, improved to 0.82 with squamous cell
**Conclusion: The nomogram provides predictive capacity in Korean patients

*'''Creteil, France; 2006''' (1978-2001) PMID 16507940 -- &quot;Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting outcome of patients with vulvar cancer.&quot; (Rouzier R, Obstet Gynecol. 2006 Mar;107(3):672-7.)
**Nomogram. 244 patients from Creteil used as a training set; 129 patients from Torino as a validation set
**Outcome: Covariaes for RFS included age, T-stage, number of LN+, bilateral LN involvement, omission of LND, SM status, LVI status, depth of invasion. Concordance 0.83 in validation set, which was better than FIGO stage (concordance 0.78, SS)
**Conclusion: Nomogram developed for predicting 2 and 5 year RFS

==Management of the primary==
===Surgery===
*Typically the primary treatment option for resectable disease (appropriate for the ~80% of localized disease)
*Historically, radical vulvectomy was performed. Even after radical vulvectomy (GOG 37), local failure rate was still 9%. With less radical surgery (modified radical vulvectomy, WLE), importance of margin becomes critical
*Surgical margin is the most important predictor of recurrence, with &gt;1cm margin satisfactory and &lt;8mm margin ~50% recurrence rate based on UCLA data
*Other factors: size &gt; 4 cm, lymphatic-vascular space invasion
**Either factor - 20% recurrence.  No factors - 9%
*However, local vulva recurrences are salvageable (unlike LN failures) and do not strongly correlate with overall survival
**To some, this suggests that adjuvant RT for vulva may not be as critical as for inguinal lymph nodes
*Please see below for unresectable disease; a GOG Phase II trial of concurrent chemo-RT followed by surgical resection and LND is ongoing
*ASTRO 2008 refresher: Adjuvant RT to vulva if SM+ or &lt;8mm, or 2+ &quot;Heaps&quot; factors, or if treat LN already then 1+ &quot;Heaps factor&quot;


*'''UCLA; 1990''' (1957-1985) PMID 2227541 -- &quot;Surgical-pathologic variables predictive of local recurrence in squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.&quot; (Heaps JM, Gynecol Oncol. 1990 Sep;38(3):309-14.)
**Retrospective. 135 patients, Stage I-IV. 
**Outcome: Recurrence rate SM &gt;=8mm 0% vs. SM &lt;8mm 48% (SS).
**Predictors for recurrence: depth of invasion (9 mm), tumor thickness (1cm), infiltrative growth, LVI+, increasing keratin, &gt;10 mitoses
**Conclusion: Surgical margin most powerful predictor of local recurrence

===Adjuvant RT===
*'''Harvard; 2013''' (1988-2009) PMID 23747330 -- &quot;Relationship of margin status and radiation dose to recurrence in post-operative vulvar carcinoma.&quot; (Viswanathan AN, Gynecol Oncol. 2013 Sep;130(3):545-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2013.05.036. Epub 2013 Jun 5.)
**Retrospective. 205 patients, Stage I-IVA. Slides reviewed, margin scored as negative (&amp;ge; 1 cm) in 34%, close (&lt;1 cm) 56%, or positive 10%. Median F/U 4.1 years
**Outcome: 4-year vulvar recurrence negative SM 18%, close SM 37% (HR 3.0), positive 77% (HR 7.0). Highest risk of recurrence with margins &amp;le; 5 mm. Adjuvant radiation dose &amp;ge; 56 Gy better
**Conclusion: Close or positive margins significantly increase vulvar recurrence risk. Radiation dose &amp;ge; 56 Gy may decrease the risk of recurrence

**Retrospective. 27 pts with positive nodes treated with post-op RT. RT was to bilateral groin and pelvic nodes, unilateral groin and pelvis, or unilateral groin only. Midline was blocked in all but 1 pt. Median dose 45 Gy. 
**Recurrences in 63% at a median of 9 months from surgery. Recurrences were under the midline block in 76%.

===Unresectable disease===
*'''GOG 101''' (1989-94)
**Phase II. 96 pts. Two groups: 1) T3 or T4 not resectable by std surgery, and 2) unresectable N2/N3 nodes (see below). Split-course cisplatin/5-FU + RT followed by resection of residual tumor and bilateral inguinal LN dissection. RT dose 4760 cGy (170 cGy/d qd, 170 cGy/fx BID on days 1-4 of each course), given as two courses of 2380 cGy. RT fields were to tumor only if N0-1, or to include groin and lower pelvis (to SI joint) if N2-3.
**''Pts with unresectable primary:'' 
***PMID 9747823, 1998 &amp;mdash; &quot;Preoperative chemoradiation for advanced vulvar cancer: a phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group.&quot; Moore DH et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Aug 1;42(1):79-85.
***73 pts with unresectable primary (of whom 50 were N0-N1 and 23 were unresectable N2-N3). 48% cCR. 70% of those had pCR. 84% of those with residual disease had negative margins. Of 50 pts who were initially felt to require pelvic exenteration, only 1 had exent. and 2 had colostomy.  Only 2 pts had residual unresectable disease.
***Median f/u 50 months for pts alive. 32.9% had recurrence. 54.9% alive without disease.

***46 pts with unresectable N2/N3 nodes. Became resectable in 38/42 pts. pN0 in 15/37. Primary tumor had pCR in 20/38 pts. 4 pts had CR of primary and had biopsy only. 
***12 pts alive without disease (median f/u 78 mo). Control of LN disease in 36/37 and control of primary and nodes in 27/38. 
**Conclusion: preoperative treatment is effective. High rate of pCR for the nodes (~40%) and primary (~31%). 

*'''GOG 185''' - ? cisplatin + RT - closed due to poor accrual?

*'''GOG 205''' (2003-?) -- Phase II
**58 pts. Unresectable T3 or T4, any N. RT (1.8 x 32 = 57.6 Gy) with weekly cisplatin, followed by resection of residual disease.
**'''2012''' PMID 22079361 -- &quot;A phase II trial of radiation therapy and weekly cisplatin chemotherapy for the treatment of locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: a gynecologic oncology group study.&quot; (Moore DH, Gynecol Oncol. 2012 Mar;124(3):529-33.)
***40 of 58 pts (69%) completed study treatment. cCR in 64% (37/58); of those having CR, 29 had pCR (29/37; 78% of those in cCR. 29/58; 50% of total)
***Conclusion: &quot;This combination of radiation therapy plus weekly cisplatin successfully yielded high complete clinical and pathologic response rates with acceptable toxicity.&quot;
***Comment: the 64% cCR rate is an increase from the ~48% seen in GOG 101. pCR of 50% is an increase from the 31% in GOG 101.

==Management of the lymph nodes==
*Metachronous (after primary treatment) groin node metastases are primary predictor of treatment failure and death
**Therefore, management of lymph nodes is critically important in vulvar cancer
*Initial surgery should include histologic assessment of inguinal nodes if the primary has &gt;1mm stromal invasion
**For lateralized T1a lesions (&lt;1 mm stromal invasion), likelihood of LN involvement is &lt;5%
**If depth of invasion 2mm - 8% risk, 3 mm - 17% risk, overall 24% risk
**Clinical tumor size correlates with occult metastases in patients with clinically negative lymph node involvement as follows: 0 to 1 cm = 7.7%; 1.1 to 2 cm = 23.9%; 2.1 to 3 cm = 31%; 3.1 to 5 cm = 36.4%. (from Gonzalez Bosquet, PMID 12957253)
**At least 10-12 lymph nodes should be removed from bilateral inguinal-femoral dissection for optimal assessment
*Predictors of lymph node metastasis: tumor thickness, grade, capillary space invasion, depth of invasion, location of tumor, tumor size
*Approximately 70-75% of patients with clinically negative inguinal groins will have pathologically negative inguinal lymph nodes
**In the clinically negative patients, GOG 88 showed that bilateral groin LND is superior to poorly done prophylactic RT (0% failures vs 20% failures), as that RT was prescribed to 3 cm and was not CT planned
**The Dutch have shown that SLND is feasible, and failure rate after SLN- is ~2-3%
*Number of involved groin lymph nodes strongly correlates with survival; and there is a benefit to adjuvant inguinal/pelvic RT. GOG 37 showed benefit for all patients with LN+, though on subset analysis the benefit was not significant for patients with a single positive LN. Retrospective SEER data suggests that these patients benefit as well, especially if they have inadequate inguinal/femoral LND (&lt;12 lymph nodes removed)
*Based on GOG data, ~25% of patients with pathologic ipsilateral groin disease will also have contralateral disease
**PET thus far appears to have &lt;70% sensitivity for assessing contralateral groin LN
**Therefore, contralateral groin requires assessment/management in ipsilateral groin LN+ patients
*Based on GOG data, ~28% of patients with groin LN + disease will also have pelvic LN+ disease
*There is no Phase III data for use of chemotherapy. In GOG 37, the 2-year OS for inguinal LN+ was 68%, but the 2-year OS for pelvic LN+ was only 23%. Extrapolated data from other organs might argue for concurrent chemo-RT
*ASTRO 2008 refresher: Adjuvant RT if 2+ LN involved, single grossly involved LN with ECE (old N2/N3 disease), or 1 LN+ but inadequate dissection (&lt;5 on that side). Consider adjuvant chemo-RT if 3+ LN involved or ECE. Prophylactic groin RT reasonable with appropriate treatment techniques

===Anatomic considerations===
*'''Torino, Italy; 2002''' PMID 12210022 -- &quot;Rationale and definition of the lateral extension of the inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulvar cancer derived from an embryological and anatomical study.&quot; (Micheletti L, J Surg Oncol. 2002 Sep;81(1):19-24.)
**Embryological and anatomic study to determine lateral extension of groin lymphadenectomy in vulvar cancer. 3 human fetuses, 1 patient dissected
**Outcome: Most lateral superficial inguinal lymph node does not rise above medial margin of the sartorius muscle, nor far lateral to where superficial circumflex iliac vessels cross the inguinal ligament
**Conclusion: Lateral surgical landmark established

===Lymph node dissection===
'''Sentinel lymph node mapping:'''
*'''GOG 173''' (1999-2009) - Phase III trial.
**459 eligible pts. Eligible if depth &amp;ge; 1mm, tumor limited to vulva, primary tumor &amp;ge; 2 cm and &amp;le; 6 cm, and inguinal lymph nodes negative by examination; i.e. T1b and N0 (but &lt;=6cm).
**Performed SLNB followed by completion lymphadenectomy. If tumor within 2 of midline, bilateral SLNB and lymphadenectomies were performed; otherwise, unilateral. 
**'''2012''' PMID 22753905 -- &quot;Lymphatic Mapping and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Women With Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Vulva: A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.&quot; (Levenback CF, J Clin Oncol. 2012 Nov 1;30(31):3786-3791.)
***452 pts underwent lymphatic mapping. 772 groin dissections performed (320 bilateral, 132 unilateral). SLN identified in 418 of 452 pts. 
***LN metastases found in 132 of 418 pts (31.6%). SLN positive in 121 of 418 pts; 11 pts with negative SLN but positive LN identified on dissection. Sensitivity of SLNB 91.7%. In pts with tumors &lt; 4 cm, false negative rate is 2%.
***Conclusion: &quot;Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a reasonable alternative to inguinal femoral lymphadenectomy in selected women with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.&quot; Women with tumors &lt; 4 cm can be counseled that they have a less than a 3% risk of a groin relapse due to a false-negative SLN.

*'''GROINSS-V; 2008''' (2000-2006) PMID 18281661 -- &quot;Sentinel node dissection is safe in the treatment of early-stage vulvar cancer.&quot; (Van der Zee AG, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 20;26(6):884-9.)
**Prospective. 623 groins in 403 patients. T1-2, &lt;4cm, SCC of vulva, clinically negative inguino-femoral LNs. SLN performed. If SLN- by ultrastaging, LND omitted. Median F/U 3 years
**Outcome: SLN- in 68% patients. If SLN-, 2.3% groin failure rate and 3-year OS 97%
**Toxicity: lymphedema 2% vs. 25%, recurrent erysipelas 0.4% vs. 16%
**Conclusion: In early-stage vulvar CA, groin recurrences are low in patients with negative SLN

**Retrospective. 58 patients with vulvar cancer, radical vulvectomy, and bilateral inguinal/femoral LND. 20th percentile for total LN removed = 10. RT 31%
**Outcome: Only predictor for time-to-progression was &lt;10 lymph nodes removed
**Conclusion: Total number of LNs removed is independent prognostic factor, and at least 10 removed from bilateral dissection should be used for optimal evaluation

*'''Mayo; 2003''' (1955-90) - PMID 12957253 -- &quot;Risk of occult inguinofemoral lymph node metastasis from squamous carcinoma of the vulva.&quot; (Gonzalez Bosquet J, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Oct 1;57(2):419-24.)
**Retrospective. 226 pts, clinically N0.
**Lymph node metastases by clinical tumor size: 0 to 1 cm = 7.7%; 1.1 to 2 cm = 23.9%; 2.1 to 3 cm = 31%; 3.1 to 5 cm = 36.4%

*'''GOG 74''' (1983-89) - superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy
**121 evaluable pts. Tumor thickness &amp;le; 5 mm; no vascular invasion, clinically negative LNs. 
**'''1992''' PMID 1553164 -- &quot;Early stage I carcinoma of the vulva treated with ipsilateral superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy and modified radical hemivulvectomy: a prospective study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group.&quot; (Stehman FB, Obstet Gynecol. 1992 Apr;79(4):490-7.)
***19 recurrences. Vulvar recurrence: 8 of 10 pts salvaged. Groin recurrence: 5 of 7 deaths from cancer occurred in pts with first recurrence in the groin.
***Conclusion: &quot;The number of patients who experienced recurrence in the operated groin is of concern and may be attributable to the decision to leave the femoral nodes intact.&quot;

***Subset of 272 of 588 pts (48.7%) had superficial tumors, defined as &lt;U&gt;&lt;= 5mm&lt;/u&gt; thick (N.B.: this is different that the cutoff of 1 mm used for Stage IA vs IB. This study measured the total tumor thickness, not the depth of stromal invasion.)
***Significant predictors of groin LN metastasis: tumor thickness, grade, capillary-like space involvement, clitoral or perineal location, and clinically suspicious nodes. 
***Conclusion: &quot;The risk of lymph node metastases is best determined by simultaneous evaluation of all risk factors rather than a single factor such as tumor thickness.&quot;
**'''All patients; 1993''' - PMID 8314530 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prognostic factors for groin node metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (a Gynecologic Oncology Group study).&quot; (Homesley HD, Gynecol Oncol. 1993 Jun;49(3):279-83.)
***All 588 pts. Predictors of groin LN metastasis (ranked in order of importance): higher grade, suspicious or fixed/ulcerated LNs, presence of capillary-lymphatic involvement, older age, greater tumor thickness. Tumor size and location were not predictive.
***Toxicity: Chronic lymphedema 27%, wound breakdown 49%

===Adjuvant RT===
*Radiation indicated for: &gt;1 LN+, LN with ECE, margin &lt; 8-10 mm, lymphadenectomy not performed due to comorbid disease, LVSI
*Patients with fixed or ulcerated nodes should be treated with chemo/RT as per unresectable disease


*'''GROINSS-V II''' (ongoing, opened 2005) - Non-randomized, observational study. In patients with SLN+, adjuvant RT (or chemo-RT, at physician discretion). For pts with SLN-, observation.


*'''SEER data; 2006''' (1988-2001) PMID 16889821 -- &quot;The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in single-node-positive squamous cell vulvar carcinoma.&quot; (Parthasarathy A, Gynecol Oncol. 2006 Dec;103(3):1095-9. Epub 2006 Aug 4.)
**Retrospective SEER data. 208 patients with single positive inguinal LN. 92% underwent radical vulvectomy with uni/bilateral LND. Median number LN resected 13. ~50% adjuvant RT. 
**Outcome: 5-year DSS adjuvant RT 77% vs. no RT 61% (SS). 5-year DSS improved if &lt;12 LN removed RT 77% vs. no RT 55% (SS), if &gt;12 LN removed RT 77% vs. no RT 67% (NS)
**Conclusion: Adjuvant RT may improve DSS in patients with single LN+ who underwent less extensive LND

*'''GOG 88''' (1986-1990) -- GN-: RT vs bilateral groin dissection
**Randomized. ''Stopped prematurely after failures seen only in RT arm.'' 52/300 patients, radical vulvectomy. T1-T3 (T1 eligible if LVI+ or depth &gt;5mm). Nonsuspicious (clinical N0-N1) inguinal nodes. Arm 1) Bilateral inguinal/femoral LND vs Arm 2) bilateral groin irradiation. RT dose 50 Gy prescribed to 3 cm depth, CT planning not mandated. 
**'''1992''' PMID 1526880 &amp;mdash; &quot;Groin dissection versus groin radiation in carcinoma of the vulva: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; (Stehman FB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1992;24(2):389-96.)
**Outcome: Groin recurrence RT 18% vs surgery 0% (SS), though 20% found to have positive disease and received ipsilateral inguinal/pelvic RT. OS RT 63% vs. surgery 88%. All recurrences were in-field
***Conclusion: Radiation of intact groins is inferior to surgical dissection
***Criticism: Dose to groin was prescribed at 3cm which greatly underdosed the nodes. ~50% patients had BMI &gt;28. (See article by Koh below.) Koh showed that of the 5 pts who failed, all received tumor doses &lt;47 Gy and 3 were underdosed by 30%. Failure rate of 18% is comparable to surgical LN+ rate of 20%, which is comparable to historical GOG data 24%

*'''GOG 37''' (1977-84) -- GN+: Inguinal/pelvic RT vs pelvic LND
**Randomized. ''Closed prematurely for better outcome in RT arm.'' 114 patients with invasive SCC of vulva, who underwent radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal LND, and were found to have positive inguinal lymph nodes (unilateral or bilateral). Arm 1) Ipsilateral pelvic LN dissection vs Arm 2) Bilateral inguinal/pelvic RT. RT AP/PA 45-50 Gy (midplane) to bilateral pelvic nodes and bilateral groins. Superior border L5/S1. No radiation to primary. FIGO clinical staging used (but pathologic confirmation of + LN required for study entry).
**'''1986''' PMID 3785783 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiation therapy versus pelvic node resection for carcinoma of the vulva with positive groin nodes.&quot; (Homesley HD et al. Obstet Gynecol. 1986 Dec;68(6):733-40.)
***Outcome: 2-yr OS RT 68% vs LND 54% (SS). Local groin failures RT 5% vs surgery 24% (SS). Failure rate in vulva 9% (23% of recurrences). Most recurrences within 2 years
***Subset analysis: Survival advantage to RT if clinically suspicious/matted nodes or 2+ LN positive. 2-year OS clinically normal nodes (N0-N1) 78% vs. suspicious nodes (N2) 52% vs. matted nodes (N3) 33%. One LN+ 80% vs. 2-3 LN+ 66% vs. 4+ LN+ 27% (SS). If 2+ LN, RT 63% vs. surgery 37% (SS); no difference in only single LN+.  
***Toxicity: No significant difference
***Conclusion: Adjuvant RT to groin and pelvic lymph nodes after WLE/B inguinal LND is superior to pelvic LN dissection
***Comment: Benefit of RT was from control of the previously dissected groins (24% -&gt; 5% failure rate)
**'''2009''' PMID 19701032  -- &quot;Radiation therapy compared with pelvic node resection for node-positive vulvar cancer: a randomized controlled trial.&quot; (Kunos C, Obstet Gynecol. 2009 Sep;114(3):537-46.) Median survivor F/U 6.1 years
***Outcome: 6-year vulva recurrence RT 9% vs PLND 7% (recall no vulva RT given), groin LN recurrence 5% vs 24%, pelvic LN recurrence 5% vs 2%, DM only 12% vs 11%. 6-year RFS RT 59% vs PLND 48% (HR 0.4, SS). CSS 71% vs 49% (HR 0.5, SS). OS 51% vs 41% (HR 0.6, NS). RT still significantly improved OS for cN2-N3 disease and 2+ groin LN 
***LN disease burden: Significant benefit for RT (HR 3.9) if &amp;ge; 20% ipsilateral LN+. If &amp;ge; 20% LN+, significantly more likely to have contralateral LN+, relapse, and cancer-specific death. 6-year OS for these patients RT 36% vs PLND 13%. Single LN+ in 35% of patients, so inadequate power to estimate benefit
***Toxicity: chronic lymphedema RT 16% vs PLND 22% (NS)
***Conclusion: RT significantly reduces local relapses and cancer-related deaths; new indication for adjuvant RT is &amp;ge; 20% ipsilateral LN+

==Ale==
'''Ale''' is a top-fermented beer that originated in England, as early as the 7th century.  The top fermenting yeast, ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', performs fermentation at a higher temperature of between 55 °F and 70 °F (13-21 °C) than the yeast used to produce lager, and their byproducts are more evident in the final taste and aroma of the ale.

Ale is properly supplied to the point of sale as a &quot;living&quot; beer in which the yeast fermentation continues to occur. Managing the final stages of this process in the cellar or special cool-room is a skilled task, but this is the role of the ''cellarman'' rather than the barman or barmaid and is not considered further here.

Ale can be served in two ways - from a '''beer engine''' or '''by gravity'''. The latter is the simpler technique, in which the glass is filled directly from the cask which is usually placed on a counter behind the bar. The tap in the end of the cask may be an ordinary threaded beer-line tap with a twisting action, or it may be a pouring tap with a lever-style handle. The glass is simply placed close under the tap and filled. Gravity service is usually found in ale-centric establishments with many beers on at once, and at beer festivals.

In most British pubs, the beer engine is used instead. This is the proper name for the tall, manually operated hand pump on the top of the bar, which is connected via the beer-line to the cask in the cellar. Most pumps dispense around a half-pint per pull, although they are frequently worn and require several pulls to obtain a complete pint. Quarter-pint engines also exist. The handle should be operated in a smooth manner across the whole of its arc, rather than jerked rapidly to and fro which tends to agitate the beer, creating a large head into which much of the bitterness migrates.

Head size is also regulated by the '''sparkler''' which may be fitted to the outlet of the pump. This forces the beer through small holes, deliberately agitating it and producing a large head. Some beers are brewed with this in mind, and others are not - a good barman will use a sparkler only on those beers meant to be served through one. In the UK, CAMRA's Good Beer Guide indicates whether this is the case; most brewers will also tell their customers, and may even affix labels with these kind of instructions to the casks.

Many pumps are fitted with a &quot;swan neck&quot; designed to reach to the bottom of the glass. If a sparkler is fitted it is important to use this in order not to create an excessive head which must either be allowed to drop in its own time or spilled out of the glass and wasted. The glass should be raised around the swan-neck so that the outlet is at the bottom. It should be left there until the glass is almost full.

===Stout===
{{wikipedia|Stout}}
'''Stout''' is an ale and a dark, sometimes black beer made with roasted grain. Like other beers, Stout is usually served cool, but some drinkers prefer having Stout at room temperature. Traditionally, the matching food for Stout is the oyster.

Stout was originally known as &quot;Stout Porter&quot; to emphasize its fuller body. Stouts are typically distinguished by use of roasted barley, which gives the drink its characteristic sharp roasty flavor. Porters typically achieve their color with chocolate malt, so named for its color and slight chocolate taste .

The most famous variety of stout is Guinness, originally from Ireland but now brewed around the world. Guinness has a light body with a distinct astringency, and is known for its creamy head of Nitrogen foam. Scottish stout is less bitter than Guinness and more fruity. Oat is sometimes added during the brewing process to make an oatmeal variety.

==Lager==
A lager is a type of beer made with specific strains of yeast which ferment at a significantly lower temperature than ale yeast, resulting in a usually crisper taste. A popular type of lager is a pilsner which is widely consumed in North America, Budweiser and Miller both being of this general style. Like Ales, Lagers also have a number of different styles of brewing.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Laser. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Laser~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: compatability → compatibility (2), managable → manageable, it's own → its own using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve"># __NOTOC__
The use of ICT has exploded, it is no longer used by just experts, so an IT policy is required to manage IT resources in an effective and efficient way and to avoid fragmentation between departments of IT systems.

A single IT policy allows for an overall view and control of an organisation's IT setup. It is important to ensure that the policy reinforces the overall strategy of the organisation.

If each section is allowed to develop individually, without an overall IT policy, it would make it difficult to introduce systems such as [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/IS Within Organisations#Management Information Systems|Management Information Systems]]

It is important to acknowledge the different needs of users when creating an overall IT policy, however.

* The graphics department may need a higher spec of machine to deal with image/video manipulation
* The publishing department may prefer using Macs.
* Operational users may need to interact with the system in a different way to the tactical/strategic users.

A good IT policy will deal with issues such as:

* Access to information - who needs it?
* How will internal communication work
* How will data be captured?

In order to be successful in the long-term, the IT policy will need to be flexible to deal with new technology, new requirements, &lt;!-- Oxford comma --&gt; and changes to the organisational structure.

=== Centralised approach ===

A centralised system is one where the whole IT system in an organisation is ran by a specific area of the company, sometimes called Information Systems.

It has various advantages, such as:

* Increased hardware and software compatibility
* The ability to take advantage of economies of scale
* Ease of transfer of data
* Simpler maintenance
* Easier training/reuse of skills due to consistent interface

=== Decentralised approach ===

In this approach, each department has its own strategy and allows for them to plan their IT system exactly to their needs. This has several disadvantages, such as a lack of coherence among the whole organisation, and the lack of expertise.

== Upgrading systems ==

There are various reasons you may wish to upgrade a system. For example, you may have a legacy system  that is no longer supported by the vendor and is difficult to maintain and is inefficient. However, even current software may need upgrading. It may not be meeting the needs of the organisation, or the organisation may wish to take advantage of features that may exist in newer versions of the software, or may just want to improve performance with faster hardware. Changes in the organisational structure, objectives, or just a &quot;cutting-edge&quot; business culture may result in upgrades.

=== Don't upgrade ===

* This is not always the cheapest option, although involves the least initial capital.
* Is upgrading really necessary?
* Is our current system sufficient to our needs?
* There's no training costs or change management required, and little risk
* The only costs are maintenance costs

=== Upgrade the entire system ===

* This involves a lot of capital expenditure
* Has large technical and support implications
* This may involve a totally new infrastructure set up
* High risk

=== Partial upgrade ===

* Only upgrade who needs it
* Cheaper than all at once
* May cause incompatibilites in the IT systems
* Medium risk

== Future proofing ==

Future proofing is impossible, and it is impossible to know with certainty what the future will hold. It is only possible to prepare for what could happen.

This generally involves purchasing software with a clear upgrade path, or developing software making it easy to expand in the future. Alternatively, this could be purchasing systems with a higher specification than the organisation actually needs in order to allow for future growth.

A method of future-proofing is leasing, where an organisation leases it's IT systems, and does not actually own it. Therefore, upgrading occurs as part of the lease.

== Emulation ==

Emulation is where software is used to run software which is not designed to run on a particular system. For example, software written to run on a specific hardware platform can be emulated to run on another using emulation software. Of course, it is impossible for this to be anywhere near as efficient as running it on the original hardware, but does reduce the hardware costs of having to buy many bits of different hardware. Additionally, an emulator may not fully emulate all the areas of the hardware it is emulating, so the program may not work as intended.

Hardware emulation also exists, where a piece of hardware emulates another piece to provide compatibility with systems designed to use that hardware.

== Backup Strategies ==

This should be part of the [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/Legal Aspects#Corporate Information Systems Security Policies|corporate IS security policy]], as backups are often a weakpoint in security of IS.

A backup strategy should ask these 3 basic questions:

* How often? (the frequency)
* What? (areas to backup)
* Where? (storage of backup)

When deciding on an appropriate backup strategy, we must consider:

* Value of data
* Quantity of data
* Frequency of data change
* Resources available

=== Backup media ===

A range of backup media is available, from the old fashioned, but still popular, [[w:Magnetic_tape|magnetic tape]], [[w:Zip_drive|Zip drives]], or more recently, [[w:DVD-R|recordable DVDs]] and [[w:USB_flash_drive|USB flash drives]].

Other methods of backup could be online, including [[w:Redundant_array_of_independent_disks|RAID]] (a redundant array of independent disks) which makes backups of data constantly.

=== Backup strategies ===

* Full backups
** All data is backed up
** For large amounts of data, this takes a long time and requires a lot of space

* Partial backups
** Only part of the data is backed up at a time. For example, one night might backup the Payroll database, and on the next night, the e-mails are backed up
** Makes large data sources more manageable

* [[w:Incremental backup|Incremental backups]]
** Full backups are made occasionally
** Incremental backups only back up what's different from the last full backup

* Batch process
** Similar to incremental backups, but used for databases

* [[w:Grandfather-Father-Son_Backup|Grandfather-Father-Son Backup]]
** Most popular method of backing up
** A copy of the masterfile and transaction is made at the grandfather level
** At the father level, a copy of the transaction file and the masterfile as a result of the grandfather master file and transaction file is made.
** At the son level, a copy of the transaction file and the masterfile as a result of the father master file and transaction file is made.

'''Aloo Gobi (or Gobhi)''' is a South Asian dish popular in both India and Pakistan. Aloo means [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] and Gobi (also spelled Gobhi) means [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]]. This dish has a prominent role in the movie ''[[Wikipedia:Bend It Like Beckham|Bend It Like Beckham]]''. The DVD contains a featurette titled ''How to cook Aloo gobi''. However, the recipe given differs from the following one and the one in the external link below, demonstrating the variety of ways the dish can be prepared. Also, sometimes aloo gobi is made without the tomato.

==Ingredients==
* 800 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] or [[Cookbook:Purée|puréed]]
* 2 big [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] cut into chunks
* 4-5 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled, cut into cubes
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 3-5 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] or cooking oil
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
* 5 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|curcuma]] (turmeric)
* 2 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* 1-2 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli]]
* 2-4 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
* 5 sprig of [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]]

==Procedure==
# Heat the ghee/oil in frying pan, wok or karahi (an Indian utensil specially used for frying purposes)
# Add jeera (cumin seeds) and wait until they turn a light brown color.
# Add the spices (except for garam masala) and the tomatoes.
# When the mixture turns oily, add the vegetables.
# Roast the cauliflower and the potatoes until they turn soft. Stir occasionally.
# Add the garam masala, mint and lemon juice.

      <comment>(Script) [[commons:COM:FR|File renamed]]: [[File:Full Adder.svg]] → [[File: Full-adder logic diagram.svg]] this is not a European Adder who has just swallowed prey</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==
When adding one number A with another number B the operation will produce a Sum S and a Carry C.The Operation of an adder is Shown below.

==Digital Adder==
===Half adder===
If there are two binary number A and B . The operation of adding two numbers can be shown below
: A + B = S C

: 0 + 0 = Sum 0 Carry 0
: 0 + 1 = Sum 1 Carry 0
: 1 + 0 = Sum 1 Carry 0
: 1 + 1 = Sum 0 Carry 1

The operation of Half Adder can be summarized in the Truth Table below
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || 0
|}

From above, In term of logic gate XOR will produce a sum of two input . logic gate AND produce carry
:&lt;math&gt;S = A \oplus B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

Half Adder can constructed from AND gate and XOR gate as shown below
:[[File:Half Adder.svg|Half adder circuit diagram]]


               ___________
      A ------|           |
              |   Half    |----- &lt;math&gt;S = A \oplus B&lt;/math&gt;
              |   Adder   |
              |           |----- &lt;math&gt;C = A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;
      B ------|___________|

===Full adder===
A '''full adder''' is a logical circuit that performs an addition operation on three one-bit binary numbers. The full adder produces a sum of the two inputs and carry value. It can be combined with other full adders (see below) or work on its own.

: [[Image:1-bit full-adder.svg|200px|Schematic symbol for a 1-bit full adder]]
Note that the final OR gate before the carry-out output may be replaced by an XOR gate without altering the resulting logic. This is because the only difference between OR and XOR gates occurs when both inputs are 1; for the adder shown here, this is never possible. Using only two types of gates is convenient if one desires to implement the adder directly using common IC chips.

A full adder can be constructed from two half adders by connecting ''A'' and ''B'' to the input of one half adder, connecting the sum from that to an input to the second adder, connecting ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the other input and OR the two carry outputs.  Equivalently, ''S'' could be made the three-bit XOR of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''C&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' could be made the three-bit [[majority function]] of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Multiple-bit adders==
===Ripple carry adder===
It is possible to create a logical circuit using multiple full adders to add ''N''-bit numbers. Each full adder inputs a ''C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is the ''C&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the previous adder. This kind of adder is a ''ripple carry adder'', since each carry bit &quot;ripples&quot; to the next full adder. Note that the first (and only the first) full adder may be replaced by a half adder.

The layout of  ripple carry adder is simple, which allows for fast design time; however, the ripple carry adder is relatively slow, since each full adder must wait for the carry bit to be calculated from the previous full adder.
The [[gate delay]] can easily be calculated by inspection of the full adder circuit.
Each full adder requires three levels of logic.  In a 32-bit [ripple carry] adder, there 32 full adders,so the critical path (worst case) delay is &lt;math&gt;32*3=96&lt;/math&gt; gate delays.

===Carry look-ahead adders===

To reduce the computation time, engineers devised faster ways to add two binary numbers by using [[carry lookahead adder]]s.
They work by creating two signals (''P'' and ''G'') for each bit position, based on whether a carry is propagated through from a less significant bit position (at least one input is a '1'), a carry is generated in that bit position (both inputs are '1'), or if a carry is killed in that bit position (both inputs are '0').  In most cases, ''P'' is simply the sum output of a half-adder and ''G'' is the carry output of the same adder.  After ''P'' and ''G'' are generated the carries for every bit position are created.  Some advanced carry look ahead architectures are the [[Manchester carry chain]], [[Brent-Kung adder]], and the [[Kogge-Stone adder]].
:[[Image:4-bit carry lookahead adder.svg|none|framed|4-bit adder with Carry Look Ahead]]

Some other multi-bit adder architectures break the adder into blocks.  It is possible to vary the length of these blocks based on the propagation delay of the circuits to optimize computation time.  These block based adders include the [[carry bypass adder]] which will determine ''P'' and ''G'' values for each block rather than each bit, and the [[carry select adder]] which pre-generates sum and carry values for either possible carry input to the block.

Other adder designs include the [[conditional sum adder]], [[carry skip adder]], and [[carry complete adder]].

===Lookahead Carry Unit===

By combining multiple carry look-ahead adders even larger adders can be created.
This can be used at multiple levels to make even larger adders.
For example, the following adder is a 64-bit adder that uses four 16-bit CLAs with two levels of LCUs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In ICT5, we cover evaluation of software.

It is performed as part of the [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT4/IS Within Organisations#Analysis|Analysis stage]] of the IS lifecycle.

Software should be evaluated against evaluation criteria to see if it meets the requirements it is needed for.

* Functionality - does the software do what is required, and what we want it to do? (i.e., does it meet the specification)
* Performance - does it do it efficiently and quickly?
* Usability - can the software be used effectively by the intended end-user?
* Compatibility - can it co-exist and work alongside our existing software/can it import data from the software we're replacing?
* Robustness - is the software stable?
* User support - do we have people to turn to if it goes wrong?
* Resource requirements - does it run on our existing hardware? Can our staff be training to use it?
* Upgradability - can we continue to use it in the future?
* Cost - is it cheaper than the alternatives? Can we afford it?
* Vendor quality - what kind of reputation does the vendor have?
* Flexibility - can we alter it to do exactly what we want? (especially relevant for generic as opposed to bespoke software)

Benchmarking is a good way of discovering whether the software is suitable or not. You give each criterion a weight, and then each product being evaluated a score. You multiply the weight by the score and add up all the criteria for that product and the one with the highest total score wins.

== Evaluation report ==

This is what should be written once evaluation is complete to be relayed back to the board of directors.

It should consist of the following sections:

* Introduction, who and why is the report being done?
* Methodology, how was the best software decided upon?
* Evaluation, an actual breakdown of each software package showing the results
* Recommendations, which product do the report writers think we should be investing in?
* Justification for this recommendation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Early databases were flat-file, meaning they were small, had lots of duplicated data and could not relate data to each other. As a result of data duplication, data can be inconsistent in separate parts of the database. Flat-files also tended to be unique to a particular program, making data portability difficult.

A database management system (DBMS) was conceived to help alleviate these shortcomings. This model gives three properties:

* Entities - An area of interest about which the data may be held
* Attributes - Properties of entities
* Relationships - A link between entities&lt;br&gt;There are different types of relationships:
** One-to-one - where an entity has a single link to another entity
** One-to-many - where an entity may link to many other entities
** Many-to-many - lots of one-to-ones

By using relationships, you can link data and have queries that will update linked data at the same time, saving time and increasing the accuracy of data. The Wikipedia has [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_management_system#Relational_DBMS more information] about DBMS's.

The role of a database administrator (DBA) is to manage and maintain the DBMS for most efficient usage.  The DBA maintains access rights, relationships and updates the database of the design if need be.

Data normalisation is the process of increasing database efficiency by reducing duplication of records and producing the best possible database design. A normalised database is consistent and flexible.

Data consistency is ensuring that the data is consistent across all occurrences of it (this is made simple using relationships).

Data integrity is the quality of the data held in the database.

Data redundancy is where data is unnecessarily duplicated.

Data independence is where data should be independent of any other changes in the database.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Originally, most large organisations had a mainframe with dumb terminals (simply front-ends to the mainframe; they did no work themselves) to use an IT system. Such systems are rare, although old-style ATM's are such an example.

Nowadays, people use distributed processing, where each terminal has its own processing power and does operations itself, rather than relying on a mainframe. Early computers tended to be stand-alone, with no communication.

Standalone computers require their own individual facilities (such as printers), and files on one can not be easily transferred to another system. However, they are more protected from external virii. Networked systems can take advantage of shared resources and easier communication and also tend to be easier to administer.

We covered networking comprehensively in [[AQA Information and Communication Technology/ICT2/Network Environments|ICT2]]. You need to know which kind of network to use for a specific application in ICT5.

When considering the Internet, you basically think of it as a series of LAN's which are connected together. Routers sit on the border of each LAN where the links are and announce to the world which IP addresses are on that LAN, and listen for other routers so it knows where to send data to.

== Distributed databases ==

When an organisation is spread out all over the world, it can be expensive to provide network access to a single central database, so databases are distributed.

With a distributed database, only the part of the database that is required for that area of the business is held. However, ensuring data integrity becomes important.

== Client/server databases ==

In the client/server model, a dedicated database machine runs the database server (typically the DBMS). The client machine connects to the server to perform queries and generate reports.

'''Phobos Facts''':
*Phobos orbits Mars closer than any other moon in our Solar System.
*Over the next 50 million years it is expected the Martian gravity will shred Phobos into smaller pieces, possibly creating some spectacular impacts on Mars
*It takes less time for Phobos to orbit Mars than for Mars to turn round on its axis.
*Several craters on Phobos are named after characters in ''Gulliver's Travels''.&lt;/div&gt;

== How big is Phobos? ==
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Mars}}

Phobos is actually quite tiny compared to most other moons in the Solar System.  It is not a round sphere-like object, but irregularly shaped, more like a lumpy potato.  At the largest extreme, it is 26 km across, and the smallest is about 18 km across.  Basically about the size of a large city here on the Earth.

[[File:Phobos_over_Mars.png|thumb|right|250px|Phobos in orbit above Mars, as captured by the Viking-2 orbiter, above the Martian volcano Ascraeus Mons]]

== What is its surface like? ==

From the basic appearance, it is very much as it would look on the Earth's Moon, except that the surface features are exaggerated.  Just like the Earth's Moon, Phobos has no atmosphere.  Also like the Earth's moon to the Earth, Phobos has one face that constantly points the same direction toward Mars, and is called '''tidally locked'''.

[[File:Phobos_Surface.png|thumb|left|150px|A photo closeup of Phobos by the Viking-1 Orbiter]]
One big difference you would notice is that there is almost no gravity at all on Phobos.  Just by jumping with your own legs, you would be able to put yourself into &quot;orbit&quot; and &quot;fly&quot; around Phobos.  The gravity is only 1/1000th as strong as it is on the Earth.  This also affects &quot;mountains&quot; on Phobos, as there would appear to be huge cliffs and other features where on even the Earth's Moon they would have collapsed due to gravity pulling them down.

One of the most prominent features on Phobos is a giant crater named '''Stickney'''.  The impact from this crater has a significant effect on the structure of the entire moon, and there are lines or &quot;grooves&quot; along the surface of Phobos that were formed as a result of this impact.

If you were standing on Phobos, Mars would be a significant feature in the sky, taking up almost 1/4 of the sky.

== How long is a day on Phobos? ==

A day on Phobos is about 7 hours 40 minutes.

== How long is its orbit around Mars? ==

Phobos is '''tidally locked''' to Mars.  This means that a day on Phobos is precisely the same as the time it takes to orbit Mars.  So, the same side of Phobos always faces Mars.

Phobos is very close to the surface of Mars.  In fact, it is closer than any other moon in the Solar System that has been discovered so far from the surface of the planet that it orbits.  This produces a very interesting experience to somebody on Mars, where Phobos rises from the west and sets in the east, as it travels faster than the Sun on a Martian day.

[[File:PIA05553.gif|300px|framed|Solar eclipse by Phobos on Mars]]

== Does Phobos cause a solar eclipse on Mars? ==

Just as on the Earth by the Earth's Moon, Phobos does eclipse the Sun on Mars.  This is also called a '''transit''', and produces many of the same effects that you see from a solar eclipse.  If you were to see such an eclipse on Mars, it would significantly darken the Sun, but it would not go into totality as the Earth's Moon does on the Earth.  This is because Phobos is too small to cover the Sun completely. Also, because the orbit of Phobos is so fast, the eclipse would happen very quickly, in just a few seconds instead of the several minutes you see an eclipse on the Earth.

Because Phobos orbits Mars so closely, an eclipse near the Martian equator will be much more noticeable than an eclipse further north or south, because Phobos is usually quite a bit closer to an observer at the equator.

== Is there a future for people on Phobos? ==

Because Phobos is so close to Mars, and because of the very low gravity, Phobos may be a place where people and supplies are transferred before going to the surface of Mars and then going to the Earth, almost like a space station in orbit around the Earth.  It is very likely that if people go to Mars as astronauts, they will be visiting Phobos as well.  Phobos also has frozen water that could be useful to astronauts on Mars as drinking water and for extracting oxygen to breathe.

However, Phobos is a doomed world. In about 50 million years, it will not exist. Every year, it gets about two meters closer to the surface of Mars, and will eventually crash or be ripped apart, forming a ring around Mars which will eventually fall to the ground.

== Who is it named after? ==

Phobos (Ancient Greek ''Φόβος'') was named after the son of Mars, who in mythology was the god of &quot;fear&quot; or &quot;fright&quot;, and one of the servants of Mars.

[[File:Asaph_Hall_Older.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Asaph Hall, the discoverer of Phobos]]

== How was it discovered? ==
Asaph Hall was an astronomer with the '''United States Naval Observatory''', where he studied many of the planets and objects in the Solar System.  In 1877 he discovered both Phobos and Deimos, and identified them as moons of Mars.  The name for Phobos was suggested by Henry Madan, based on the book '''Iliad''', a classical Greek book about mythology.  His wife's maiden name, Stickney, gave the name of the giant crater.

==How much will Phobos' gravity pull on me?==
Phobos, because it is so small, has hardly any gravity at all. It has so little gravity that a 100-pound person on Phobos would only weigh 1/20 of a pound. This also means that you would be able to lift massive amounts of mass. A person who could carry 10 kg on Earth would be able to carry three elephants on Phobos.

Because Phobos' gravity is so small, it is easy to escape Phobos and float off into space. In fact, Phobos' gravity is so light that you could throw a tennis ball or a baseball and it would fly away from Phobos and become a new moon of Mars!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,
It's rather unorthodox to remove your comments from the talk page of the main Cookbook module. I think your desire to have a better search is a good one, and perhaps leaving the comments there would spur discussion. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 18:03, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Calvin. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Calvin~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==JavaScript Debuggers==

===Firebug===
* [http://www.getfirebug.com/ Firebug] is a powerful extension for Firefox that has many development and debugging tools including JavaScript debugger and profiler.

===Venkman JavaScript Debugger===
* [http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/venkman/ Venkman JavaScript Debugger] (for Mozilla based browsers such as Netscape 7.x, Firefox/Phoenix/Firebird and Mozilla Suite 1.x)
* [http://web.archive.org/web/20040704044520/devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/venkman/01/ Introduction to Venkman]
* [http://web.archive.org/web/20040603085323/devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/venkman/01/ Using Breakpoints in Venkman]

===Internet Explorer debugging===
* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sdbug/Html/sdbug_1.asp Microsoft Script Debugger] (for Internet Explorer) The script debugger is from the Windows 98 and NT era. It has been succeeded by the Developer Toolbar
* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2f465be0-94fd-4569-b3c4-dffdf19ccd99&amp;displaylang=en Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vwd/ Microsofts Visual Web Developer Express] is Microsofts free version of the Visual Studio IDE. It comes with a JS debugger. For a quick summary of its capabilities see [http://www.berniecode.com/blog/2007/03/08/how-to-debug-javascript-with-visual-web-developer-express/]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Internet-explorer/ Internet Explorer 8] has a firebug-like Web development tool by default (no add-on) which can be accessed by pressing F12. The Web development tool also provides the ability to switch between the IE8 and IE7 rendering engines.

=== Safari debugging ===
Safari includes a powerful set of tools that make it easy to debug, tweak, and optimize a website for peak performance and compatibility. To access them, turn on the Develop menu in Safari preferences. These include Web Inspector, Error Console, disabling functions, and other developer features. The Web Inspector gives you quick and easy access to the richest set of development tools ever included in a browser. From viewing the structure of a page to debugging JavaScript to optimizing performance, the Web Inspector presents its tools in a clean window designed to make developing web applications more efficient. To activate it, choose Show Web Inspector from the Develop menu. The Scripts pane features the powerful JavaScript Debugger in Safari. To use it, choose the Scripts pane in the Web Inspector and click Enable Debugging. The debugger cycles through your page’s JavaScript, stopping when it encounters exceptions or erroneous syntax. The Scripts pane also lets you pause the JavaScript, set breakpoints, and evaluate local variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url         = http://www.apple.com/safari/features.html#developer

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JTF: JavaScript Unit Testing Farm===
* [http://jtf.ploki.info JTF] is a collaborative website that enables you to create test cases that will be tested by all browsers. It's the best way to do TDD and to be sure that your code will work well on all browsers.

===jsUnit===
* [http://www.jsunit.net/ jsUnit]

=== built-in debugging tools ===

Some people prefer to send debugging messages to a &quot;debugging console&quot; rather than use the alert() function[http://osteele.com/archives/2006/03/inline-console][http://www.webreference.com/js/column108/5.html][http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web/Web_Languages/JavaScript/Q_21380186.html]. Following is a brief list of popular browsers and how to access their respective consoles/debugging tools.

* Firefox: &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Shift+K&lt;/code&gt; opens an error console.
* Opera (9.5+): &lt;code&gt;Tools &gt;&gt; Advanced &gt;&gt; Developer Tools&lt;/code&gt; opens [[Wikipedia:Opera_Dragonfly|Dragonfly]].
* Chrome: &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Shift+J&lt;/code&gt; opens chrome's &quot;Developer Tools&quot; window, focused on the &quot;console&quot; tab.
* Internet Explorer: &lt;code&gt;F12&lt;/code&gt; opens a firebug-like Web development tool that has various features including the ability to switch between the IE8 and IE7 rendering engines.
* Safari: &lt;code&gt;Cmd+Alt+C&lt;/code&gt; opens the WebKit inspector for Safari.

==Common Mistakes==
* Carefully read your code for typos.
* Be sure that every &quot;(&quot; is closed by a &quot;)&quot; and every &quot;{&quot; is closed by a &quot;}&quot;.
* Trailing commas in Array and Object declarations will throw an error in [[w:Microsoft Internet Explorer|Microsoft Internet Explorer]] but not in Gecko-based browsers such as Firefox.
&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
  // Object
  var obj = {
    'foo'   : 'bar',
    'color' : 'red', //trailing comma
  };

  // Array
  var arr = [
    'foo',
    'bar', //trailing comma
  ];
&lt;/source&gt;
* Remember that JavaScript is case sensitive. Look for case related errors.
* Don't use [[JavaScript/Reserved Words|Reserved Words]] as variable names, function names or loop labels.
* Escape quotes in strings with a &quot;\&quot; or the JavaScript interpreter will think a new string is being started, i.e:
:&lt;s&gt;&lt;code&gt;alert('He's eating food');&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/s&gt; should be
:&lt;code&gt;alert('He&lt;strong style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;\'&lt;/strong&gt;s eating food');&lt;/code&gt; or
:&lt;code&gt;alert(&lt;strong style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;He's eating food&lt;strong style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;);&lt;/code&gt;
* When converting strings to numbers using the parseInt function, remember that &quot;08&quot; and &quot;09&quot; (e.g. in datetimes) indicate an octal number, because of the prefix zero. Using parseInt using a radix of 10 prevents wrong conversion. &lt;code&gt;var n = parseInt('09','''10''');&lt;/code&gt;
* Remember that JavaScript is [[w:Platform (computing)|platform]] independent, but is not [[w:web browser| browser]] independent. Because there are no properly enforced standards, there are functions, properties and even objects that may be available in one browser, but not available in another, e.g. Mozilla / Gecko Arrays have an indexOf() function; [[w:Microsoft Internet Explorer|Microsoft Internet Explorer]] does not.

==Debugging Methods==
Debugging in JavaScript doesn't differ very much from debugging in most other programming languages. See the article at [[Computer Programming Principles/Maintaining/Debugging]].

===Following Variables as a Script is Running===
The most basic way to inspect variables while running is a simple alert() call. However some development environments allow you to step through your code, inspecting variables as you go. These kind of environments may allow you to change variables while the program is paused.

==Browser Bugs==
Sometimes the browser is buggy, not your script. This means you must find a workaround.

[http://www.quirksmode.org/bugreports/ Browser bug reports]

== browser-dependent code ==

Some advanced features of JavaScript don't work in some browsers.

Too often our first reaction is: [[Microsoft_Certified_Professional_Developer/Exam_70-528/Web-Based_Client_Development/Program_a_Web_application#Detect_browser_types_in_Web_Forms. | Detect which browser the user is using]], then do something the cool way if the user's browser is one of the ones that support it. Otherwise skip it.

Instead of using a &quot;browser detect&quot;, a much better approach is to 
write &quot;object detection&quot; JavaScript to detect if the user's browser supports the particular object (method, array or property) we want to use.[http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html] [http://pageresource.com/jscript/jobdet.htm]

To find out if a method, property, or other object exists, and run code if it does, we write code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var el = null;
if (document.getElementById) {
  // modern technique
  el = document.getElementById(id);
} else if (document.all) {
  // older Internet Explorer technique
  el = document.all[id];
} else if (document.layers) {
  // older Netscape Web browser technique
  el = document.layers[id];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This recipe contains ghee, aka clarified butter, which is certainly not vegan.  Can the recipe be modified to use a substitute or should it be removed from the vegan cookbook entirely?

: I previously provided a vegan variation in the &quot;variations&quot; section, which simply substitutes oil or melted margarine for the ghee. There's not much special about ghee. This variation was [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Aloo_gobi&amp;action=history removed by Albert] with the note that the substitution is obvious. I also think it's obvious, but I'm not quite sure if we should/how we should provide per-recipe variations for ingredients like ghee, or if we should expect vegans to figure it out. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:34, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
&lt;br&gt;
Personaly, I would prefer adding a link or note in the area about the possible substitutions. I am by no means a vegan, but I have a daughter with a mil allergy and I find browsing vegan cookbooks the safest place to find a good, new meal. THAT SAID I jumped onto the discussion page to make a note about ghee not being vegan only to find it was noticed. I was not aware of the substitution, although it does seem obvious. A simple link would be appropriate, I believe.

&lt;big&gt;'''Localized Prostate Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Definitions==
*Historically, clinically localized prostate cancer was primarily determined by stage. Patients with T1-T2 could be offered watchful waiting, surgery, or radiation therapy. Patients with T3-T4 disease were not considered surgical candidates
**Localized: T1-T2
**Locally advanced: T3-T4
*More recently, urologists have been treating some T3a patients using the robotic surgery. Also, NCCN (www.nccn.org) risk stratification includes T3a patients in the localized disease
**Low risk: T1-T2a and PSA &lt;10 and GS 2-6
**Intermediate risk: T2b-T2c or PSA 10-20 or GS 7
**High risk: T3a or PSA &gt;20 or GS 8-10
**Locally advanced: T3b-T4


==Prospective Comparisons==
*There are no conclusive randomized trials comparing the 3 primary modalities (EBRT, permanent brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy)
*There have been a number of failed trials in the past, but more recently both the PIVOT trial and the ProtecT trial completed accrual. START trial is ongoing

&lt;br&gt;

===Systematic Reviews===
*'''Italy; 2014''' (1965-2007) PMID 24589471 -- &quot;Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy in High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis.&quot; (Petrelli F, Clin Genitourin Cancer. 2014 Aug;12(4):215-224.)
**Meta-analysis; high risk pts, treated with RT vs RP (w/ or w/o ADT), no brachy. 17 studies (16 retrospective, 1 randomized); 13,704 pts. 
**RP associated with improved OS (OR 0.51), PCSM (OR 0.56), and non-PCSM (OR 0.53). bRFS similar to RT.
**Conclusion: &quot;Overall and cancer-specific mortality rates appear to be better with RP compared with RT in localized, high-risk PC. Surgery is also associated with a 50% decreased risk of non-PCSM compared with RT.&quot;

**Decision analysis on RP, EBRT or WW using data from review of literature and Medicare claims data
**Outcome: In well-differentiated tumors, treatment offers at best limited benefit in terms of QALY and may result in harm. In moderately/poorly differentiated tumors and age 60-65, RP or EBRT may benefit over WW, but typically &lt;1 QALY. In patients &gt;70, treatment generally appears harmful
**Conclusion: RP and EBRT may benefit select groups, however, in most cases potential benefits are small and choice of therapy is sensitive to patient's preference

***Outcome: Orchiectomy (orchiectomy alone or orchiectomy + RT) superior to RT alone in DMFS. No difference in local control or overall survival
***Conclusion: Orchiectomy superior to RT alone in metastatic-free survival

==Retrospective Comparisons==
Single institution data suggests comparable outcomes between RP and high-dose (&gt;72 Gy) EBRT, but advantage to RP compared with low-dose (&lt;72 Gy) EBRT. In unfavorable tumors, there appears to be some benefit to RT:


===Single Institution===
*'''Washington U; 2012''' PMID 22335870 -- &quot;Survival among men with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy in the prostate specific antigen era.&quot; (Kibel AS, J Urol. 2012 Apr;187(4):1259-65.)
**Retrospective. 10,429 consecutive pts treated with RP, EBRT, or BT.
**10-yr OS: favors RP (88.9%) over EBRT (82.6%) or BT (81.7%). Adjusted PCA specific mortality favors RP (1.8%) vs EBRT (2.9%) or BT (2.3%). EBRT is associated with decreased OS and PCSM compared with RP. BT is associated with decreased OS but not PCSM compared with RP.
**Conclusion: &quot;After adjusting for major confounders, radical prostatectomy was associated with a small but statistically significant improvement in overall and cancer specific survival. These survival differences may arise from an imbalance of confounders, differences in treatment related mortality and/or improved cancer control when radical prostatectomy is performed as initial therapy.&quot;

** 5-yr bNED 74% (3D), 87% (IMRT), 94% (BT), 94% (EBRT+BT). For int risk: improved bNED for IMRT, BT, or EBRT+BT vs 3D; no improvement noted for low risk. 
** BT caused more GU but less GI tox, EBRT + BT caused more late GU and GI tox than IMRT or 3D.

**347 patients with intermediate cancer treated 8/89-6/01 with standard EBRT (SD-EBRT), high dose &gt;72 Gy EBRT (HD-EBRT), brachytherapy, or brachytherapy+EBRT. AST analyzed also. Median follow-up 36 months
**All treatments were comparable to each other except brachytherapy-based vs. SD-EBRT (p=0.0003)
**AS+SD-EBRT better than SD-EBRT (p=0.0001) ''only'' if failure definition PSA &gt; 1.5 is used
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;For intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients, brachytherapy-based treatment results in an excellent outcome that is significantly better than SD-EBRT.

===EBRT===
*Conventional (2D) RT can safely deliver maximum 65-70 Gy before causing significant GI and GU toxicity. Some subpopulations of tumor clonogens appear resistant to this dose.
*3D-CRT allows delivery of significantly higher doses, and is currently the standard of care
*IMRT permits further dose escalation while providing lower GI toxicity. Its role is under evaluation

**10-year clinical DFS: 22·7% in the radiotherapy-alone group and 47·7% in the combined treatment group (p&lt;0.0001)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The combination of radiotherapy and 3 years of androgen suppression improved long-term overall survival, without increasing late cardiovascular mortality, and should be regarded as standard of care for treatment of men with prostate cancer who are at high metastatic risk, with a WHO performance status of 0–2, and who have no contraindicating coexisting conditions.&quot;

__NOTOC__
== Background ==
OpenCola is  unique in that the instructions for making it are freely available and modifiable. Anybody can make the drink, and anyone can modify and improve on the recipe as long as they, too, license their recipe under the GNU General Public License. The legal grounds for this are dubious however, as recipes are exempted from copyright as they are techniques, not artworks.

Although originally intended as a promotional tool to explain free software/open source software, the drink took on a life of its own and 150,000 cans were sold. The Toronto-based company Opencola founded by Grad Conn, Cory Doctorow and John Henson became better known for the drink than the software it was supposed to promote. Laird Brown, the company's senior strategist, attributes its success to a widespread mistrust of big corporations and the &quot;proprietary nature of almost everything.&quot;

== Flavoring Formula ==
* 10.0 g Food Grade Gum Arabic &lt;I&gt;(Important: Do NOT use Art Grade Gum Arabic!)&lt;/I&gt;
* 3.50 mL Orange oil
* 3.00 mL Water
* 2.75 mL Lime oil
* 1.25 mL Cassia oil
* 1.00 mL Lemon oil
* 1.00 mL Nutmeg oil
* 0.25 mL Coriander oil
* 0.25 mL Neroli oil
* 0.25 mL Lavender oil

== Concentrate Formula==
* 2.36 kg plain granulated White Table Sugar
* 2.28 L Water
* 30.0 mL Caramel color
* 3.50 tsp. 75% Phosphoric acid or Citric acid
* 2.00 tsp. Flavoring Formula
* 0.50 tsp. Caffeine (optional)

== Preparation ==

'''Flavoring:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Mix oils together in a cup. Add food-grade gum arabic, mix with a spoon. Add water and mix well. A mixer may be used for this step, mixing for 4-5 minutes. You can also transfer to a blender for this step. The mix can be kept in a sealed glass 
jar in a refrigerator or at room temperature.
Please note that this mixture will separate. The gum arabic is essential to this part of the recipe, as you are mixing 
oil and water.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Syrup:'''&lt;br /&gt;
In a one gallon container, take 5 mls of 
the Flavoring Formula, add the 75% phosphoric or citric acid. Add the water, then the sugar. While mixing, add the 
caffeine, if desired. Make sure the caffeine is completely dissolved. Then add the caramel color. Mix thoroughly.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Cola:'''&lt;br /&gt;
To finish drink, take one part syrup and add 5 parts carbonated water.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction and Important Stuff==

My name is Jeff Hankins, and I have a variety of interests, including mathematics and [http://www.homestarrunner.com www.homestarrunner.com], which is where my user name originates. As of late July 2005, I have also begun enjoying football. Although I supported the [http://www.steelers.com Steelers] during my childhood, I decided that since I only supported them because my father did, I had enough reason to turn to the [http://www.buccaneers.com Buccaneers]. I've supported the Tennessee Volunteers all my life. As for other sports, I haven't worked out who I'm going for unless the Volunteers are in it. I created the Pokémon Colosseum walkthrough and finally finished it. By the way, I managed to catch a shiny Pokémon other than Red Gyarados! I really am excited about this. Also, it turns out that Wikipedia was founded on my birthday. I turned 15 that day.

By the way, I will not be editing Wikibooks from July 16, 2005 to August 1, 2005, which means that I should be able to get back to editing on August 2. Do not take this as a reason not to edit any pages that I have created. If something needs to be changed, change it, but please make sure that all changes are appropriate.

As an update, I may do some edits beginning July 24, 2005, but I won't be able to edit nearly as often as usual until August 2, 2005. I hope to be well on my way to adminship.

== Interesting note ==

One time, for the Games bookshelf, I suggested that a Sports section should be included. Seeing that there is a Sports section now, I see that someone has taken my idea to heart.

== No MGS2 guide? ==

It's amazing that there isn't a guide for this game. I think that such a guide would be a good thing to add to Wikibooks, considering that there are already plenty of guides and a guide satisfies the criterion for being on Wikibooks because it is basically a manual.

== German language wikibook ==

The German language wikibook is a great wikibook. I can't believe how much time and effort has been put into it. Anyone who says that Wikibooks isn't going anywhere should check that book out.</text>

== Description ==

&lt;code&gt;X'{{Ada/attribute|Last}}&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is any [[ada Programming/Subtypes|scalar subtype]] (for example integer, enumerated, real), is an [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] that represents the last value (upper bound) in the range of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;A'{{Ada/attribute|Last}}&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is an array, denotes the last index value. For more-dimensional arrays, &lt;code&gt;A'{{Ada/attribute|Last(N)}}&lt;/code&gt; denotes the last index value of the Nth dimension (N must be static).

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Int  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -1 .. 5;
 ... 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Last = Enum3);  {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Int'Last  = 5);      {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Int'Last  = 4);      {{Template:Ada/comment|Wrong!}}

== Description ==

X'Succ(Y) is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any discrete type and Y is a value of that type. This attribute represents the discrete value that has a position number of one greater than the input parameter.

The returned discrete value type is the base type of discrete type. If the input parameter is the {{Ada/attribute|Last}} value of the discrete type, then a CONSTRAINT_ERROR [[Ada Programming/Exceptions|exception]] will be raised.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);
 ...
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Succ(Enum2) = Enum3);   {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MAMBOTOC_SMALL}}

If you want to '''hide the pathway on the front page''', you simply have to wrap it in a piece of PHP code. Here is an example of the code all together:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php if ($option == &quot;com_frontpage&quot;) { } else { ?&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php mosPathWay(); ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;?php } ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This returns nothing if the variable ''option = com_frontpage'', and gives the code between the php tags if option is anything else than &quot;com_frontpage&quot;. This variable can be exchanged with other variables if that is needed, but this works with the default homepage setting in mambo.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chess piece placement puzzles are puzzles where certain pieces have to be placed on the board and satisfy certain conditions.

Chess checkmates are problems where White starts and mates in a ''clearly'' stated number of moves(or less).

Chess endgames and middlegames are problems where the number of moves is indefinite, and White (or Black) has to either win or tie , as stated by the question.

G'day all,

I removed a bunch of links to specific forms of vegan cheese and milk. I really think if we are going to mention specfic brands then we should do it in a table sinilar to the ones on wikipedia comparing different software and the like. We HAVE to stay NPOV, so we cant go around advertising this or that brand.

It is open to manipulation by companies, and it is also not international, since most of the linked brands are only avaliable in one or two countries. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 13:02, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:: (duplicate of what I put on your talk page:) I added most of those companies (some while not logged in) for the express purpose of people being able to find vegan products. These could perhaps be split off to another page, but I think it's unreasonable to eliminate them. Vegan substitute products are difficult to find and it's even more difficult to find good ones. I am curious about your thoughts on this. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:07, 17 May 2005 (UTC)
::: expanding on this: I think that having links to specific products (especially &quot;basic&quot; ones) is important with respect to veganism. Many of these basic things are prohibitively difficult, specialized, or time consuming to prepare (vegan cheese, for example) and it's unreasonable to just note that they exist without providing possibilities for people to find them (vegan substitutes like this are notoriously hard to get a hold of). I do agree that these are country specific, even region-specific, but I don't think there's a solution for this except maybe to denote that they are indeed region specific.
::: With respect to NPOV, I think that the difficulty in finding certain replacements trumps the &quot;neutrality&quot; of a non-mention. I'd like to see this software comparison table you're referring to, as this could satisfy both of our desires here. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:16, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

=== advertising ===

A while back I added a bunch of info about vegan ingredient substitutes, with specifics of brand names and links to their respective webpages [[User:The_bellman]] did some amount of purging of these with a NPOV complaint. I responded both on [[User_talk:The_bellman|his user talk page]] and the [[Talk:Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine]] page, with no replies on either. I am going to reinstate these links for the reasons I have written in both places. If somebody can think of a better format, I am open to suggestions, but I think the info itself is useful. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 02:50, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I have no problems with product recomendations.  Our NPOV policy is much looser than our big sister's, and specifying specific brand name products is common for a cookbook. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:08, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::Agree that recommendation of specific brands - particularly for tricky things like vegan substitutions - is OK. A similar thing would perhaps apply to kitchen equipment, where someone might want to suggest that Acme Food Processors are a reputed product, etc. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 17:36, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

End section copied from [[Talk:Cookbook]]

I am going to remove NPOV banner since at least 3 active contributors have no problems with reccomendations and there has been no other input for 3 months. I would like to sort out how to deal with the region-specific issues though. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 21:08, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

== Minor addition ==

I added a very small comment that some grocery store brands of Worcestershire sauce are also vegan, for the very same reason mentioned above re brand names. Not everyone may have access to, or even may have heard of, the vegan brands mentioned, and store brands are often a godsend when it comes to looking for vegan alternatives generally. I'm new to this, hope I did it right!

== As I understand it ==

As I understand it this selection should not include, or at least set off to the side, recommendations using any animal products including milk, cheese, eggs, and butter. From [[W:veganism]]... ''&quot;Veganism is the practice of eliminating the use of animal products.&quot;'' Merry Christmas! // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 02:10, 15 December 2011 (UTC)

Just wanted to say, I think this is lovely! :) [[User:JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|JonathanHopeThisIsUnique]] ([[User talk:JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|contribs]]) 19:20, 3 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preterite (Simple Past) Tense==

This tense is used to describe an action that has happened in the past and which is now finished.

To form the preterite tense, use the following guide for regular verbs. The endings in bold can be put on the stem of the regular &quot;AR&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;IR&quot; verbs you wish to conjuagate.

----
Some background about these riddles is given on the [[Puzzles/Puzzles in science|Puzzles in science]] page. There is no strict solution to any of these puzzles. So rather than searching for a solution try to find support in favor or against the following postulates.


=== Achilles and the tortoise ===
Achilles is racing against a tortoise. Starting the race the tortoise is 10 m ahaed. However, Achilles runs 20 times faster than the tortoise which runs at 1 m/sec (or any other positive speed). Shouldn't Achilles overtake the tortoise? In fact we shall see he does not. We start with the tortoise ahead at point A and Achilles behind at point B. When Achilles reaches point B a certain amount of time has passed which allowed the tortoise to move on to point C. Again Achilles reaching point C leaves the tortoise ahaed of some positive length, ad infinitum. Therefore Achilles is not going to catch up with the tortoise which is a contradiction to the initial notion of motion.

Therefore motion does not exist. Do you agree? [[/Achilles_comment/|comment]]


Here is a variant of the above puzzle:

=== Reaching point B ===
Suppose you intend to travel from point A to point B on a straight line. In order to do that you have to reach the midpoint C between A and B. In order to reach point C you have to reach the midpoint of A and C, say D, ad infinitum. Therefore it takes you an infinite amount of finite movements to reach point B which is in contrast with the notion of constant speed.

Therefore motion does not exist. Do you agree?

=== The flying arrow ===
Suppose an arrow is being shot from a bow. At any fixed point in time the arrow is motionless at a certain point. This directly contradicts the idea of motion since at any conceivable point in time motion is not present.

Therefore motion does not exist. Do you agree?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Mr. Doyle,

I have changed the format of the headlines in the bioethics course that you are currently writing. This will allow other modules to link a section directly. It will also be possible to edit individual sections. I have also thought that you might want to link the references with the main text, in such a way that by clicking on the reference number, the browser jumps to the reference and back. This would save a lot of scrolling.([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 12:25, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC))

Dear Mr. Doyle,

I have been reading some of the recent additions to your bioethics course and have been puzzled by the fact that the section on &quot;Principlism&quot; is before the &quot;Bioethics and moral theory section&quot;. Shouldn't &quot;principlism&quot; be included in the latter section? Should &quot;utilitarianism&quot;, &quot;principlism&quot;, &quot;Equity issues in health care&quot; (and so on) be ''subsections'' of &quot;Bioethics and moral theory&quot;?

Would you like me to link the references to the main text?

Thank you very much for your attention. ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 21:12, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC))

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Djdoyle. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Djdoyle~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

{{wikibooks|God and Religious Toleration/Buddhism}}
This Wikibook is about the way and practice of Buddhism. If you believe in &quot;to know the practice by knowing the theory&quot;, then welcome to the other side of it, that is &quot;to understand and realize the theory by knowing and doing the practice&quot;. For some people, the first way might work but for other people the second might be better. 

The first way is more suited for people with deep wisdom. Seeing the theory, they can understand it. Understanding the theory, they can deduce their way of practice. People with lesser wisdom will be confused when they see the theory. Even when they are reading it, they do not understand it. However, simply stating what they should do and then practicing it is much better.

Repeating what has been written, this book
* is not about theories, but about ways of practicing
* lets people know the way of practice so that they will understand the theory
* is not tied to a particular method; instead it will try to describe several methods that are available.

==General ==

==The Five Precepts and the Eightfold Way==

==Morality ==

Morality is a quality of mind. It produces a level of calmness and happiness in oneself and produces a basic level of security in society, making it a reasonably safe place to live. Morality can be developed by following certain guidelines, IF one has the right attitude.

The first set of guidelines that a lay Buddhist (who is still interested in family life) undertakes are known as The Five Precepts. They are:

# Don't kill any living creature 
# Don't take what is not given to you 
# Don't commit sexual immorality 
# Don't speak falsely 
# Don't become intoxicated such that you lose your ability to judge properly (this includes, drugs, alcohol etc.)

The next set of guidelines that a lay Theravada Buddhist (who is losing interest in family life - they could still live at home) undertakes for shorter to longer lengths of time, are known as The Eight Precepts. The change of precept number three above and the extra precepts (6-8) are related to restraining the six senses and support the meditative practice of looking inwards for true happiness, rather than outwards for sense pleasures. They are:

# Don't kill any living creature 
# Don't take what is not given to you 
# Don't have intentional sexual activity 
# Don't speak falsely (don't lie, not even white lies) 
# Don't become intoxicated such that you loose your ability to judge properly (this includes, drugs, alcohol etc.)
# Don't eat after noon
# Don't dance, sing, play or listen to music, go to see entertainments, wear garlands, use perfumes, or beautify the body with cosmetics
# Don't use high or luxurious furniture

Novice monks of the Theravada tradition follow 10 precepts, but actually it is only one more than the eight above, because number seven above is divided into two. The 10 are:
# Don't kill
# Don't steal 
# Don't have intentional sexual activity 
# Don't speak falsely (don't lie, not even white lies) 
# Don't become intoxicated such that you loose your ability to judge properly (this includes, drugs, alcohol etc.)
# Don't eat after noon
# Don't dance, sing, play or listen to music, go to see entertainments
# Don't wear garlands, use perfumes, or beautify the body with cosmetics
# Don't use high or luxurious furniture
# Don't accept and use money

The only difference between the 8 and 10 Precepts is number 10. The last precept marks the giving up of addiction to sense pleasures. If we have money, we can buy whatever we want (depending on how much money we have, of course).

Monks and nuns follow even more precepts, many of which are specific to a monk's or nun's life in a monastery or as a wanderer. These are around 230 precepts for a monk and around 300 for a nun (it varies depending on which Buddhist tradition is being referred to).

==Concentration ==
Meditation is a part of Buddhist concentration that helps to purify karma. Devout Buddhists should meditate on a daily basis.

==Wisdom ==

Wisdom is insight into dependent origination; it's insight that believes that everything is caused and hence impermanent, based on suffering and not-self. This is seeing with insight the Four Noble Truths. This is consciousness and perception and feeling which are conjoined and inseparable from wisdom. &quot;Wisdom is to be developed and consciousness is to be understood&quot;, said the Buddha in the sutta spoken by Bhikkhuni Visakha.

==The Way of Practicing Satipatthana==

Satipatthana comes from two words; ''sati'' and ''patthana''. Sati meaning mindfulness, and patthana meaning foundation. Thus, the Satipatthana Practice is the foundation for the development of mindfulness.

==Thinking Tilakkhana==

Here are the thoughts that comply with the concept of anattā (non-self) in the [[w:Three_marks_of_existence|Tilakkhana]] (the three marks of existence in Buddhist theory):
* The thought of anger appears
* A bad action has been done

And here are the thoughts that do not comply with the concept of anattā (non-self) in the Tilakkhana.
* I am angry
* I have done a bad thing

When submitting to a broadcaster, you should check with them to ask what format they prefer.  Often, the required format is:

* DigiBeta
* 4:3 FHA (full height anamorphic)
* clocked
* colour bars for 1 minute, 30 sec clock, 3 sec black before the first frame of audio or video
* ensure that your colourspace is legal for broadcast

One possible way of configuring your timecode:
* 09 57 45 00 = Black
* 09 58 00 00 = Bars &amp; Tone
* 09 59 00 00 = Black
* 09 59 20 00 = 40 Second clock
* 09 59 57 00 = Black
* 10 00 00 00 = Programme Start
* Plus at least 1 minute of black on end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several solutions to this puzzle, but they are all quite similar.

Here's a possible one:

{{chess position|=

8 |  |bl|bl|bl|bl|bl|bl|  |=
7 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
1 |bl|bl|bl|bl|bl|bl|bl|bl|=

|40}}

==Proof of maximality==

There are 15 diagonals on the chessboard running from bottom left to top right.
They are:
*a8-a8
*a7-b8
*a6-c8
*a5-d8
*a4-e8
*a3-f8
*a2-g8
*a1-h8
*b1-h7
*c1-h6
*d1-h5
*e1-h4
*f1-h3
*g1-h2
*h1-h1

Each of these diagonals can only contain one bishop. Also, the first and last diagonals cannot both contain a bishop, since both are on the diagonal a8-h1. Therefore, we can place at most 13 bishops on the other 13 diagonals, and one bishop on those two diagonals, for a total of 14 bishops. Since 14 bishops is possible, 14 is the maximum number of bishops we can place so no two attack each other.

==Proof of maximality==

Pair up the squares of the board, demonstrated by the pairs of chess pieces on the board below.

{{chess position|=

8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
7 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
2 |ql|kd|rl|bd|  |  |  |  |=
1 |rl|bd|ql|kd|  |  |  |  |=

|40}}

Continue this pairing onto the rest of the board. On each pair of such squares, only one knight may be located. Since there are 32 such pairs, it's impossible to place more than 32 knights on the board. Since placing 32 knights is possible, 32 is the maximum number of knights that can be placed on a chessboard so no two attack each other.
