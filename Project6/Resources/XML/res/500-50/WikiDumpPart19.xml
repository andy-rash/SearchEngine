      <text xml:space="preserve">Loops are things that keep on repeating and repeating until you tell it to stop.  There are two types of loops that we'll be learning: for-loops and regular loops.

For-loops increase the value of an integer ''i'' (or anything else) by a given amount (default: 1), until it has reached its upper limit.

&lt;pre&gt;
for i : 1 .. 10 %Start with 1, end with 10, increase i by 1 (i.e. 1,2,3...10)
     put i
end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's all there is to it! Whatever's in the middle will be executed each time the loop is run.  This program will print all numbers from 1 to 10.

Now there are a few things you may have noticed.  Firstly, we haven't declared i.  Actually, you're not supposed to declare for-loop variables.  In fact, if you do, then it won't work!

What if we want to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and 103?

&lt;pre&gt;
for i : 0 .. 103 by 5
    put i
end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

Excellent! You're now a for-loop guru! Loops are pretty simple, and the syntax is almost the same.  So why would you want to use normal loops instead of for-loops? For-loops are used when you know how many times to repeat it.  However, sometimes the amount of times you repeat depends on how many lines there are in a text file.  More often, you'll want a program to loop until the user tells you to exit.  This is what we'll be doing.

&lt;pre&gt;
var word : string

loop
     put &quot;Enter any word you want, and I'll tell you what it is! (type 'exit' to exit)&quot;
     get word
     exit when word = &quot;exit&quot;

     put &quot;You entered &quot;, word
end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's pretty self explanatory.  We're getting a string from the user, and if the string is exit, then we exit.  Turing is a very easy program to use, and it avoids complicated syntax, which becomes handy in cases like this; 'exit when' means exactly that, you exit when the following case is true.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What are datafiles? Why would you need them?

Data files are simple text files that Turing can read and write from.  Sometimes, especially in contests, the data entered will be in a text file rather than the user entering it when they run the program.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to read from and write to data files.

Let's start with reading, which is used more often.  You first declare an integer variable.  This is required from Turing.  Then, you'll use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; statements to read from it.

&lt;pre&gt;
var inp : int %Turing requires this integer variable
var ctr : int := 0 %Counter variable, initial value 0
var tmp : string %Holds each line of the datafile

open : inp, &quot;INPUT.txt&quot;, get %open the file INPUT.txt for reading

loop
     exit when eof(inp) %Exit when the end-of-file is reached
     ctr += 1
     
     get : inp, tmp %Read the [ctr]th line from the data file, and store it in the string variable tmp
     put ctr, &quot;th line reads: &quot;, tmp
end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

You may have noticed &lt;code&gt;eof&lt;/code&gt; in the above code.  EOF means end-of-file, so we're telling Turing to exit the loop once it has reached the end of the file.  If you don't do this, you'll get an error because Turing will try and read past the end of the file!

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This section means to serve as an introduction to the rest of Section 3: '''Resources'''.

==== The Simple Website ====

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFFCC; border: solid 1px #99CC99; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;''Four basic things are needed for a website: '''domain name, webhost, text editor, and an ftp program'''. This will get you a basic website without pictures or any complex backend, but it is functual and can be effective all the same.''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Web development is fairly easy to learn and get into. This is mainly because it is so accessible, and because a simple website requires very little overhead or experience to create. To create a simple website, one will need to have the following:

# '''Domain Name''' - the common place the user will find your site on the World Wide Web. For example, www.yournamehere.com is a domain name. You can purchase your own domain or get a free one offered by many different online companies. Domains have come down in price drastically over recent years, and can now be found for under $10 USD.
# '''Webhost''' - this is a company that will &quot;host&quot; your domain and web pages. By &quot;uploading&quot; your &quot;data&quot;&amp;mdash;transferring the files that makeup your website&amp;mdash;to their server, you give the consumer access to your page on the Internet.
# '''Text Editor program''' and a little knowledge of '''HTML''' - HTML, or Hypert-text markup language is the most basic of the web-languages. All you really need to develop a web page is some basic knowledge of HTML and the Windows program Notepad (the Macintosh equivalent is TextEdit). A page written in this &quot;markup language&quot; can contain images, links, text formatting, etc., and its file extension is .html. After you type your page into one of these free programs (or many other pay programs), upload the file to your hosting. A user's browser will then be able to decipher the HTML.
# '''FTP Program''' - FTP stands for file transfer protocol, and is the most common method of uploading your files to your hosting. When you register a domain name and secure space online for your data, your webhost will give you an FTP user name and password. By typing these into one of the numerous [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=free+ftp+program&amp;btnG=Search free FTP programs], you can access your web space and upload your website.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFCCCC; border: solid 1px #FF9999; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''HTML''' – Hyper Text Markup Language, the most common web language, and also the simplest and easiest to learn.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''''Note''': HTML is not covered in this course, but several [[web Design/Basic HTML and CSS| HTML tutorials]] can be found online.''

==== Human Resources ====

As for the more advanced websites, a staff is usually required to maintain and keep up the site. Aside from knowledge of HTML and webspace, people may be required to do miscellaneous jobs such as graphic design, advanced coding, customer relations, network administration, etc.

==== Capital ====

Capital, varying with the complexity of the website's goals, is also needed. For a simple website run by one person, the expenses may be as small as paying for the domain and yearly hosting fees. As websites get more complex and intricate, the amount of capital increases proportionally. 

As a common sense rule, the bigger the website you want, the more people, money, and technology you're going to need. This section should serve as a guide for planning resource gathering and management, and to give you an idea of what's needed to start up and maintain a website.

==Question 1: Fractorials==
A '''fractorial''' is very similar to a factorial.  A fractorial of a n means that 1 to n over that number is a whole number.

For example, 5 fractorial is 60, because 1/60 + 2/60 + 3/60 + 4/60 + 5/60 is a whole number.

Write a program that will find the fractorial of any given number.  It should ideally get input from a data file.  Sample input will be given, and your program should not take over 2 minutes per result.

var n : int          %User input
var ctr : int := 0   %Counter variable
var gotit : boolean  %Stores if fractorial is found

get n

loop
    ctr := 0  %ctr is NEVER actually used as zero, since that would cause a division by 0 error.

    loop
        gotit := true      %Initially assume that fractorial has been found, and change to false if found otherwise
        ctr += n           %Increase counter by n
        for i : 1 .. n     %Try n/1, n/2, n/3... until n/i.  If all are whole numbers, then answer has been found
            if ctr / i not= ctr div i then
                gotit := false
            end if
        end for
        exit when gotit = true
    end loop

    if gotit = true then
        put &quot;Fractorial (&quot;, n, &quot;) = &quot;, ctr
        exit
    end if
end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

While you might try ctr += 1 initially, it will quickly become evident that this is too slow.  Through logical reasoning and some experimentation, you should be able to discover that the fractorial of n is a multiple of n.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Both computer programmers and mathematicians have quickly learned that with complicated problems, it can become near impossible to try and solve everything at the same time.  Instead, we try to reduce the problem that we know how to solve.  This can be done easily and efficiently with procedures and functions.

First, let's deal with procedures.  When you call a procedure inside a program, it jumps to that procedures, executes the code, and goes back.

''Sample procedure code coming soon''

----
You can think of functions like variables that calculate things.  They return a value when you call them, so they can be used just like variables.  This code should help you understand:

Here is a program that will print a string backwards.

&lt;pre&gt;
function flipWord (w : string) : string
    var tmp : string := &quot;&quot;

    for decreasing i : length (w) .. 1
        tmp := tmp + w (i)
    end for
    result tmp
end flipWord

%%%%%%%%%%MAIN PROGRAM%%%%%%%%%%
var word : string

put &quot;Enter word&quot;
get word : *   %bypasses token-oriented input

put flipWord (word)
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are actually a couple new things.  First, the more simple, is the word &lt;code&gt;decreasing&lt;/code&gt; in the for-loop.  This tells Turing to decrease by one.  As you can see, functions allow us to keep our main program nice and neat.  It will become imperative to use functions in larger programs, as they can get very complicated!

If you were wondering what 'token-oriented input' meant, it's just telling Turing NOT to consider space to mean that the next variable is being put in.  This allows spaces in the word variable.

----
Processes are like procedures, except they can run concurrently with other parts of your code.  This means that, if you're using a loop, your process won't stop you from doing whatever else you need.  This is especially useful in cases like playing music, where you need other code to be able to run while the music is playing.

Processes are used similarly to procedures; however, one must replace the word &lt;code&gt;procedure&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt;.  Additionally, processes cannot be started by simply calling them.  You must prefix the process name with the command &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If statements are just that.  They say, &quot;'''If''' a is true, then do the following, if not, do this instead&quot;

Here's a simple program for you that tests if someone is an adult.

&lt;pre&gt;
var age : nat %Can't have negative age

get age

if age &lt; 18 then
     put &quot;You are not an adult!&quot;
else
     put &quot;You are an adult!&quot;
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

This program is saying: &quot;Ask the user for their age.  If it's under 18, then they're not an adult.  If it's '''not''' under 18, then they are.  Note that else statements do not check if they are greater/equal to 18, they just check if they are not under 18.  This will suffice for our purposes

But what if we want to test for seniors too? This can be accomplished with an &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; statement:

&lt;pre&gt;
...
if age &lt; 18 then
     put &quot;You are not an adult!&quot;
elsif age &gt; 64 then
     put &quot;You are a senior!&quot;
else
     put &quot;You are an adult!&quot;
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is saying &quot;If they are under 18, they're not an adult.  If they're not under 18, then check if they're older than 64; if so, they are a senior.  If neither of the above cases are true, then they are an adult.

Cases are like funny if-statements.  They're pretty easy to understand, but you probably won't use them until later.  Still, they fall under the same category as if statements, so you might as well get used to them now.

== In what situations does Turing really work great ? ==

* In what situations does Turing really work great ? When would I choose Turing over some other language on the [[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf]] such as [[QBasic|Programming:QBasic]] or [[Prolog|Programming:Prolog]] or [[Python Programming]] ?
* Who uses Turing ?
* Are there any major programs written in Turing ?
* Can Turing run on my PC ?
* Can Turing run on my [[Embedded Systems/PIC ?
* How do I install the Turing compiler/interpreter/IDE on my computer ?

i0 := --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 00:20, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

:* Hi David.  Sorry for the late response. #sorrynotsorry Turing is used primarily as a learning tool, and was designed as such.  Since it was made for ease-of-use rather than speed or versatility, the only reason you might use Turing is for a simple program, or if you're just getting started with programming.
:* Mostly highschool students
:* To my knowledge, no.
:* Yes, turing runs on windows.  It also runs on linux and  mac.
:* If you can get linux on it ;)
:* Not that I know of, but I'm not sure.
:* You'll have to buy a copy from [http://www.holtsoft.com/turing/ holtsoft].  If you are a student, and your school/board has purchased a license, you can get a copy for free.
:* Under windows, installation is very simple.  I don't use it that often and I haven't used it in a while, so I'm not sure if there are any important notes for installing it on other systems.

== passing parameters ==

why is not passing parameters bad programming style? If it works without passing parameters, why not use global variables?
:The reasons may vary depending on the program.  One of the most common reasons is that your procedures/functions may ultimately be included in a library, where people using your programs will want to just pass the parameters straight to it rather than figuring out all the variable needed. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 04:23, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

== increasing and decreasing a counter by an increasing and decreasing amount?? ==

So i need to increase a value by zero, then one, then -1, 2, -2, 3, -3... and i have no idea on how to do it. i've been trying to use some variation on

&lt;pre&gt;
  loop
    counter:=counter+1
    a:=a+(-1)**counter
  end loop
&lt;/pre&gt;
but its just doing a+0 ,a-1, a+1, a-1, a+1 insdead of a+0, a-1,a+1,a-2,a+2 
HELP!

:I'm not sure I completely understand your question...wouldn't that end up just equalling 0 if you're subtracting and then adding by the same number? -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 11:58, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

It's going a+0 ,a-1, a+1, a-1, a+1 because -1**1=-1, -1**2=+1, -1**3=-1, -1**4=+1...etc.
Try:
&lt;pre&gt;
var y : int
var z : int
for x:1..10
    y:=x
    z:=x
    put &quot;a+&quot;, y 
    put &quot;a-&quot;, z
end for
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Slowing Down Your Program ==

How can I slow down the rate at which my program outputs(put) information to the screen?
Please help! Urgent!

''Answer:''
:Use '''delay(n)''', where n is the number of milliseconds you want the program to pause for.  Example: 

 delay(1000)

will make the program pause for 1 second before executing the next line. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 22:53, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== how do you skip lines ==


is there any way you could skip a line under a certain condition

Example

if x=2 &quot;now i need the computer to avoid the data from line 32 to 45&quot;

:In most cases, you can just store it to a temporary variable in those lines:
&lt;pre&gt;
var tmp : string
if x=2 then
     for i : 1 .. 14
          get : inp, tmp
     end for
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

:However, I've had cases where you can't store it to a variable at all, and I'm not sure how to get around that.  If you find out how, please post it here! :) -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 02:48, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== GOLF SIMULATION ASSIGNMENT ==

I am in grade 10, and we were just asked to make a simulation program. With variables such as wind, gravity, etc. Anyways, I've been sick for the past week or so and haven't got anything done because I dont have turing at my home. Can anyone send me a program which will simulate a golf shot? It has to have variables such as wind gravity slice and hook of the shot, and the user can enter thigns such as if he /she is a amteur or pro golfer, therefore affecting how close their shot will be to the hole. Can anyone PLEASE send me a prgram that will do this. I am in HUGE need. THANKS! my email is jamias_666@hotmail.com if u want to send me one. thank you!
  I advise you not to publish email addresses if you don't want to get spam.

== Exercises ==

How do i write a program that allows the user to input any base 10 number then outputs the number into binary?

&lt;pre&gt;
var tmp : int
var tmpc : string := &quot;&quot;

get tmp

loop
    tmpc += intstr(tmp mod 2)
    tmp := tmp div 2
    exit when tmp=0
end loop

put tmpc

for decreasing i : length(tmpc) .. 1
    put tmpc(i)..

== Making A RPG Game In Turing ==

Is it possible to make a RPG in turing? I can make a very basic battle system with hp and such. However I  want to make it so you can level up and use items and all that. With a weapon making system of some kind.
----
Turing is an extrmely limited programming tool/language, making an RPG with level ups and wepons would be extremely difficult if not impossible. This is because Turing is used mainly as a ''learning tool'' for beginner programmers to show them the basic elements of programming, a better programmming language to use would be Java maybe, or C++, I really '''do not''' recommendd the use of Turing to create a complex game such as the one you describe
----
i have made a simple(it has levels atk ect.)text based rpg but it is hard to make graphics in my game so instead i wnt for a retro look if you like doing these kind of things you should go to this website.

Of course you can make an RPG in Turing. Now, it won't be the graphical equal to Final Fantasy X, but you can make something that looks like a game from the Nintendo/Super Nintendo era without much trouble at all.

umm yee i jus wanted to know like i understand the how the loops work but i dont understand how you get the program to loop so that it starts over again if the user prompts it to like for example.. in the case such as you hav the program run then you get to the end and you loop it so it says exit program if word = no( the user says no i dont want to play again) but how do you get it to start over if the user says yes they do want to start over again ??

== Linking ==

I'm working on a turing project for school (grade 10 FTW), and I have to create a welcome screen to use in all of my programs. The problem is, I made a really nice one (atleast nice for what we've learned so far) but the code it really long. I don't want to have to copy that into the top of my program everytime. Is there a line of code that I can put into the top of each program to tell it to run the welcome screen first, then continue on to the rest of the program?

You can use include.

For example, if your welcome screen is in a file called welcome.t, you would write

include &quot;welcome.t&quot;

at the beginning of each of your assignments.

Make sure welcome.t is in the same directory as your assignment, though.

== Too many Variables. ==

Hello, while I won't tudor you, you may find it helpful to look up arrays in the turing reference. 


var sampleArray1: array 1..9,1..9 of int    %Creates an array

var sampleArray2: array 1..3,1..6 of int:   %Creates an array and assigns puts values into the array 
    =init(1,1,1,1,1,1,
    1,1,1,1,1,1,
    2,2,2,5,6,2)
sampleArray1(1,3):=6    %Assigns the integer 6 to index 1,3 of the array

:You are not using boolean properly. Rewrite (p1 = &quot;p&quot; or &quot;P&quot;) to (p1 = &quot;p&quot; or '''p1 = &quot;P&quot;'''), so the first line would be:
&lt;pre&gt;

    put &quot;\nTie game, nobody wins.&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

''Answer:''
: Not sure what is what your are trying to do in the problematic section. Mi guess is that you would need to change the problem area into the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
var allRight : boolean := true
for i :1..4
    if GUESS(i) not= ANS(i) then
       allRight := false
    end if
end for
if allRight the
    put &quot;Correct&quot;
    exit
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Polygon  ==

I' am doing this assignment and i need to move a polygon but i don't no how soo can u please tell me how. thanks soooo much


It probably has somehting to do with getch and the follow mouse procedure
try lookin those up and once you know how to use getch you will probably figure it out

== parallel port ==

How do use the parallelget function. according to my understanding its more complicated than ''parallelget(64)'' . please answer in full detail as i am in g.12. what is'''Bold text''' MOD and DIV. thanks . ALOT.
parallelget is a function with no parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
procedure PGet(var val, i0, i1, i2, i3, i4: int)
val := parallelget
i0 := (val div 64) mod 2
i1 := (val div 128) mod 2
i2 := (val div 32) mod 2 
i3 := (val div 16) mod 2
i4 := (val div 8) mod 2 
end PGet
&lt;/pre&gt;


parallelget represents an already determined number, it requires no variables and that is wht parallelget(64) doesnt do anything. use it like a variable, ex. &quot;put parallelget&quot;

== programming alphabetically ==

yeah, i need to make a program where i ask the user for two words, and then i put it in alphabetical order
i have managed to do this by just making my variables word1, and word2, then i just put :

&lt;pre&gt;
if word1 &gt; word2 then
   put word2,&quot;&quot;:2,word1
else
   put word1,&quot;&quot;:2, word2
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

in my program i did include the get statements and the variables... but i just put in the general idea i had for putting things alphabetically. The problem is, both words have to be either upper case, or lower case, i cant word1 as upper, and word2 as lower because lower case words are larger than upper even if the upper starts with &quot;Z&quot; and the lower starts with &quot;a&quot;, my program will still display after the words are inputted, Z is before a. how do i make it so it says a before Z?

== Base converter (base 2, 8, 10, 16 conversions) ==

hi!

i was wondering if i could get some help in converting numbers

i need to convert decimal, hexadecimal, binary and octal into eachother

i know that

&lt;pre&gt;
binary_out := intstr (decimal_in, 0, 2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

will change decimal_in to binary_out

and
&lt;pre&gt;
for decreasing n : length (binin) .. 1
        if binin (n) = '1' then
            decout := decout + 2 ** (length (binin) - n)
        end if
    end for
&lt;/pre&gt;
will change the number back to decimal

i am having difficulty with : binary to octal/hex, octal to decimal/binary/hex, and hex to decimal/binary/octal

please help me! thanks
==&gt; why not just convert binary string back to integer (base 10) first?  Then you can use &quot;intStr(int, 0, &lt;base&gt;) to convert to Hex or Octal string?
&lt;pre&gt;
decNumberOut := strint(binStringIn, 2)
octalString  := intstr(decNumberOut, 0, 8)
hexString    := intstr(decNumberOut, 0, 16)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== calculating tax for output ==

can anyone tell me how to make my program calculate tax? I already tried to multiply it by a number on the line itself, but my instructor does not allow it, saying it needs to be done as a variable, where after the price is inputed, you click and it calculates the tax. 

Here is the program so far 



var Name:string
var Price:int
var Total:int

put &quot;What is the item you want to buy?&quot;
get Name:* 
put &quot;How much does it cost?&quot;
get Price
put &quot;With tax, the total bill is..&quot;


well it depends how much the tax is in your area, since i don't what it is in your area, I will prompt the user to input it  just like they input the price. Below is the new program:
&lt;pre&gt;
var Name:string
var Price:int
var Total:int
var Tax : int

put &quot;What is the item you want to buy?&quot;
get Name:* 
put &quot;How much does it cost?&quot;
get Price
put &quot;How much is the tax.&quot;
get Tax 
put &quot;With tax, the total bill is..&quot;
Total := (Price * Tax) + Price
put Total
&lt;/pre&gt;
Thats it!, hope it helped

I am a grade 10 student who attends a &quot;Computer Engineering&quot; class. We have been doing Turing for a while now and we have been assigned a final project worth 30 percent of our marks. The assignment I was given is this:

You have been hired by the grade 10 Computer Science teacher to help students learn new computer terms by creating a Hangman game with the appropriate graphics. As a student enters a letter they think is in the word either a green LED light will light indicating the letter is correct or a red LED will light indicating the letter is wrong.

Peripheral: You must design and build a peripheral which will display 2 LEDs associated with attractively made designs for being correct (green) or wrong (red)

Interface: You must properly assemble a parallel port connector with 2 LEDs and insert them into the peripheral.

Now, I have created my hangman game on Turing with all of the game requirements, except for the peripheral and interface. Our teacher has not covered any of that information; therefore I don’t know how to do it.

Please, if you can explain to me or give me steps to what I should do (even a link to where I can get answers) will be very useful and very well appreciated.
Thank you!

hello i am in grade 10. I tried my best to do this but i cant we are doing some practice on chapter 6 of turing and we have to creat a quiz where it ask's for like multiple choice questions,true and false and matching.This quiz consist of 10 questions. After each question the computer must chech if the answer is correct or incorrect, and output the result as well as the number of marks earned for that question.  At the end of the test, the computer must print out the final mark for the test in 3 ways:
example:
1.A fraction
2.A percentage
3. A letter grade
If the test was a 50 percent or lower, the computer must ask if the student would like to re-write the test.  If she/he wants to, the computer must loop back to the 1st question and begin again with a blank mark.  The student can rewrite a total of 2 times
Here are the 10 questions i want to put in order to make the turing program work
Multiple choice question

1:What is another name for CPU
Here are the options of the answer
1:Microprocessor
put &quot; Yes your right&quot;
2:decode
put &quot;No try again&quot;
3:execute
put&quot;No you're wrong&quot;
4:Microchip
put &quot;Nope this is wrong sorry&quot;
So these questions i want to put into turing form
 


One question for true and false
1:Turing is a great programming language
if the statement is true then put its right
if the statement is false but its wrong

and other questions like this
Please i really need help so please tell me ASAP

''''''how do we do fill in the blank on turing like i want to draw a small line for blank and then put the statement. like _________ is my name so how do i draw the line please helppp ASAPPPPP...''''''





i need help withh this question for turing 4.1.1
Federal income tax is to be levied in stages on taxable income.On the first $27,500 you pay 17%, on the next $27,500 you pay 24%, an on the rest 29%. Write a program to read in a taxable income and compute the federal tax payable to the nearest cent. (use the current tax for the province of Ontario.)

I have a really annoying problem in my coding to create a hangman game in Turing. The problem is at the bloded and italicised part. Turing says one of the variables has no value, and I have no idea why

== How do you find the highest and lowest number from a list of numbers given  in Turing (programming)? ==

Here is the question: 
Prompt the user to input test marks. Find the average and highest and lowest marks. 

The average was easy to find but I have on idea how to get the highest and lowest marks. Our (Gr. 10) Turing class so far has covered loops, for loops, if statements, variable types: string, real, int, and other basic things. 

Anyone have any idea how to solve this, please? Thanks.</text>

In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of differentiation. Differentiation is a staple tool in calculus, which should be a fact somewhat familiar to you from studying earlier mathematics. However, the reasons as to why this is true have not always been so clearly proven. This chapter will thus also prove a simple consequence of differentiation you will be most familiar with - that is, we will focus on proving each differentiation &quot;operations&quot; that provides us a simple way to find the derivative of common functions.

==Definition==
Let us define the derivative of a function 

Given a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

We say that ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') is '''differentiable''' at ''x''=''a'' if and only if

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)-f(a) \over h}&lt;/math&gt;

exists.

The '''derivative''' of ''&amp;fnof;'' at ''a'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;

A function is said to be differentiable on a set ''A'' if the derivative exists for each ''a'' in ''A''. A function is differentiable if it is differentiable on its entire domain.

==Definition-Derived Theorems (Differentiability Implies Continuity)==

Given our definition of a derivative, it should be noted that it utilizes limits and functions. This theorem relates derivation with continuity, which is useful for justifying many of the latter theorems that will be discussed in this chapter. The proof for this theorem is simple; it requires a valid limit converging to zero to mimic the continuity definition.

{{Equation box 1|indent=:|title='''Theorem'''|equation=Given a function &amp;fnof; which is differentiable at ''a'', it is also continuous at ''a''}}

The proof for this is as follows

{| style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;
|+ '''Proof that Differentiable Functions at a are Continuous at a'''
|-
|style=&quot;height: 3.5em; width: 20em;|Differentiable definition:
| rowspan=&quot;6&quot; |&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f'(a) &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)-f(a) \over h} \\
f'(a) \cdot \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {h} &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)-f(a) \over h} \cdot \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}{h} \\
f'(a) \cdot 0 &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \cdot h} \\
0 &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)} - \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a)} \\
\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a)} &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)} \\
\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)} &amp;= f(a)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|-

| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Algebraic manipulations
|-
|
|-
|style=&quot;height: 2.5em;&quot;|The continuity definition &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}
However, the converse is not true in this case. Analyzing the proof, it is apparent that a continuous function at ''a'' does not necessarily mean that it is differentiable at ''a'' simply because it would involve removing the multiplication by 0, which is impossible given our algebraic axioms.

==Properties of Differentiation==

From this definition, we will create new properties of derivation. People familiar with Calculus should note that we are proving that the derivation of certain functions and operations are valid. These first theorems follow immediately from the definition.

===Basic Properties===
Below are the list of properties which are mentioned only for completeness, and a demonstration of how the derivation formula works.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ List of Basic Derivative
|-
| Constant Function || Given &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c, \quad f'(a)=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Identity Function || Given &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x, \quad f'(a)=1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

'''&lt;u&gt;Constant Function&lt;/u&gt;'''

Suppose a constant function ''&amp;fnof;'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=c \quad\forall x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. This function will always have a derivative of 0 for any real number.

Given the derivation definition, we have

&lt;math&gt;f'=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)-f(a) \over h}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of the function, we can substitute the function for c, as such

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f'&amp;=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {c-c \over h} \\
  &amp;=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {0 \over h} \\
  &amp;=0 \\
&amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Identity Function&lt;/u&gt;'''

Suppose an identity function ''&amp;fnof;'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x \quad\forall x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. This function will always have a derivative of 1 for any real number.

Given the derivation definition, we have

&lt;math&gt;f'=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)-f(a) \over h}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of the function, we can substitute the function for its input, as such

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f'&amp;=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {a+h-a \over h} \\
  &amp;=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {h \over h} \\
  &amp;=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {1} \\
  &amp;=1 \\
&amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Algebraic Properties===
Suppose two functions f and g that are differentiable at a, these following properties apply

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ List of Derivatives for Algebraic Operations
|-
| Addition || &lt;math&gt;(f+g)'(a) =  f'(a) + g'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Subtraction || &lt;math&gt;(f-g)'(a) =  f'(a) - g'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Product || &lt;math&gt;(fg)'(a) = f'(a)g(a) + f(a)g'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Multiple of a Function || &lt;math&gt;(\lambda f)'(a) = \lambda \cdot g'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Reciprocal || &lt;math&gt;\left( \dfrac{1}{f} \right)'(a) = -\dfrac{f'(a)}{f^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Division || &lt;math&gt;\left( \dfrac{f}{g} \right)'(a) = \dfrac{f'(a)g(a) - f(a)g'(a)}{g^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

We will individually prove each one below

'''&lt;u&gt;Addition&lt;/u&gt;'''

This proof essentially creates the definition of differentiation from the two functions that make up the overall function.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(f+g)'(a) &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {(f+g)(a+h)-(f+g)(a) \over h} \\
          &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {(f(a+h)+ g(a+h))-(f(a)+g(a)) \over h} \\
          &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \left( {f(a+h) - f(a) \over h} + {g(a+h) - g(a) \over h} \right) \\
          &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h) - f(a) \over h} + \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {g(a+h) - g(a) \over h} \\
          &amp;= f'(a) + g'(a) \\
          &amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Subtraction&lt;/u&gt;'''

We will not write out a rigorous proof for subtraction, given that it can be done mentally by imagining a negated &lt;math&gt;g(a)&lt;/math&gt; function or retracing the addition proof with subtraction instead.

'''&lt;u&gt;Product&lt;/u&gt;'''

This proof works similarly to the previous proof, except that this proof requires the addition of extra terms which zero out when added together. This is a normal algebraic trick in order to derive theorems, which will be further used in the latter theorems in this chapter.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(fg)'(x) &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)g(a+h)-f(a)g(a) \over h} \\
         &amp;\text{next, we introduce the } f(a)g(a+h) \text{ term into the statement} \\
         &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)g(a+h)-f(a)g(a+h)+f(a)g(a+h)-f(a)g(a) \over h} \\
         &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {g(a+h)(f(a+h)-f(a))+f(a)(g(a+h)-g(a)) \over h} \\
         &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)-f(a) \over h}\lim_{h \rightarrow 0}{g(a+h)}
            + \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a)} \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {g(a+h)-g(a) \over h} \\
         &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h)-f(a) \over h} g(a+h)
            + f(a) \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {g(a+h)-g(a) \over h} \\
         &amp;= f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) \\
         &amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Product of a Constant&lt;/u&gt;'''

For this proof, we will present it using two different methods.

The first method requires only the limit theorem that a constant multiple is equivalent to the limit being multiplied by the constant.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\lambda f)'(a) &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} { \lambda f(a+h) - \lambda f(a) \over h} \\
                &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} { \lambda \left( \dfrac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \right)} \\
                &amp;= \lambda \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(a+h) - f(a) \over h} \\
                &amp;= \lambda f'(x) \\
                &amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second proof requires applying the product rule and constant function for differentiation.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\lambda f)'(a) &amp;= g'(x)f(x) + g(x)f'(x) \\
                &amp;= 0 \cdot f(x) + \lambda f'(x) \\
                &amp;= \lambda f'(x) \\
                &amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Reciprocal&lt;/u&gt;'''

Like the other proofs before, this one will also invoke the definition at a certain point to simplify the statement into a concise, memorizable format.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left( \dfrac{1}{f} \right)'(a) &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\dfrac{1}{f(a+h)}-\dfrac{1}{f(a)} \over h} \\
                                &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\dfrac{f(a)-f(a+h)}{h \cdot f(a+h)f(a)}} \\
                                &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\dfrac{f(a)-f(a+h)}{h} \cdot \dfrac{1}{f(a+h)f(a)}} \\
                                &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {-\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}} \cdot \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\dfrac{1}{f(a+h)f(a)}} \\
                                &amp;= -f'(a) \cdot \dfrac{1}{f(a)f(a)} \\
                                &amp;= -\dfrac{f'(a)}{[f(a)]^2} \\
                                &amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Division&lt;/u&gt;'''

This proof borrows the reciprocal proof and the multiplication proof to form an easy to follow rationale.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left( \dfrac{f}{g} \right)'(a) &amp;= \left(f \cdot \dfrac{1}{g} \right)'(a) \\
                                &amp;= f'(a)\left(\dfrac{1}{g(a)} \right) + {f(a) \over g'(a)} \\
                                &amp;= f'(a)\left(\dfrac{1}{g(a)} \right) + f(a)\left(-\dfrac{g'(a)}{[g(a)]^2} \right) \\
                                &amp;= \dfrac{f'(a)}{g(a)} - \dfrac{f(a)g'(a)}{[g(a)]^2} \\
                                &amp;= \dfrac{f'(a)g(a)}{[g(a)]^2} - \dfrac{f(a)g'(a)}{[g(a)]^2} \\
                                &amp;= \dfrac{f'(a)g(a)-f(a)g'(a)}{[g(a)]^2} \\
                                &amp;\blacksquare
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Chain Rule (Function Composition Theorem)===

Given two functions f and g such that f is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;g(a)&lt;/math&gt; and g is differentiable at a, then &lt;math&gt; (f \circ g)'(a) = f' \circ g(a) \cdot g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Proof Part 1&lt;/u&gt;'''

Unlike the previous properties, the chain rule will quickly become problematic and will definitely require an external theorem outside of algebraic manipulations to solve. To illustrate why a new theorem is required, we will begin to prove the Chain Rule though algebraic manipulations, point out the road block, then create a lemma to guide us around the issue, and thus figure out a proof. We begin with the following statements:

&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)'(x) = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over y-x}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over g(y)-g(x)}{g(y)-g(x) \over y-x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{y \rightarrow x} {f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over g(y)-g(x)}\lim_{y \rightarrow x}{g(y)-g(x) \over y-x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = f'(g(x))g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;


The problem is that &lt;math&gt;g(y) - g(x)&lt;/math&gt; may be zero at points arbitrarily close to x, and therefore &lt;math&gt;{f(g(y))-f(g(x)) \over g(y)-g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; would not be continuous at these points.  Thus we apply a clever lemma as follows:

====Caratheodory's Lemma====
Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;\phi :\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies

&lt;math&gt;(x-c)\phi (x)=f(x)-f(c)\forall x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Proof&lt;/u&gt;'''

(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; and define function &lt;math&gt;\phi :\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;\phi (x)=\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\neq c&lt;/math&gt; and 

&lt;math&gt;\phi (c)=f'(c)&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous and that it satisfies the required condition.

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)
Let &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous function satisfying &lt;math&gt;(x-c)\phi (x)=f(x)-f(c)\forall x\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

For all &lt;math&gt;x\neq c&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)=\tfrac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\phi (c)=\lim_{x\to c}\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt;, that is,

&lt;math&gt;\phi (c)=\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}&lt;/math&gt; which implies that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Proof Part 2&lt;/u&gt;'''

Let &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;c\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;d=g(c)&lt;/math&gt;

Let the domain of f be a subset of the image of g.

Then,
# &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'(c)=f'(g(c))g'(c)&lt;/math&gt;

Caratheodory's Lemma implies that there exist continuous functions &lt;math&gt;\phi ,\gamma :\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x-c)\gamma (x)=g(x)-g(c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g(x)-g(c))\phi (g(x))=f(g(x))-f(g(c))&lt;/math&gt; 

Now, consider the function &lt;math&gt;\eta (x)=\phi (g(x))\gamma (x)&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, &lt;math&gt;\eta (x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. 

Also, it satisfies &lt;math&gt;(x-c)\eta (x)=(f\circ g)(x)-(f\circ g)(c)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by Caratheodory's Lemma, &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'(c)=\eta (c)=f'(g(c))g'(c)&lt;/math&gt;

We will first revise some important concepts of Linear Algebra that are of importance in Multivariate Analysis. The reader with no background in Linear Algebra is advised to refer the book [[Linear Algebra]]. 

==Vector Space==
A set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''Vector Space''' over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if and only if operations ''addition'' and ''scalar multiplication'' are defined over it so as to satisfy for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2},\ldots\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_1,c_2\in F&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(i)''Commutativity'':&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2}=\mathbf{v_2}+\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(ii)''Associativity'':&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2})+\mathbf{v_3}=\mathbf{v_1}+(\mathbf{v_2}+\mathbf{v_3})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(iii)''Identity'':There exists &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0}\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{0}=\mathbf{v_1}=\mathbf{0}+\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(iv)''Inverse'':There exists &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{v_1}\in\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+(-\mathbf{v_1})=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(v):&lt;math&gt;c\mathbf{v_1}+c\mathbf{v_2}=c(\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(vi)&lt;math&gt;c_1\mathbf{v}+c_2\mathbf{v}=(c_1+c_2)\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(vii)&lt;math&gt;c_1(c_2\mathbf{v_1})=c_2(c_1\mathbf{v_1})=(c_1c_2)\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Members of a vector space are called &quot;Vectors&quot; and those of the field are called &quot;Scalars&quot;. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all polynomials etc. are examples of vector spaces

A set of linearly independant vectors that spans the vector space is said to be a '''Basis''' for the vector space.

==Linear Transformations==
Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; be vector spaces.

Let &lt;math&gt;T:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a '''Linear transformation''' if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1},\mathbf{v_2}\in X&lt;/math&gt;,

(i)&lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2})=T(\mathbf{v_1})+T(\mathbf{v_2})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(ii)&lt;math&gt;T(c\mathbf{v_1})=cT(\mathbf{v_1})&lt;/math&gt;


As we will see, there are two major ways to define a 'derivative' of a multivariable function. We first present the seemingly more straightforward way of using &quot;Partial Derivatives&quot;.

==Directional and Partial Derivatives==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with respect to vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}\in\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}+h\mathbf{y})-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a})}{h}=\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; and is written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}'(\mathbf{a};\mathbf{y})&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector, the derivative is said to be a partial derivative. Here we will explicitly define partial derivatives and see some of their properties. 


Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real multivariate function defined on an open subset &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; f: \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;.

Then the ''partial derivative'' at some parameter &lt;math&gt; (x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the ''coordinate'' &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the following limit
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {f(x_1,\ldots,x_i+h,\ldots,x_n)-f(x_1,\ldots,x_i,\ldots,x_n) \over h} = { \partial f \over \partial x_i } &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''differentiable'' at this parameter &lt;math&gt; (x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt; if
the difference &lt;math&gt; f(x_1,...,x_i+h,...,x_n)-f(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt; is 
equivalent up to first order in ''h'' to a linear form ''L'' (of h), that is
:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1,...,x_i+h,...,x_n)-f(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_n) = L\times h + o(\|h\|).&lt;/math&gt;

The linear form ''L'' is then said to be the ''differential'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;, and is written as &lt;math&gt; Df|_{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)} &lt;/math&gt; or sometimes 
&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;,
by linearity we can write
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}f={\partial f \over \partial x_1}\mathrm{d} x_1+\ldots+
                                    {\partial f \over \partial x_n}\mathrm{d} x_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''continuously differentiable'' if its differential is defined at any 
parameter in its domain, and if the differential is varying continuously relative
to the parameter &lt;math&gt; (x_1,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;, that is if it coordinates (as a 
linear form) &lt;math&gt; \partial f \over \partial x_1 &lt;/math&gt; are varying continuously.

In case partial derivatives exists but &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not differentiable, and sometimes
not even continuous ''exempli gratia''
:&lt;math&gt; f:(x,y)\mapsto {(xy)^2\over (x^2+y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;
(and &lt;math&gt; f(0,0)=0 &lt;/math&gt;) we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''separably differentiable''.

==Total Derivatives==
The total derivative is important as it preserves some of the key properties of the single variable derivative, most notably the assertion differentiability implies continuity

Let &lt;math&gt;f:A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a &lt;u&gt;linear transformation&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a}):\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''derivative'' or ''total derivative'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;,  such that 

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\| \mathbf{h} \| \to 0}\frac{\| f(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h})-f(\mathbf{a})-\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{h}) \|}{\| \mathbf{h} \|}=0&lt;/math&gt;

One should read &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{h})&lt;/math&gt; as the linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a})&lt;/math&gt; applied to the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes it is customary to write this as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{h})&lt;/math&gt;.


===Theorem===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an open set and &lt;math&gt;f:A\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable on A.  Think of writing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in components so &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=(f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n),\ldots,f_m(x_1,\ldots,x_n))&lt;/math&gt;. Then the partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; exist, and the matrix representing the linear transformation  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the standard bases of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Jacobian Matrix:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}  \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

NOTE:  This theorem requires the function to be differentiable to begin with.  It is a common mistake to assume that if the partial derivatives exist then this would imply that the function is differentiable because we can construct the Jacobian matrix.  This however is completely false.  Which brings us to the next theorem:

===Theorem===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an open set and &lt;math&gt;f:A\to \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;.  Think of writing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in components so &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=(f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n),\ldots,f_m(x_1,\ldots,x_n))&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt; exists  and is continuous on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j\in \{1,\ldots, m \}&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;i\in \{1,\ldots,n \}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.   


This theorem gives us a nice criteria for a function to be differentiable.</text>

[[image:GENtle_auto_annotate.png|thumb|The automatic annotation dialog.]]
The '''automatic annotation''' feature can search a database of standard vectors (included with the GENtle package), and (optionally) a user-generated database, for feature sequences that are found in the currently opened DNA sequence. Recognized features are then annotated in the current sequence.

Invoked through ''Edit/Auto-annotate sequence'' or &lt;tt&gt;F9&lt;/tt&gt;, a dialog opens, offering various settings:
* Whether or not to search the common vectors database
* Whether or not to use a user-generated database (and, if so, which one)
* Whether or not to reduce the number of generated features (recommended; otherwise, a lot of features are annotated)
* Whether or not to add unrecognized open reading frames as features</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The cold call ==
Cold calls are telephone calls to anyone that you do not know and have not spoken with before. We often make cold calls to try to establish business contacts; to get a job, find a new client, seek someone else’s services, or initiate any other business relationship. Following are some tips on how to make effective cold calls. 


== Planning the call: Establish your objectives &amp; prepare the conversation ==
Plan your call. This requires a conscious effort to sit down, think, and plan out what it is you want to achieve with the call. After you determine your goals, go over them in your mind until they are very clear to you. 

Then, imagine how a conversation might be with the person or business that you plan to call. Rehearse it in your mind and get ready to give a quick and confident presentation of your ideas. Prepare yourself so that you do not stutter or hesitate; you should know exactly what it is you want to say, and be able to say it backwards and forwards. Decide how you want the conversation to flow.

General goals to have for a cold call are to establish contact. You will want the person to remember you the next time you call, and have positive feelings towards you. Plan for the call to be as short as possible and focus on setting up an appointment. All negotiation or in-depth talking should take place later, when you are with the other party in person.

== Just before the call: Prepare your mind and body for a positive attitude ==
You may not realize it, but the position of your body influences how your mind works, what hormones are flowing through your veins, and ultimately, how others perceive you. This is true when you talk with someone face to face as well as over the phone. The reason is that your physical state affects your mental state: your thinking, your attitude, and your voice. Remember that your voice is your only tool to communicate your ideas over the telephone. How can you prepare your body? Make the call sitting down in a chair and leaning slightly forward. This puts you in a state for a positive attitude. Then smile. The person on the other end of the line will be able to hear it.
Making the call: Be brief, be polite
When you are duly prepared, pick up the phone and dial. Identify yourself confidently by name and ask if the person has a moment to take your call. It is possible that the person is in a meeting or is otherwise unable to talk with you at the moment, even if they answered your call. Be considerate and allow them to end the call immediately if needed. 

Remember to be as brief as possible when calling. Your goal is not to chat up anyone, but rather establish contact and a specific time to meet. The person you are calling is a busy professional who would much rather be doing something productive than chewing the fat with strangers cold-calling them on the phone.

== Ending the call: Finish with definite goals &amp; confirm information ==
The end of the call is a time to be very concrete and confirm the next steps that you will take. Ideally this will mean an appointment to meet with the person you called. If the person is too busy to speak with you , set a specific time for you to call them back, for example five minutes, an hour, two days. If the time is excessively large, this is a clear signal that the person really has little interest in speaking with you. If you have set up an appointment, repeat the time and date, so there is no confusion. 

When you say goodbye, do so quickly and confidently, thank the person for their time and repeat your name. It is possible that even in a short call the person has forgotten your name, and repeating it helps avoid awkwardness, and helps assure that they will remember it next time as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Don't go for what looks easy or flashy ==
Do something that you know well, where you have experience and are an expert. You should thoroughly understand all of the issues related to the activity.

Sometimes people can be tempted to do something that looks simple to start and deal with. The fact is that in any activity that you can imagine there are many things that are impossible to predict until they come up:

a)	Certain unexpected situations&lt;br&gt;
b)	Once in the situation, how to deal with it

You will need to plan to be effective, and you can´t plan what you don´t know. You can react to the unexpected but usually, that is an easy way to get in trouble.


== Start slowly ==
In the beginning of your business try, if you can, to deal with it as a side-line, so you are not depending on it for an income. That way you will only risk time, effort and maybe little money as you begin to test your idea in the real world, and learn a lot from it.

If things are going well pehaps it is the moment to move forward and be very conscious of the consecuences of your decisions. That will help you a lot in the future, when you will have to make decisions that may imply risks. Experience is the most powerful tool that  you can rely on in this situation. 

A gradual transition will allow you to think, plan, execute without risk and see and work on potential problems that perhaps you woulden´t realize from the beginning.

== Build your network ==
Relations will help you in the beginning of your operations, and in countries like Mexico contacts are the main source of opportunities to make business.

There are many methods to develop a business network, and it depends on your capability to invest some money to obtain results. In the beginning the best practice is to establish contacts on a one-to-one basis. This means that you should approach your contacts to offer them some benefits if they are able to offer you potential business opportunities. This doesn´t mean an attempt to bribe them (at least not necesarily), but instead you can offer your complete help to obtain results oriented to their positioning in their field of action. An example of this is to offer your organization as manpower to solve some of their concerns without any additional charge if in exchange you can get the opportunity to show your abilities and results. It is very good to develop a “partnership” relation with people that know you and is aware of your efforts to create your company.

Another way to do this, but much more expensive is to organize (and therefore to pay for) some events (business breakfast, perhaps) in which you will have the opportunity to present your products or services, and after your presentation provide some brochures to the audience, and most important, to collect data from them in order to establish further contact on one to one basis again, to work on those issues that have interested them more.

Those things mentioned above would allow you to keep in contact with the people that can provide you business opportunities. For instance, once you have identified a group of executives that would represent a solid network, you can invite them to some periodic events in which they will have opportunity to keep contact among themselves (to establish their own network), and also receive information about topics that should be very interesting for them in their activity (products or services presentations, some recognized speaker... etc.). Doing that three times a year will provide you reasons to be in contact with them and take advantage of that  to expect the chance to be in the right place in the right moment.


== Expect the unexpected ==
Reality will show you all those things that you didn´t consider in your previous planning activity. Yes, shit happens, and Murphy is relentless. Be prepared and deal with it, whatever,  without hessitation and tune up your reaction abilities. That will protect you until you get the experience to know in advance what will happen according to the signs that always appear to trained eye.

Warum darf man Hitler in »Der Untergang« nicht sterben sehen? Kritische Anmerkungen zu einem Film ohne Haltung

Von Wim Wenders
  
 
 Vorgeschichte: In aller Herrgottsfrühe am Montag, dem 20. September, in Frankfurt gelandet. Durch den Regen nur die Lichter auf der Autobahn zu sehen. Dann müde Gesichter in den Gängen und auf den Rolltreppen. Die übliche mürrische Passkontrolle. Schließlich auch Zeitungen. Und beim Warten auf den Anschlussflug als erste Neuigkeit aus Deutschland: In Sachsen hat die NPD gerade fast zehn Prozent der Wählerstimmen erhalten. Aber in keiner der ausliegenden deutschen Zeitungen irgendein Bild, das zu dieser Partei oder ihren Repräsentanten gehören würde. Erst auf der Titelseite der Financial Times (klar, mit Zeigefinger!) dann ein Konterfei von einem »Herrn Apfel«, der sich da triumphierend durch eine Menschenmenge schiebt. War es richtiger, so einen Mann nicht zu zeigen? 

Später, im Taxi. »Haben gewählt, sind selber schuld!«, sagt der Fahrer. Im Radio gratulieren alle Politiker ihren Parteien zum Sieg und echauffieren sich anschließend pflichtgemäß über die rechte Pest. Ich sehe das anders. Zumindest weiß man hierzulande, woran man ist. Jeder Zehnte in Sachsen hat also irgendwie die Schnauze voll und blickt nicht mehr durch. Auch zur Wahl der Antidemokraten hat er das Recht. Trotzdem, nein, gerade deswegen bestätigt mir mein »Heimatland« so seine demokratische Voraussetzung, auch wenn es gerade sehr um sein Selbstverständnis kämpft. In der amerikanischen »Wahlheimat«, aus der ich gerade komme, muss ich daran zweifeln, gerade weil man sich da der demokratischen Mission so (selbst)sicher ist. 

Später am Abend erst sieht man auch im Fernsehen die Rechten. Die feiern hinter verschlossenen Türen, aber ein Kameramann vom MDR hat wohl sein Mikro durch einen Fensterspalt geschoben. Man sieht die Rücken von ein paar Biertrinkern und hört eine heisere Stimme im Off: »Wir sind keine Partei wie alle anderen Parteien. Wir sind gegen alle anderen Parteien. Und wir wollen auch mit niemandem zusammenarbeiten, um das System zu verbessern. Wir wollen das System abschaffen.« Oder so ähnlich. Das Ende ging in grölendem Beifall unter. Da sitze ich also, mit meinem amerikanischen Hochverdruss und meinem deutschen Willkommensgruß. 

Was tun, wenn man so lange weg war, wenn nicht ins Kino gehen und nachholen? Habe ja viel verpasst. Vor allem den deutschen Start des »Hitler-Films«, von dem ich in der Ferne nur gelesen habe. Der Untergang, denke ich, wird also der große deutsche Film über das Ende des Nationalsozialismus sein, über das Ende der Herrschaft faschistischer Ideen in diesem Land. Gerade das Richtige, zum richtigen Zeitpunkt. Ich geh also rein.

Nach dem Kinobesuch ein tiefes Erschrecken über etwas, was ich nur »Verharmlosung« nennen kann. Ich schreibe mir meine Eindrücke in einer langen Nacht von der Seele, kann wegen meines Jet-Lags ohnehin nicht schlafen. Aber in den Tagen darauf zögere ich, den Text zu veröffentlichen. Die ganze Sache scheint ja auch schon zur Genüge diskutiert worden zu sein. Warum also auch noch meinen Senf dazugeben? 

Zeit vergeht. Ich rede mit Leuten. Viele sind »beeindruckt«, andere nicht, wissen aber nicht recht, warum. Mein Unbehagen angesichts des Untergangs wächst, wird zu Ärger. Ich halte mitten in anderer Arbeit inne, um Dinge aufzuschreiben, die mir nachträglich erst klarer werden. Ich lese das eine oder andere nach, was so gesagt und geschrieben worden ist, und in mir kocht es über. Ich will überprüfen, was mir da so auf den Geist gegangen ist. Vielleicht habe ich mich ja auch getäuscht…


Geschichte: Bei mir um die Ecke wirbt ein großes Plakat für einen Film namens Resident Evil. Ich radle jeden Tag daran vorbei. Hat nicht dieses »Einheimische Böse« irgendwas mit meinem Zorn zu tun, denke ich, wäre »Das Übel, das bei uns wohnt« nicht auch ein Titel, eine Art Metapher für den Faschismus? Unsere Zukunft liegt in ihren Händen steht da auch noch als Unterzeile. Ich beschließe, beide Filme hintereinander anzuschauen. Sie laufen im selben Cineplex.

Es ist nicht ungefährlich, heute ins Kino zu gehen. Was mir da Gruseliges um die Ohren fliegt, als ich im dunklen Saal meinen Platz suche, ist, so stellt sich raus, bloß der Vorfilm zum neuen Exorzisten. Aber dann kommt es noch viel ärger, der Trailer zu Alien versus Predator nämlich, und da fühle ich mich schon arg gebeutelt. Warum muss man so einen hohen Preis zahlen, bevor man einen Film sehen kann? Dann der Vorfilm für The Forgotten, in dem es offensichtlich darum geht, dass man Menschenleben ungeschehen machen kann. Menschen sterben, aber so, als hätten sie nie gelebt. Sie lösen sich in nichts auf, mitsamt ihrer Geschichte. Mir wird erst jetzt, beim Schreiben, plötzlich klar, wie ich da auf die Begegnung mit Hitler vorbereitet worden bin, ohne dass ich’s gemerkt und sicherlich auch ohne dass das jemand so gewollt hätte, außer dass es eben die heutige »Kinolandschaft« so will.


In diese Landschaft hinein hat ein deutscher Produzent zwei Filme gesetzt, Bernd Eichinger nämlich, auf den ich große Stücke halte. Er zeichnet auch als Executive Producer für Resident Evil, der laut der Branchenzeitschrift Variety in den USA höchst erfolgreich ist, während Der Untergang hierzulande die Kinos füllt. Eichingers Erfolg freut mich im Prinzip erst einmal. 

Während Resident Evil in der Zukunft spielt, liegt Der Untergang, wie jeder weiß, knapp 60 Jahre weit zurück. Beide laufen aber jetzt, in der Gegenwart, wo ich im Sony-Center in Berlin sitze, in der Stadt, die man in dem einen Film untergehen sieht und die im anderen durchaus der fiktiven Stadt »Raccoon« ähnelt. Resident Evil hätte jedenfalls durchaus ein relevanter Film über den Faschismus werden können, was er womöglich auch ansatzweise ist. Es geht darin um ein weltbeherrschendes Imperium, um Biowaffen und Gehirnwäsche und darum, dass Tote wieder auferstehen und die Lebenden auffressen. Eine Frau namens Alice (Milla Jovovich), halb geklont, aber das Herz auf dem rechten Fleck, hilft höchst heroisch den wehrlosen Menschen, sich sowohl gegen die toten Zombies als auch gegen die böse Corporation zu behaupten. Deren biogenetische Experimente zielen auf die Schaffung einer idealen Menschenrasse, aber ein Fehler im Programm hat wohl die Toten auf den Weg gebracht. So viel hanebüchenen Schwachsinn zusammenzufassen fällt einem echt schwer. Ein Machwerk, will man’s schnell abtun und zum Werk übergehen, das Der Untergang dagegen wohl ist, wenn nicht ein »Meisterwerk«, wie so oft zu lesen war. Ich sehe den Film also ein zweites Mal. Worum es mir dabei vor allem geht, ist, herauszufinden, welche erzählerische Position er eigentlich vertritt. Zu dieser Frage hatten sich meine Zweifel und zuletzt mein Zorn zugespitzt. 

Ich muss kurz einschieben, dass ich eine Vorgeschichte zu dem Thema habe. Vor 27 Jahren habe ich, ebenfalls in der ZEIT, das einzige Mal mit Wut im Bauch über einen Film geschrieben, über den Hitler-Film ebenjenes Professors Joachim C. Fest nämlich, dessen Vorlage diesmal zum Untergang geführt hat. Sein damaliger Film war zwar ein »Dokumentarfilm« gewesen, der aber den in meiner Sicht unverzeihlichen Fehler begangen hatte, zu glauben, dass man aus Nazibildern und Propagandamaterial nur durch den bloßen Kommentar einen »umgepolten«, distanzierten Film machen könnte. Ich habe darin damals eine bodenlose Arroganz gesehen oder zumindest ein völliges Missverständnis dessen, was Kino kann und was es nicht kann. Die Kraft dieser infektiösen Bilder war jedenfalls einfach stärker als die dagegen schwächliche Stimme des Historikers, dessen »Erzählhaltung« mir zudem noch äußerst dubios erschien. 

Nun hat der kluge Mann also ein Buch über die letzten zwölf Tage des »Dritten Reiches« geschrieben, das zum Film Der Untergang geführt hat. Eine weitere Quelle, wie man zur Genüge weiß, waren die Aufzeichnungen von Hitlers letzter Sekretärin Traudl Junge. Die Kompetenz des Geschichtsprofessors, gepaart mit der Authentizität der Zeitgenossin, das kann ja nur zu einem großen Wahrheitsanspruch führen. Und mit ebendiesem tritt der Film auch an. »Wir wissen, wovon wir reden!«

Aber wenn man etwas erzählen will, reicht es nicht, zu wissen, wovon man erzählt, dann muss man auch dazu stehen, wie und aus welcher Sicht man es erzählt. Die letzten beiden Fragen hat man sich beim Machen dieses Films auf verheerende Weise nicht gestellt, oder, noch schlimmer, man ist ihnen vielleicht sogar bewusst ausgewichen.


Betrachten Sie nur den Anfang. Ein Mann sucht eine Sekretärin, und nicht nur irgendwer, nein »der Führer« höchstpersönlich! Die Kandidatinnen kommen bei Nacht und Nebel an, klar, es ist Krieg, sitzen dann in einer Reihe im Warteraum und sind aufgeregt. Alle schauen sie schließlich auf die sich öffnende Tür (und wir im Publikum mit ihnen), und dann tritt, höchst kinowirksam aufgebaut, Hitler auf. Da ist er! Der Mann ist ungemein freundlich und umgänglich, interessiert sich eigentlich nur dafür, woher die Damen alle kommen, und wählt schließlich die hübscheste aus, die (natürlich) aus München kommt. Er bittet zum Diktat, »tja, dann wollen wir mal«. Gnädig verzeiht er ihr, dass sie wohl nicht so gut tippen kann. Bald darauf kommt Fräulein Junge (anscheinend niedergedrückt, hat sie nicht gerade alles verpatzt?) aus seinem Zimmer, alle anderen schauen sie gespannt an, und: Sie verkündet freudestrahlend, dass sie den Job hat. Die Mitbewerberinnen freuen sich mit ihr und fallen ihr um den Hals, und der heutige Kinobesucher auch. Der hat sich gerade, ob er will oder nicht, mit der netten und liebenswerten Traudl identifiziert. Und wird das die nächsten zwei Stunden über so tun. In Der Untergang sieht man vieles aus ihrer Sicht. Es ist die Perspektive einer unschuldigen jungen Person, die in Nürnberg ebendeshalb wohl freigesprochen worden wäre. Daran wäre auch eigentlich nichts auszusetzen. Aber in seinem letzten Satz, von der erwachsenen echten Frau Junge gesprochen, wird sich der Film von dieser naiven Sicht distanzieren, weil es nämlich »keine Entschuldigung ist, dass man jung ist, dass man auch Dinge hätte erfahren können«. Sie sagt sogar: »Es fällt mir schwer, mir das zu verzeihen.« 

Aber teilt der Film diese Einsicht, und wie teilt er diesen Sinneswandel mit? Er erzählt ausschließlich aus der naiven Sicht der jungen Traudl, die Reflexion der alten Frau Junge hängt er nur kurz hintendran. Selbst daran wäre womöglich nichts auszusetzen, wenn Der Untergang »ihr Film« geworden wäre. Aber genau das ist er nicht. Er ist ja auch noch der Film des Geschichtsprofessors, aus dessen Sicht wir einige andere Szenen des Films sehen, bei denen Traudl nicht dabei sein darf. In diesen Szenen treten all die Herrschaften des Naziregimes auf, dass einem nur so der Kopf schwirrt (gut, dass es auf der Web-Seite das »Who is who des Führerbunkers« gibt). Es kommen die Schlachtpläne auf den Tisch, es werden Lageberichte zitiert. Es sind Szenen, die sich als Sprachrohr der »Geschichte« geben, in denen ein unerbittliches »So war es und nicht anders!« mitschwingt, eben die Sicht des Herrn Fest. Der muss es ja wissen, der hat ja das Buch geschrieben. 

Gegen dieses Buch gibt es auch nichts einzuwenden. Es reiht sich ein in Tausende anderer Bücher über das »Dritte Reich«. Es trägt die Handschrift des Historikers. Aber die lässt sich nicht so einfach von Buchseiten auf Filmbilder transportieren. Bilder nämlich brauchen einen eindeutigen point of view, eine Haltung, die Der Untergang lediglich simuliert. Neben der Verhackstückung von Frau Junge und dem daraus resultierenden hybriden Blick gibt es durchaus noch weitere Erzählperspektiven. Etwa die Erlebnisse des kleinen Hitlerjungen, der vom Führer höchstpersönlich mit dem Eisernen Kreuz dekoriert wird, weil er zwei russische Panzer aufgehalten hat. »Also Peter heißt du. Ich wollte, meine Generäle hätten deinen Mut.« Man folgt dem Jungen durch den Horror der belagerten Stadt, in der die Bomben nur so durch die Gegend fliegen und die Menschen vor unseren Augen zerfetzt werden. Da treiben sich SS-Henkertrupps herum, wird Peters Vater gehängt und seine Mutter abgeschlachtet. Und ebenjener blonde deutsche Bub rettet dann am Schluss auch die Traudl. Ja, man glaubt seinen Augen kaum, da kommt er aus dem Nichts und greift ihre Hand und führt sie durch die russischen Soldaten ins Freie, weil die ja einer Mutter mit Kind nichts tun. Wer erzählt denn nun? Ein Märchenonkel? Sicher weder Frau Junge noch Herr Fest. Ist hier nicht einfach nur »das Kino« am Werk? 


Wie könnte ich das Fehlen einer Erzählhaltung anders begründen als mit dem schlimmsten Schnitzer, den dieser Film macht? Während nämlich dauernd Arme und Beine abgesägt werden, während Hunderte von Soldaten abgeschlachtet werden, während sich die Generalität die Kugel gibt und man die Leichen mit den Einschusslöchern herumfallen sieht und ein junger Volksstürmer seine Freundin erschießt und dann sich selbst, während all das ausgiebig gezeigt wird, beweist der Film dann doch zweimal ausgesprochene Pietät. Hitler bittet seinen Adjutanten Wünsche, er möge Benzin besorgen, »damit die Russen meine Leiche nicht zur Schau stellen können«. »Ein schrecklicher Befehl, aber ich will ihn ausführen«, entgegnet der Untergebene. Und was tut der Film? Er führt Hitlers Befehl tatsächlich aus! Alles sieht man in Der Untergang, nur Hitlers Tod nicht! Der Mann gibt sich (und seiner Eva) hinter verschlossener Tür das Gift und die Kugel. So wie Hitler sich abwendet, wenn seine Schäferhündin Blondie stirbt, so wendet sich der Film ab, wenn der Führer stirbt. Traudl schmiert den Goebbels-Kindern Butterbrote, da ertönt ein Schuss. »Volltreffer!«, ruft der älteste Junge erfreut. Dann öffnen sie alle die Tür und gucken. Aber wir, die Heutigen, sehen nicht, was sie sehen. Alle schauen erschaudernd und trauernd beiseite. »Herr Reichsleiter, es ist passiert!« – »Es«, sagt der Mann, als ob es das Unvorstellbare wäre. »Ich melde, der Führer ist tot.« In diesem Film hätte das keine Meldung sein dürfen. Warum auf einmal dieses dezente Nichtzeigen, warum die plötzliche Prüderie? Warum, verflucht noch mal!? Warum nicht zeigen, dass das Schwein endlich tot ist? Warum dem Mann diese Ehre erweisen, die der Film sonst keinem von denen erweist, die da reihenweise sterben müssen?

Keinem? Oh, doch! Noch einer wird auf diese Weise ausgeblendet. Wenn Goebbels wie im Western-Duell vor seiner Frau steht und die Pistole hebt, wendet sich die Kamera noch einmal vornehm ab. Sonst wird in diesem Film nie weggeschwenkt! Eine halbe Minute später hat der Film nichts dagegen, wenn Schädle sich das Gehirn aus der Birne bläst, dass es nur so gegen die Wand spritzt. Tausend Leichen sieht man, nur den Führer kriegen wir nicht tot zu Gesicht. In Decken wird er rausgezerrt und in eine Grube geworfen. Wenn dann Benzin über seine Leiche gegossen wird, kommt dieser Schnitt, der mir heute noch wehtut.

Ja, da folgt dem Ausgießen des Benzins, von der Nahaufnahme des Kanisters – »gluck, gluck, gluck« macht es laut – tatsächlich ein Schnitt auf eine Nahaufnahme von Traudls Asbach-Uralt-Flasche, »gluck, gluck« macht es wieder, und sie trinkt sich Mut an, um nun endlich abzuhauen. »Das darf doch nicht wahr sein«, habe ich bloß gedacht. Aber er war leider wahr, dieser unsäglich dumme Schnitt.

Welchen Erzähler entlarvt er hier? Wessen Sicht transportiert dieser Film? Warum dürfen wir Hitler und Goebbels nicht sterben sehen? Werden sie durch das Nichtzeigen nicht erst recht zu mythischen Figuren? Warum verdienen sie einen so würdigen Abgang, während alle anderen guten und schlechten Deutschen abgeknallt werden? Was für ein Verdrängungsvorgang entspinnt sich da vor unseren Augen? Oder kriegen wir diese Szenen später nachgeliefert, als Zusatzmaterial auf der DVD? 

In Resident Evil geschieht das Richtige: Da wird den Zombies am Ende der große Manipulator zum Fraß vorgeworfen. Hier wird zumindest die Geschichte bedient. Nicht die mit einem großen »G«, aber die des Kintopps.

Der Untergang bedient weder das große noch das kleine »G«. Der Film hat von allem keine Meinung, vor allem nicht vom Faschismus oder von Hitler. Er überlässt den Zuschauern die Haltung, die er selbst nicht hat oder höchstens vortäuscht. Das Machwerk Resident Evil lässt den Faschismus am Ende als latente Gefahr weiterleben, mit dem Unbehagen nämlich, dass das »Einheimische Böse« womöglich doch schon eine weltumspannende faschistische Corporation geworden ist. Ja, es erlaubt sich sogar noch die Ironie, im Endtitel nämlich, uns die gruselige Vorstellung nahezulegen, dass diese Macht uns, das heutige Publikum, beherrsche. Das Untergangs-Werk dagegen entlässt uns zur Sonne, zur Freiheit. Als die beiden überlebenden deutschen Helden am Ende in die Freiheit radeln, geht tatsächlich die Kunstlicht-Sonne auf über Traudl und Peterle, dem Hitlerjungen. Und was in den Schlusstiteln geschieht, spottet dann jeder Beschreibung. Sie beginnen mit dem Datum der Kapitulation, klären uns dann auf über die sechs Millionen Juden, von denen der Film nicht gehandelt hat, nicht handeln wollte oder konnte, und führt dann, unterlegt mit derselben Musik, die alles einebnet, auch über zu den Privatschicksalen aller Menschen und Unmenschen, denen wir für einen Zeitraum von zwölf Tagen haben zuschauen dürfen. Himmler und Göring haben dieselben Tafeln wie alle anderen Kriegsverbrecher, wie die netten Menschen, Traudls und Peterles und Millionen Namenlosen, und so finden sich Verführer und Opfer zum Schluss noch einmal in der beliebigen Haltungslosigkeit vereint, die diesen Film so unglaublich ärgerlich macht. Allein der Mangel an Erzählhaltung führt die Zuschauer in ein schwarzes Loch, in dem sie auf (beinahe) unmerkliche Weise dazu gebracht werden, diese Zeit doch irgendwie aus der Sicht der Täter zu sehen, zumindest mit einem wohlwollenden Verständnis für sie.

PS: Auf einer Website zu dem Film lese ich in einem Interview mit Fest auf die Frage »Welche Resonanz erwarten Sie auf den Film?« folgende Antwort: »Die Resonanz auf das Buch war sehr gut. Was ich mir für den Film verspreche, weiß ich nicht. Ich fürchte, irgendjemand wird sagen, das ist wieder diese unerlaubte Heroisierung, die moralischen Aspekte kommen zu kurz… Hat der Fest oder Eichinger keinen Zeigefinger, den er erheben kann? Das sind die blödesten Kritiken, die ganz bestimmt kommen werden. Ich habe diesen Zeigefinger tatsächlich nicht. Wer diesen Film auch nur halbwegs aufmerksam verfolgt, wird merken, welche Lehre diese Darstellung enthält. Wenn er das nicht merkt, kann ich ihm auch nicht helfen, dann wird auch der erhobene Zeigefinger ihm nicht helfen. Aber vielleicht enttäuscht mich das deutsche Publikum mal positiv und überrascht mich…«

Ich fürchte, ich bin hier derjenige, welcher. Nur kreide ich ihm den fehlenden Zeigefinger anders an, als er denkt. Nicht »moralisch«, sondern »erzählerisch« hätte der Film uns andere Fingerzeige geben müssen. 

Von Charlie Chaplin weiß man, dass er im Nachhinein Zweifel an Der Große Diktator hatte, weil er die Ungeheuerlichkeit Hitlers noch nicht in aller Konsequenz hatte ahnen können, als er ihn 1942 verulkte. Den deutschen Filmemachern Eichinger und Fest hätten die Zweifel kommen müssen, ob sie Hitler nicht auch verharmlost haben, indem sie 4500 Tage deutscher Geschichte mit ihm, seinen Ideen und seinen Taten ausgespart und uns nur das kommerzielle Sahnehäubchen seiner morbiden letzten Tage aufgetischt haben. Zum Gruseln haben sie uns damit gebracht. Aber das kann auch Resident Evil. Unser »einheimisches Böses« hätte einen anderen Erzählstandpunkt gebraucht als den des landläufigen Kinos.

==enlightenment installation guide==

Installing Enlightenment 0.17 (also known as E17 or DR17) is a snap in suse. You just use YAST and it is all done for you. After the progress bar is finished you then log out. When you look at the sessions available at the login screen, Enlightenment is now available.  How you get to yast and all the other programs through enlightenment, I don't know!

There is a quickstart guide for E17 in Suse at http://archive.is/20121225190143/arun.wordpress.com/2006/06/15/how-to-enlightenment-17-in-suse-10/

A HOWTO for Gentoo can be found at http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/E17

Check out the following link to install DR17 in Suse Linux :
http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/feature/16231.html

There are no up-to-date official binaries for E17 for Debian- or Ubuntu-based distributions.  Packages labeled &quot;e17&quot; in the Ubuntu repositories are actually e16 and are dated December 2004.  &lt;!-- Directions for accessing the latest unofficial .deb packages for Debian are here: 
http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/E17_User_Guide/Installing_using_Linux_distribution_packages#Debian_GNU.2FLinux
and for Ubuntu here: 
http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/E17_User_Guide/Installing_using_Linux_distribution_packages#Ubuntu_Linux --&gt;

=== Installing e from a terminal ===
 
open a terminal and become root, or su, or sudo 

in mine, (Mandriva 2008, running Eterm)

  '''[root@localhost ~]#''' ''apt-get install enlightenment''

or
 ''' [root@localhost ~]#''' ''yum install enlightenment''

or 
 ''' [root@localhost ~]#''' ''urpmi enlightenment''

one of these should install enlightenment if you are already connected.

==enlightenment DR16 configuration guide==

Enlightenment is extremely configurable - that is you can alter or re-design almost any feature of the window manager. The only downside is that to get a really cool environment, you have to do the work. Or download a theme someone else has done for you.


===Getting Background images to change from middle click menu-in .e16'''===

using a terminal (i prefer ''Eterm'')
you should see 

 '''[yourloginname@localhost ~]$'''''su'' &lt;enter&gt; 
 '''password''' &lt;your root password- type it in, &lt;enter&gt;&gt;
now, your terminal will look like

 '''[root@localhost yun]#''' 
now we are root.


 '''[root@localhost yun]#''''' ls -a''

see a report of folders, etc., you need to see &quot;.e16&quot; so you can change into that directory

 '''[root@localhost yun]#''' ''cd .e16''


notice we will leave our ''yun'' directory and are now in .e16- (below) lets add a folder for images 


 '''[root@localhost .e16]#''''' mkdir /backgrounds''


now, we can &quot;''cd''&quot; into /backgrounds, and see all the files in there (now, there's none, but this is where you want background images to be for the middle menu button, 
if you want to download them directly into this directory, choose to save image into the same path, '''''yun''' &gt; .'''e16''' &gt; '''backgrounds''' &lt;''save''&gt;''

***note***- sometimes the &quot;background&quot; menu dissapears, to restore it on the fly, 
 '''-middle click &gt; maintenance &gt; purge all caches''' ''*OR*'' '''regenerate menus''' 
now, to test your new backgrounds from the middle click menu
  '''middle click &gt; Desktop &gt; backgrounds''' 
= your backgrounds are now tiny images to help you select, on the fly swapping, select any of the small image icons, and watch your background flip instantly (ensure proper dimensions on image, like 1200x720 )

=== staying in .e16  other menu/ simple config===

You should by now have a folder titled &quot;.e16&quot; in your home directory.
This is the configuration point for enlightenment.

It has a layout as follows:

backgrounds/
cached/
e_config--0.0.backgrounds
e_config--0.0.buttons
e_config--0.0.cfg
e_config--0.0.ibox
e_config--0.0.snapshots
icons/
menus/
themes/

Let's start with menus
Left click anywhere on the desktop, and up comes a menu titled &quot;User Menus&quot;
Straight off this is the &quot;User Application List&quot;!1. This is a list of commands that can be configured by you to run as children of the process running enlightenment.

On my installation (Mint 9 Julia) &quot;User Application List&quot; did not appear, though user_apps.menu existed and had entries.  I had to change /usr/share/e16/config/menus/enlightenment.menu where I changed the line 
'&quot;User Menus&quot;           NULL menu file.menu'
to read
'&quot;User Menus&quot;            NULL menu user_apps.menu'
Then the entries showed as a menu straight off the &quot;User Menus&quot; list.

edit .e16/menus/user_apps.menu

Add the following line to the bottom

&quot;Clock&quot; NULL exec &quot;xclock&quot;

now save and try left-clicking again. You should see a menu option for the clock, selecting that option and you have just configured your desktop.

&lt;!--
Now, how do we make it really configurable.
added-
- want to change your bland background with .jpg images straight from a middle click menu ?
change directory into .e16
--&gt;

2 bunches broccoli rabe
                             
2 TB extra-virgin olive oil                         

4 medium garlic cloves, peeled and minced           

1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper                     

freshly ground black pepper                         

salt to taste                                       

1.  Remove any tough or damaged outer leaves. Peel the thick, lower stems from the broccoli rabe, and tear the rabe into large pieces. Wash in cold water until all dirt is removed. 

2.  Blanch the broccoli rabe in several quarts of salted, boiling water, until bright green and leaves are tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the hot water and immediately shock in ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain well and set aside.

3.  Meanwhile, heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper. Sauté the garlic until brown. Add the broccoli rabe to the pan and toss to coat with the garlic/pepper mixture and heat through. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.

Additional Broccoli Rabe Ideas

Add julienned red bell peppers to the pan with the garlic, and add pitted oil-cured black olives at the end for a colorful twist.

Add 3 anchovy fillets to the olive oil with the garlic for a classic beginning dish to Christmas Eve dinner in Napoli in Southern Italy.</text>

== Origins of Marxism ==

Lenin traces the roots of Marxism to German Philosophy, British Classical Economics, and French Socialism. Thus, it is best to look at these components in layman's English.

As a note, it is best to say Dialecticians rather than German philosophers influenced Marx and Engels. Hegel is the major player in both cases; he was &quot;the most encyclopedic&quot; of the dialecticians, and German philosophy &quot;culminated&quot; in the Hegelian System[1].

===Dialectics===

But what is &quot;dialectics&quot;? It is, more or less, a form of logic. It began with the Ancient Greeks as ''the'' logic. Literally, dialectic corresponds to &quot;discourse&quot; since the Greek dialectic was simply a discourse between a &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;con&quot; position on an issue. 

Hegel changed this, for Hegel had created the &quot;Modern&quot; dialectic. This note will be a step by step explanation of his method, so it may be a longer section than the others. Hegel believed the starting point is the immediately given experience at a particular historical juncture. This immediate experience is not &quot;apprehended&quot;. Thought must proceed from that which is initially given onwards.

Yet what is &quot;initially given&quot;? This brief moment is when Hegel, a philosopher who is an idealist, is empirical. Or, in other words, this is when Hegel looks at reality (empiricism) rather than ''only'' thinking about it. 

The goal is not to &quot;create&quot; the world out of pure thought processes, but to reconstruct the &quot;intelligibility&quot; (ability to apprehend by intellect only) of the world. This requires us to assign the fundemental categories that captures that intelligibility. 

Hegel writes: &quot;In order that this science (i.e. Hegel's own theory) may come into existence, we must have the progression from the individual and particular to the universal - ''an activity which is a reaction on the given material of empiricism in order to bring about its reconstruction. The demand of a priori knowledge, which seems to imply that the Idea should construct from itself, is thus a reconstruction only'' ... In consciousness it then adopts the attitude of having cut away the bridge from behind it; it appears to be free to launch forth in its ether only, and to develop without resistance to this medium; but it is another matter to attain to this ether and to development of it.&quot;

Now, what exactly is a &quot;category&quot;? Hegel explains that a category articulates a structure with two poles, a pole of unity and a pole of differences. From this general notion of a category we can go on to derive three general types of categorial structures.

In one the ''moment of unity'' is stressed, with the moment of differences implicit. In another the ''moment of difference'' is emphasised, with the moment of unity now being only implicit (or in other words the nature of the moment of unity is left undeveloped). In a third both ''unity and differences are made explicit together'', both are developed.

Another way of speaking of the connections is the concept of '''dialectical contradiction'''. Hegel's views on contradiction has been very controversial (to say the least). In terms of categories, what he means is fairly straightforward. If a category is a principle that unifies a manifold, then if a category ehibits only the moment of unity, then there is a &quot;contradiction&quot; between what is inherently ''qua'' is category (unifier of a manifold) and what it is explicitly (moment of unity alone). Overcoming the contradiction requires the intial category to be '''negated''' (in the sense that a second category must be formulated that makes the moment of difference explicit). Yet when this is done the moment of difference will be emphasized at the cost of having the moment of unity implicit. This means there is another contradiction. To overcome this the second category needs to be replaced with a category in which both poles, unity and difference, are each made explicit simultaneously.

Hegel is well aware of what contradiction and negation means in formal logic. He was following a tradition since Plato of using &quot;contradiction&quot; and &quot;negation&quot; as logical operators. The logic is ''dialectical logic''.

===British Classical Economics===

Classical Economics is a vast school of economic thought which will not be entirely discussed here. Instead, only David Ricardo and Adam Smith will be reviewed. 

Adam Smith had argued that value could not have originated in utility. He presented the counterpoint: if utility was the basis of value, how is it that water (which we need to live) is of no value compared to diamonds (which have no use at all)? He came to the conclusion that the labor used to make the commodity determines the value in exchange. 

As a general matter, Smith thought, the amount of labor required to produce the goods would determine the rate at which they could be exchanged for one another, though he mentioned some exceptions. If the supply of goods could not be increased by labor, then their value would be determined by their scarcity, and not by the labor embodied in them. Old master paintings would be a case in point -- no more could be produced, since all the old masters were dead, so the price of these paintings could rise to any height without calling forth a competing supply of new production. Monopoly would be another exception. The monopoly would be able to keep the good scarce, preventing any competing new production. The general idea seems to have been the people can always choose to produce for themselves rather than obtaining goods and services in exchange for others. If they must give up more labor to get the good by exchange, then they would produce for themselves instead.

Basically, the work of Adam Smith that is relevant to Marxism is summed up to a single proposition: Exchange Value must depend on something common to all goods; embodied labor is the one common factor on which exchange value depends. 

Ricardo essentially reformed the Labor Theory of Value so value wasn't &quot;entirely&quot; based on labor, although a large portion of value is. He theorized about the influence of machinery affecting value. Ricardo saved the labor theory of value from a serious objection. The objection had to do with land and rent. On the one hand, land rent seems to be a cost of production -- shouldn't the &quot;natural price&quot; of an agricultural product depend on the rent of land? On the other hand, labor will be more productive on land that is more fertile. Crops grown on fertile land will cost less labor. Does that mean it has less value?

I'll skip the math and come to Ricardo's conclusions. It is the labor required for production on marginal land (the next unit of land) that determines the normal price or value of agricultural products. And the surplus of production on more fertile land is &quot;absorbed&quot; by rent. Landowners don't have to do anything to earn this rent -- they get it automatically as a result of the competition for fertile land.

Ricardo fortified the Labor Theory of Value from ''most'' criticisms. There were three main vulnarable points: absolutely scarce goods, international trade, and monopoly. Marx played with these, which will be discussed later.

===French Socialism===

French Socialism can be summed up as the rejection of capitalism. All sorts of outlandish ideas have been associated with French socialism (e.g. polygamy, etc.).

French socialism is only one name of the concepts. Marx referred to them as ''utopian socialism''. Marx grounded his theory in scientific materialism (i.e. beyond physical reality there is nothing), and thus criticized the Utopian socialists for not having a basis in reality for their theories.

The utopian socialists explained that &quot;somehow&quot; everything will fit together into an ideal society. Of course they never bothered to investigate ''how'' socialism would come about. They wrote instead of ''what'' socialism is. 

This may not seem like a bad idea, but to Marx it was a grievous error. Marx explained his theory with historical materialism, which is our next topic.

== Historical Materialism ==

&quot;[People] make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like an nightmare on the brains of the living.&quot;[2]

In the beginning, according to Historical Materialism, is material reality. A particular group of humans, living in a specific part of the world, with a unique history, a particular technology, etc. It is Marx's idea that those specific details produce a certain kind of society with certain kinds of classes, certain relationships between them. Those relationships, in turn, generate ideas, religions, cultures, etc.

So we have an &quot;orderly&quot; explanation of human society: material conditions leading to technology leading to classes leading to culture. It was Marx's observation that there were &quot;regularities&quot; over long periods of time in this process. (He called them &quot;laws&quot; because that was the custom in 19th century European science.) He saw the evolution of human society in these &quot;regularities&quot; or &quot;stages&quot; (taken from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production wikipedia article]) This is the &quot;Ladder of Marxism&quot;.

1. Primitive communism. Human society organised in traditional tribe structures, typified by shared production and consumption of the entire social product. As no permanent surplus product is produced, there is also no possibility of a ruling class coming into existence. As this mode of production lacks differentiation into classes, it is said to be classless. Paleolithic and neolithic tools, pre- and early-agricultural production, and rigorous ritualised social control are the typifying productive forces of this mode of production.

2. The asiatic mode of production. This is a controversial contribution to Marxist theory, initially used to explain pre-slave and pre-feudal large earthwork constructions in China, India, the Euphrates and Nile river valleys (and named on this basis of the primary evidence coming from greater &quot;Asia&quot;). The asiatic mode of production is said to be the initial form of class society, where a small group extracts social surplus through violence aimed at settled or unsettled band communities within a domain. Exploited labour is extracted as forced corvee labour during a slack period of the year (allowing for monumental construction such as the pyramids, ziggurats, ancient Indian communal baths or the Chinese Great Wall). Exploited labour is also extracted in the form of goods directly seized from the exploited communities. The primary property form of this mode is the direct religious possession of communities (villages, bands, hamlets) and all those within them. The ruling class of this society is generally a semi-theocratic aristocracy which claims to be the incarnation of gods on earth. The forces of production associated with this society include basic agricultural techniques, massive construction and storage of goods for social benefit (grainaries).

3. The slave mode of production. It is similar to the asiatic mode, but differentiated in that the form of property is the direct possession of individual human beings. Additionally, the ruling class usually avoids the more outlandish claims of being the direct incarnation of a god, and prefers to be the decendents of gods, or seeks other justifications for its rule. Ancient Greek and Roman societies are the most typical examples of this mode. The forces of production associated with this mode include advanced (two field) agriculture, the extensive use of animals in agriculture, and advanced trade networks.

4. The feudal mode of production. It is usually typified by high feudalism in Western Europe. The primary form of property is the possession of land in reciprocal contract relations: the possession of human beings as peasants or serfs is dependent upon their being entailed upon the land. Exploitation occurs through reciprocated contract (though ultimately resting on the threat of forced extractions). The ruling class is usually a nobility or aristocracy. The primary forces of production include highly complex agriculture (two, three field, lucerne fallowing and manuring) with the addition of non-human and non-animal power devices (clockwork, wind-mills) and the intensification of specialisation in the crafts--craftsmen exclusively producing one specialised class of product.

5. The capitalist mode of production. It is usually associated with modern industrial societies. The primary form of property is the possession of objects and services through state guaranteed contract. The primary form of exploitation is wage labour (see Das Kapital, wage slavery and exploitation). The ruling class is the bourgeoisie, which exploits the proletariat. The key forces of production include the factory system, mechanised powered production, Taylorism, robotisation, bureaucracy and the modern state.

6. The socialist mode of production. Since this mode of production has not yet come into effect, its exact nature remains debatable. Some theorists argue that prefiguring forms of socialism can be seen in voluntary workers' cooperatives, strike committees, labour unions, soviets and revolutions. The socialist mode of production is meant to be a society based on workers' control of all production, with a property form equating consumption with productive labour. The key forces of production are similar to those in capitalism, but changed in their nature due to workers' control and collective management. Additionally, the merging of mental and manual labour is meant to increase the level of productivity and quality of the productive forces. The primary ruling class of this mode is meant to be the working class. The primary form of exploitation is meant to be self-exploitation - in other words, the exploitation of some people by others (the &quot;exploitation of man by man&quot;) is meant to be abolished.

7. The communist mode of production. Since it refers to the far future, it is a highly debated theoretical construct. Some theorists argue that prefiguring forms of communism can be seen in communes and other collective living experiments. Communism is meant to be a classless society, with the management of things replacing the management of people. Particular productive forces are not described, but are assumed to be more or less within the reach of any contemporary capitalist society. Despite the imminent potential of communism, some economic theorists have hypothesised that communism is more than a thousand years away from full implementation.


These are not rigid and impenetrable catagories. There were capitalists in Ancient Greece and Egypt, and elements of feudalism exist today with American Corporations.

The Marxist hypothesis is that while the ultimate cause for such changes lies in technological innovation, the means by which one social order surplants another is that of class struggle. Nomads had to physically defeat savages; early despots had to defeat nomad barbarians; feudal lords had to defeat the despots; and capitalists had to defeat the feudal lords. These were not simply military struggles; they also took place in the realm of ideas. For example, new religions were invented to &quot;justify&quot; the rise of a new kind of ruling class. New &quot;moralities&quot;, new &quot;legal&quot; concepts, new &quot;philosophies&quot;, followed. If this &quot;metahistory&quot; is more or less correct, asked Marx, what happens next? Is capitalism the &quot;end of history&quot;, or will there be another new social order?

We know the answer that Marx gave, of course. Possibly he noticed the curious trajectory that was followed: primitive equality to proto-classes to centralized despotism, then mini-despots, then a lot of mini-despots, then...advanced equality? More likely, I must admit, he probably used Hegalian dialectics to arrive at the same conclusion (Hegalian philosophy was very fashionable in Marx's youth and exerted a lasting influence on the way he approached matters).

Technologically advanced equality, which he called communism, would be the next &quot;stage&quot; of human history, and one in which classes would no longer exist at all. Moreover, like all the others, it would come into existence through class struggle with the old ruling class. To Marx, it seemed inevitable that capitalism, left to itself, would become more and more openly despotic (and with fewer and fewer significant despots) and, because of its own economic constraints, would generate crisis after crisis threatening a return to barbarism or savagry unless overthrown...by all those who were not capitalists, the working class.

== Marxist Economics ==

===On Commodities===

Commodities is to capitalism as elements are to chemistry. It is very important in capitalism. (Economics, Marx and Engels argued, is the science of capitalism).

The commodity has two values: one if its usefulness, fulfilling a need, it's called a use-value; the other &quot;expresses&quot; the use-value in relations to each other, called the exchange-value. Use-value is concerned with &quot;quality&quot;(or the character of different sorts of commodities), and exchange-value is concerned with &quot;quantity&quot;.

Here's where Marx's translation gets warped: every commodity has both forms of value. If we take away value, we are left with labor. But since we screwed around with the value, we screw around with the labor also.

Value is affected directly by labor. Marx cites the example of power-looms which decreased the labor necessary to weave by half, in effect the value of the linen decreased by half also.

There are two factors in labor: labor-power, the degree of power given by labor; and labor-time, how much time is consumed by laboring. The reason why gold is so valuable is because so much labor-time is dedicated to finding it, then labor-power to extract it. For example: Brazil around the 1820s found a rich vein of diamonds. They spent so much labor-power on the diamonds that the combined value within the next three years of the diamonds is as much as Brazil's sugar crops within one year, because the amount of labor dedicated to each respective sector created a balanced value. We determine labor through necessary labor time.

NOTE: Not all things with a use-value is created by labor, e.g. virgin soil, air, etc. A use-value can have no value. Labor is able to create value, but it is also capable of not doing so.

Marx gives the example a coat=20 yards of linen. That would mean that the coat takes 2W labor time, and the 20 yards of linen has 2W labor time. The element that allows us to say 1 coat=20 yards linen is value. Money is a commodity which is used to express value, it could be gold, cattle, etc.

Now it gets tricky... when there is a series of commodities set to be expressed through the means of gold, it is the &quot;money form of value&quot;; for example:

2 ton Iron
20 yards linen
2 coats = 3 ounces gold
1 table
x commodity A

This is the &quot;price form&quot;. Prices go up because of an increased amount of labor on the commodity, or a decreased amount on the gold. The opposite is true too.

The circulation of commodities and money is a little weird at first, but I'll try to explain it. There is the sale transaction, the commodity-money(C-M), which exchanges a commodity for money. Then there is the purchase transaction, the money-commodity(M-C), which exchanges money for commodity.

What happens is the two form the C-M-C process, the circulation of commodities; or selling in order to purchase. The equation N x P = V x S, or the number of sales(N) at the average price(P) equals the velocity, or number of transactions,(V) multiplied by the money supply(S).

This all assumes that money is not being hoarded, of course. Then money itself is a commodity. Finally, money, if based on a standard, has its standard as the universal money; that is to say, if money is backed by gold, the unvirsal money is gold.

===Transformation of Money into Capital===

The general formula for the circulation of commodities is C-M-C. The opposite is basically the same for the merchant's point of view: M-C-M. However, there is a profit to be &quot;made&quot;. If one buys 1000 yds of linen for $20, then sells it for $25, you exchange $20 for $25. So, it is M-C-M', where M'= M + M. That triangle thingy, for those who don't know, means &quot;the difference between&quot;; in this case it would mean $5 surplus-value.

There is a contradiction, though, that the value is expressed through another commodity of equal value. Yet the exchange was of unequal values! This surplus-value could be used to get more capital. Well, the difference between M' and M would be the percent which prices are affected.

Every human has labor-power. It is the only commodity which they are born with, and forced to sell in capitalism. There is a limit, however, to how much labor-power that can be expended; old age takes its toll. As Marx says: &quot;The price of the labour-power is fixed by the contract, although it is not realised till later, like the rent of a house. The labour-power is sold, although it is only paid for at a later period.&quot;

There are various GUI toolkits to start with.

==Tkinter==

Tkinter, a Python wrapper for [[Programming:Tcl | Tcl/Tk]], comes bundled with Python (at least on Win32 platform though it can be installed on Unix/Linux and Mac machines) and provides a cross-platform GUI. It is a relatively simple to learn yet powerful toolkit that provides what appears to be a modest set of widgets. However, because the Tkinter widgets are extensible, many compound widgets can be created rather easily (e.g. combo-box, scrolled panes). Because of its maturity and extensive documentation Tkinter has been designated as the de facto GUI for Python.

To create a very simple Tkinter window frame one only needs the following lines of code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Tkinter

root = Tkinter.Tk()
root.mainloop()
&lt;/source&gt;

From an object-oriented perspective one can do the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import Tkinter

class App:
    def __init__(self, master):
        button = Tkinter.Button(master, text=&quot;I'm a Button.&quot;)
        button.pack()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Tkinter.Tk()
    app = App(root)
    root.mainloop()
&lt;/source&gt;

==PyGTK==
''See also book [[PyGTK For GUI Programming]]''

[http://www.pygtk.org/ PyGTK] provides a convenient wrapper for the [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] library for use in Python programs, taking care of many of the boring details such as managing memory and type casting. The bare GTK+ toolkit runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X (port in progress), but the more extensive features &amp;mdash; when combined with PyORBit and gnome-python &amp;mdash; require a [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] install, and can be used to write full featured GNOME applications.

PyQt is a wrapper around the cross-platform [http://web.archive.org/web/20060514211039/http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt Qt C++ toolkit]. It has many [http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/classes.html widgets and support classes] supporting SQL, OpenGL, SVG, XML, and advanced graphics capabilities.
A PyQt hello world example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

class App(QApplication):
    def __init__(self, argv):
        super(App, self).__init__(argv)
        self.msg = QLabel(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
        self.msg.show()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    import sys
    app = App(sys.argv)
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/ PyQt] is a set of bindings for the cross-platform [[Qt]] application framework. PyQt v4 supports Qt4 and PyQt v3 supports Qt3 and earlier.

==wxPython==

Bindings for the cross platform toolkit [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets]. WxWidgets is available on Windows, Macintosh, and Unix/Linux.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import wx

class test(wx.App):
    def __init__(self):
        wx.App.__init__(self, redirect=False)

    def OnInit(self):
        frame = wx.Frame(None, -1,
                         &quot;Test&quot;,
                         pos=(50,50), size=(100,40),
                         style=wx.DEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE)
        button = wx.Button(frame, -1, &quot;Hello World!&quot;, (20, 20))
        self.frame = frame
        self.frame.Show()
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = test()
        app.MainLoop()
&lt;/source&gt;
* [http://wxpython.org/ wxPython]

==Dabo==

Dabo is a full 3-tier application framework. Its UI layer wraps wxPython, and greatly simplifies the syntax.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import dabo
dabo.ui.loadUI(&quot;wx&quot;)

class TestForm(dabo.ui.dForm):
	def afterInit(self):
		self.Caption = &quot;Test&quot;
		self.Position = (50, 50)
		self.Size = (100, 40)
		self.btn = dabo.ui.dButton(self, Caption=&quot;Hello World&quot;,
		      OnHit=self.onButtonClick)
		self.Sizer.append(self.btn, halign=&quot;center&quot;, border=20)
	
	def onButtonClick(self, evt):
		dabo.ui.info(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)

if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = dabo.ui.dApp()
        app.MainFormClass = TestForm
        app.start()
&lt;/source&gt;
* [http://dabodev.com/ Dabo]


==pyFltk==

[http://pyfltk.sourceforge.net/ pyFltk] is a Python wrapper for the [http://www.fltk.org/ FLTK], a lightweight cross-platform GUI toolkit. It is very simple to learn and allows for compact user interfaces.

The &quot;Hello World&quot; example in pyFltk looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from fltk import *

window = Fl_Window(100, 100, 200, 90)
button = Fl_Button(9,20,180,50)
button.label(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
window.end()
window.show()
Fl.run()
&lt;/source&gt;

==Other Toolkits==
* [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pykde/index.php PyKDE] - Part of the kdebindings package, it provides a python wrapper for the KDE libraries.
* [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/PyXPCOM PyXPCOM] provides a wrapper around the Mozilla [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XPCOM XPCOM] component architecture, thereby enabling the use of standalone [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL XUL] applications in Python. The XUL toolkit has traditionally been wrapped up in various other parts of XPCOM, but with the advent of [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner libxul and XULRunner] this should become more feasible.

[[image:GENtle_silent_mutation.png|thumb|The silent mutation dialog]]
This dialog can find restriction enzymes that cut in a marked DNA sequence (context menu ''Selection/Show enzymes that cut here'' in the DNA module). It can also find alternate versions of the DNA which will translate into the same amino acid sequence, but contains a new restriction site (silent mutation). A chosen enzyme/mutation will appear in the sequence (DNA or primer, respectively) upon &lt;tt&gt;OK&lt;/tt&gt;.

The results can be changed by
*changing which enzyme group to search
*limiting the number of times an enzyme may cut in the whole sequence
*limiting the number of mutations needed for a restriction site to manifest (PCR module only)</text>

[[image:GENtle_enzyme_management.png|thumb|The enzyme management dialog]]
The enzyme editor for enzyme management, both globally and per DNA sequence, is divided into three lists:
#A list of enzyme groups (top right)
#A list of enzymes in that group (bottom right)
#A list of current/temporary enzymes (left)
Enzymes can be copied into/removed from the left list through the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;--Add&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Remove--&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; buttons. Enzymes can be deleted from a group (except &lt;tt&gt;All&lt;/tt&gt;) via &lt;tt&gt;Delete&lt;/tt&gt; from group, or added via &lt;tt&gt;New enzyme&lt;/tt&gt;. A double click on an enzyme name in either list shows an enzyme properties dialog.

Enzymes from the left list can be added to a new or existing group via the respective buttons. All enzymes from a group can be added to the left list, and a group can be deleted.

You can share enzyme groups with other GENtle users on your intranet via a commonly shared database. Create an enzyme group as &quot;Database name:Enzyme group name&quot;, and it will be available to everyone using that database on the next start of GENtle. Note that when creating the enzyme group, use the name of the database as it appears in your local installation (maybe &quot;Shared&quot;, &quot;Shared0&quot;, &quot;Shared (2)&quot; etc.).</text>

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Asarkees. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Asarkees~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Theory of Sedimentation''' is an interdisciplinary field of research that investigates the build up of sediments. It implies knowledge of chemical engineering, mathematics, fluid mechanics, and physics. This book tries both to give an introduction on the level of graduate students and to be a reference book for researchers and practitioners. The content reaches from the explanation of basic concepts up to the documentation of ongoing research.

== The Paleolithic Era ==
The [[w:Paleolithic|Paleolithic]] (or '''Palæolithic''') Era, is the name historians give to the time period between 2.6 million years ago, and approximately 12,000 years ago.  Historians categorize the Paleolithic Era as [[Ancient History/Glossary#Prehistory|prehistory]] because there was no written language to record events, names, dates or places.  Everything we know today about prehistory, including the Paleolithic age, is as a result of the investigations of paleo-anthropologists, archaeologists, physical and cultural anthropologists, zoologists, chemists, botanists, physicists, historians and dedicated amateurs.  It is difficult and under-appreciated work, but it is necessary if our understanding of the past is to advance.

== Hominids ==

=== ''Homo erectus'' ===
Four useful developments came about during this time. These developments were very important to the Homo habilis they helped with everyday doings including hunting and cooking. Tools, the ideas of tools, fire and shelter are the four developments that were introduced to the Homo habilis. A fifth development was language, it acted both as a cultural artifact and mental change.

=== ''Homo neanderthalensis'' ===
Neanderthal humans were a prehistoric, stone-tool using species of human, the last of which are thought to have lived 28,000 years ago.  First published in 1863 from a cave in Germany's Neander Valley,  Neanderthal remains and associated tools have since been found across Eurasia from Gibraltar to Uzbekistan.  The average adult Neanderthal was much more powerfully built than a modern adult human, with distinct facial features including low, thick brow ridges.  Neanderthals inhabited Europe during Ice Age periods, surviving extremely harsh climatic conditions which may have prompted the evolution of their stout, muscular frames.  

Neanderthals buried their dead, and even included flowers with some burials.  When ''Homo sapiens'' arrived in Europe 40,000 - 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals were present.  There has been much speculation about contact and even interbreeding between the two types of human, but genetic surveys have never found modern humans with DNA that could be matched to DNA recovered from Neanderthal remains.  It is possible that modern humans, using more refined tools and techniques for hunting, out-competed Neanderthals for food resources and brought about their extinction.

=== ''Homo sapiens'' ===
Anthropologists believe that modern man, or ''Homo sapiens'', emerged as a distinct species by about 100,000 years ago.  Extensive studies of ancient human remains and shelters seem to show that groups of ''Homo sapiens'' left Africa and entered Asia via the Middle East around 65,000 years ago. 

The first modern humans to evolve in Africa lived mainly on meat. By 70,000 years ago, they had switched to a marine diet consisting largely of shellfish. 
This new research suggests they moved along the coasts of the Arabian peninsula into India, Indonesia and Australia about 65,000 years ago. An offshoot later settled the Middle East and Asia about 30,000 to 40,000 years ago. (Ref: BBC News 13 May 2005 &quot;Early humans followed Coast&quot; )

By 35,000 to 40,000 years ago, modern humans were living across the Old World from Europe to Australia.  About 12,000 to 15,000 years ago, humans crossed into North America from Asia via Beringia, a now submerged land bridge that existed during the Pleistocene Ice Age when sea levels were lower. They rapidly spread across North and South America after the climate became warmer and the ice sheets retreated. 

Around 10,000 years ago agriculture began at sites such as Jericho and Catal Huyuk in the Fertile Crescent, an area in the Middle East between the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. These early towns and villages were generally located near sources of water for growing crops. It was not until millennia later that humans developed irrigation techniques and could grow crops using the rising and falling waters of The Fertile Crescent's twin rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates. This period is generally accepted as the birth of modern civilization and the beginning of the nation-state.

== Hominids to Humans ==

=== Physical Changes ===
As hominids developed into humans (''Homo sapiens''), they underwent various physical changes.  Most obviously, our ancestors learned to walk upright on two legs, rather than alternating between two legs and four legs.  This straightened the spine, and moved the'' foramen magnum'' from the back of the skull to the underside.  Hominin faces flattened, and the space between the eyes narrowed, so that they could look forward and see from side to side.

Our ancestors also developed a taste for a broad variety of foods.  Early hominids, like'' Australopithicus robustus'', were clearly vegetarian plant-eaters, based on their teeth and jaw structure.  But later hominids, including ''Australopithicus afarensis'' and ''Homo erectus'', clearly used their incisors to tear meat and their molars to chew it.

=== Mental Changes ===
Mental changes in early hominins were substantial.  From ''Australopithicus afarensis'', who had barely 300 cubic centimeters of brain size, hominin heads eventually expanded to ''Homo neanderthalensis'''s impressive 1950 cubic centimeters.  At least some of this expanded brain power was shifted from processing scents to processing sights and sound.  Another substantial portion went to controlling the auditory and language functions.  Smell diminished in importance as more brain power was reserved for looking, listening and talking.

The modern ''Homo sapiens'' brain is actually smaller than ''neandethalensis'', but paleoanthropologists theorize that once the brain reached an optimum size for certain kinds of work, it began specializing, miniaturizing, and integrating.  The result is that the modern human brain may be smaller, but its critical functions are much more closely packed into a narrower space, for more efficient functioning.  In this way, the process of evolution continued in early humans.

== Technological Changes ==
The Paleolithic Era accounts for millions of years of human experience, a period many times longer than the mere ten thousand years that something resembling civilization can be said to have existed.  This first primitive era saw few changes in how humans lived.  Yet four great developments did occur which represent some of the most momentous changes in human lifestyles.  These four changes may be summarized:  the idea of a tool, a range of tools, fire, and shelter.  A fifth &quot;tool&quot;, language, acts as both a cultural artifact and a mental change.

===Tools ===
Tools seem like such a basic part of everyday life that it is hard to imagine a world without them. The computer you are using to read this book is a tool, though, and so is the desk or table on which the computer rests.  Your chair is a tool, and the electricity which powers your computer is provided by another tool, a power plant which converts other forms of energy into electrical power.  Tools, in a very real sense, are all ''artifacts'' -- objects made by human hands to serve some purpose.

In the early Paleolithic period, from about 3 million years ago until 1 million years ago, the hominids from which we arose lived much like other animals: they hunted and gathered food from natural sources, and ate only the food that was immediately edible to a human digestive system.  No one appears to have had any tools at all.  Some early hominids were vegetarian; others were meat-eaters.  Yet neither group cooked their food, consuming it raw instead. This placed significant limitations on their diets — a number of plants and animals cannot be consumed and digested raw.  

About two million years ago, our predecessor, a hominid known as ''Homo habilis'' used his hands with opposable thumbs to construct a crude tool from stone.  This tool, called a ''hand axe'' was about the size of a modern adult male's fist, bi-faced, with a sharp point. The hand axe was used for breaking open bones to scoop out the rich marrow inside, a popular food item among hominids. No doubt, the same tool served as a weapon as well.

The hand axe was formed by taking a nodule of flint, and gradually breaking away all the pieces of flint which did not match the shape of the ideal hand-axe.  This process is called ''core-formed flint-knapping'', because it takes a lump of flint and gradually disposes of all of the flint which does not match the desired shape.  

''Homo habilis'' and his relatives made core-formed hand axes for a million years before a new group of hominids, ''Homo erectus'', hit upon a new technology which reverberates to the present day.  Before ''Homo erectus'', there was only one tool in the world, and it was a hand axe.  However, ''Homo erectus'' hit upon a new method for producing hand axes.  Instead of chopping away at a flint nodule until it looked like a hand axe, the new tool-makers would knock a piece of flint off a core, and then shape the splinter, or ''flake'' to the desired shape.  This process created numerous ''microliths'', or sharp pieces of flint or chert, which could be used as small knives or as scrapers on hides or bone.  

The development of ''flaking'', or using smaller chips from a flint nodule rather than the main core of the nodule, spread rapidly.  Within 100,000 years, nearly all peoples in the world were using the new technique for making hand axes.  Something else interesting happened as well.  As the technique of flaking spread, new forms of flaking appeared as well.  No longer were hominids making only hand axes.  They began creating a whole series of new tools out of flint and quartzite and chert and obsidian:  burins, or drills, for putting holes in wood; awls for punching holes in leather; scrapers for cleaning the meat off of hides and bones; knives for cutting meat or vegetables; points for spears (and later still, arrows); and chisels for working stone, wood and bone.

==== Tool Specialization ====
Archaeologists would say that the denizens of the late Paleolithic had begun to ''specialize''.  Specialization in a historical context means the development of new forms to accommodate new activities.  The hand axe had been a sufficient tool when everyone in the world was interested in collecting marrow from the insides of bones.  However, around one million years ago, there was an explosion of new tool types, ranging from needles to drills to knives.

The increasing number of tool types suggests to archaeologists that there was also an explosion in the number and types of human activity.  Why make a needle, if there is no thread to use with it?  Why make a needle, if you have no cloth or leather to sew together?  The presence of so many tools shows that hominids were opening oysters with finesse, instead of simply smashing the shells.  They were sewing leather or plant material together, to make baskets and bags and clothing.  They were drilling holes in wood, to make houses or boats.  They were scraping hides because they wished to make leather.  They were making knives to use in their kitchen areas because they were making more complex types of food.  They were making spears because they were hunting large animals -- and defending themselves against human predators as well.

==== Perishable Tools ====
Other types of tools show up in the late Paleolithic age.  It is hard to tell what they are, however, because many of these tools are made of perishable materials such as wood, bone, leather and cloth.  We can guess at their existence today only by hints.  If a bone fishing hook appears at an archaeological site, we can presume they had fishing line, perhaps made out of vegetable fibers.  If a stone with a specific shape and a hole in it is found, scientists can guess at the existence of a spinning spindle, to make thread.  The presence of beads in patterns in a grave suggests thread for the beads to be strung upon, or even clothing for the beads to be sewn on.  It is hard to make generalizations about the existence of baskets in the Paleolithic period, but people must have made nets, baskets and bags for carrying food and fruit, and catching fish, at many places around the world.

=== Fire ===
Sometime between 300,000 and 1.5 million years ago, humans also tamed fire.  Taming fire may not be the same as controlling it.  Some scientists believe that the hominid ''Homo erectus'' stumbled upon a lightning-struck tree or a forest fire, and captured a few coals in a basket, a bag or an animal horn.  It may not have been able to put out the fire and re-start it, but it at least had some coals from which it could keep a hearth fire alive.

''Homo erectus'' used fire in a number of interesting ways.  First, their overnight stops now included a warm and welcoming light at the center and a fire that kept animals at bay.  Second, that warm and welcoming light also provided enough heat to cook food.  New plants and animal foods became open to humans for the first time as a result of this tamed fire.  Third, the heat and light on a torch could be used to start large fires, and drive animal prey towards a trap or ambush site.  ''Homo habilis'' could now catch a lot more food on the hoof.  Fourth, the same fire could be used to drive away predators.  It made camps safer, and it gave hominids a new tool for defeating rivals who ate the same animals.  Finally, fire probably stimulated the creation of language.  As early peoples sat around the fire, they would have enacted stories from their family history, and discussed new tool types.  At first, these conversations may have been mere gestures accompanied by grunts, perhaps boastful males re-enacting their daring deeds of the day.  However, over dozens or hundreds of generations, hominids would have developed strong speech centers in the brain, which would make word banks and grammars possible.  The existence of many language families in the world today is one strong argument for the independent development of language. Language seems inherently human, a process linked to thinking and the development of reason.

Yet all of these many benefits of fire would be canceled if the people failed to keep their fire fed.  The coals would go out, and all the benefits of having fire would be lost, for the hominids had no way to restart the flame once it was extinguished and the coals turned to ash.

====Controlling Fire ====
Sometime between 500,000 and 1 million years ago, one of the hominids (probably ''Homo erectus'') discovered that some stones gave off sparks when they were struck together.  They also discovered that friction can produce heat, and heat can produce sparks which then generate flame.  Four techniques developed for mastering friction and sparks.  The first of these simply involved jamming one stick into a groove in another stick, and rubbing back and forth until the friction produced a spark or a flame.  The second method, the drill method, involves twirling one stick against another until the heat produced generates a spark or a flame.  Bow-drilling, the third method, involves using a bow with a cord strung around the vertical stick, to speed the friction and increase the likelihood of flame.  The fourth method requires a naturally occurring ferrous metal and a piece of flint; when the two are struck together, the resulting sparks can start a fire.

With four methods for generating fire, hominids no longer needed to fear the loss of their coals.  Bowdrilling or stick rubbing were slow and inefficient ways of starting a fire, but they worked reliably and well.  Now hominids really controlled fire, because they could let it go out, and start it again, whenever they needed and wherever they wanted.  It was likely considered an almost magical process.  The Greek myth of Prometheus attributes almost mystical power to the ability to control fire, and declared that the wrath of the gods must surely fall on one who knew such secrets.

=== Clothing ===
The third technological shift represents the development of shelter and clothing.  Most clothing is made out of perishable materials like leather and cloth, which readily decay in the ground after only short periods of time.  Modern scientists can only postulate the existence of clothing in the Paleolithic Age from the existence of needles and other tools for sewing and preparing hides.  Archaeologists find one possible sign of clothing in the Paleolithic era, though:  in some very ancient grave sites, a thin layer or halo of colored earth surrounds the skeleton.  Most scholars believe this red ocher residue to be the remnants of paint smeared on the body.  However, some believe this colored earth to be the remains of clothing at burial.

Certainly, later Neanderthal man (Homo neanderthalensis) started burying their dead.  The graves tend to be very simple.  Often the dead person is buried in a fetal position, suggesting the same shape in death as the infant at birth.  Flowers are often scattered in the grave, along with strands of beads and a few simple tools.  The custom of burying someone with ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Grave goods|grave goods]]'' remains a consistent part of human life in many places even today.

=== Shelter ===
Most early hominids probably lived in the open air, near to sources of food and water.  They chose locations that could be defended against predators and rivals and that were shielded from the worst weather. Many such locations could be found near rivers, lakes and streams, perhaps with low hilltops nearby that could serve as refuges in troubled times.  Since water can erode and change landscapes quite drastically, both in the course of ordinary motion and catastrophe, many of these campsites are utterly destroyed, and not even skilled archaeologists can find them, much less reconstruct them.  Our understanding of Paleolithic dwellings is thus necessarily limited.

Even so, a few examples of Paleolithic houses exist, although they only come to light very recently in the Paleolithic era, no more than 200,000 years ago.  These &quot;houses&quot; are more frequently campsites within caves or in the open air, with little in the way of formal structures for living in.  However, as the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated, more elaborate, and more house-like.  The oldest examples are shelters within caves, followed by houses of wood, straw and rock; a few examples exist of houses built out of bones.

==== Caves ====
Caves are the most famous example of Paleolithic shelter, though the number of caves used by Paleolithic peoples is drastically small compared with the number of hominids thought to have lived on earth 500,000 years ago.  Most hominids probably never entered a cave in their lives, much less lived in one.  Nonetheless, the remains of hominid settlement show interesting patterns.  In one cave, a tribe of ''Homo neanderthalensis'' kept a hearth fire burning for a thousand years, leaving behind an accumulation of coals and ash.  In another cave, post holes in the dirt floor reveal that the residents built some sort of shelter or enclosure with a roof to protect themselves from water dripping on them from the cave ceiling.   They often used the rear portions of the cave as ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Middens|middens]]'', depositing their garbage in the back of the cave.

In the later, more recent Paleolithic period, about 125,000 years ago, caves ceased to act as houses.  Instead, they became religious or magical places for early peoples to gather for [[Ancient History/Glossary#Ritual|ritual]] purposes.  Caves, such as Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain, became art galleries filled with elaborate images of horse, bison, buffalo, mammoths and other animals.  Lit by flickering firelight, these images appeared to move and come alive.  Archaeologists do not know whether ancient peoples worshiped these images or used them for the purpose of working magical spells on the animals they hunted.  Modern visitors to such caves are awed by the beauty of these ancient artworks, even so.

Some scholars today believe that these caves were the work of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' -- our own direct ancestor.  As of this writing, no artwork has yet been found at any ''Homo erectus'' or ''Homo neanderthalensis'' archaeological site, anywhere in the world.  The creation of art, and the symbolic thinking that goes with creating sculptures or paintings, may truly be the mental process that separates human beings from other types of animals.  Other scholars contest this claim.

==== Tents and Huts ====
Other than caves, modern archaeologists know few other types of shelter available to ancient peoples.  Some examples exist, but they are quite rare.  In Siberia, a group of Russian scientists uncovered a house or tent with a frame constructed of mammoth bones.  The great tusks supported the roof, while the skulls and thigh bones formed the walls of the tent.  Several families could live inside, where three small hearths, little more than rings of stones, kept people warm during the winter.  Archaeologists presume that the roof was made of mammoth hides in several layers.  Similar houses existed in France and Germany; all date to about 90,000 years ago.  

Much more recently than that, around 50,000 years ago, a group of Paleolithic ''Homo sapiens'' camped on a lake shore in southern France.  At Terra Amata, these hunter-gatherers built a long and narrow house.  The foundation was a ring of stones, with a flat threshold stone for a door at either end.  Vertical posts down the middle of the house supported roofs and walls of sticks and twigs, probably covered over with a layer of straw.  A hearth outside served as the kitchen, while a smaller hearth inside kept people warm.

Both dwellings could be easily abandoned by their residents.  This is why they are not considered true houses, which was a development of the Neolithic period rather than the Paleolithic period.  However, they give us brief looks at the lives of our most distant ancestors.

=== Language and Culture ===
In modern eyes, perhaps the most significant technology of the Paleolithic Age was the development of language.  Language is not strictly speaking a technology&amp;mdash;you cannot hold it or touch it.  Instead, it relies upon changes in the human brain&amp;mdash;the development of speech centers to govern the tongue and lips to produce precise sounds, the development of memory to hold lists of words, the development of rules to govern how those words are used in different circumstances, and the development of hearing centers in the brain to process foreign sounds as words within a set of rules.  These functions did not come overnight.  Fire may have stimulated some of them: ancient peoples sat or danced around fires, and they must have had stories to tell each other of their discoveries.  Hunting stimulated others: needing to catch food that ran away required co-ordination among different hunters.  People also created language while searching for edible plants, and plants with medical properties to cure or lessen the hurts of themselves and their families.

With the development of language came the development of '''culture'''.  Having a name for a thing -- be it a plant, an animal, a stone, a tool, or an event -- meant that early humans carried ideas about how the world worked.  They taught those ideas to their children, and to their children after them.  Young people not only learned what plants to eat and what not to eat, they learned about the dead and the living within their family and beyond; they learned how to make tools, and what those tools were for. By extension, children learned what they should do and what they should not -- a series of prescriptions and taboos that governed behavior.  As different groups of humanity spread across the globe, some of these prescriptions and taboos were forgotten, and new ones were learned.  Different places, with different animals and plants, and different dangers, developed different lists of forbidden and acceptable activities.  In this way, the many peoples and tribes and cultures of the world originated.

By 20,000 years before the present, with the exception of some islands off the beaten track of human exploration, humans had settled in virtually every place in the world.  Then came the Ice.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes and Exercises&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Personal Pronouns – Subject, Object and Possession&lt;/font&gt;===

The subject and object forms (e.g English ''I'' and ''me'') of Novial pronouns are the same:

*'''me''' – ''I, me'' 		
*'''nus''' – ''we, us''
*'''vu''' – ''you'' (one person) 	
*'''vus''' – ''you'' (more than one person)
*'''lo''' – ''he, him''	
*'''los''' – ''they, them'' (all male)
*'''la''' – ''she, her''	
*'''las''' – ''they, them'' (all female)
*'''le''' – ''he or she, him or her''	
*'''les''' – ''they, them''
*'''lu''' – ''it''		
*'''lus''' – ''they, them'' (all sexless objects)

Notice that in the third person, male and female have the endings '''-o''' and '''-a''' respectively. The ending '''-e''' indicates either male or female without specifying. The ending '''-u''' indicates a sexless thing.
Plurals all end in '''-s'''. '''Les''' is conveniently used to mean ''they, them'' as in English, i.e. it is not specified whether ''they'' are sexless or not, and ''they'' may be any mixture of male, female and sexless things. This system is flexible and allows more speakers to follow their natural language habits. So the French may often choose to use '''las''' and '''los''', while most English speakers would choose to use '''les''', ignoring the sex distinction which is here absent in English.  A Finnish speaker may prefer to use '''le''' (''he or she''), since the ''he/she'' distinction is absent in Finnish. The pronoun '''le''' is also very convenient to say ''he or she'' using a single word and avoiding sex bias.

The standard word order is, as in English, '''subject-verb-object''', so the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject:
*'''me observa vu''' – ''I observe you''
*'''vu observa me''' – ''you observe me''

The personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding '''-n''' or after a consonant '''-en'''. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so '''men''' means both ''my'' and ''mine'' (''of me''):
*'''lu es men hunde''' – ''it is my dog''
*'''lu es men''' – ''it is mine''

*'''men''' – ''my, mine''		
*'''nusen''' – ''our, ours''
*'''vun''' – ''your, yours''		
*'''vusen''' – ''your, yours'' (more than one person)  
*'''lon''' – ''his''			
*'''losen''' – ''their, theirs'' (all male)
*'''lan''' – ''her, hers''		
*'''lasen''' – ''their, theirs'' (all female)
*'''len''' – ''his or her, his or her''s	
*'''lesen''' – ''their, theirs''
*'''lun''' – ''its''			
*'''lusen''' – ''their, theirs'' (all sexless objects)

# Ob vus sava ke lus es '''men''' problemes?
}}


===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verb – Present Tense, Imperative, Infinitive and Negative&lt;/font&gt;===

As in English the present tense of the verb and the imperative are identical:
*'''me dikte''' – ''I say'' or ''I am saying''
*'''dikte! ''' – ''say! ''

Note that the English present continuous, such as ''you are saying'', is translated by the simple present: 
*'''vu dikte'''
The infinitive is also the same as the present: 
*'''me prefera dikte''' – ''I prefer to say''

The negative is formed with '''non''' (''not''), which usually precedes the word which it negates. The negative answer to a question is '''no''' (''no''), while the positive answer is '''yes''' (''yes'').
*'''nus non sava lu''' – ''we don’t know it''

The verb never varies with the person:
*'''me sembla''' – ''I seem''		
*'''nus sembla''' – ''we seem''
*'''vu sembla''' – ''you seem''		
*'''vus sembla''' – ''you seem''
*'''le sembla''' - ''he or she seems''	
*'''les sembla''' – ''they seem''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Articles, Plural Nouns and Nouns with Natural Sex&lt;/font&gt;===

The plural of a noun is formed by adding the ending '''-s''' ('''-es''' after a consonant) and the definite article '''li''' (''the'') is invariant as in English:
*'''li probleme''' – ''the problem''
*'''li problemes''' – ''the problems''

For convenience '''de li''' (''of the'') is usually shortened to '''del''' and likewise '''a li''' (''to the'') to '''al''' and '''da li''' (''by the'') to '''dal'''.
There is no indefinite article (''a, an'') in Novial. This causes no ambiguity as seen in English when the plural indefinite article (''some'') is dropped:
*'''hunde''' – ''dog, a dog''
*'''hundes''' – ''dogs, some dogs''

The indication of sex in the third person pronouns with the endings '''-e''', '''-o''' and '''-a''' is also used with nouns that have natural gender:
*'''doktore''' – ''doctor'' (male or female)		
*'''doktora''' – ''female doctor''		
*'''doktoro''' – ''male doctor''
		
*'''hunde''' – ''dog''
*'''hunda''' – ''bitch, female dog''
*'''hundo''' – ''male dog''
			
*'''siniore''' – ''sir or madam''		
*'''siniora''' – ''madam, Mrs''			
*'''sinioro''' – ''sir, Mr''			
*'''siniores''' – ''ladies and gentlemen''
		
*'''home''' – ''person''
*'''homa''' – ''female person'' (adult or child)
*'''homo''' – ''male person'' (adult or child)
*'''homes''' – ''people''

Many sexless nouns also end in '''-e''' and these of course cannot change the ending to indicate sex differences.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Adjectives&lt;/font&gt;===

All adjectives end in an '''-i''', which may be dropped if easy to pronounce. Adjectives usually precede the noun that they qualify. As in English, adjectives do not agree with their noun in number or gender: 
*'''boni puera''' or '''bon puera''' – ''a good girl''
*'''boni pueras''' or '''bon pueras''' – ''good girls''
*'''boni puero''' or '''bon puero''' – ''a good boy''
*'''boni pueros''' or '''bon pueros''' – ''good boys''
*'''boni pueres '''or '''bon pueres''' – ''good children (boys and/or girls'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/font&gt;===
 
Question words such as '''que''' (''who?'') or '''pro quu''' (''why? '') directly indicate a question and the subject-verb-object order need not be changed:  
*'''pro quu vus visita nus? ''' – ''why are you visiting us?'' (Literally: ''why you visit us? '')
*'''que visita nus? ''' – ''who is visiting us''? (Literally: ''who visits us? '')

Otherwise a question is indicated with the general question word '''ob''' (''is it that?''), again with no change in the standard word order of the remainder of the sentence:
*'''ob vu es lan amike? ''' – ''are you her friend?'' (Literally: ''is it that you are her friend? '') 
*'''ob vu sava li familie? ''' – ''do you know the family?'' (Literally: ''is it that you know the family? '')

=== Mfiles === 
Subroutines are encapsulated by Mfiles (Matlab files with ending .m). 

==== Direct problem ====
The closure functions are prescribed by
 function f = f(u)
 global uinf umax C
 f=uinf.*u.*(1-u).^C.*(u&gt;0).*(u&lt;umax); 
and 
 function a = a(u)
 global a0 uc C k umax
 a=a0.*(1-u).^C.*u.^(k-1).*(u&gt;uc).*(u&lt;umax);
The Engquist-Osher numerical flux function is implemented as
 function feo = feo(g,u,v)
 global um
 fgu=feval(g,u); fgum=feval(g,um); fgv=feval(g,v); fguvum=fgu+fgv-fgum;
 lu=u&lt;=um; lv=v&lt;=um;
 feo= lu.*lv.*fgu + lu.*~lv.*fguvum + ~lu.*lv.*fgum + ~lu.*~lv.*fgv;
The right-hand side of the linear system and the block-triangular matrix is assembled in the routine
 function [M b]=Mb(g,u)
 global Au J dt dx epsilon
 F=feo(g,u(1:J-1), u(2:J)); % f_{j+1/2}
 Ax=Au(floor(u.*(u&gt;=0).*(u&lt;=1)*length(Au))+(u&lt;1));
 b=dt/dx*([F(1:J-1);0]-[0;F(1:J-1)])-dt/dx^2*([Ax(1:J-1);0]-[0;Ax(2:J)]-[Ax(1:J-1);0]+[0;Ax(1:J-1)]);
 ax=a(u);
 epsilon=1e-5;
 F1eps=feo(g,u(2:J)+epsilon,u(1:J-1));
 F2eps=feo(g,u(2:J),u(1:J-1)+epsilon); 
 Jminus=(F1eps-F)/epsilon;
 Jplus=(F2eps-F)/epsilon;
 M1=-dt/dx*[Jminus(1:J-1)] - dt/dx^2*[ax(1:J-1)];
 M2=1+dt/dx*([Jminus(1:J-1);0] - [0;Jplus(1:J-1)]) + 2*dt/dx^2*ax;
 M3=dt/dx*[Jplus(1:J-1)]-dt/dx^2*[ax(2:J)];
 M=diag(M1,-1)+diag(M2,0)+diag(M3,1);
such that the direct problem can be solved by
 function U = S(g,u,T)
 global dt
 U=u;
 for dt=diff(T)
   [M b]=Mb(g,u);
   du=M\b;
   u=u+du;
   U=[U,u];
 end
The time steps of the numerical method are adapted to the measurment times. They can be refined by the factor 2 by the following mfile:
 function T = refinetime(T) 
 dThalf=diff(T)/2; 
 taxis=2:2:2*length(T)-2; 
 dT(taxis)=dThalf; 
 dT(taxis-1)=dThalf; 
 Tnew=cumsum(dT); 
 T=Tnew; 

==== Optimization ====
As result of the numerical simulation, one obtains a grid of computed volume fractions. From this grid one can extract a computed upper interface.

First, an upper and a lower bound on the grid, consisting of two neighboring cells has to be found for each time. The computational interface is yielt by linear interpolation.
 function h=interface(U,u)
 [uupper iupper]=max(U-u - (U-u&gt;0));
 [ulower ilower]=min(U-u + (U-u&lt;0)); 
 h=X(iupper)+(X(ilower)-X(iupper)).*(0-uupper)./(ulower-uupper);
Qdq computes Q and dq is used in the main optimization step
 function [Q dq]=Qdq(e)
 global epsilon
 q=cost(e,0);
 for K=[1 2], q1(K)=cost(e,K); end
 for K=[1 1 2 2; 1 2 1 2]; q2(K(1),K(2))=cost(e,K); end
 dq=(q1-q)/epsilon;
 Q=(q2'-2*q1'*[1,1]+q)/epsilon^2;
 % the last computation is a short form for
 %
 % Q11=(q2(1,1) - 2*q1(1)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % Q22=(q2(2,2) - 2*q1(2)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % Q12=(q2(2,1) - 2*q1(1)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % Q21=(q2(1,2) - 2*q1(2)+q)/epsilon^2;
 % 
 % Q=[Q11 Q12; Q21 Q22];
The cost function is evaluated as
 q=function cost(e,K)
 global T H u0
 parametershift(e,K)
 U=S('f',T);
 q=norm(h-H);
The small variation over the parameters is done by a parametershift
 function parametershift(e,K)
 global uinf C a0 uc k epsilon emask
 eder=[]; for j=K, eder=[eder, emask(j)]; end
 I=diag(ones(size(e)));
 eplus=e+sum(I(eder,:))*epsilon;
 uinf=eplus(1); C=eplus(2); a0=eplus(3);  uc=eplus(4); k=eplus(5);

=== Testing of direct scheme ===
The constitutive assumptions can be plotted by
 global umax uinf C a0 uc k
 umax=0.66; uinf=1; C=5; a0=1; uc=0.1; k=3;
 u=(0:0.01:1)'; au=a(u); fu=f(u);
 subplot(2,1,1); plot(u,au); subplot(2,1,2); plot(u,fu)
The maximum of the flux function which is used in the Engquist-Osher numerical flux is computed as
 global um; [gm im]=max(fu); um=u(im); 
 subplot(2,1,2); hold on; plot(um,gm,'gx')
The integral A is calculated by the [[NumericM:Numerical Integration|trapezoidal rule]]
 global Au
 Au=[0;cumsum(([au(1:length(u)-1);0]+[au(2:length(u));0])/2)];
 subplot(2,1,2); cla; plot(u,Au)
Testing Mb
 global dt dx; dx=max(H)/5; X=(0:dx:max(H));
 u=0.123*ones(size(X'));
 global J; J=length(u);
 [M b]=Mb('f',u)
Testing S
 T=[0:0.01:0.04];
 U=S('f',u,T);
 figure(1); hold on; for u=U, plot(u,1:length(u)),pause; end

=== One optimization step === 
A single optimization step is performed by
 global epsilon; epsilon=1e-5;
 global u0; u0=0.123*ones(J,1);

 e=[1 2 3 4 5];
 [Q dq] = Qdq(e);
 de=Q\dq;
 e=e+de;
where the above defined subroutines are employed.

=== Time estimate for reasonable accuracy ===
Time estimate for reasonable accuracy, where J=100 and T=100, the main loop Mb has to be called 700 times for one optimization step.
 tic, for k=1:1000;  [M b]=Mb('f',u); end; toc
gives: &quot;Elapsed time is 14.469154 seconds.&quot;
This is rather reasonable.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Adult Low Grade Glioma'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Overview==
*Relatively slow-growing primary brain tumors
*Account for ~10% of primary CNS tumors in USA
*Median age at diagnosis is 40's for adult tumors, and teens for pilocytic astrocytoma
*Heterogenous clinical presentation ranging from seizure only to functional deficits 
*Classified as Grade I or Grade II by WHO; common histologic subtypes include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and mixed oligoastrocytomas. 
*Anaplastic transformation to high grade is common, in 70-80% patients
*Surgery is typically first option
*RT may be offered as adjuvant or as salvage; while time-to-progression and control of seizures is better with adjuvant RT, there is no difference in overall survival
*There does not seem a strong dose response between 45 and 65 Gy based on two randomized trails (EORTC 22844 compared 45 Gy vs. 59.4 Gy, INTERGROUP compared 50.4 Gy vs. 64.8 Gy); as a result, NCCN recommends 45 - 54 Gy as a reasonable dose
*5-year overall survival is 60-70%, while progression-free survival is 40-50%


==Prognostic Factors==
'''''1p/19q fusion or deletion'''''
*'''NCCTG Trials; 2006''' PMID 17047046 -- &quot;A t(1;19)(q10;p10) mediates the combined deletions of 1p and 19q and predicts a better prognosis of patients with oligodendroglioma.&quot; (Jenkins RB, Cancer Res. 2006 Oct 15;66(20):9852-61).
**119 patients enrolled on 2 low-grade glioma NCCTG trials. Translocation t(1;19) evaluated by FISH
**Fusion prevalence: oligodendroglioma 55%, mixed oligoastrocytoma 47%, astrocytoma 0%
**Median OS: all patients - fusion/deletion 11.9 years vs. no fusion 8.1 years (SS); oligodendroglioma only - fusion/deletion 13.0 years vs. no fusion 9.1 years (SS)
**Conclusion: t(1;19) mediates combined 1p/19q deletion, and is associated with superior OS and PFS in low-grade gliomas


'''''Prognostic Grouping'''''
*'''EORTC 22844/22845'''
**'''2002''' PMID 11956268, &quot;Prognostic factors for survival in adult patients with cerebral low-grade glioma.&quot; (Pignatti F et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Apr 15;20(8):2076-84.)
**EORTC 22844 (construction set = 322 patients) and EORTC 22845 (validation set = 288 patients)

==Adjuvant RT Dose==
*'''EORTC 22844''' (1985-1991) &quot;Believers Trial&quot;
**Randomized. 343 patients. Age 16-65. Included astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma. Excluded completely excised pilocytic astrocytoma. Surgery first. Randomized to low dose 45 Gy vs high dose 59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fx. RT technique: 2 cm margin around enhancing tumor to 45 Gy, reduced field 1 cm margin to 54 Gy and minimal margin to 59.4 Gy.

Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Oct 1;36(3):549-56. Median F/U 6.2 years
***5-year outcome: No difference in OS (58% vs 59%) or PFS (47% vs 50%)
***Predictors: Age, size, neurologic status, amount of surgery
***Conclusion: No dose response above 45 Gy
**'''Quality of life; 1998''' PMID 10023313 -- &quot;Quality of life after radiation therapy of cerebral low-grade gliomas of the adult: results of a randomised phase III trial on dose response (EORTC trial 22844).

***Questionnaire, 47 items
***Outcome: high RT group had more fatigue/malaise, emotional functioning
***Conclusion: 45/25 schedule better

*'''Intergroup NCCTG/RTOG/ECOG''' (1986-1994)
**Randomized. 203 patients. Age &gt;18. Included low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, or mixed oligoastrocytoma; pilocytic astrocytomas were excluded. Randomized to 50.4 Gy vs 64.8 Gy. RT technique: 2 cm margin around preoperative tumor volume, 1 cm margin for boost after 50.4 Gy.

***5-year outcome: OS low dose 72% vs. high dose 65% (NS); time-to-progression 58% vs. 52% (NS). Failure within field 92%
***Toxicity: more often and more severely in high dose arm (2.5% vs 5%)
***Poor prognosis: astrocytoma, age &gt;40, tumor &gt;=5 cm (5-year OS if &lt;40 and oligodendroglioma 82% vs. &gt;40 and astrocytoma 32%)
***Conclusion: No benefit for higher RT dose
**'''MMSE Cognitive; 2003''' PMID 12829670 -- &quot;Effects of radiotherapy on cognitive function in patients with low-grade glioma measured by the folstein mini-mental state examination.&quot; (Brown PD, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 1;21(13):2519-24.)
***Prospective. 203 patients evaluated with Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline and follow-up. Median F/U 7.4 years
***7.4-year outcome: Stable MMSE in 95% patients without tumor progression. If abnormal baseline MMSE, experienced significant improvement after treatment
***Conclusion: Most patients had stable neurocognitive status on MMSE after RT
**'''Full Cognitive; 2005''' PMID 15964709 -- &quot;Cognitive function after radiotherapy for supratentorial low-grade glioma: a North Central Cancer Treatment Group prospective study.&quot; (Laack NN, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Nov 15;63(4):1175-83.)
***Subset. 20 patients (10 low dose, 10 high dose) treated at Mayo Clinic. Evaluated with extensive battery of tests at baseline, and then every 1.5 years. Median F/U 3 years
***Outcome: baseline scores below average compared with age-specific norms. No changes in cognitive performance regardless of stratification (dose, age, location, type, or resection)
***Conclusion: Cognitive function stable after RT


==Early vs Delayed Radiotherapy==
*'''EORTC 22845''' (1986-1997) &quot;Non-Believers Trial&quot;
**Randomized. 314 patients. Age 16-65. Supratentorial low grade astrocytoma, low grade oligoastrocytoma, or low grade oligodendroglioma. Excluded small completely resected [[Radiation_Oncology/Pilocytic_Astrocytoma|pilocytic astrocytomas]], [[Radiation_Oncology/Optic_Pathway_Glioma|optic nerve gliomas]], brainstem gliomas, third ventricle gliomas, and infratentorial gliomas. Surgery first. Randomized to early radiotherapy with 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fx) vs delayed radiotherapy until the time of progression. CT with contrast every 4 months until progression. Technique: preop CT + 2 cm margins to 45 Gy, reduced field to 1 cm after 45 Gy.
**'''2005''' PMID 16168780 &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term efficacy of early versus delayed radiotherapy for low-grade astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma in adults: the EORTC 22845 randomised trial.&quot; (van den Bent MJ et al. The Lancet Volume 366, Issue 9490, 17 September 2005, Pages 985-990.) Median F/U 7.8 years
***Outcome: Median PFS early RT 5.3 yrs vs delayed RT 3.4 yrs (SS). 5-year PFS 55% vs. 35% (SS).  Median OS 7.4 vs 7.2 yrs (NS), 5-year OS 68.4% vs 65.7% (NS). 65% of pts in control group received RT at progression, 4% in early RT received salvage RT.  At 1 yr, better control of seizures in early RT group (25% vs. 41%, SS).
***After progression: survival early RT 1.0 years vs. delayed RT 3.4 years (SS). ~70% transformed to high grade tumors, regardless if they had RT or not. Most recurrences within field
***Toxicity (compared at 1 year for patients still tumor free at 2 years): No difference in cognitive deficit, focal deficit, performance status, or headaches. 
**Conclusion: Early RT lengthens PFS and controls seizures, but doesn't impact OS
**Comment: Tumor planning off CT, central path showed 26% were high grade tumors but balanced between arms, no QoL analysis. Lack of OS difference likely due to effectiveness of salvage RT

==RT +/- Chemotherapy==
*'''RTOG 98-02 / INT''' (1998-2002) -- RT +/- PCV
**Randomized arm + observation arm. 362 patients, WHO Grade II supratentorial astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, or oligodendroglioma

==Epidemiology==
*Most common &lt;u&gt;benign&lt;/u&gt; brain tumor
**Approximately 95%
*Represents 20% of primary intracranial neoplasms.
*Occur mostly in age group 40-70 yrs old, increasing in incidence with age, and peaking at 70.
*F&gt;M 2:1

==Risk Factors==
*Prior radiation therapy
**Treatment of tinea capitis with radiation is classic scenario of radiation induced meningioma.
**PCI increases incidence of meningioma by 10X baseline rate.
**Median interval between radiation treatment and development of meningioma is ~20 yrs.
*Type II Neurofibromatosis
*Hormone replacement therapy in women


*'''Mayo Clinic; 2008''' (1993-2003) PMID 18182668 -- &quot;Is there an association between meningioma and hormone replacement therapy?&quot; (Blitshteyn S, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):279-82.)
**Retrospective. 1390 women with meningioma, 11% current/past HRT users
**Outcome: OR for HRT use and meningioma 2.2 (SS)
**Conclusion: Positive association between HRT use and diagnosis for meningioma

*CT
**Well-defined extra-axial mass that displaces normal brain. Smooth in contour, sometimes calcified
**About 60% hyperdense with normal brain without contrast
**About 70% brightly and homogenously enhance with contrast (less frequent in malignant or cystic meningiomas)
*MRI
**Preferred imaging because it can show dural origin
**Dural tail sign seen in about two-thirds: characteristic marginal thickening that tapers peripherally along the dura
**Isointense on T1, hyperintense (usually homogeneously) on T2, strong enhancement with IV contrast
*PET
**May have a role in predicting aggressiveness of meningioma: more aggressive tumors appear to have significantly higher mean rate of glucose utilization

==WHO Classification==
*'''Benign''' (Grade I) - (90%) - meningothelial, fibrous, transitional, psammomatous, angioblastic (most aggressive)
*'''Atypical''' (Grade II) - (7%) - choroid, clear cell, atypical
*'''Anaplastic/Malignant''' (Grade III) - (2%) - papillary, rhabdoid, anaplastic


*'''Korea; 2007''' (1986-2004) PMID 17766430 -- &quot;Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas: prognostic implication of clinicopathological features.&quot; (Yang SY, J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2007 Aug 31)
**Retrospective. 74 patients with high grade (33 atypical, 41 anaplastic). Reclassified according to 2000 WHO. Mean F/U 4.8 years
**Outcome: OS atypical 11.9 years vs. anaplastic 3.3 years; RFS atypical 11.5 years vs. anaplastic 2.7 years
**If atypical, brain invasion and RT didn't improve survival; if anaplastic, prognostic factors were brain invasion, adjuvant RT, p53 overexpression, extent of resection
**Conclusion: 2000 WHO classification better than previous criteria

==Treatment Overview==
*Treatment can range from conservative management to definitive surgery, adjuvant radiation or definitive radiation/radiosurgery.
*Patients with small asymptomatic meningiomas found incidentally can be observed until they grow or become symptomatic.
*Indications for adjuvant radiation therapy:  incomplete resection and high grade tumor.  Tx to dose of 54 Gy for Grade I and 60 Gy for Grade II-III.
*Cavernous sinus meningioma represent a scenario where SRS is particularly useful given the potential morbidity of surgical resection in that region.
*[http://www.uptodate.com/ UpToDate] recommendations (version 15.2, 4/2007)
**Small, asymptomatic meningioma: careful observation with re-imaging in 3-6 months
***If no growth at first F/U, routine imaging q1 year
***If tumor growth, active treatment
**Young patients with asymptomatic meningioma: consider surgery
**Symptomatic, large, infiltrative, or edematous lesions should be treated with surgery and/or RT
***If anatomically accessible: attempt surgical resection
***Simpson Grade I: no adjuvant therapy
***Simpson Grade II-III and benign: no adjuvant therapy
***Simpson Grade II-III and atypical/malignant: adjuvant RT
***Simpson Grade IV: adjuvant RT
**For patients who are unresectable, not surgical candidates, or refuse surgery, offer primary RT

==Observation==
*Majority (~2/3) of asymptomatic, incidentally found meningiomas are stable on imaging. If they progress, the rate of growth tends to be 2-4 mm per year and tumor doubling time is on average 20 years
*Calcified and hypointense on T2 meningiomas appear less likely to progress; elderly patients appear to have slower growth rates
*Reasonable to consider observation for asymptomatic meningiomas, particularly in elderly patients or patients with skull-base (high operative risk) tumors. If so, MRI at 3 months, then 6 months later, then annually is considered reasonable 
*For younger patients and patients with non-calcified tumors, consider treatment due to higher expected growth rates


*'''Tel Aviv; 2004''' (Israel)(1989-1999) PMID 15452322 -- &quot;Natural history of conservatively treated meningiomas.&quot; (Herscovici Z, Neurology. 2004 Sep 28;63(6):1133-4.)
**Retrospective. 43 patients, 51 meningiomas
**Outcome: 63% no growth, 37% growth (mean growth rate 4 mm / year)
**Predictors: younger age, sphenoid ridge location, non calcified, hyperintense on MRI T2 predicted for growth

*'''Hannover; 2003''' PMID 12823874 -- &quot;The natural history of incidental meningiomas.&quot; (Nakamura M, Neurosurgery. 2003 Jul;53(1):62-70; discussion 70-1.)
**Retrospective. 47 asymptomatic patients reviewed. 41 (87%) managed conservatively, 6 surgery
**Outcome: volumetric growth mean 0.8 cm3 / year, 66% growth rates &lt;1 cm3 / year; tumor doubling mean 22 years (1.3 - 143 years). Higher growth rates in younger patients. No correlation between initial size and doubling time. Less likely to progress if calcified
**Conclusion: Majority of incidental meningiomas minimal growth; can be managed conservatively

*'''Mayo; 1998''' PMID 9855530 -- &quot;The natural history of asymptomatic meningiomas in Olmsted County, Minnesota.&quot; (Go RS, Neurology. 1998 Dec;51(6):1718-20.)
**Retrospective. 35 asymptomatic patients found incidentally. Mean F/U 6.2 years
**Outcome: 88% stable, 12% progressed, 3% (1 patient) developed symptoms. Less likely to progress if calcified 

*'''Northwestern; 1997''' PMID 9153494 -- &quot;Meningiomas: the decision not to operate.&quot; (Braunstein JB, Neurology. 1997 May;48(5):1459-62.)
**Retrospective. 12 patients managed conservatively in 100 consecutive meningiomas, either with no symptoms or high operative risk. Mean F/U 8.8 years
**Outcome: growth in 1/12 patients

*'''Illinois; 1995''' PMID 7616265 -- &quot;The natural history and growth rate of asymptomatic meningiomas: a review of 60 patients.&quot; (Olivero WC, J Neurosurg. 1995 Aug;83(2):222-4.)
**Retrospective. 60 patients diagnosed with asymptomatic meningioma. 45 patietns follow up scans at 3 months, 9 months, then q 1 year. Average F/U 2.7 years (0.5-15).
**Outcome: 67% no growth (average F/U 2.4 years, max 6 years); 22% tumor growth (2.4 mm per year, range 2 mm - 1 cm) 
**Conclusion: Need for close follow-up to rule out rapidly enlarging tumors

==Surgical Management==
*Frequently considered for symptomatic patients, younger patients, and patients with expanding/infiltrating tumors
*Complications: range 2-30% depending on location and type
*Mortality: range 1-14%; worse in elderly
*Resectability plays an important role:
**Completeness of resection - '''Simpson Grade''' PMID 13406590 - predicts for likelihood of local recurrence
**Gross total resection (Grade I-III) in ~80%, leading to 10-year PFS of ~80%
**Subtotal resection typically in cavernous sinus, petroclival region, posterior superior sagittal sinus, and optic nerve sheath tumors; have 4.2x relative excess death risk compared to complete resection
{| border=&quot;1&quot; 
! Simpson Grade !! Completeness of Resection !! 10-year Recurrence
|- 
| Grade I || complete removal including resection of underlying bone and associated dura || align=&quot;center&quot; | 9%
|-
| Grade II || complete removal + coagulation of dural attachment || align=&quot;center&quot; |  19%
|-
| Grade III || complete removal w/o resection of dura or coagulation || align=&quot;center&quot; |  29%
|-
| Grade IV || subtotal resection || align=&quot;center&quot; |  40%

**Retrospective. 935 patients treated with surgery.
**Outcome: 1-year DSS 91%, 15-year DSS 78%; subtotal resection 4.2x risk of death; malignant histology 4.6x risk of death

==Adjuvant Radiation==
*'''Germany''' (1985-2009) -- Atypical and malignant meningiomas
**62 pts w/ atypical and 23 pts w/ malignant meningiomas, s/p RT (60% after surgical resection, 19% at disease progression, 8% as primary treatment). Average dose 57.6 Gy in 1.8-3 Gy fx.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several ways to express giving and receiving depending on which side the speaker is on, but also depending on whether someone of higher or lower rank is being addressed.

== Giving ==
[[File:Japanese Verbs of Giving.png|thumb|360px|This schematic illustrates the various verbs for giving and receiving.]]

When expressing that someone '''gives''' to someone else (but not you), use the form of:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| valign=&quot;middle&quot; | (Giver) || は&lt;br /&gt;が || (Receiver) に (object) を
| {{furi|差|さ|し}}{{furi|上|あ|げる}}。&lt;br /&gt;
{{furi|上|あ|げる}}。&lt;br /&gt;
やる。&lt;ref&gt;The verb &quot;やる&quot; is rather disrespectful and would only be used by boys joking with each other.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

When others give you, use either:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| valign=&quot;middle&quot; | (Giver) || は&lt;br /&gt;が || (you) に (object) を
| {{furi|下|くだ|さる}}&lt;br /&gt;くれる
|}

{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|先生|せんせい}}に{{furi|本|ほん}}を{{furi|差|さ|し}}{{furi|上|あ|げます}}。 // I give the teacher the book.
}}
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|妹|いもうと}}にお{{furi|菓子|かし}}をあげる。 // I give my sister candy. (plain present)
: {{furi|私達|わたしたち}}は{{furi|猫|ねこ}}にボールをあげた。 // We gave the cat a ball. (plain past)
: {{furi|彼女|かのじょ}}は{{furi|先生|せんせい}}に{{furi|林檎|りんご}}をあげます。 // The girl gives an apple to the teacher. (polite present)
: {{furi|友達|ともだち}}はお{{furi|母|かあ}}さんにカードをあげました。 // My friend gave his mom a card. (polite past)
}}

The polite form is &quot;くださる&quot; while &quot;くれる&quot; is of neutral politeness and most commonly used. You will often use this verb when you've gotten something from someone who isn't currently there.
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|先生|せんせい}}は{{furi|私|わたし}}に{{furi|本|ほん}}を{{furi|下|くだ|さいました}}。 // The teacher gave me a book.
}}
{{Japanese example|
: あなたは{{furi|私|わたし}}にビデオをくれる。 // I get a video from you.
: {{furi|岸子|きしこ}}は{{furi|私|わたし}}にマンガをくれた。 // I received a manga from kishiko.
}}

== Receiving ==

When expressing that someone '''receives''' from someone else, use a form of:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| valign=&quot;middle&quot; | (Receiver) || は&lt;br /&gt;が || (Giver)
| に&lt;br /&gt;から
| (object) を
| {{furi|頂|いただ|く}}&lt;br /&gt;{{furi|貰|もら|う}}.
|}

Although に is slightly more casual, you can use both に and から when you receive some physical objecs. For actions, you can only use に. Use から when you wish to emphasize the giver.

{{Japanese example|
: クリスマスが{{furi|来|き|たら}}、お{{furi|婆|ばあ}}ちゃんに{{furi|新車|しんしゃ}}をもらうと{{furi|思|おも|う}}。 // When Christmas comes, I think I'll get a new car from grandma. (''plain form'')
: {{furi|誕生日|たんじょうび}}に、{{furi|梓|あずさ}}はお{{furi|父|とう}}さんから250,000円をもらったそうです！ // For her birthday, I heard that Azusa received 250,000 yen from her dad! (''polite form'')&lt;ref&gt;In this case, 誕生日に、梓はお父さん&quot;から&quot;～ may be better because you can avoid &quot;に、... に&quot; form&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{furi|彼女|かのじょ}}は{{furi|王子|おうじ}}と{{furi|結婚|けっこん|したら}}、{{furi|女王|じょおう}}に{{furi|多|おお|く}}の{{furi|宝石|ほうせき}}をもらいます。 //  When she marries the prince, she will receive many jewels from the queen. (''polite form'')
: お{{furi|母|かあ}}さんに{{furi|新|あたら|しい}}パソコンをもらいました！ // I got a new computer from my mother! (''polite form'')
}}
The verb いただく is a humble verb, and is used when you receive something from a superior or wish to show respect.

Example:
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|先生|せんせい}}にペンをいただきました。 // I received a pen from the teacher.
}}

== Actions ==
When the object being given or received is an action (and thus expressed by a verb) you can attach use it in the て-form in place of the object.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| (Giver) は
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | (Verb in 〜て form)
| (Verb of giving)。
|-
| (Receiver) に || (Verb of receiving)。
|}
Note that for receiving an action, you cannot use &quot;から&quot;.

Examples for giving, &quot;I washed the car for her,&quot; or, &quot;I did the laundry for him.&quot; Here are some examples in Japanese:

{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|私|わたし}}はアパートの{{furi|掃除|そうじ}}をしてあげました。 // I cleaned the apartment (for him/her). (polite form)
: {{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|晩|ばん}}ご{{furi|飯|はん}}を{{furi|作|つく|って}}あげた。 // I made dinner (for him or her). (plain form)
}}
Examples for receiving, &quot;The dentist examined my teeth for me,&quot; or &quot;Mom cleaned up my room for me.&quot; Here are some examples:
{{Japanese example|
: {{furi|医者|いしゃ}}に{{furi|診|み|て}}もらいました。 // The doctor examined me (for me). (''polite form'')
: {{furi|彼氏|かれし}}に{{furi|新|あたら|しい}}{{furi|車|くるま}}を{{furi|買|か|って}}もらった！ // My boyfriend bought a new car for me! (''plain form'')
}}

[[Image:09-crust_blended.jpg|thumb|right|Pastry Blender with blended butter and flour]]

A '''pastry blender''' or '''pastry cutter''' is a device used to cut a solid [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] (such as [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]) evenly into a dry, usually [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]-based, mixture. A pastry cutter will typically have four or five blades or stiff wires running parallel, which curve into a handle on both ends creating a &quot;D&quot; shape.

The purpose of a pastry blender is to distribute the fat into the mixture without combining them. When a dough made with this technique is rolled flat, these small pieces of fat are extended to discs in different levels of the dough. When this dough is cooked, the fat forms small pockets which give pastry its delicate and flaky texture.

A pair of butter knives is typically an acceptable substitute for a pastry cutter, though the process may be slower.</text>

== To add ''Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide'' to the ''See also'' section ==

Besides the Reference Manual, it could be interesting that every page references to the ''[http://www.adaic.com/docs/95style/html/cover.html Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide]'' at the [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing#See also|See also]] section:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 === Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide ===

 * [http://www.adaic.com/docs/95style/html/sec_5/5-5-5.html 5.5.5 Short Circuit Forms of the Logical Operators]
 * [http://www.adaic.com/docs/95style/html/sec_10/10-5-2.html 10.5.2 Short-Circuit Operators]
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Also, why make links to the &quot;plain&quot; [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TOC.html Reference Manual] and not to the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95aarm/html/AA-TOC.html Anotated one]?

--[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 14:47, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I agree about the Style Guide. The rationale is also a good source of information. Maybe we should look for a more compact layout for these external references if we end linking to all of them. About the anotated manual, I'm not sure, usually the annotations are aimed to compiler developers more than to the Ada programmer, aren't they? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 12:53, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I agree about the Style Guide. I don't think the AARM is good for a tutorial. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:57, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Well, the RM is not very good for a tutorial neither :-) -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 11:40, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

=== No '95 ===

Hello again. I propose to change the title of that section to &quot;Ada Quality and Style Guide&quot; (and not &quot;Ada '''95''' Quality and Style Guide&quot;). Maybe in the future there will be a new style guide for Ada 2005 (I hope so, but I don't know about any plan to make that effort), but the main reason is because that title looks like &quot;old&quot;. If you are agree I can make all the changes. Best regards. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 10:54, July 22, 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with you, surueña. It would look a bit old when Ada 2005 is published. In the case that a new guide is published we will change the &quot;current style guide&quot; templates ([[Template:Ada/SG1]], etc) to the new one, otherwise all the information present is still applicable for Ada 2005. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 13:46, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:Sure, lets change it. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 14:53, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

::OK, I'm working on it --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 19:57, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

== Templates ==

Templates are very powerful. Until now I've created two of them:
* [[Template:Ada/Keywords]]
* [[Template:Adakw]]
The former is a table with references to every keyword, and it is intended to be used in all pages of [[Ada Programming/Keywords]] (but I can't center it!). The latter could be used when a keyword appears, and not only in souce code examples but also if mentioned in a text (but surrounded with &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;), thus is very, very compact, instead of the first one. I propose to make more templates like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
* Operators:      [[Template:Adaop]]
* Types:          [[Template:Adatype]]
* Attributes      [[Template:Adaatt]]
* Pragmas:        [[Template:Adapragma]]
* Packages:       [[Template:Adapackage]]
* Child Packages: [[Template:Adapackage]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
They are not made yet because I haven't decided a good name. Maybe for keywords and operators that one is OK, but for the others [[Template:Ada-pragma]] is better. Any ideas? -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 11:38, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I prefer separating the words and I think that using [[Template:Ada:pragma]] or [[Template:Ada/pragma]] would be the proper wiki style. I also propose to define a template for the external links to the ARM and the Style Guide so it defends ourselves againts future web changes. For example, see: [[Template:Ada/RM2]] (two chapters deep) which can be instantiated this way:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/RM2|4|4|Expressions}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Resulting:
{{Ada/RM2|4|4|Expressions}}
And when Ada 2005 is finished we can change all the links to the new standard easily! [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:24, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Any of those two new naming conventions for the templates seems OK to me. You don't say anything, but for keywords I still would use a more compact name. I'm agree that those new templates for external links are very helpful. And I would also add some more templates for presentation purposes (comments, literals...). -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 18:44, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::I agree about adakw template but we can always make a redirect for orthogonallity (let's see: [[Template:Ada/kw]]). I tried making [[Template:Ada]] a parent page for all the Ada/ templates that we would define, but surprisingly the subpages are not linked with it, so I suppose the subpage feature does not work for templates (or it's a cache problem). I intended to insert it in this Contributing page but if it is not working as a parent page for all our templates I'm not sure of its usefulness. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:57, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:::[[Template:Ada/kw]] works! A template redirect {{Ada/kw|renames}} a template. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:01, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)


I've added another template: [[Template:Ada/comment]]. This one is a formatting template, putting the text in italics silver font (of course, change the colors/face if you wish). And note that the template puts &quot;-- &quot; in front of the text:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/comment|This is a comment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;          {{Ada/comment|This is a comment}}

I wanted to make more formatting templates like strings literals or numeric literals, but I think they are not necesary. In my opinion, in the source code examples of the wikibook it's important that keywords are easily identified (bold face) because beginers have to learn them first. Also, comments should be visually distinc because someone could think they are part of the code (after all -- is an very well known operator of C and other common languages). As I said, we could make similar templates for literals and so on, but in my opinion they are more helpful in an IDE than in a book. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 21:28, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I aggree with the new template and all you say. Regarding the colour I probably will change it because it is too light, almost unreadable in my screen, though don't know what colour or gray tone to choose. On the other hand, Ada/-- might be a good alias for the template, isn't it? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:53, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::OK, the shortcut [[Template:Ada/--]] added to the [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing|contributing page]]. If there are more visualization problems with the current formatting of comments, please feel free to make any change (currently comments are seen OK in my computer). --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 09:42, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Headings capitalization ==

Following the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)#Capitalisation|Manual of Style of Wikipedia]], the capitalisation of the sections's headings are the first letter of the first word only, i.e. like a normal sentence. For example:

* '''See also'''
* '''External links'''
* '''The Ada Reference Manual and other documents'''

This isn't only a convention of the Wikipedia, but also is followed in every english book that I've seen. Although note that for the title of a chapter (almost) every word must be capitalised (except definite/indefinite articles). --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 14:14, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Well we have different rules here in Germany which might have leaked into Programming:Ada - so just correct it.

== Book of the month ==

How about a run at: [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] - there are not that many votes so I think we might have chance.

:Yes, let's try. I'm not sure if we can defend the nomination, but a good argument is that ours is the biggest programming book on Wikibooks [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm] (being quality a difficult measure I think we win in that aspect too). The problem may be that people usually prefer less technical books. Would we contest for August or is it a bit late? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

=== November ===

Timing could be tricky indeed - and yes for August it is to late - rather think of November.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

: Why wait so much? Do you think we should expand more the book or prepare something? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:53, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

:: Ups - I wanted to say &quot;Sebtember&quot; for which voting starts on monday.

Voting for September has started so I have nominated Programming:Ada. Please, vote and give publicity to the nomination. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:58, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

: I added my vote an a little supporting comment --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:02, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

== Moving the Standard Libraries ==

In my opinion, there are some advantages in moving the Standard Libraries from the [[Ada Programming/Packages|Packages:]] domain name, to the [[Ada Programming/Libraries|Libraries:]] one:

* The Standard Libraries do not only have packages, but also generic subprograms (like Ada.Unckecked_Conversion), that aren't currently covered in [[Ada Programming/Packages/Ada]] and they should be.
* To be able to use the [[Template:Ada/package]] not only with entities of the Standard Library, but also with packages/subprograms of other libraries, e.g., in demo code, to be able to put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Ada/package 2|Gwindows|Databases}} resulting in a link to [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Gwindows.Databases]].
* To leave to &quot;entire&quot; domain [[Ada Programming/Packages|Packages:]] for explaining the concepts of packages (limited, private, ...). Currently alhtough its submodules lists the Standard Libraries the module [[Ada Programming/Packages]] is used to explain the theory behind packages, but it would be more intuitive to list in the parent module all the libraries.
So I think we should:

# Move all the modules about Standard Libraries to the domain name [[Ada Programming/Libraries|Libraries:]] (not a lot of work because many packages haven't got its own module), leaving redirections from the old location to the new one, 
# Modify the [[Template:Ada/package]], [[Template:Ada/package 2]], [[Template:Ada/package 3]] and [[Template:Ada/package 4]] -- and thus working with every library unit (maybe also rename this templates to [[Template:Ada/lib unit]] or something like that because they also cover generic subprograms?).
# Create references to generic subprograms, they are part of the Standard Libraries too. 
Again, if you agree with me I volunteer to do the job, it's easy. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 08:10, July 29, 2005 (UTC)

: Fine by me - however I think our priority should be to reduce [[:Category:Ada Programming/Empty module]] --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:47, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even though it is tried to keep this chapter on '''Parameter Identification of Flocculated Suspensions''' as self-comprehensive as possible, preliminar knowledge on [[numerical Methods]] and the [[Sedimentation:Modeling|Modeling of suspensions]] are useful. In particular, the [[Numerical Methods/Equation Solving#Newton-Raphson|Newton-Raphson]] scheme to solve nonlinear systems of equations for the optimization and Finite-Volume-Methods for the solution of [[wikipedia:Partial differential equation|partial differential equations]] are applied.

== Introduction ==
== Modeling of flocculated supensions ==
The batch settling process of flocculated suspensions is modeled as an intitial value problem

&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f(u)}{\partial x} 
= \frac{\partial A^2(u)}{\partial x^2}, 
\quad
u(0,x)=u_0(), \quad x \in [0,L]
&lt;/math&gt; 

where
&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
denotes the volume fraction of the dispersed solids phase.
For the closure, the convective flux function is given by the Kynch batch settling function with Richardson-Zaki hindrance function

&lt;math&gt;
f(u) = \left \{ \begin{matrix}
&amp; u_{\infty} u (1-u)^C &amp; \mbox{for } 0 \le u &lt; u_{\max} \\
&amp; 0 &amp; \mbox{for } u \le 0 \mbox{ and } u \ge u_{\max} 
\end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt; 

and the diffusive flux is given by 

&lt;math&gt;
  A(u)=\int_0^{u} a(s) ds, \quad
  a(u)= a_0 (1-u)^C u^{k-1} ,
&lt;/math&gt; 

which results from the insertion of the power law 

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{\mathrm{e}}(u) = \left \{ \begin{matrix}
\sigma_0 \left ( \left ( \frac{u}{u_{\mathrm{c}}} \right )^k - 1    \right )  &amp; \mbox{for } u_{\mathrm{c}}&lt; u \\
0 &amp; \mbox{for } u \le u_{\mathrm{c}}
\end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt; 

into

&lt;math&gt;
  a(u)= \frac{f(u) \sigma_{\mathrm{e}}'(u)}{\Delta \varrho g u}, \quad
  a_0=\frac{u_\infty \sigma_0 k }{\Delta \varrho g u_{\mathrm{c}}^k} .
&lt;/math&gt; 

In the closure, the constants
&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; u_{\infty}, C, a_0, u_{\max}, k &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
are partly known.

== Numerical scheme ==
The numerical scheme for the solution of the direct problem is written in conservative form as a marching formula for the interior points (&quot;interior scheme&quot;) as
&lt;math&gt;
u_j^{n+1}=u_j^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left ( f_{j+1/2}^{n+1} -  f_{j-1/2}^{n+1} \right )
+ \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{j-1}^{n+1})  - 2 A(u_{j}^{n+1}) + A(u_{j+1}^{n+1}) \right ),
\quad j = 2, \dots, J-1 
&lt;/math&gt; 

and at the bondaries (&quot;boundary scheme&quot;) as

&lt;math&gt;
u_1^{n+1}=u_1^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} f_{j+1/2}^{n+1} + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{j+1}^{n+1})  - A(u_{j}^{n+1}) \right ), \quad 
u_J^{n+1}=u_J^n + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} f_{J-1/2}^{n+1} - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{J}^{n+1})  - A(u_{J-1}^{n+1}) \right )
&lt;/math&gt; 

For a first-order scheme, the numerical flux function becomes

&lt;math&gt;
f_{j+1/2}^{n} = f(u_{j}^n, u_{j+1}^n) .
&lt;/math&gt; 
If the flux function has one single maximum, denoted by

&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; u_{\mathrm{m}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, 
the Engquist-Osher numerical flux function can be stated as

&lt;math&gt;
f^{\mathrm{EO}}(u,v) = \left \{ \begin{matrix} 
&amp; f(u), &amp; \mbox{for } u \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, v \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, \\
&amp; f(u)+f(v)-f(u_{\mathrm{m}}), &amp; \mbox{for } u \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, v &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}}, \\
&amp; f(u_{\mathrm{m}}), &amp; \mbox{for } u &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}}, v \le u_{\mathrm{m}}, \\
&amp; f(v), &amp; \mbox{for } u &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}}, v &gt; u_{\mathrm{m}} .
\end{matrix} \right.
&lt;/math&gt; 

For linearization, the [[Wikipedia:Taylor series|Taylor]] formulae 

&lt;math&gt;
f(u_j^{n+1}, u_{j+1}^{n+1}) = f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^{n}) 
+  \frac{\partial f(u_{j}^n, u_{j+1})}{ \partial u_j^n } (u_j^{n+1} - u_j^{n})
+  \frac{\partial f(u_{j}^n, u_{j+1})}{ \partial u_{j+1}^n } (u_{j+1}^{n+1} - u_{j+1}^{n}), \quad j = 1, \dots, J
&lt;/math&gt; 

and

&lt;math&gt;
A(u_j^{n+1}) = A(u_j^n) 
+  \frac{\partial A(u_{j}^n)}{ \partial u_j^n } (u_j^{n+1} - u_j^{n}), \quad j = 1, \dots, J
&lt;/math&gt; 

are inserted.
&lt;!-- 
where 
&lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:-0%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{J}_{\mathrm{f}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
is the Jacobian of the flux function.
--&gt;
&lt;!-- Collecting convective and diffusive fluxes as
&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{f}_{j+1/2} = f_{j+1/2} + \left ( A(u_{j+1})-A(u_j) \right ) / \Delta x
&lt;/math&gt; 
--&gt;
Abbreviating the time evolution step as

&lt;math&gt; \Delta u_j^n = u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n, \quad j = 1, \dots, J, &lt;/math&gt; 

the linearized marching formula for the interior scheme becomes

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta u_j^n = - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} 
\left ( f_{j+1/2}^n + \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^- \Delta u_j^n 
+ \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^+ \Delta u_{j+1}^n 
+ f_{j-1/2}^n + \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^- \Delta u_{j-1}^n 
+ \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^+ \Delta u_j^n \right ) 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
+\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} 
\left ( A(u_{j-1}) - 2A(u_j) + A(u_{j+1}) + a(u_{j-1}) \Delta u_{j-1} -2 a(u_j) \Delta u_j + a(u_{j+1}) \Delta u_{j+1} 
\right ) , 
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

&lt;math&gt; 
J_{j+1/2}^+ = \frac{\partial f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^n)}{\partial u_{j+1}^n}, \quad 
J_{j+1/2}^- = \frac{\partial f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^n)}{\partial u_{j}^n} . 
&lt;/math&gt; 

Rearrangement leads to a block-triangular linear system 

&lt;math&gt;
- 
\left( \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} ( \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^- + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} a(u_{j-1}^n) \right ) \Delta u_{j-1}^n 
+ 
\left( I +\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left ( \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^- - \mathcal{J}_{j-1/2}^+ \right) + \frac{2 \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} a(u_j^n) \right) \Delta u_j^n 
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
+ 
\left( \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \mathcal{J}_{j+1/2}^+ - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} a(u_{j+1}^n) \right ) \Delta u_{j+1}^n 
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
= 
\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left ( f(u_j^n, u_{j+1}^n) - f(u_{j-1}^n,u_j^n)\right ) 
- \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left ( A(u_{j-1}^n) - 2 A(u_j^n) + A(u_{j+1}^n) \right ) , j=2,\dots,J-2
&lt;/math&gt; 

which is of the form

&lt;math&gt;
  m_{j,j-1} \Delta u_{j-1}^n + m_{j,j} \Delta u_j^n + m_{j,j+1} \Delta u_{j+1} = b_j ,
&lt;/math&gt; 

or, in more compact notation,

&lt;math&gt;
M \Delta u^n = b, \quad
\begin{bmatrix} m_{11} &amp; m_{12} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 
m_{21} &amp; m_{22} &amp; m_{23} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;   &amp; &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;   &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp;  m_{J,J-1} &amp; m_{J,J}
\end{bmatrix} , 
\quad 
b= \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_J \end{bmatrix} , 
\quad 
\Delta u^n = \begin{bmatrix} \Delta u_1^n \\ \vdots \\ \Delta u_J^n \end{bmatrix} . 
&lt;/math&gt; 


== Parameter identification as Optimization ==

The goal of the parameter identification by optimization is to minimize the cost function over the parameter space

&lt;math&gt; \min_e q(e), \quad q(e) = \| h(e) - H \|^2 &lt;/math&gt;,

where h(e) denotes the interface that is computed by simulations and H is the measured interface.
Without loss of generality we consider a parameter set e=(e_1, e_2) consiting of two parameters.
The optimization can be iteratively done by employing the Newton method as

&lt;math&gt;Q(e_k) \Delta e_k = \nabla_e q(e_k),
\quad 
e \subset \{ C, v_{\infty}, a_0, u_{\mathrm{c}}, k \} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

&lt;math&gt;
Q = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
  \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_1^2} &amp; \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_1 e_2} \\
  \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_2 e_1} &amp; \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial e_2^2}
\end{bmatrix} , 
&lt;/math&gt; 

is the Hessian of q. The Newton method is motivated by the Taylor expansion

&lt;math&gt; 
0 \approx Q(e^*) = Q(e) + \nabla_e Q(e) \Delta e + \frac{1}{2} \Delta e^{\mathrm{T}} Q \Delta e, 
\quad
\Delta e = e^* - e,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e^*&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal parameter choice.

'''Render Layers'''

The output of the rendering process is generally a single image frame (which might be part of a sequence of images). However, instead of directly rendering all the elements of the scene into the output image, you may want to apply different effects to different parts.

To this end, it is possible to split out the elements of the rendering process (separate scene layers, also solid versus halo materials, Z-depth, sky background etc) into separate ''render layers'' which can then be fed into the '''[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Compositing|compositor]]''' and tweaked in various ways to make up the final image.

'''Rendering by Parts (Bucket Rendering)'''

Images can be rendered in pieces or layers rather than all at one time. Your computer will only need to compute smaller bits of information thus using less memory. By changing the Xpart and Ypart values (up to 8 each since Blender can't support more than 64 [8x8] parts) in the Render panel of the Scene context(F10,) you can divide your image into an invisible grid. The pieces will layer one at a time until they are whole.

'''Edge Renderings''' - [http://forum.nystic.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=3102 Tutorial Here]

Blender has an option of adding a border – a defined edge to objects (like in cartoons). To do that you need to go to the render buttons (F10) and then, under &quot;output&quot; change the edge setting: set the &quot;Eint&quot; to a value of about 100 and check the &quot;edge&quot; icon to enable edge rendering. This would give you edge line at the edge of each polygon.
To prevent it from applying on all polygons the same way change to &quot;unified render&quot; under the format tab. Then, in the edge settings change the &quot;antishift&quot; value, it will decrease itself from the fint value when the line is between identical materials. By also checking the &quot;all&quot; icon you tell the render to apply the edge rendering on transparent materials as well.
In Blender 2.59 this seems to be integrated into the Render-properties in the subwindow 'Post Processing' as options 'Edge' and 'Threshold'. 

Note: User Terrywallwork - The edge bordering feature in Blender 2.43 only seems to work when Blender Internal renderer is used, when Yafray is used, no edge is show even if the options is clicked.  I'm not sure if there is a way round this or not. 

HDRI Rendering - [http://forum.nystic.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=5355 Tutorial Here]

'''Multi Thread Rendering'''

Blender has the option to render with 'Multiple threads' meaning it can render more than 1 part at once. This is done by sending more than 1 Render parts to the CPU to process at the same time, if your CPU can handle it. The Option is found in render buttons (F10). Change the number of threads used by changing its number.

'''Note in Blender 2.46+''': Blender 2.46 automatically selects the number of threads.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

In 3D graphics, materials and textures are nearly as important as shapes. Scenes would be boring if all the objects were gray.

The {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|material system}} in Blender allows you to model a wide variety of materials and how they interact with light.  The next few modules will introduce the available options.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Note that material and texture settings are renderer-specific.''' This page and the following ones describe settings appropriate to the '''Blender Internal''' renderer, which is the one selected by default when you open a new Blender document. Other renderers (both built into Blender and external) are available; you will learn about these later, in [[../Advanced_Tutorials/Advanced_Rendering|Advanced Rendering]].}}

== Material versus Texture ==
A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|material}} defines the optical properties of an object: its color and whether it is dull or shiny.  A {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|texture}} is a pattern that breaks up the uniform appearance of the material.  Very few objects in the real world have completely uniform surfaces.  Instead most of them have patterning or variation in color: consider the grain in a piece of wood, the pile in a carpet, or the mortar in a brick wall.

Blender allows textures to influence materials in various ways, such as altering their colors. Multiple textures can interact with each other to produce interesting effects.

Note that textures have to be attached to materials to affect objects, you cannot apply a texture to an object without a material.

== Other Material Settings ==
Additional settings you can specify for a material include {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|shaders}}, {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|ray-tracing}} and {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|halo}}.

Shaders determine how the appearance of a material varies with the angle of the light: {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|diffuse}} shaders give a non-shiny look, while {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|specular}} shaders give a mirror-like finish.  Blender's material settings always involve both kinds of shaders, but you can adjust a material's diffuse and specular colours separately to control their respective effects; if you set the specular colour to black, the surface will no longer produce reflections.

Ray-tracing is a technique for modeling the physical path of light through the scene. It is capable of producing exquisite reflection and refraction effects, including different degrees of reflectivity, translucency and transparency, and representing materials with different indexes of refraction. Blender provides two separate groups of ray-tracing settings, one for reflection of light and the other for its transmission through the material. You can control these settings on a per-material basis.

Halo rendering means an object no longer looks like solid matter, instead it appears to be made of bits of light. This can be used for real-world effects like fire, smoke and plasma, or to create fantasy effects with no connection to reality.

Note that reflections produced by ray-tracing are separate from that produced by the specular shader: the former are controlled by the material's mirror colour, while the latter is controlled by its specular colour.

Reflection is done in two different ways because, while ray-tracing produces the most realistic renders, it is also very CPU-intensive. It is therefore best to apply the ray-tracing effects when you're completely done with your modelling to help reduce high CPU usage. Enough practice with ray-tracing can also help you get stunning effects with just few clicks without you having to do much trial and error. You would do well to dedicate at least a few hours of your time to experimenting with it, so that in a future real production situation, you will be spared all that hassle.

==Types of Textures==
When you create a texture in Blender, you will see a popup menu listing a whole lot of different types for the texture. The {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Image or Movie}} texture type lets you use a scanned image to texture your object: for example, you can scan an actual piece of metal and use that to give your object a realistic metallic appearance, or use a photograph of an actual brick wall to texture the wall of a building model, and so on. You could even use a movie, which plays during the animation of the scene.

The other texture types are called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|procedural}}, which means the textures are generated according to algorithms built into Blender itself. These can be useful for simulating various effects when you don’t have an image of the real material handy; they can also be applied to augment the appearance in various ways.  For example:
* using a “cloud” texture to “dirty-up” a material
: or
* using one texture as a stencil to create an amalgam of two other textures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Modeling a 3D logo from a 2D logo in Blender 3D ==

I found an outdated logo creation tutorial at: [http://www.vrotvrot.com/xoom/tutorials/logoTut/logoTut.html www.vrotvrot.com]. Since I wanted to design a logo of my own, I've decided to take this tutorial as a basic and go on with my own logo creation from there. I do not intend to insult the original author, but I couldn't find a way to get in touch.


''' Tracing your logo '''

The most tedious part of creating a logo animation is tracing the logo. In most cases all you'll get as a freelancer is a paper print, or a bitmap of a company's logo. 

In this case, I just ripped a cool looking logo from the internet.

[Image:http://www.vrotvrot.com/xoom/tutorials/logoTut/original.jpg]

The first thing you'll need for this is a 2D logo that you want to make a 3D model of, I made up a fake company logo for this tutorial (try and get it in JPEG format).  You can click the link below to see it.

'''note from spiderworm'''  thank you, i've responded back.
'''note from milovanderlinden'''  I am working on upgrading this tutorial.

''' Curve or polygon? '''

Ok I decided to step up to the plate and continue this simple tutorial.

You can use a curve, polyline and trace the outline of the 2D logo with those. Alternatively a polygon is used(say, a plane). The polygon is molded into 2D logo shape by subdivision and consequent pushing&amp;pulling the vertices so that the poly outline is the same as the logo.


''' Extruding the tracing curve '''

Once you have the logo traced with a curve or polyline, or polygon, select it, and press EKEY. Then extrude the profile as much as you like. Make sure it has faces on all sides.

''' Add Texture '''

Add a texture to the shape.

''' Lights, Camera, Render '''

Position lights and the camera so that the logo looks nice. Press F12 key to render.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Programming]] | [[Programming:Prolog|Prolog]] | Cuts and Negation

This section explains the use of cuts to control backtracking, the way negation is used in Prolog and  a useful combination of both.

== The cut ==

Consider the following program.

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
a :- b.
b :- c.
c :- d.
b.
&lt;/source&gt;

If you load this into Prolog and ask Prolog '''?- a.''', Prolog will evaluate it by first searching for any rule that can make '''a''' true; it adds '''a''' to its list of goals to prove. The first rule states that '''a''' is true if '''b''' is true, so Prolog adds the goal '''b''' to its list. It finds a rule for '''c''' and now needs to prove '''d''', which fails. Prolog now removes the goal '''d''' from its list, because it couldn't prove it, and tries to prove '''c''' in a different way. This is known as '''backtracking'''. Prolog can't prove '''c''' either, backtracks again and tries '''b'''. It can prove this, using the last line of the program and Prolog terminates.

Understanding how Prolog evaluates your query is essential in Prolog programming. To control the way Prolog evaluates your program, you can use the '''cut''' operator: '''!'''.  the cut operator is an atom, and can be used in the following way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;a(X) :- b(X), c(X), !, d(X).&lt;/source&gt;

If Prolog finds a cut in a rule, it will not backtrack on the choices it has made. For instance, if it has chosen frank for the variable X and encounters a cut, Prolog will consider frank the only option for X, even if there are other possibilities in the database. 
This is illustrated by the following program

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;a(X, Y) :- b(X), !, c(Y).
b(1).
b(2).
b(3).

c(1).
c(2).
c(3).
&lt;/source&gt;

If we ask Prolog '''?- a(Q, R).''' it will first answer

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
?- a(Q, R).&lt;br&gt;
Q = 1&lt;br&gt;
R = 1 ;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And when we ask Prolog for more answers, using the ''';'''-key:
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q = 1&lt;br&gt;
R = 2 ;&lt;br&gt;
Q = 1&lt;br&gt;
R = 3 ;&lt;br&gt;
No&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

As you can see Prolog considers 1 as the only option for Q, whereas it returns all alternatives for R. When Prolog starts out on the query it tries to prove '''a(Q, R)''', using the first line of the program. To prove this rule, it needs to first '''prove b(Q)''', it succeeds with Q = 1. Then Prolog encounters a cut and sets Q = 1 as the only option for Q. It continues with the last goal of the rule, c(R). It first finds R = 1. and completes its goal. When user presses ''';''', Prolog first checks for alternatives to the goal c(R). Remember, when Prolog encountered the cut it hadn't chosen an instantiation for R yet, so it can still look for alternatives for R. When it runs out of alternatives for R, Prolog can't look for alternatives for Q, and terminates.

To understand how the cut changes the meaning of a program, consider the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
a(X) :- b(X), !, c(X).
b(1).
b(2).
b(3).

c(2).&lt;/source&gt;

Without the cut in the first line, Prolog would return '''Q = 2''' to the query '''?- a(Q).'''
With the cut Prolog fails to find an answer. To prove the goal, it first proves b(Q) with Q = 1. It then encounters a cut, is committed to Q=1 and can't find a proof for '''c(1)'''. If it could have searched for alternatives, it would have found that Q=2 makes both b(Q) and c(Q) true, but the cut doesn't allow that.
However, if we ask Prolog '''a(2)''', it will return yes. Now, Prolog instantiates the X in the first line of the program with 2, because the user has specified it, and when Prolog reaches the cut X becomes committed to 2, allowing Prolog to prove c(2).

The cut also works across multiple rules. If a program has two rules for the goal '''a(X)''', and Prolog encounters a cut in the first rule, it is not only committed to the instantiations of the variables, but also to the second rule for a(X). Prolog will not consider the second rule. For instance, the following program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
a(X) :- b(X), !, c(X).
a(X) :- d(X).

b(1).
b(4).

c(3).

d(4).
&lt;/source&gt;

will fail for the query '''?- a(X).'''. Prolog could solve the query with the second rule, using '''X =4''' and the last line of the program, but Prolog tries the first rule first and when it encounters the cut, it is forced to ignore all alternatives to a(Q). This time, the query '''?- a(4)''' will fail too, because Prolog still reaches the cut. When it tries '''a(4)''' with the first rule, it succeeds in proving '''b(4)''' and reaches the cut. It then tries '''c(4)''', which fails, and Prolog has to terminate. If the lines '''b(4).''' and '''b(1).''' are removed from the program, Prolog fails on the first rule, before it encounters the cut, and is allowed to solve the query with the second rule.

== Using Cuts ==

* examples where cuts are necessary
* if-then-else structures
* advice on using cuts ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28logic_programming%29#Red_cut red cuts] &amp; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28logic_programming%29#Green_cut green cuts])

== Negation ==
'''not(X)''' is the way to implement negation in Prolog; however '''not(X)''' does '''not''' mean that '''X''' is false, it means that '''X''' can't be proven true.

For example, with the database:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
man('Adam').
woman('Eve').
&lt;/source&gt;

asking ''not(man('Abel')).'' will return yes.

== Cut-Fail negation ==

== Examples ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
not(Goal) :- call(Goal),!,fail.
not(Goal).
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==

{{recipe}}

Basic recipe on how to cook artichokes.
==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (5 ml) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tablespoon]] (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

==Procedure==
#Cut off artichoke stem and head.
#Remove base leaves and cut off pointy end of upper leaves.
#Rub artichoke in lemon to preserve color.
#Add salt (and any seasonings) to 3 inches of water, bring to low boil.
#Place artichoke top down in pot tall enough to place lid without touching the artichoke.
#Boil on low 30-45 minutes until bottom can be punctured without resistance.
#Place artichoke upside down to drain.
#Serve whole, with one or more dips. Diners should remove a leaf, dip the base of the leaf in the dip, and eat the fleshy base of the leaf.
#When all the leaves are gone, remove the choke, cut the heart of the artichoke into bite sized pieces, and serve with the dip.

==Seasonings==
#Parsley
#1-2 Garlic per artichoke
#Pepper
#1/8 cup (30 ml) white wine.
==Simple Dips==
*Drawn [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[:Cookbook:Mayonnaise|Mayonnaise]]
*[[:Cookbook:Mustard Dip|Mustard Dip]] (This dip is, in the opinion of some, more tasty than butter or mayonnaise)

I just want to make sure it gets put in a logical spot in relation to the rest of the tutorials.  Thanx.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 23:52, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== what the tutorial is for ==

Thanx for interest spiderworm, i didn't think anyone would ever look at this.  The purpose is to take a simple 2D bitmap graphic and turn it into a 3D model that you could rotate and use for presentations.  Let's face it - a 3D logo looks better than a 2D one and this is a pretty easy effect to master.  Basically, I'll show people how to load a background image into the workspace and trace it with a polygon and turn that polygon into an extrudable mesh.

Cheers, i'll get back to work now.
-Schwiezer

== gracias ==

Thanx for the update.  Try to make this a very basic tutorial then, where the user learns to extrude and CTRL+LMB to place new verts.  Your logo looks good :)  I'm placing this tute between Quickie Render and Modelling a Simple Person.  Also, can you come up with a more concise name for the title of this page? If so, let me know and I'll perform the move. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:38, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

In Brahms' First Symphony, second movement, the 1st horn has a duet with the violin during the first phrase of this excerpt. The second phrase is a horn solo.

Horn I in C

[[Image:Brahms1-4.png|Horn Solo in Fourth Movement.]]

The last movement solo is over muted strings. The second horn player plays whole notes at the same time the first has the dotted half notes in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th bars of the example. The effect is of one continuous line.

&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;How to Use the ''Study Guide to Invertebrate Zoology''&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;

The purpose of the ''Study Guide to Invertebrate Zoology'' is to weave&amp;mdash;out of the information on Life Science contained in ''Wikipedia''&amp;mdash;a course of study for the student or layman.  It is anticipated that this course will be either supplemental to instruction being received at a school or college, or will be self-directed. In either case, the Guide is not a novel and should not be approached as one. A smooth flow of dialogue is simply not possible and should not be anticipated.  The Guide may be closer to the sometimes disjointed notes generated by a student from a lecture or careful reading of a detailed textbook.

Within each subsection of a Chapter, introductory text is followed by one or more &quot;reading assignments&quot; of the form:

*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Zoology|Zoology]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;) 

Following (that is ''clicking'' on) the link (to ''Wikipedia'' &quot;Zoology&quot; article in this case) will open an article intended to provide the details of the Chapter subsection. Recommended articles should be read from top to bottom, and then re-read following some or all of the links embedded in the article to other articles for expanded elucidation or to clarify terms; that is, in most cases, completion of an &quot;assignment&quot; (recommended article) includes at least some or all articles linked to the first.  Obviously, it cannot be the case that all links are followed to articles, whose links are then followed to articles, and so on until no new material is encountered. It is likely there would be no quick end to such a pursuit. The amount of time spent wandering beyond the original article is partly a personal matter of how much the reader is getting out of the foray than anything else. Realize it is certainly possible to wander well off the subject at hand.  As in the example above, notes are provided with assignments giving some direction for pursuing links. An instruction NOT to pursue links simply means the additional material will be encountered later in the course of instruction, and going beyond the assigned article may provide too much detail for a beginning student.  The following example: 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Science|Science]] (&lt;small&gt;The following links are included:&lt;/small&gt;)
** [[Wikipedia:en:Scientific method|Scientific Method]]
** [[Wikipedia:en:Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]]

specifies that two other links ARE part of the assignment.  Other links encountered may be followed to expand your knowledge or, as always, to aid in  understanding of technical terms encountered. Hyperlinks included with the text in the Guide are there simply for convenience, usually to topics somewhat peripheral to the main one.  In all cases, finding your way back to the Guide may become tricky, but we have to leave this up to you to establish, beyond pointing out that your browser's ''Back'' button is intended for this purpose.   

Note that at the beginning of each module, links are provided to both the previous chapter and the succeeding chapter, as well as to the main Table of Contents.

== Final Note ==

Both this Guide and all articles in ''Wikipedia'' are [[Wikipedia:en:free content|free content]] that can be added to or edited by anyone.  It is an opportunity for the user of these documents to contribute information, or even state given information more clearly, simply by editing a page. As a student with a textbook and a lecturer (teacher), you may find yourself in possession of useful facts, another point of view on existing facts, or a report you prepared of exceptional quality.  Any of these can be added to an appropriate page in this Guide or the ''Wikipedia''.  However, this caution is strongly advised: ''Do not place into the Guide any text or pictures taken verbatim (or close to verbatim) from a text book, web site, or other copyrighted source without permission of the copyright holder''.  In general, this means, anything you submit should be your own work.

'''To learn how to edit or contribute material to this textbook, first read the introduction at:''' &lt;big&gt;''[[Wikipedia:en:Wikipedia:introduction|How to Edit]]''&lt;/big&gt;.

=== Note to future contributors ===
Although initially developed as a &quot;Guide&quot;, by which is meant a sort of outline with links to Wikipedia articles, it is not necessary to scrupulously maintain the format.  If, as a contributor, you would prefer to flesh out any module with minimal reference to Wikipedia, that should be acceptable, so long as your contribution exceeds what is available on the topic at Wikipedia.  In this instance, &quot;exceeding&quot; is a reference to quality and not quantity.  In such cases, it might remain helpful to the student to place the reading &quot;assignment&quot; as a &quot;See also:&quot; link on the chapter page.  

Use of any Wikipedia article as a substitute for text should include consideration of the quality of information and writing at the assigned article. It is simply one approach to work on that article to insure quality before assigning it.  Another approach would be to ignore the article at Wikipedia and develop the necessary text in the module itself.  This does have a disadvantage in that, through hyperlinks, the student may well later arrive at the &quot;rejected&quot; Wikipedia article anyway. If the information found there conflicts or confuses, the student may have difficulty establishing which bits of information are correct and which are not.

== Zoology as a Science ==

Zoology is the branch of '''biology''' concerned with the scientific study of animals. Invertebrate Zoology deals with only a specific, although very large, part of the '''Animal Kingdom''' as we shall learn further into this Chapter. Zoology is not usually a starting course in biology, so it must be assumed that the student or user of this Guide already has some background in biology.  This should be sufficient; it is not necessarily the case that Biology is followed by ofGeneral Zoology is followed by Invertebrate Zoology. However, you may find much of the material difficult to comprehend if you have not first acquired basic knowledge in General Biology. Nonetheless, our first assigned read at ''Wikipedia'' will be a review of biology and zoology as sciences: 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Biology|Biology]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Zoology|Zoology]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;) 
:and note that other texts encompassing topics in biology are available (''under development'') at the Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:biology bookshelf|biology bookshelf]] as sources of reference.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;


==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. A collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; of open sets is called a '''base''' for the topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if every open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the union of sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Obviously &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for itself.

==Conditions for Being a Base==
In a topological space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; a collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it consists of open sets and for each point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and open neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is a set &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in B\subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt;
We need to show that a subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is open if and only if it is is a union of elements in &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;. However, the ''if'' part is obvious, from the facts that the elements in &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; are open, and that so are arbitrary unions of open sets. Thus, we only have to prove, that any open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; indeed is such a union.&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; be any open set. Consider any element &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt;. By assumption, there is at least one element in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, which both contains &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and is a subset of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. By the axiom of choice, we may simultaneously for each &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt; choose such an element &lt;math&gt;B_x \in \mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The union of all of them indeed is &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, any open set can be formed as a union of sets within &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Constructing Topologies from Bases==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be any set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following:
# If &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in B&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;B_1,B_2\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in B_1\cap B_2&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;x\in B\subseteq B_1\cap B_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Remark :''' Note that the first condition is equivalent to saying that ''The union of all sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.''

==Semibases==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be any set and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a semibase if a base of X can be formed by a finite intersection of elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exercises==

# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}=\{(a,b):a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of all open intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. 
# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\{[a,b]:a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of all closed intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is '''not''' a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\{(a,b]:a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of half open intervals is a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Show that the collection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{[a,b):a,b\in\mathbb{R},a&lt;b\}&lt;/math&gt; of half open intervals is a base for a topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. A '''Partition''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; over the closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ordered n-tuple &lt;math&gt;a&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\ldots &lt;x_n&lt;b \,\!&lt;/math&gt;; the '''norm''' of a partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{P}\|=\sup \{x_i-x_{i-1}|2\leq i\leq n\}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br/&gt; For every &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, define the set &lt;math&gt;U_{\delta}=\{\mathcal{P}|\|\mathcal{P}\|\leq\delta\}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt; If &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all partitions on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, prove that the collection of all &lt;math&gt;U_{\delta}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a Base over the Topology on &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fundamental SI Units ==

SI unit system defines the following seven fundamental units in terms of how they can be measured. All other units in SI unit system can be derived from these. Also note that from physical point of view, only the first three, length, mass, and time are fundamental. Mole and Kelvin are actually arbitrary choice of scaling factor that has proven useful in various fields, and candela is also defined in terms of existing quantities.  Note that derived unit'' means that it can be determined from the fundamental units, and ''not'' that it can be expressed in terms of them.

*Meter (m), the unit of length.  It is defined as being the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a second. 

*Kilogram (kg), the unit of mass. Note that the gram is ''not'' the fundamental unit for mass.  It is defined by an actual platinum-iridium bar, though there is discussion of defining it by a more universal constant.  It's worth noting in advance that a kilogram is not a unit of weight, which is a type of force.

*Second (s), the unit of time. The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom. [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html NIST(1)].

*Ampere (A), the unit of electric current. The ampere is defined as ''that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10-7 newton per meter of length''. [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/ampere.html NIST(2)]

*Mole (mol), the unit of quantity. One mole contains as many items as 12 grams of Carbon-12 contains of atoms. That number is known as Avogadro's Number, which is approximately &lt;math&gt;6.02214199\times 10^{23}&lt;/math&gt;.

*[[Kelvin]] (K), the unit of temperature. It is defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/kelvin.html NIST(3)].  The 'easy' way to find the temperature in Kelvin is to add 273.15 to the temperature in Celsius.

*Candela (cd), the unit of luminous intensity or brightness. It is defined as ''the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency &lt;math&gt;540\times 10^{12}&lt;/math&gt; hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.'' [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html NIST(4)].

==Derived SI Units==
In physics there are many quantities that cannot be expressed by a single base unit.  For example, speed, the rate at which a position changes with time, is expressed as a combination of the unit for distance (meters) and the unit for time (seconds).  As we will soon learn, the speed is equal to the distance divided by the time.  Therefore, the unit of speed is the ''meter per second'', or ''m/s''.  The unit ''meter per second'' is called a ''derived unit'', meaning that it is derived from the seven SI base units.

Units can be combined together in many possible combinations, and any physically-significant quantity will have its own units.  Some frequently-used combinations get their own names.  Here are a sample of some of the more common ones:

*Newton (N), the unit of force.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N} = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

*Joule (J), the unit of energy.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{J} = \mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{m} = \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{s}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

*Watt (W), the unit of power.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{W} = \mathrm{J}/\mathrm{s} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Pascal (Pa), the unit of pressure.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pa} = \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Hertz (Hz), the unit of frequency.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hz} = 1/\mathrm{s} = \mathrm{s}^{-1} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Coulomb (C), the unit of electric charge.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C} = \mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{s} &lt;/math&gt;

*Volt (V), the unit of electric potential or voltage.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V} = \mathrm{J}/\mathrm{C} = \mathrm{W}/\mathrm{A} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Ohm (&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;), the unit of electric resistance.
**&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \mathrm{V}/\mathrm{A} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Farad (F), the unit of electric capacitance.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F} = \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{V} \ &lt;/math&gt;

*Tesla (T), the unit of magnetic field strength.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T} = \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{A} \cdot \mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;

*Weber (Wb), the unit of magnetic flux.
**&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Wb} = \mathrm{T} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==SI Prefixes==
Physics spans the very small to the very large.  Particle physicists are interested in distances as small as the radius of a proton, 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; m or smaller.  Meanwhile, astronomers may be interested in measuring distances of  a parsec, around 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; m, or greater.

The &quot;English&quot; system used different units to indicate the scale of measurement.  For example, one might say that one's house has a length of 53 feet.  However, perhaps New York City is 150 miles away.  While it would be perfectly accurate to do so, no person would state that their house was 0.010 miles long or that New York City was 792 000 feet away.  In both cases, the unit doesn't accurately represent the scale of the measurement.

In SI, prefixes are available to adjust the size of a unit so as to keep the number of those units reasonable.  Prefixes may be added to either base units or derived units.

Here are the accepted SI prefixes:

For example, it would be awkward to speak about the capacitance of a particular device as &quot;0.000 000 000 010 farads.&quot;  Using the unit &quot;10 picofarads&quot; is a lot more sensible.

For some reason, however, not all prefixes are frequently used.  Distances are rarely given in units larger than kilometers and masses usually aren't given in units larger than kilograms.  Experience will indicate when certain implied conventions apply, but it's never incorrect to refer to a distance of 5 400 000 000 m as 5.4 Gm.  The point will be made and the value will be understood.

==Calculations with Units==
When performing calculations in physics, it is very helpful to keep track of the units of each numerical quantity.  The unit of the result can often lend insight into the nature of what has been calculated.

When adding or subtracting values with units, each quantity must have the same unit.  The result has the same unit as the operands.  For example:

:5 m + 3 m = 8 m
:2.50 kg + 3.712 kg = 6.21 kg
:57 feet + 192 inches = ?????

If quantities have different units, one must first convert to a common unit before the calculation is completed:

:57 feet + 192 inches = 57 feet + 16 feet = 73 feet.

When multiplying or dividing values with units, the units are multiplied or divided too.

:&lt;math&gt;(20\ \mathrm{m}) \times (5\ \mathrm{m}) = 100\ \mathrm{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(1000\ \mathrm{N}) / (40\ \mathrm{m}) = 25\ \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes the resulting unit has a special name:

:&lt;math&gt;(400\ \mathrm{J}) / (5\ \mathrm{s}) = 80\ \mathrm{J}/\mathrm{s} = 80\ \mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt;

----
I thought there were only ''three'' fundamental units: length, mass, and time; and the others could be defined from them. (And that is what my lower division physics textbook says too.) Does anyone have a reference that says something like &quot;ampere&quot; is a fundamental unit? [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 03:13, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)
: Egh. Fixed it myself by clarifying what is meant by &quot;fundamental&quot;. The 7 units are &quot;fundamental&quot; in the sense that they are the beginning units for SI system. But physically speaking, only the first three are---you can see in the definitions that the four other units are actually defined in terms of the first three or their derived units.

Atchar is a spicy condiment, often eaten with a curry. It comes from the Indian cuisine in South Africa. In India, it is spelled Achar, and the word means pickle in Hindi. Usually the atchar made in South Africa is made with unripe green mangoes and chillies. The whole mango is used for making atchar.

This traditional mango atchar is easily made at home. Adjust the amount of chillies to your liking and serve with a vegetable curry, or on a slice of white bread.

== Ingredients ==

* 1.5 kg unripe mangoes, chopped
* 4 tsp garlic and herb salt
* 3 Tbs chilli powder
* 2 Tbs cumin powder
* 1 Tbs ground coriander
* 3 Tbs curry powder
* 1.5 cups (360ml) raw honey or fructose
* 2 cups (480ml) balsamic vinegar
* 0.5 cup (120g) corn or potato flour
* 2 Tbs mustard seeds
* handful curry leaves
* 1.5 cups (360ml) virgin olive oil or cold pressed sunflower oil

==Procedure==
Simmer all the ingredients except the mangoes and the oil, until it thickens. Pour over the mangoes, add the oil, mix well, cool and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==method 1 - bringing the outer circle into 3d==
'''[Noob Note:''' I'm new to Blender but have been dealing with bezier's for a long time, and this method of creating the slashed circle seems excessively complicated (whereas the other alternative presented bypasses the point of using curves altogether). The inside of the circle is just 2 half circles cut out from the original larger circle and would only need 2 points to draw out (for each half). Here's what I did.

Another noob note: I found that instead of doing all of this, just insert the inner circle, rotate by 45 degrees, and scale and grab along y and x axis and you will have a much better looking circle

note added 12/08..... all these methods produce something that is &quot;LIKE&quot; the logo jpg but all end up different.  Look at the picture..THE TOP PART OF THE LIGHTNING BOLD IS ON TOP OF THE RED CIRCLE... only the body and bottom tip of the lightning bolt are underneath it.  The lightning bolt must be rotated on the x axis to correctly finish the logo.

== method 3 - bringing the outer circle into 3d==
(Another way to do it is to create a ring with 2 Tubes ('''SPACE''' -&gt; Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; tube). Scale one to the size of the outer border of the ring and one to the size of the inner one. Then in edit mode select 2 Vertices next to each other on the inner and outer tube and made a face ('''FKEY''') which covered one segment of the ring. Then you have to spin it like described above (the number depends on the number of vertices you choose for your tube tube = 32 Verticles -&gt; 632 rotationsteps). Same on the other side. If your faces are not in the right place go to object mode select the tubes an press '''SHIFT'''+'''SKEY''' and choose 'Cursor -&gt; Selection' to center the 3D cursor.)

==an other way (faster)==
n00b note. This is an other way (faster) add a open circle, make it right size, extrude + esc, scale, mark them both and press F for fill, and rotate it so 4 vertexes are the corners of the line over the lightning, make edges with 2 vertex and F, I think u know the rest so ur done now :D

:this is now method 2 [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:22, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

== Rewrite ==

This tutorial seems disjointed, and several of the images have been lost.

Would anyone mine if I wrote another one from scratch on the same subject?

--[[User:Lazy-lump]] 20 Jan, 2008

:I've cleaned it up! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:22, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

-----

I am following this tutorial on another similar logo.  Now that I have completed it, when I select one of the letters, ALL of the letters select (in object mode).  I can't split them up and for example rotate one of the letters at a time.  Sure I can select them individually in edit mode, but then I cannot translate in the z direction and do other things I want to do.

But in this tutorial the lightning bolt and the circle X are acting as two distinct objects.  Is this something I missed in an earlier tutorial.  Perhaps someone could add more detail about this?

-----

OOPS!

Didnt realize you're going into beziers here.  I'll find a more appropriate spot for this tute.  Beziers, of course!  I suppose I'll separate mesh modeling from bezier modeling from metaballs from etc....  I'll figure out a good spot for this, continue your good work on this please!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:34, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Ok, looks like this tutorial needs some one to finish it. I'll give it a try.

This tutorial needs to be marked as incomplete and moved to the &quot;Miscellaneous Tutorials&quot; at the bottom of the main page of the Wikibook. I'd do it myself, but I'm completely wiki illiterate. This is my first post on a wiki. [[User:Jdwolfears|Jdwolfears]] ([[User talk:Jdwolfears|talk]]) 07:53, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

== Set up ==

This bit;

&quot;Now scroll the view [[using by]] clicking and dragging the MMB and notice how the cube and image move together?&quot;

Apart from the [[typo]] I'm not sure what its intention is because when you rotate the world by clicking and dragging the MMB the background image vanishes, as it is apparently only visible from the three orthogonal views &amp; the camera; therefore by saying &quot;...notice how the cube and image move together?&quot; seems odd. I'm using Blender v2.40, so maybe this behaviour is different from v2.37.

Also, on the previous bit where we are playing around with the 'blend' function it could do with being mentioned how to input the exact 0.500 value again as it's nearly impossible to do it with the slider; i.e. click on the current value and enter it with the keyboard &amp; then press enter. Just to help.

Also, in Blender v2.40 &quot;Ext1: 0.2 Ext2: 0.02 BevResol: 4&quot; appear as:

&lt; Extrude: n.nnn &gt;

&lt; Bevel Depth: n.nnn &gt;

&lt; BevResol: n &gt;

In more-or-less the same place; Mode: Edit or Object &gt; Panel: Editing &gt; MiniMenu: Curve and Surface.

[user:mr_spoon, 4/Jan/06].

----

OK It is probably just me but there appears to be a bit between &quot;Polishing the Tracing&quot; and &quot;Adding the third dimension&quot;. The reason I say this is I have the latest version of blender and following the instructions as listed means that instead of a solid swoosh-type shape you get a solid shape with the middle taken out.

That image showing how to set up the curve it probably the worst for someone (like me!) who is trying to learn a whole bunch of stuff that is new...

The picture needs to be changed!!!

[From marinalan, Mar 16 2009]
I am very much frustrated that I can not see in this tutorial original image that is served as background image for tracing, exactly &quot;no symbol with lightening bolt&quot; in png or jpg format.

Without this I can not follow and do steps.

Noob answer: I just used my own Logo and followed the steps, it still worked. 

I had much more success with another tutorial,

=== &lt;center&gt;*&lt;/center&gt; ===

Hi anybody (or everybody),

Just discovered this tutorial and wanted to use it to help myself. Then discovered that it's in state of disarray.

'''I tried to find out what's wrong with the missing images,''' so I checked the Commons deletion log for one of them ''([[Commons:File:Blender-2dlogo-polish-final.png]])''... but either the search is faulty, or I don't know what, because it's yielding no results:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=File:Blender-2dlogo-polish-final.png&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Should I believe that this file had never been uploaded in the first place? Maybe I'm distrustful, but somehow I doubt this...

Then I checked the history of this tutorial, to look for some useful c[l]ues as to what might have happened.

One notheworthy edit is this one ''([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/2D_Image_(logo)_to_a_3D_Model&amp;diff=1008439&amp;oldid=987316 diff])'' by [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] on 20 October 2007. His description of the action is:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;''Removing instance of image Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg that has been deleted because &quot;nld&gt;7d&quot;); using [[WP:TW|TW]])''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now no sane person is going to know what sort of excuse &quot;nld&gt;7d&quot; is. But we have Google, so I located the description of this mysterious symbol... on said user's own subpage ''([[User:Mike.lifeguard/Deletion_reasons]]),'' and only there (hey, that's a notable symbol then, isn't it). So I was lucky that Google placed this result on the top position ''globally,'' otherwise I would never find it. (So it must be somehow notable in the end.) The explanation is perhaps even more mysterious than what it explains:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;
nld&gt;7d
: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[WB:NLD|nld&gt;7d]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, lucky me that I can comprehend [[Wikipedia:Wikicode|wikicode]]—not everybody can. So I typed in &lt;tt&gt;[[WB:NLD]]&lt;/tt&gt; manually in the search box, only to get redirected to... ''[[Wikibooks:Media]].''

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;This policy explains our requirements for images and other media files used on Wikibooks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Great! So what do we know? All that we learn is that the picture has been deleted because of failing unspecified &quot;requirements&quot;!

So we end up knowing nothing, unable to make our own judgement of that long-gone operation. But at least we have a proof (!) that the file ''([[Commons:Image:Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg]])'' existed, and had been deleted, rather than never uploaded in the first place!

So I re-test the Commons deletion log search for ''this'' one file... again, to no avail. Now we know that it is not just this particular tutorial: '''it is basic mechanisms of Mediawiki that appear to be falling apart.''' (Or, if I am simply unskilled enough to use them properly, how many other people are? If not for problems of the kind that I discovered, I'm sure someone would have repaired this tutorial by now after all these years!)

=== Summary ===

Summing up, the problems which I have encountered in the way of my effort to repair this tutorial appear to lie in the ways Wikimedia mechanisms are at the moment functioning:

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 20px; width:200px; border: solid 1px #bbb; clear: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|200px|Before]]&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|200px|After]]&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''''[[Wikipedia:Damnatio memoriae|Damnatio memoriae]]''—history knows cases of whole people being deleted from the deletion log.''' It is comparatively easy to delete—and disproportionately hard to create. But, while deleting can often be somehow justified, deleting from the deletion log is outright evil... ''and you should know this without my explanation.''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

# '''The deletion log on Commons is a bit hard to locate.''' Entering &quot;deletion log&quot; in the search box yields no results. I have found it by using a separate search on the Commons &quot;Help&quot; page which works for help pages only. I don't know why the primary search box should not have universal scope of operation like it has on Wikipedia. (Okay, it does—as I discovered later—but the user must know upfront which namespace to select... only to get an old, defunct [[Commons:Commons:Deletion log|deletion log page from year 2004]]. For readers' information, here is the ''[[Commons:Special:Log/delete]]''—don't confuse with a Wikibooks deletion log.)
# '''The deletion log search almost never appears to work.''' (Well, quite wickedly, it seems to work ''only'' for the kind of files, disappearance of which couldn't go unnoticed by a large audience...) To compound, rather than ease, this problem—the search doesn't seem to allow for filename filtering, so you can't find a file without knowing its full name. (Why this restriction, so unnatural for computer systems—do we have something to hide?) Example:&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Image:Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Accountability for actions of possibly long-departed users:''' someone has deleted a (perhaps!) good stuff someday many years ago under a pretension of informed decision, such as &quot;nld&gt;7d&quot; or even &quot;dafq3dsjh&quot;, leaving an otherwise 90% good tutorial in a state of disarray and seemingly making extra effort to make it irreversible. What next? What is our direction starting from this point?
# '''Some established habits of higher-profile users:''' It's easy to delete files without considering the fate of some greater work they were part of (such as this tutorial), and not even bother to leave notice about what happened and why '''on the pages that have linked to them.''' It takes comparatively little energy to delete a file. Unlike to create one. Even though both operations have ''equally'' profound effect. Some people seem to have lost this sense of balance (or have never had it in the first place) between these two opposite modes. Perhaps it's their broader pattern that they do things merely because they can do them.
# '''Commons pages of deleted files look like these files have never existed,''' rather than been deleted—making it much less likely for someone to give it a second thought and possibly spot an abuse of deletion.

''The bottom line:'' I failed to find out what happened (and why) to the images missing from this tutorial, and to repair them, due to multiple obstacles in the ways Wikimedia sites work at this time. I'm hoping the problem only looks this big while actually not being so—that I just had bad luck today or so. But facts are there.

=== P.S. ===

Hey, I found them in the deletion log!

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;
# http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Image:Blander-sample-2d-logo.jpg&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;hide_review_log=1

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was looking in the wrong Wikimedia: Commons—instead of Books. (It's because the missing image links redirect to Commons.) The proper deletion log page is simply ''[[Special:Log]].''

So one legible explanation why they were deleted, that I found, is this:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background-color: #dddddd; padding: 0.5em 1em&quot;&gt;
''image with no copyright info, listed for over 7 days, no links.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It appears that the author of this tutorial has disappeared from Mediawiki with [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/2D_Image_(logo)_to_a_3D_Model&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=236267 the last contribution ever] on 19 September 2005. Which is shame. I'm hoping he is alright.

Unfortunately, after finishing his work, he failed to tag his (probably genuine) illustrations with copy-free licence.

Even more unfortunately, this omission was only spotted with a two-years delay. (Sometimes it's better quick—or never.) By that time, he was not with us anymore to avert this little but critical error.

And that's how a good work has gone shit, instead of being preserved for years to come.

Theoretically, I guess, it is possible to undelete them for the purpose of individual re-creation and tagging with a proper licence—if someone was so determined.

&lt;small&gt;''—[[User:6birc|6birc]] ([[User talk:6birc|talk]]) 02:20, 5 May 2010 (UTC)''&lt;/small&gt;

It appears that the author ''is'' alive—it's just an extreme case of loss of interest in Wikimedia (perhaps computers in general): here is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lion/Archive_2&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111996965 his Wikipedia edit] two years later, in 2007. All we learn about him from there is that he had his 9th grade biology class in year 1984. He has turned with his interest to cats since. Now I can go to sleep &lt;tt&gt;;-)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''—[[User:6birc|6birc]] ([[User talk:6birc|talk]]) 02:47, 5 May 2010 (UTC)''&lt;/small&gt;

: people come, write about what interests them, then lose interest, and dissapear... it's the way of the wiki... thanks for researching these! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 13:42, 3 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:MeshModeling.svg|thumb|Your sketch should look like this.]]

Mesh modeling is the most common type of modeling in all of Blender-dom.  If you did the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Model|Quickie Model]] tutorial, then you've already participated in mesh modeling. A mesh is simply a collection of vertices that define a three dimensional object. This exercise will further help explain mesh modeling.

# Get a piece of paper and a pen or pencil.
# Draw three dots that are no more than 2.5 cm (about an inch) apart from each other
# Each one of these dots is called a '''vertex'''.  (The plural of vertex is &quot;vertices&quot;)
# Now connect two of the dots with a line segment.  The line segment is called an '''edge'''.
# Draw two more edges so that the three vertices are all connected.  You should now have a triangle drawn on the paper.  Fill the triangle in.  This is called a '''face'''.
# Now draw another vertex (dot) on the paper.  Connect it to two of the vertices (dots) you previously drew.  You have another triangle.  Fill it in to create another face.

Could you imagine doing this same sort of activity in 3D space?  Essentially, mesh modeling is just that. The details are on subsequent pages in this tutorial.

You can keep filling up the paper with more vertices, edges, and faces if you want.  You may want to try and create something interesting with your triangles. Blender also supports faces with four vertices (called quads), but faces with five or more (so-called N-gons) cannot be created.

''Look closely at a 3D video game character some time. Believe it or not, every part of the character is created from little triangles joined together (of course, the triangles are much harder to see in newer games using more detailed technology).''

When you're creating your models, remember that the whole point of having edges and vertices is so that you can have control points in 3D space for your faces.  When the scene is rendered, only the faces will be seen.  Any edges or vertices not connected to a face will not appear.

'''Bah Kut Teh''' (literally, &quot;spare rib tea&quot;) is a Hokkien specialty. It is an exotic herbal soup spiced with plenty of aromatic spices including [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], cloves and lots of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]. It is often served with Chinese doughnuts and goes well with white rice. It usually comes with a small serve of cut red chillies in dark soya sauce or garlic.

==Ingredients==

* 1½ lb (680 g) [[Cookbook:Pork|pork spareribs]], cut into 2 inch (5 cm) pieces
* 1 whole bulb garlic, unpeeled and slightly crushed
* 2 inch (5 cm) [[Cookbook:Chinese Herbs|ginseng root]], peeled and slightly crushed
* 3 cinnamon sticks
* 5 star anise
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|white peppercorns]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|dark soy sauce]]
* 6 dried [[Cookbook:Mushroom|shitake]] mushrooms
* 6 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]], finely sliced and fried golden brown (optional)
* Salt and pepper

==Procedure==

# Soak dried shitake mushrooms in 240 ml of boiling water to reconstitute, when soft slice into strips; reserve liquid for cooking.
# In a stockpot, cover spareribs with cold water, parboil ribs until froth rises to the surface.
# Drain, briefly rinse spareribs under cold running water and drain again.
# In a casserole pan add the parboiled spare ribs, garlic bulb, ginseng root, shitake mushrooms, reserved liquid and additional water (to cover the meat).
# Wrap cinnamon, star anise, white and black peppercorns in cheesecloth, tie with string and add to the pan.
# Gradually bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to simmer until pork is very tender, about 45 mins to 1 hr; occasionally skim off fat from the surface.
# When the meat is almost falling off the bones; discard spice bag, season with salt and pepper and add dark soy sauce and sugar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Seems like more of a plug than a tutorial.  It is not easy to read, or to apply this tutorial.

For the beginner I suggest using pictures with each stage or step.  It is not easy to apply simple examples as shown on the home site.
Please try to include some pictures and notes on how to use the buttons... etc. 
Thanks...

Appears to have been updated.
Thank you to whoever updated this page.

Lol, no probs ! I'm busy now so the last part is still missing. I think I will make it during holidays ( or maybe someone else can do ;) ).

=== Can't use Track to Constraint ? ===

It's impossible to get something to &quot;track to contraint&quot; It tends to go to a dot at 0,0,0 (x,y,z) can anyone explain this?

* That's strange, it is working for me, and I can't do the thing you describe. I tried with a camera, a mesh and a spotlight, pointing to other diverse objets, and it worked. (Ow I discovered that when an object was assigned to &quot;Track to&quot; multiple objects, it looked in the exact middle of them. Don't know what it can be used to ;-) I exactly followed what I wrote in the tutorial and I had no problems. What is your version of Blender ? Mine is 2.35 (I know, I should upgrade :-P ) -- [[User:Totophe64|Totophe64]]


=== Why hasen't the rest of the tut been finished? ===
Hey, can you try to finish this tut, I'm a noob, wanting to be a pro, but I can't be a pro if I don't know what to do, so can you help me out please?

=== Dark ===
I am not sure why all the pics in this tutorial are so dark. None of my come out the same way, all are much lighter. ~ [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] ([[User talk:Nanobug|talk]]) 02:43, 24 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Arjuna meets Krishna at Prabhasakshetra.jpg|thumb|left|The Hindu deity Lord Krishna meets his friend,cousin and brother-in-law, Arjuna, the warrior hero of the Mahabharata]]
Hinduism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. It is a polytheist anthropomorphic religion with a highly ritualized form of worship. The canon of books and poems that define Hinduism were written in Sanskrit and are of ancient origin. They range from Epics about the lives and loves of the Gods, philosophical treatises on metaphysical questions, and law books. The Hindu religion has provided the roots of Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. In the West it can be found in the Hare Krishna movement. Hinduism is the majority religion of India, Nepal, and Mauritius and a significant minority religion in Fiji, Suriname, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Classics ==
If you have no idea what to do, and don't mind her knowing you are interested in her, try these:

* Cinema - Most classic example, yet very usable, it's standard in the adolescent blind date scene, you can have fun even if the girl wants to spoil your evening. Some people think it's really boring, because you don't get to talk or look at each other.
* Restaurant - She will usually expect you to pay for her; as a first date, you may both have an overly awkward feeling.  Requires excellent conversation skills. 
* Cooking for/with her - More creative, but considered too dangerous for a first meeting of two almost-strangers!
* Theatre - like the cinema, but a bit more unusual (and more expensive)
* Local Play - Instead of a theatre, try going to a small local production, like at a community center. These are often quite professional, almost always a lot of fun, relatively inexpensive, and a lot less formal than a theatre.
* Amusement Park - If you're young enough (teen), try going on a trip together with a school, community center, etc. You're probably not going to be paying for both of you. (Tickets usually cost $20-50). Hang out together in the park, maybe eat lunch together.
* Go for a walk together - Free, non-threatening first date for almost-strangers. Some people tend to prolong such walks.  According to the &quot;don't act needy&quot; rule, an early withdrawal might be better.

== Creative things ==
''alphabetized list''
* Bar/Pub - why does this even need to be listed?
* Beach - go for a walk on the beach, sunrise, sunset, any time. Swim or don't, play in the sand, build castles, or have a mudfight. This is a good teen activity. The beach is particularly romantic at night (maybe too much for a first date) with the stars, the relative darkness, and the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore.
* Bowling  
* Church or other kinds of religious services - Attend religious services together.  Afterward, find out about each other's spiritual side.   Reverently and respectfully discuss religious beliefs.
* Concerts / summer rock festivals - Choose a band that has lively music and bright lights.  A band she would obviously not know about is a good choice.  Conversation would also not necessary during the &quot;main event&quot; while you can still see her (unlike movies) and perhaps dance or headbang.  Later then, should be a good time to reminisce and talk about past experiences.  Be careful not to get separated.   (Bring along a set of earplugs to rock festivals just in case she has sensitive hearing; she will perceive this as a thoughtful gesture)
* Crafts/Arts - Finger paint together, make foam swords, do origami, paper airplanes, paper maché, or some other creative activity
* Convention center show - Call up the nearest city's convention center and see what's on.
* The &quot;Country&quot; - If you live in an urban area with a lot of things to do, take a drive to where people get their kicks from picking off blackbirds from the fence with a rifle. (Note: This may be a bad idea for a first date.  Also, find out her thoughts about shooting animals first.  Target practice on inanimate objects may be better.)   Teaching her how to hold a rifle is one of the classic ways to get close to a girl (the &quot;teaching embrace&quot;).
* Dancing - No, you don't want to lead her into a normal disco where you have to fight the fleas that suddenly get interested in your girl... Try a Latin/salsa place, if you know how to dance it. Mostly they are cheap, there are a lot of tables, and the guys usually respect a couple. Also dancing is a fabulous way to feel up a girl.  Or, learn some basic ball-room dancing moves such as twirling, and especially dipping (girls like both those moves).  Learn how to lead.  Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies may provide some inspiration.  
* Drive-in Movie - The classic aspect of a regular movie might make a girl yawn. Many cities still have Drive-in theatres. Try catching a scary movie here!
* Errands - Not exactly a date per se, but taking a girl along to get useful things done can be a good neutral way to get to know each other on more or less a friendly basis. Call up that girl and ask her if she wants to come along with you to buy groceries, register for classes, or even shopping for clothes (be careful about the whole &quot;clothes&quot; thing though - I think you know what I mean).  
* Expensive Areas - A lot of girls like to look at mansions, unless they live in one.   Share your favorite ideas of what you would include in your dream house.  
* Food - early morning breakfast, or no-fork spaghetti, or a marathon dinner, or a dollar dinner (what you can find to eat for a dollar per person), or cornflakes by candlelight, or backwards dinner (with food on the table, eat while sitting facing the opposite direction), dinner at a campground, pacific island-themed dinner, and so on...
* Games - Play hide-and-go-seek in the mall (Limit the area, if it is too large), play blind volleyball.  
* Hikes - Similarly, if there are some good nature areas around (state parks, historic sites, etc.), a good date can be walking a trail through them. On the magnitude of 3-5 miles gives you some time to be together without being too strenuous.  Take along enough water &amp; energy snacks for the two of you.  (shows thoughtfulness) 
* Kite-flying - You could both try to make an old-fashioned kite, or you could just get a cheap kite or two.
* Miniature Golfing - A fun activity that allows some conversation, but an even balance of an activity as well.
* Museums, Art - A nice combination of modern and classical art is good, so that you can get a break now and again from being weirded out by all the abstract stuff.  Analyze out loud what feelings different works of art evoke and invite her to do the same.  (This shows her that you are in touch with your emotional side.)  Be respectful of her opinions, even if they are opposite yours.    
* Park - go to a local park, sit on the benches and talk, or go for a walk around the lake. Lay down in a big grassy field at night.  Now ''that's'' romantic.
* Parties - Going for a party is always a nice idea.
* Holiday Parties - have a Christmas party in July and go carolling.  (most fun in a big group)
* Playground - Can be found in schoolyards and parks.  Make sure it is has decent-sized equipment to play on.  Swings are a classic.  Give her an under-dog.  The right playground equipment will give you an opportunity to show off your physical prowess in a non-threatening, childlike way. 
* Pool - relatively cheap, can be a great way to have some fun.
* Rock climbing - rock walls are a great start. A nice excuse to show your strength and to help her climb.
* Scenery - Anywhere outdoor with a nice lookout.  Nothing like an romantic evening under the stars - and there will most likely be a coffee place to learn about each other.  Not to mention you can show off your astronomy skills - girls love it.
* Shopping - In any city there are interesting locations to go, Chinatown for example or a gothic or freaky shop.
* Skating - Any type (roller skating, roller blading, ice skating, etc.) will do.  It is a (relatively) painless and cheap way to spend some quality time.
* Skiing - Skiing although sometimes expensive is a great way to &quot;break the ice&quot; especially if you are a particularly good skiier
* Sports - Racquetball, Tennis, Soccer, Volleyball, Swimming, Bicycles, Ice Skating, Bowling, Roller skating... find out if she likes to watch or play these, and make it part of a date.
* Sunrise anything - See if she is a morning person.   See what she looks like without makeup
* Tea - Find a good teahouse, ask around. Sophisticated girls will love this one!
* Theme Restaurant - These can be fun! Esepecially one where you and her may both have childhood memories!  
* Tricks - glue a quarter to the sidewalk, preferably in an area that gets a lot of people passing through, and then videotape the people who notice it. 
* Watching - Watching a big event on TV at your house. Probably not a sports game unless she's interested. Or watch TV with no sound and make up the funniest things they could be saying. Another idea is to watch shows like Jerry Springer and cover up the idea of that episode (i.e. &quot;my mother was a [blank]&quot;, or &quot;my [blank] was a [blank] behind my back) and try and guess it. You can also watch a couple of episodes from your favorite TV series (make sure she likes it first) this will also give you the chance to give her something for example &quot;I'm getting some hot chocolate, whould you like some?&quot;.
* Water - Water, like ponds or lakes, often has a romantic quality about it. Pick a place with lots of birds or other wildlife.
* Water Balloons - fill up a bunch on a hot day and then have a water balloon fight.  Make sure she wants to get wet first.  
* Zoo - You'll have tons to talk about and pretend you're both like kids again.

Be creative. Maybe some things you liked to do in your youth?

For clarification, '''Currently Untitled Studio''' means just that, not that CUS is the name of the studio. The name will be changed as work progresses. In either case, this is a case study/log of events concerning production of a series of shorts undertaken by DorianGray (director) and a group of volunteers.

Note: The first few weeks of work are not dated, or have only been dated by the accuracy of memory. Specific items such as previous ideas, names, and storylines/scripts will not be mentioned or changed for privacy, liability and copyright reasons. These will possibly be changed as work progresses/finishes.

[[File:Scomber scombrus illustration.png|thumbnail|right|An illustration of an Atlantic Mackerel]]
'''[[w:Mackerel|Mackerel]]''' is an oily-fleshed sea fish found throughout the oceans of the world. The flesh is strong-flavoured and the fish is bony, which means it is not a fish for beginners. 

It is important to buy mackerel as fresh as possible. If you can, buy it with the head on, so that you can see if the eye is still bright; if it isn't, don't buy it. 

One way of cooking mackerel is to chop off the head and gut the fish, then make up a paste of [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon juice]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] and [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]. 

Make some incisions into the side of the fish, then rub the paste over the skin of the fish, working it into the cuts. Fill the body cavity with finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] and herbs. Wrap the fish in foil and bake it in a preheated medium oven for about 20 minutes. Serve with boiled [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]].

Mackerel can also be grilled and served, unlikely as it may seem, with a [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]] of [[Cookbook:Gooseberry|gooseberries]].

Smoked mackerel can be bought in most supermarkets and fishmongers and is often served with a salad.

[[Image:Rosemary.jpg|right|thumb|Rosemary]]

'''Rosemary''' is a perennial woody herb, which grows in temperate and Mediterranean climates. The thin  needle-like leaves are used in cooking.  They have a bitter, astringent taste, which complements oily foods, such as [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] and oily fish.

Rosemary can also be used a flavouring in [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] such as foccaccia. 

You can put whole branches of the plant on to the hot coals of a barbecue to flavour the food being cooked, or strip off the leaves and use the stem as a skewer for [[Cookbook:Kebab|kebabs]] (but you will need to pierce a hole in the food with a real skewer first, and soak the stem in water before use, to prevent it burning). 

When [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]] a leg of lamb, branches of fresh rosemary can be laid in the roasting pan directly under the meat to keep it from sticking to the pan, and to infuse the meat with aroma of rosemary. Also strip the leaves off a branch or two, to sprinkle on top of the meat before roasting.

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]], sprigs of rosemary are traditionally worn on ANZAC day, to commemorate the soldiers from those countries who have fought in all wars since the Great War.

''Focaccia'' is a type of a somewhat flat yeast bread from Italy. The basic bread is often topped with any of the following: [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]], [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], and can be seen as a precursor to pizza. Focaccia is commonly used for [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]].

Makes 1 loaf.

== Inputs and Outputs ==

Input is something put into a system or expended in its operation to achieve output or a result.  Output is the information produced by a system or process from a specific input.  Within the context of systems theory, the inputs are what are put into a system and the outputs are the results obtained after running an entire process or just a small part of a process.  Because the outputs can be the results of an individual unit of a larger process, outputs of one part of a process can be the inputs to another part of the process.

== Input-Output Analysis ==

Input-output analysis is “a technique used in economics for tracing resources and products within an economy. The system of producers and consumers is divided into different branches, which are defined in terms of the resources they require as inputs and what they produce as outputs. The quantities of input and output for a given time period, usually expressed in monetary terms, are entered into an input-output matrix within which one can analyze what happens within and across various sectors of an economy where growth and decline takes place and what effects various subsidies may have” (Krippendorf).

== Areas of Consideration ==

Systems theory is “transdisciplinary study of the abstract organization of phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or spatial or temporal scale of existence” (Universiteit).  It can be applied to general systems that exist in nature or, in a business context, organizational or economic systems.  In studying systems theory, there are a few common, major aspects to consider. 

One must look at the individual objects that compose a system.  The objects consist of the parts, elements, or variables that make up the system.  The objects that make up a system can be physical objects that actually exist in the world, or they can be abstract objects or ideas that cannot be found physically in the world.  

One must also consider the attributes of a system.  The attributes consist of the qualities and properties of the aforementioned objects of the system.  The attributes may also describe the entire system itself.  

A third consideration would be the internal relationships among the objects of a system.

The fourth consideration would be the environment in which the system exists.  

All of these aspects of a system play an important role.  Using these four characteristics, a system can then be defined as “a set of things that affect one another within an environment and form a larger pattern that is different from any of the parts.”  Furthermore, “The fundamental systems-interactive paradigm of organizational analysis features the continual stages of input, throughput (processing), and output, which demonstrate the concept of openness/closedness” (Universiteit).

== Systems Defined ==

A system can be defined by using the definition of desired outputs to understand what inputs are necessary.  The following questions can be used for this method:
# What essential outputs must the system produce in order to satisfy the system users’ requirements?
# What transformations are necessary to produce these outputs?
# What inputs are necessary for these transformations to produce the desired outputs?
# What types of information does the system need to retain?

Another way of defining a system is to work forward in a stimulus-response method of definition.  The following questions can be asked in conjunction with this method in order to define the system:
# What are the stimuli, and what are the responses to each stimulus?
# For each stimulus response pair, what are the transformations necessary?
# What are the essential data that must be maintained?

These methods can be used to define not just the general system in question, but also the subsystems which compose the larger system as a whole (Sauter).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autonomous Technology-Assisted Language Learning (ATALL)''' includes (a) the development and use of technological tools to facilitate foreign language (FL) or second language (L2) learning (both to be used synonymously hereafter), and (b) research on the development, use, and effects of such tools.

ATALL is autonomous in that it provides the means for language learners to improve their L2 proficiency whether or not they are taking formal courses in the language they are learning.  Thus, ATALL can be used by students in conjunction with formal L2 study or by learners who are not taking L2 classes.  ATALL activities can be used as an integrated component of formal L2 courses or for supplemental study (and perhaps extra credit) within L2 courses.  ATALL can also be used by non-native L2 teachers who wish to improve their L2 skills and show their students how they can continue to develop their L2 proficiency outside of class.  &quot;Autonomous&quot; also implies that the tools are widely available (such as via the World Wide Web) at no or low cost (see [http://ec.hku.hk/autonomy/ Autonomy in Language Learning] for resources about autonomy and language learning; for a comprehensive, empirically-based theory of human autonomy, see [[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Perceptual Control Theory|Perceptual Control Theory]] and the [http://www.perceptualcontroltheory.com Control Systems Group]).

ATALL encompasses ''all'' forms of electronic and information technology that can be used to facilitate L2 proficiency.  This includes the obvious tools of computer and Internet technology.  But it also includes other forms of communication technology such as wired and wireless telephony, television and radio (broadcast, satellite and cable) and the integration of older communication technologies with newer information technologies.

ATALL is based on the latest theory and research on second language acquisition [[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Second_language_acquisition |(SLA)]], the [[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Learning_psychology | psychology of learning]] and computer-assisted language learning ([[MetaWikipedia:wikipedia:Computer-assisted_language_learning|CALL]]).  Research and theory provides directions and implications for how technology can best be used to improve L2 proficiency in the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing.  Principles derived from L2 research and theory are applied to the development of ATALL tools and activities.

ATALL activities can be divided into the five primary domains of '''input''', '''output''', '''interaction''', '''exercise''', and '''assessment''', which form five of the primary modules of this wikibook.

{{expand|section}}

===Attribution===
====Credits====
Videos often include credits at the start or end of content. This type of attribution ensures that viewers are aware of a video's contributors. Credits may also be transcribed for the visually impaired.

=====Design=====
Sometimes, the delivery of credits may be sufficiently artistic or dramatic in such a way that contributes to the viewer's overall experience.

======Text======
[[File:Little Red Walking Hood title card.png|thumb|300px|Leading contributors can be featured alongside a video's title]]
Text may be presented with a variety of methods and can be opaque, transparent, or even artistic.

;Single-frame method
In some cases, all contributors can be credited in a single still frame near the beginning or end of a video. This method is simple but impractical for videos with a large number of contributors.

;Marquee method
The marquee method consists of one or more streams of scrolling text, typically oriented vertically or horizontally. For aesthetic purposes or to create a focal point, text is sometimes faded with a gradient. This method is commonplace in many videos.

;Serial method
The serial method describes text where contributors are credited individually. This method can sometimes be manipulated for effect when carefully synchronized with audio that is complementary or suspenseful.

======Backgrounds======
;Static
Static backgrounds, a common example being solid black, are simple and can provide high contrast for viewers.

;Hybrid
When possible, a static background can be framed in graphics, animations, or video.

;Uninterrupted content
In many cases, credits can overlay uninterrupted video without any issue. This may be desirable or undesirable depending on the video and intended audience.

;Tailored scenes
Production value can often be greatly enhanced by the integration of video that is purposefully tailored for displaying credits. For example, if introductory credits are desired and a video's first scene portrays political proceedings, text could overlay video of the legislative building followed by a person walking up its steps to the doors. 

======Placement======
Credit placement can play an important role in its accessibility, the ability to provide context, and even a video's overall production value. Typically, credits are placed near the beginning and/or end of a video, but they can also be interspersed. In some cases, the visibility of credits—especially those at the end of a video—may be diminished by a broadcaster's proclivities, such as the use of picture-in-picture to introduce subsequent programs or sometimes even outright omission. 

;Opening credits
Credits can be placed at the beginning of a video. Often, this is done to highlight leading contributors while other contributors are listed in closing credits.

;Closing credits
Credits can be placed at the end of a video. This placement is often used for comprehensive attribution.

;Realtime attribution
The realtime model is often preferred in cases where communicating context to the viewer in real-time is a top priority. This method is frequently accompanied by one or more others and is typical of journalistic productions.

Some videos also use  attribution as a humorous [[w:Gimmick|gimmick]] or to suggest irony.

======Styles======
;Staging method
The staging method entails a series of static frames, each crediting a given number of contributor. When used as part of an introductory phase, this method allows for leading contributors to be featured and can also be used to incorporate visual elements that affect the viewer's perception of succeeding content. For example, these visual elements might include key characters, allusive symbols, enthralling objects, or immersive scenes with each new interval of progression.

;Interspersed method
The interspersed method employs gradual crediting of contributors in phases spanning a prolonged introductory period or sometimes even an entire video. This method may be used for effect, such as to tantalize or surprise, or to add artistic value. Contributors may be credited along with the introduction of a relevant character, scene, theme, or plot. In many cases, this method is best combined with one or more others.

====Metadata====
Metadata can facilitate the attribution of contributors in some digital formats.

=====MP4=====
MPEG-4 supports the ISO-standardized [[w:Extensible Metadata Platform|Extensible Metadata Platform]] in addition to its own metadata format.

====Resources====
===Intermission===
[[File:Content intermission.svg|thumb|right|300px|An intermission screen]]
Intermission is sometimes desired, or even in the case of videos produced live, a necessity.

===Length===
Video length is often an important consideration.

====Palatability====

====Limitations====
Some distribution platforms platforms are designed to accommodate videos of a specific length. For instance, a television station may have program blocks of 15 and 30 minutes, while an online hosting provider may allow for hours or even seconds, in the case of a Vine.

Limitations may become a cross-consideration in the event that a video has enough potential to be desired in its original form on an alternate format, which is something to evaluate in certain circumstances.

===Live broadcasts and streams===
[[File:Content introduction.svg|thumb|right|300px|Introductory screens inform viewers that content will begin soon]]
Productions that utilize live video present unique considerations.

=== Transcription ===
Subtitles and transcripts are different: a transcript is only the text of the video, whereas a subtitle file includes the timecode as well. Subtitle files have a variety of formats (.srt, .sub, etc.), but they are compatible with each other.

====Subtitles====
It is very important for independent video producers to make available subtitle files (or at least transcripts) when they are distributing their work. Furthermore, it is highly beneficial for online video distribution projects to include an option to upload subtitles/transcripts with the video files, even as a way to raise awareness on the issue. Without a subtitle file in the original language, it is much much more difficult to translate a video, which highly limits the possibility of its distribution.

=====Preparation=====

=====Formatting=====

=====Translation=====
======Workflow======
This is a suggested workflow that would make translation of your video or DVD much easier. It avoids the problem caused by networking transcriptions of video features without the time code, which is that each transcript then has to be timecoded for each language. With co-ordination we should be able to avoid this. There is a project and sample workflow for subtitling [http://www.network23.org.uk/node/79 here]. This also includes a suggested [[/Workflow for translators helping video collectives with subtitle translations]]. Work that needs to be done: building a network of translators familiar with the use of subtitling software that can read, edit and create *.srt subtitle files.

===Encoding===
{{Main|Video Production/Encoding}}
Because raw video files are tremendously large by contemporary standards—an uncompressed half-hour 1920x1080 8-bit video at 30 frames per second will exceed 300 GB, for example—it is generally necessary to make use of a process known as encoding. The same 300GB video, when encoded with a common codec, will be reduced to about 20 GB.

There are a few popular ways of encoding video using commercial solutions and many free options exist as well.

====Codecs====
Codecs are software algorithms that compress data into a desired container format. 

Many codecs exist and in order to select the one most suitable, several factors may need to be considered, including availability, video quality, compression efficiency, compatibility with the intended method of distribution, and licensing.

====Introduction to using Open Source Tools for Video Production and distribution====

Different Software is used for the many stages of the Video production process. Depending on what platform you use there are various different levels of effectiveness and ease of use of the open source solutions.

This is a section of notes on interpretations of the scope and ease of use of different Free and Proprietary software. 

[[/Mick Fuzz's notes on Windows &amp; Mac platforms and Free Software solutions/]]

==== Working out what kind of Video File you have ====

If you are uploading a video file and you often need to know what type/ codec it is to allow people to be able to make the correct choice to download it.   


====How to Make a Video podcast====

What is a podcast?

Why create one?
Video podcasts are a good way to distribute your Video. They can be seen in programs like iTunes, Democracy player and Fireant. If you get the format of you video file right they can also be downloaded onto portable devices. They can also be featured on other people's websites often as a list at the side of their pages. This is called syndication.

What do you need to do to make one?

Get you audio or video ready for the Internet. 
(see encoding notes)

Essentially you have to make specialised a text file available on your website. This file is written in a simple Markup language  which gives details about your video. It part of it might look a bit like this. 

&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt; 

You can if you choose hand code this file, but there are automated ways which make it a bit easier. This next section examines the different solutions. 

=====Using Blogger and Feed burner and Archive.org=====

Once you have created your audio / video files, you can use these 3 free tools to create podcasts.

======Step one: put your media up online with archive.org / ftp to a webspace======

To do this you first need to sign up to be an archive.org member. Go to the front page, click join us, and follow the instructions. 


With this tool you can upload your music / video file to the archive.org site, and choose a copyright licence to go with it. You will then get a page where the link to your file is displayed.

Or if you have some webspace that you can upload your files to. Use an FTP client to do this. 

======blogger.com======

You can create a blog quickly and easily at blogger.com - A blog is a simple web page which is diary like in format listing the latest posting first (just like a podcast does).  

In the settings panel of blogger.com you can adjust the formatting tab so that you can include a link with every post. In the link field we need to paste a link to the uploaded media file on achive.org.

======feedburner.com======

blogger.com creates an RSS feed for all your entries, but it is not a Podcast. You can't use a program like iTunes with it yet. We need to use a service called feedburner to change the feed into a Podcast. 

To do this we need to click an option on the feedburner settings called smartcast. 

=====Using a  Video Content Management system=====

======Ourvideo CMS - (not a big community  of developers)======

Ourvideo CMS is a Media content management system running on MySql and php. It is aimed at community and low budget groups and can help them achieve their aims at a lower cost in the following ways. There are minimal changes to the standard server environment to help groups that don't have access to a high level server administration resources.


======Loud Blog website======

Loudblog is a flexible and easy-to-use Content Management System (CMS) for publishing media content on the web. It automatically generates a website and multimedia distribution via Podcasting.

Loudblog needs to be installed on a webserver and requires systems administrator level skills for install and setup. It will allow you to host your own website with integrated audio and video distribution support. 

You can upload your audio/video via ftp, via web forms, by fetching external links - thus hosting them on your server, or linking to external files.

It is designed for audio, and creates a flash audio preview. This is also possible with some video files. So the web presentation of your media is pretty good. It takes the form of a blog.  

It creates a podcast with iTunes categories. 

Disadvantages: 
* This is set up for audio files, so while the podcasts do work for video files, you get unsuitable messages on the wen pages, like &quot;listen now&quot;
* The RSS podcast doesn't have images associated with it yet. It has no &quot;media:thumbnail&quot; element in the feed.

======Word Press CMS======

The wordpress content management system has a very simple approach to podcasting. 

How It Works

* Create audio or video that you want to share (usually MP3 or MP4)
* Upload the file to a server
* Link to the file in a post in your weblog
* Wordpress automatically Includes a link to the file in your RSS/Atom feed
* Listeners &quot;subscribe&quot; with podcast client application to your RSS/Atom feed and download new files automatically. 

WordPress creates all the necessary links for you! 

Disadvantages:
Archive.org can be used to host podcast audio files but archive.org uses re-directs on the file paths it publishes - this confuses WordPress, and consequently, the Podcast publication fails (missing enclosure tag error).

To avoid this error, if you are hosting your audio files on archive.org, you need to add a Custom Field called &quot;enclosure&quot; and paste the full URL for the mp3 file in the Value field. 

=====Rss editor for Windows=====

If you don't want to enter details in to a Content Management system, or don't have the technology to set one up. Then there is an alternative. If you have ftp access to your website. You can enter the details of each podcast item into a program called rss editor and it will alter and upload the RSS file you need to have a podcast.

Tutorial &gt;&gt; [[/Rss editor for win/]]

=====Notes on Media RSS / Podcasting specifications=====
Unfortunately the Media RSS specification used by Democracy player and Yahoo isn't the same as the Podcasting specification used by iTunes. The solution is to avoid things that will make your feed unreadable in either.  

==Distribution==
For issues that are not covered in the corporate media, using a network of community screenings, independent cinemas and pirate TV is a good way to get your media, such as a film or documentary, out there.

=====Tactical use of the Internet to distribute Video=====

Here is a proposed model of how groups could work together to create and distribute content via the Internet
[[/Convergence and collaboration model/]]
This includes recent reflection and thoughts on the European Newsreal Project. 

Here is a work in progress for how to distribute a video file as widely as possible
[[/Wide distribution/]]

* Collaborative projects to create Video content using the Internet

Asia 247: Online contributions are picked up by an editorial team who collate the material and contextualise it for daily podcast transmission. They are active in training video producers from across Asia in using this technology. 

The European newsreal is a half hour magazine whose production and distribution is decided in a decentralised way with the use of email lists and online collaborative tools like wikis.


=====Appropriate Use of Video released over the Internet=====

[[/Appropriate use/]]

Some thoughts on specifying the appropriate/ethical uses of online video.

=====Content Management Systems and related tools for Video on the Net=====

Plone is one system that can be used, Engage Media are working with other plone developers on multimedia aspects of this set of tools. 

Drupal is another popular content management system (CMS) that can be used to manage your video online. 

Some work has been done on aggregation sites which really maximises the capacity of Drupal to import and manage RSS or RDF data. 

One example of this is the V2V site which outputs data in RDF form which can then be imported into a CMS.

===Television===
====Terrestrial Broadcast====
{{expand|section}}

=====Pirate TV=====

====Cable====

====Satellite====
=====United States=====
======Free Speech TV (FSTV)======
It is possible to submit Social Justice video content to Free Speech TV which covers every state in the US. One very successful use of FSTV is Deep Dish TV, a New York based part of the network which collates the work of Independent Video producers and grass roots activists and puts together professional shows which are uplinked to FSTV. They are also recorded locally and retransmitted by over 200 local TV stations and cinema/community screeners. In this way the costs and time of copying and networking physical tapes and disks are reduced. 

FSTV also accept content from outside the USA, for example programmes from UK based Undercurrents Productions and the European Newsreal.

=====Europe=====
In Europe it is possible to rent the time of satellites without paying for them all the time. This may be useful to network programmes for retransmission to local TV stations and collectives. 

===Physical media===
Optical media, such as DVDs and Blu-ray discs, is commonly used in much of the world to physically distribute content. USB drives can also be used.

Books on Wikibooks should be structured in to sections (akin to chapters), in a manner at the discretion of the authors of the Wikibook. However, there is no one method of denoting substructure within Wikibook article names. This page is to discuss the merits of the currently used methods and to decide on a method to use, which will then become a definite recommendation to future books on [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]].

There are several issues involved in the naming convention, and it is the cleanest to discuss them separately (for example, which delimiter (&quot;:&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;(..)&quot;,..) to use is more or less independent of the question whether to allow several levels of hierarchy or whether numbers should be used for labelling chapters). Each section states current examples.

Please add to advantages or disadvantages below, or provide discussion alternatives.

== Delimiters ==
=== Subpages &quot;/&quot; ===
One method is to use subpages, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;bookname/subpagename&lt;/tt&gt;. 
 [[Wikijunior Solar System]]
 [[Wikijunior Solar System/Mars]]
 [[Wikijunior Solar System/Glossary]]

Advantages:
* The main merit to this scheme is that it allows for automatic navigation links within the hierarchy.
* This allows hierarchy but also allows sub-subhierarchy and more.
* Every sub(sub..)page gets a &lt;!-- &quot;link (inflexible though)&quot; replaced by the more neutral &quot;static link&quot; --&gt; static link to all its parents. One can reference to subpages with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/subpagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (i.e. bookname is not necessary).
* It will appear similar to directories in the URL as pointed out 1 1/2 years ago [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2003-July/000102.html] and in that sense also follows in principle the [[wikipedia:principle of least surprise|principle of least surprise]].

Disadvantages:
* The main demerit is that the scheme facilitates the use of subhierarchies, which may make the book slightly more difficult to read or present. Also, authors might be tempted to over-use the tree-structure. It might therefore be part of the recommendation, to use only one level of subpages, and a second only if needed in very large books (see separate discussion point below).
* Links from one subpage to another subpage must be typed in full.  Further, the pipe trick does not work for subpages; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname/Subpagename|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays as [[Bookname/Subpagename|Bookname/Subpagename]]
* All links to subpages are case sensitive; [[Wikijunior Solar System/The Sun]] vs [[Wikijunior Solar System/the Sun]]
* The delimiter &quot;/&quot; will interfere with the filesystem when one wants to save files and automatically process them by scripts and simple UNIX commands like grep. It would be required to use &lt;!-- &quot;get painfully awkward help from&quot; --&gt; &lt;!-- other UNIX commands --&gt; additional commands like &quot;mkdir&quot;, &quot;find&quot;, and &quot;xargs&quot;.
* The enforced tree structure is unsuitable for many uses. For example: anise is a spice, herb, and vegetable. There is no correct way to set this up such that automatic links will be provided for all uses of anise. One would have to choose more general tree nodes, like &quot;glossary/anise&quot; or a completely flat structure (&quot;cookbook/anise&quot;).

=== Real custom namespaces ===
One method is to use [[m:Help:Namespace#Custom namespaces|custom namespaces]], that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;bookname:subpagename&lt;/tt&gt;. Examples:
*[[Cookbook]]
*[[Cookbook:Grilled Cheese Sandwich]]
*[[Cookbook:Contributors]]

Advantages:
* This scheme is like other namespaces, and as such, follows the [[wikipedia:principle of least surprise|principle of least surprise]]. 
* Linking becomes simple using the pipe trick; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname:subpagename|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; becomes [[Bookname:subpagename|subpagename]].
*[[Special:Allpages]] can be applied to a book of choice.
*[[m:Help:User contributions|User contributions]] can show all, or be restricted to a book of choice.
*From MediaWiki 1.5 [[m:Help:Recent changes|Recent changes]] ditto; for this, Allpages and User contributions, one can also select all namespaces except a specified one; thus, one can still have a combined list including all book pages by selecting e.g. the image namespace and using the invert option.
*[[m:Help:Searching|Searching]] can be restricted to any subset of books.
*The variables &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NAMESPACE}} and {{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; give the book name and the page name without book name, respectively.

Disadvantages:
* Creation, deletion, and renaming of a custom namespace can only be done by a developer (when a new book is started, provisionally a pseudo-namespace can be used, see the next section).
* The maximum number of &quot;real&quot; namespaces is limited by the software to 256 (it is a TINYINT(2) in the SQL database), i.e. numbers 0-255. Custom namespace numbers start with 100, so there can be 156 of them, including talk pages, i.e. 78 custom namespaces and their talk namespaces. However, from MediaWiki 1.5 the maximum is 65,536, i.e. 32,718 custom namespaces and their talk namespaces, see [[Bugzilla:719]].

=== Pseudo-namespaces ===
Another method is to mirror that of namespaces, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;bookname:subpagename&lt;/tt&gt;, like above. 

Advantages:
* The main merit to this scheme is that it is mirrored in namespaces, and as such, follows the [[wikipedia:principle of least surprise|principle of least surprise]]. 

Disadvantages:
* The main demerit is that this scheme doesn't act as a namespace, but merely looks like one .
* With pseudo-namespaces, the pipe trick still works, but the first letter of the subpage name is case sensitive, which makes them less useful for inline links.

=== Brackets &quot;(..)&quot;===
One method is to use brackets, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;subpagename (bookname)&lt;/tt&gt;. 
 [[General Biology]]
 [[Energy and Metabolism (General Biology)]]
 [[Authors (General Biology)]]

Advantages:
* Similar to Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation]], people coming from Wikipedia will be familiar with this.
*This allows for easier linking, using the pipe trick; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[subpagename (bookname)|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; appears as [[subpagename]]. 
Disadvantages:
* More difficult to extract a list of books automatically in the future (see [[Wikibooks:Top active/All books]]). In an automatic extraction it is more difficult to tell apart a book title from the middle of a string, because it might be part of another subpage title. The extraction process is unique, if the bookname always appears on the front position.

=== No delimiter, no book title on subpages, all in wikibooks.org domain ===
One method is to use no delimiter at all, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;subpagename&lt;/tt&gt; (i.e. the bookname does not appear).

 [[World History]]
 [[Civilization and Empires in the Indian Subcontinent]]  (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
 [[The Industrial Revolution]]    (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
&lt;small&gt;([[World History]] pages have been changed in the meantime to namespace delimiter. The lines are kept as an example)&lt;/small&gt;
 [[Vector Math]] (&lt;- this single modules is referred to in the middle of the Geometry, Calculus, and Electronics books)
 [[ASCII character set]] (&lt;- this single module is referred to in the appendix of just about every programming language)

'''Advantages:'''
* Title of subpages does not get cluttered by long book title.
* Normal wiki ease-of-use is fully restored: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname:Foo|foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* Short modules that are part of several different wikibooks can be written once and for all. After improving that module in the course of editing one book, all the other books immediately use the improved version.
* This doesn't require a seperate database or software change -- it's already running at http://wikibooks.org/ .

'''Disadvantages:'''
* Without separate domain names or software changes (which are unlikely to happen soon) chapter pages are very likely to run soon into naming conflicts between books.

Note that '''both of the disadvantages''' may '''not''' be relevant for certain [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts|annotated texts]]. I.e. for specific texts with unique titles, which will be annotated only once, there are no naming conflicts. Therefore, no subdomains are required, nor any software changes, and normal wiki ease-of-use is fully maintained.
: I think you mix up &quot;no delimiter, no book title on subpages&quot; with the next section &quot;arbitrary delimiter&quot;, that is a blank space &quot; &quot;, or a section that still would have to be added. &quot;No delimiter, no book title on subpages&quot; means here that the bookname does '''not''' appear on every subpage, which makes it very likely that two books get into naming conflicts, even for annotated texts.

=== No delimiter, no book title on subpages, and separate domain names ===
One method is to use no delimiter at all, that is, for a Wikibook named ''bookname'', and a subpage called ''subpagename'', the article name is &lt;tt&gt;subpagename&lt;/tt&gt; (i.e. the bookname does not appear).
Also, each book is placed in a separate domain name.
 [[World History]]
 [[Civilization and Empires in the Indian Subcontinent]]  (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
 [[The Industrial Revolution]]    (&lt;- this is a subpage of World History!)
&lt;small&gt;([[World History]] pages have been changed in the meantime to namespace delimiter. The lines are kept as an example)&lt;/small&gt;
 [[Vector Math]] (&lt;- this single modules is referred to in the middle of the Geometry, Calculus, and Electronics books)
 [[ASCII character set]] (&lt;- this single module is referred to in the appendix of just about every programming language)

'''Advantages:'''
* Title of subpages does not get cluttered by long book title (but the book title is put in the domain name).
* Scalable, making it easier to split up wikibooks over more servers.
* No unrelated clutter in [[Special:Recentchanges]], [[Special:Allpages]], [[Special:Wantedpages]], [[Special:Lonelypages]], [[Special:Deadendpages]], and [[Special:Categories]]. '''(Yes! We need this!)'''
* Normal wiki ease-of-use is fully restored: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname:Foo|foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
* This doesn't require a seperate database or software change -- it's already running at http://wikicities.com/ .

'''Disadvantages:'''
* This requires separate domain names: cookbook.wikibooks.org
* A module cannot be shared between books -- the [[Vector Math]] module is custom to each book it appears in. If 10 different people make 10 different improvements to that module, those improvements are scattered over all the copies of that module, and it is hard to integrate them.

=== Arbitrary delimiter ===
Any character could be used as a delimiter, restricted only by the taste and imagination of the authors: &quot; &quot; (blank space), &quot;-&quot;, &quot;--&quot;, &quot;,&quot; (comma), &quot;;&quot;, .... All of these in combination with another blank &quot; &quot; (white space) either before, or after the delimiter, or both.
 [[As You Like It]]    &amp;rArr;  [[As You Like It - Act III]]
 [[Bicycle Repair]]    &amp;rArr;  [[Bicycle Repair Cleaning parts]]
 [[Using GNOME]]       &amp;rArr;  [[Using GNOME : File manager]]
Advantages:
* Each author can easily please their tastes.

Disadvantages:
* It is difficult to work efficiently upon different books without a clear convention.
* It is not consistent across books.
** Thus, it becomes a usability problem.

=== A combination ===
Use a combination of the above: For example place books into a designated namespace, but place pages on subpages.
 [[Musictionary]]
 [[Musictionary:Guitar]]
 [[Musictionary:Guitar/Bass]]

Advantages:
* Could combine the advantages of namespaces (if they were really activated) and of subpages (link to parent).

Disadvantages:
* Makes very long titles for subpages.
* For new users this approach does not seem intuitive and simple at all. Since two different delimiters are used, it might be cause of confusion or false usage.

=== Other ===
'' Please place other methods here ''

== Subhierarchy ==
=== As flat as possible ===
The naming of subpages should be done so that each subpage name reflects hierachy, but does not introduce sub-subpage level of hierachy. This should be done so that the ''subpagename'' together with the ''articlename'' sounds as natural as possible.
 [[US History]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian]]
 [[US History:Civil War]]

Advantages:
* Chapters can be easily rearranged in the future. The emphasis is on the content of the subpage, not its structural location within the book.

Disadvantages:
* The structure of the book is not visible from the title. One needs to refer to the table of contents, or other navigational help.

=== As structured as possible ===
A book could be structured in several chapters, sections, sub-section, and so on. Subpages allow easily to build this kind of hierarchy, but one is not limited to the use of subpages: With any kind of delimiter, a structuring is possible. For namespace-like delimiters, it is possible by adding extra :''subpagename'' sections, but this method is ''not'' mirrored in namespaces.
 [[Geometry]]
 [[US History]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian:Aztec Empire]]
 [[US History:Pre-Columbian:Mayan Empire]]

Advantages:
* Book structure is easily visible: One &quot;knows&quot; in which part of the book one is.

Disadvantages:
* The main demerit is that subhierachies may make a book slightly more difficult to read or present.
* Another disadvantage is that it doesn't allow for a page to be in more than one location in the hiearchy of non-linear wikibooks.  For example, [[Cookbook:San Francisco style Scallop Ceviche]] is a ceviche recipe, a main dish, an appetizer, a scallop recipe, and a California cuisine recipe, and could be structured under any of these. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:12, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Title on subpages ==
=== Use the full book name on subpages ===
A ''bookname'' scheme can be to use the same ''articlename'' on the contents and the book pages proper, ie ''bookname'' is the contents page and ''bookname'':''subpagename'' are on the subpages.
 [[SA NC Doing Investigations]]              &amp;lArr; bookname
 [[SA NC Doing Investigations:Chapter 1]]
 [[SA NC Doing Investigations:Chapter 2]]    &amp;lArr; same bookname

Advantages:
* One (reader and automatic software) can easily see which subpage belongs to which book.
* Given the name of any subpage, I know the name of the book. 

Disadvantages:
* Subpage heading might get very long.

=== Use a short book name on subpages ===
Another possibility is to use a long elaborate title for the book name, but a shorter title for the subpages, i.e. using a long ''bookname'' on the contents and a shorter ''shortbookname'' on the subpages. The shorter title should not be reduced to have the effect to reduce readability - for example, &quot;IP:...&quot; should not be used as a short title of &quot;Introduction to Philosophy&quot;; one reason why this is a bad idea is because it can be confused with a title such as &quot;Inside Perl&quot;?

 [[Learning the vi editor]]                 &amp;lArr; bookname
 [[Learning vi:Basic tasks]]
 [[Learning vi:Advanced tasks]]             &amp;lArr; shorter bookname

Advantages:
* The long title can be more descriptive, without cluttering all sections of a book.

Disadvantages:
* Makes automatic extraction of book information more difficult.
* Subpages only work when the exact title is used on every subpage.

== Numbers as chapters ==
=== Use chapter descriptions ===
 [[Business English/Getting more practice]]
 [[Business English/Phrasal verbs]]
 [[Business English/Phrasal verbs/Get]]

Advantages:
* One knows about the content of the chapter.
* It is easy to insert new chapters between existing ones or change their order (important for the wiki process!)
* Chapters can be easily rearranged in the future. The emphasis is on the content of the subpage, not its structural location within the book.

Disadvantages:
* One does not know about the current position within the book =&gt; need for additional navigational structure.

=== Use chapter numbers ===
 [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Chapter 1]]
 [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Chapter 2]]
 [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Chapter 3]]

Advantages:
* The structure of the book is emphasized.

Disadvantages:
* The number does not say anything about the content of the chapter.
* It is difficult to rearrange chapters or insert a new chapter between existing ones (move all higher books, or copy all content?). This is insofar severe, as wikibooks are expected to grow in the future.
* It is completely unusable in non-linear wikibooks.

=== Use chapter numbers and description ===
 [[Macbeth - Act 5, Scene 1 - Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle]]
 [[Macbeth - Act 5, Scene 2 - The country near Dunsinane]]
 [[Macbeth - Act 5, Scene 3 - Dunsinane. A room in the castle]]

Advantages:
* One knows in which part of the book one is.

Disadvantages:
* Difficult to insert new chapters.
* Long titles.

== Personal taste and discussion ==
''Please place advantages and disadvantages of the methods in the appropriate sections above, and put personal taste into here.''

I think, with all the mess around currently, the definite way for the future is to have a '''clear recommendation''' for future books (which hopefully will outnumber the existing books at some point in the future), whichever that might be.
Since subpages offer an automatic link to the parent page and (more or less) force to use exactly the same booktitle on all subpages of the book, my personal taste would be to promote subpages as the way to go, clearly recommending only 1 layer of substructure (no sub-subpages), and descriptions of chapters instead of numbers. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:37, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: The result of the below vote should not result in a mere recommendation - it should be ''policy''. I have no real problems with subpages other than the hierachy and the principle of least surprise comment that the &quot;:&quot; has that I've raised before. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:36, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::My thoughts are at [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]].  I don't find either of the namespace cons very persuasive -- we can use more than 200 namespaces right now, and the software could surely be changed to allow for me (is there a technical reason it has to be at any fixed number?). [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:49, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: Apart from the 15 standard namespaces, none of the additional namespaces listed on [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]] is actually really a namespace (Cookbook is none, Wikiversity is none... I know this because I restricted my [[Wikibooks:Top active]] SQL search to namespace &quot;0&quot;, and Cookbook and Wikiversity are both in there - my list of books counts 400 titles by the way). I cite from [[Wikibooks talk:Namespaces#Policy on namespaces]]:
:::: ''&quot;With the current implementation, having too many custom namespaces is a bad idea - they all have to be manually entered in the MediaWiki configuration file. Also, deleting and renaming namespaces is quite a pain. So I suggest keeping the number of custom namespaces small, at least at first, maybe 5 or 6.--Eloquence&quot;'' [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Namespaces#Policy_on_namespaces]
::: So we are really talking about &quot;pseudo&quot;-namespaces, that only ''look'' like namespaces but are not really (still, the pipe-trick works for them too: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[book:page|]] will display as [[page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Given that, it is just a matter of taste which symbol to use to delimit the bookname from the subpage name. The only true hierarchical support is given for subpages, which give an automatic link to the parent page. This option was not available when things were discussed on [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|Help:Namespaces]] (since subpages have been enabled only recently for the main namespace on Wikibooks), but is available now, and might help the many new wikibooks that pop up every week by providing the basic navigation &quot;for free&quot;. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 23:35, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

;Subpage disadvantages:
I put the following disadvantages for subpages which seem flavored by personal taste (&quot;..are very annoying..&quot;) to the discussion section, and converted the points above to a more neutral tone --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
* Hierarchy is often wrong. [[Cookbook:Anise|Anise]] is a spice, herb, and vegetable. [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] is both a cooking technique (verb) and a cooking tool (noun). Subpages do not allow for this; they only support tree structures.
*: This point should probably go under &quot;flat vs. structured&quot;. As pointed out above, I can have a flat hierarchy with all delimiters (&quot;/&quot;, &quot;:&quot;), as I can have a deep tree structure with all delimiters (e.g. Cookbook:Spices:Anise vs. Cookbook/Anise). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:: No, because the &quot;/&quot; delimiter is special. It has built-in wiki support that enforces a tree. This is no good.
* Subpages are very annoying if you wish to process wiki text as files. For example, one might save wiki text to files on a Linux system so that the grep command (or a slightly more complicated script) can be used. Having the &quot;/&quot; makes this awkward. Shell wildcard expansion fails, so the &quot;find&quot; command will be needed. Files can no longer simply be saved; a &quot;mkdir&quot; command will be required.
*: If a structure is &quot;annoying&quot; or not probably depends on what you want to do, how many wikibooks you want to process, and so on. I agree, if you had scripts working with your cookbook, and after a change they don't work anymore, this is annoying, but imagine that each wikibook would have its own url (cookbook.wikibooks.org, kochbuch.wikibooks.org, howtobuildacomputer.wikibooks.org,...) and you want to process them - wouldn't you put the pages of each of those books into a separate directory before processing? (some pages might have the same name!) So, this is what the &quot;/&quot; delimiter automatically does for you! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*:: I'd want to process just one book actually, the cookbook. What I don't want to see is Cookbook/Vegetable/Anise, Cookbook/Spice/Anise, and Cookbook/Herb/Anise. What are they going to be, symlinks? Duplicate copies? Hard links? In any case, this artificially enforced hierarchy is going to make a mess.
*::: What about Glossary/Anise? I'm not trying to change existing wikibooks, but find the most useful form for many few pages long wikibooks that pop up without a definite naming scheme. Since many beginning wikibooks even lack navigational templates, the best way for those new books would be to have an automatic link back to their main page, and enforce that all pages start with the very same bookname. This is what subpages do.
*::: I see that for significantly larger projects pseudo-namespaces make sense as well, that is why I suggest a double policy: Subpages for books that have a linear structure (you read them from the beginning to the end), and namespace-like for collections of items like the cookbook. What do you think about this compromise? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 06:11, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*::: People keep raising exceptions as to why a scheme won't work. Whatever scheme (or schemes) is settled upon there are going to be special cases that don't work (and therefore require a workaround). I agree that subpages works well for linear books and namespace for collections so I think adopting both is a good idea. Mixing the two is obviously less desirable so a workaround may be required for a liner book that belongs to a collection (e.g. a linear programming textbook inside the programming namespace). --[[User:M.linger|M.linger]] 6 July 2005 03:51 (UTC)

kelvSYC's thoughts on the issue:
I believe good consistent organization is a must.  Thus, the naming scheme should be related to the scheme used for templates/categories, etc.  So my thoughts:
* Whatever the convention is, each and every existing Wikibook should be converted to the standard convention.
* A title with no delimiters, to me, implies a separate Wikibook.  Categories should organize parts of books (eg. textbook answer keys) as well as books that are related (eg. [[Abstract Algebra]] and [[Linear Algebra]] should be categorized as &quot;mathematical textbooks&quot;).  As it is entirely possible that books are part of other books, the category system should reflect that.
* Categories can also be used for, say, an automatic indexing feature (see [[Wikibooks Pokédex]]), but it should be avoided
* Only large overly general books deserve separate namespaces.  Good examples would be [[Cookbook]], [[Programming]], and [[Game Guides and Strategy]].
* Table of contents, indices, and all that should be colon-delimited if the book's title page does not contain them (eg. &quot;Foo:Table of Contents&quot;, &quot;Bar:Alphabetical Index&quot; vs. &quot;Baz/Chapter 1&quot;)
* Actual book content should be in subpages, whenever possible.
* For books with such a structure, a top-level subpage with custom up-links should be provided (provided we can hide the default up-links).
* The about pages (notes for contributors, etc) should be colon-delimited (eg. &quot;Foo:About&quot;, &quot;Bar:Contributers Notes&quot;).
* Bracket syntax should '''never''' be used.
* Books should be moderately structured: the hierarchy within a book should be as structured as possible, but flat enough so that names are not too long.  (even if it means we have a very long page)  Hierarchies should not be more than, say, three or four levels deep.
* All templates and categories specific to a single book should start with the name of the book. (eg. &quot;Template:Foo:TOC&quot;, &quot;Category:Bar:Pages on baz&quot;)
* For pages that are part of multiple books, put it as a subpage of one book and have all others redirect to it, and make custom up-links.  Which book it should be part of should be up to discussion.

[[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:51, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I think that it is safe to say that we will adopt either the Bookname:subpage or the Bookname/subpage hierchy.  I tend to go with the former because so many books use their own templates as navigation techniques, so the Bookname/subpage hierchy would look odd.  Also, I think that since the other kinds of namespaces, such as Wikibooks: and Talk: and User:, etc. are done in this manner it will be intuitive to most users.  As for substructure, I believe that should be the decision of the individual book writers- there are simply too many different circumstances.  Some books are better divided into chapters only, some are better divided further.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 19:36, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Voting ==
Ideally, the Wikibooks community should propose a method above and vote for a Wikibooks wide scheme for naming hierachies. This will have the advantage of consistency and ease of use within Wikibooks.

Wikibooks should accumulate a number of naming hierachy schemes and then set a vote, which should happen here.

==New wikistats report for Wikibooks==
I'm glad to announce a new report for Wikibooks, generated periodically by the Wikistats job. You'll find here an overview of books, their content and some stats. I discovered there are at least 6 naming schemes for chapters. This made it difficult to automate extraction of chapter names, so in some cases the grouping of chapters may look a bit odd. I'm sure this will improve when the ongoing discussion about standardisation of article titles bears fruit.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verbs – Past and Conditional Tenses&lt;/font&gt;===

The past preterite (simple past) is formed with the auxiliary verb '''did '''before the present or equivalently by adding '''-d''' ('''-ed''' after a consonant) to the present:
*'''me did parla (= me parlad) ''' – ''I spoke''
*'''vus non did dona (= vus non donad) ''' – ''you didn’t give'' (Literally: ''you not gave'')
*'''les esed (= les did es) bon''' – ''they were good''

Note that the English auxiliaries ''do'' and ''did'' used in questions and negative statements are not translated:
*'''ob vu veni''' – ''do you come'? '' (Literally: ''is it that you come? '')
*'''lo non dikte''' – ''he does not say'' (Literally: ''he not says'')
*'''ob vu parlad? (= ob vu did parla?) ''' – ''did you speak? '' (Literally: ''is it that you spoke? '')
*'''les non envadad (= les non did envada)''' – ''they did not enter'' (Literally: ''they not entered'')

The perfect tense is formed with the auxiliary verb '''ha''' before the present form:
*'''me ha parla''' – ''I have spoken''
*'''vus non ha dona''' – ''you have not given''
*'''les ha es bon''' – ''they have been good'' 
*'''ob les ha es bon?''' – ''have they been good?'' 
  
The conditional of a verb is formed with the auxiliary verb '''vud '''before the present:
*'''lo vud dikte''' – ''he would say''
*'''les vud parla''' – ''they would speak''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Numbers – Cardinal and Ordinal&lt;/font&gt;===

The cardinal numbers are:
*'''sero''' – ''zero''
*'''un''' – ''one''
*'''du''' – ''two''			
*'''tri''' – ''three''			
*'''quar''' – ''four''			
*'''sink''' – ''five''			
*'''six''' – ''six''			
*'''set''' – ''seven'' 			
*'''ot''' – ''eight''			
*'''nin''' – ''nine''			
*'''dek''' – ''ten''			
*'''dek-un''' – ''eleven''		
*'''dek-du''' – ''twelve''		
*'''dek-tri''' – ''thirteen''				
*'''dek-quar''' – ''fourteen''		
*'''dek-sink''' – ''fifteen''		
*'''dek-six''' – ''sixteen''		
*'''dek-set''' – ''seventeen''		
*'''dek-ot''' – ''eighteen''		
*'''dek-nin''' – ''nineteen''		
*'''duanti''' – ''twenty''		
*'''duanti-un''' – ''twenty-one''
*'''duanti-du''' – ''twenty-two'' …etc.
*'''trianti''' – ''thirty''
*'''trianti-du''' – ''thirty-two''
*'''quaranti''' – ''forty''
*'''quaranti-tri''' – ''forty-three''
*'''sinkanti''' – ''fifty''
*'''sinkanti-quar''' – ''fifty-four''
*'''sixanti''' – ''sixty''
*'''sixanti-sink''' – ''sixty-five''
*'''setanti''' – ''seventy''
*'''setanti-six''' – ''seventy-six''
*'''otanti''' – ''eighty''
*'''otanti-set''' – ''eighty-seven''
*'''ninanti''' – ''ninety''
*'''ninanti-ot''' – ''ninety-eight''
*'''sent''' – ''a hundred''
*'''sent-duanti''' – ''120''
*'''sinksent-trianti-set''' – ''537''…etc.
*'''mil''' – ''a thousand''
*'''mil-un''' – ''1001''
*'''mil-sent''' – ''1100''
*'''mil-dusent-tri''' – ''1203''
*'''mil setsent-quaranti-du''' - ''1742''
*'''milione''' – ''a million''
*'''miliarde''' – ''a thousand million'' (American ''billion'')
*'''bilione''' – ''million million, billion'' (American ''trillion'')

Units, tens and hundreds are separated by hyphens for ease of reading. The tens are formed from the units with the ending '''-anti''' (notice the adjective ending as all numbers before a million are adjectives). Hundreds have their number in front of '''sent''': '''otsent''' – ''eight hundred''. Thousands, millions and higher are separated from their multiplier by spaces: '''ot mil''' – ''eight thousand''.
'''Milione, miliarde''' and '''bilione''' are nouns so multiples take the plural ending '''-s''':
'''tri miliardes setsent-sixanti-six miliones sent-quaranti-nin mil dusent-sixanti-set''' 
– (American:) ''three billion seven hundred and sixty-six million one hundred and forty-nine thousand two hundred and sixty-seven''  (3 766 149 267) 

Ordinal numbers are formed from the cardinals with the ending '''-esmi''' which is added only to the last component of the number:
*'''unesmi''' – ''first''
*'''duesmi''' – ''second''
*'''trisent-quaranti-sinkesmi''' – ''three hundred and forty-fifth'' (345th)

Ordinals may be abbreviated as: '''1smi (1&lt;sup&gt;smi&lt;/sup&gt;), 2smi (2&lt;sup&gt;smi&lt;/sup&gt;), 345smi (345&lt;sup&gt;smi&lt;/sup&gt;) ''' etc.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Indefinite Preposition&lt;/font&gt;===

The preposition '''ye''' has no definite meaning, and is used when it is not obvious which preposition is exactly appropriate in a literal sense:
*'''ye akurateso de''' – ''with/at an accuracy of''
*'''ye dis die''' – ''on this day''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;The Reflexive Pronoun&lt;/font&gt;===

The reflexive pronoun is '''se''', ''himself, herself, itself, themselves'' (third person only). Note that '''se''' is used only when the object of the verb refers back to the subject of the verb. 
*'''la observa se''' – ''she observes herself''
*'''la observa la''' – ''she observes her''
*'''lo parla a se''' – ''he speaks to himself'' 
*'''lo parla a lo''' –'' he speaks to him''
*'''les parla a sen hundes''' – ''they speak to their (own) dogs''
*'''les parla a lesen hundes''' – ''they speak to their dogs'' (somebody else’s dogs)

This pronoun avoids awkward ambiguity which sometimes occurs in English.

The first and second persons use no special pronoun:
*'''me observa me''' – ''I observe myself'' (Literally: ''I observe me'')
*'''vu parla a vu''' – ''you speak to yourself''  (Literally: ''you speak to you'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Adjectival Suffix -AL&lt;/font&gt;===

Novial uses prefixes and suffixes added to root words to make related words. 

The suffix '''-al(i) ''' is added to a root word X to make an adjective meaning “of X or X related”.
Any final '''-e, -o, -a''' or '''-i''' of a noun is removed to provide the root then '''-al(i) ''' is added to the root.

*'''nature – natural''' (''nature – natural'')
*'''universe – universal''' (''universe – universal'') 
*'''natione – national''' (''nation – national'')
*'''doktore – doktoral''' (''doctor – doctoral, of a doctor'')
*'''familie – familial''' (''family – family related, of a family'')
*'''sientie –siential''' (''science – scientific, science related'')
*'''laboro – laboral''' (''work – work related, of work'')
*'''alkali – alkalal''' (''alkali – of alkali'')
*'''mensu – mensual''' (''month – monthly, of a month'')

Notice that a final '''-u''' is part of the root and not dropped before adding '''-al'''. Novial is here much more regular than English. Many derived adjectives are similar to the English but it is not possible for all to be so, because the English derivation system is very mixed and irregular.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Substantival Suffix -ESO&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-eso''' is added to the root of an adjective (i.e. without the final '''-i''') to form the corresponding abstract noun:

*'''bon – boneso''' (''good – goodness'')
*'''akurati – akurateso''' (''accurate – accuracy'')
*'''inteligenti - inteligenteso''' (''intelligent – intelligence'')

If the sense permits, more than one suffix may be added to the root:

*'''amike – amikal – amikaleso''' (''friend – friendly – friendliness'')

Notice again how irregular the English system is.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Relative Pronouns&lt;/font&gt;===

The relative pronoun in English takes several forms (''who, whom, which, that''). In Novial one word, '''kel''', can serve for all of these:
*'''evita pasiones, kel porta sufro ''' – ''avoid passions which (that) bring suffering ''
*'''li yuna, kel me ama, es bel''' – ''the young woman, whom (that) I love, is beautiful ''
*'''me donad lu al proprietere, kel es oldi viro ''' – ''I gave it to the owner who is an old man ''
*'''li stule, sur kel me sida, es grandi ''' – ''the chair, on which I sit, is big ''

The English possessive (''whose'') is translated as '''kelen''' or '''de kel''':
*'''li farmere, kelen filia me ama, es oldi viro ''' – ''the farmer, whose daughter I love, is an old man ''
*'''li farmere, li filia de kel me ama, es oldi viro ''' – ''the farmer, the daughter of whom I love, is an old man ''

If necessary in order to avoid ambiguity the endings '''-o, -a, -u'''  may be used to indicate sex or lack of sex and '''-s''' may be used to indicate a plural:
*'''li filia del doktoro, kela me ha renkontra, es inteligenti''' – ''the daughter of the doctor, whom I have met, is intelligent '' (I met the daughter not the doctor)
*'''tima li ansestres e li pasiones, kelus pove ankore veni a vu''' – ''fear the ancestors and the passions, which can yet come to you '' (the passions can come not the ancestors)

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verbs – Future Tense&lt;/font&gt;===

The future tense is formed by placing the auxiliary verb '''sal''' in front of the present tense of the verb:
*'''me sal evita tal stranji viros ''' – ''I shall avoid such strange men''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Adverbs from Adjectives&lt;/font&gt;===

An adjective may be converted to a corresponding adverb by adding '''-m''' after the final '''-i''':
*'''diferanti ''' – ''different ''
*'''diferantim ''' – ''differently ''
*'''proximi ''' – ''close ''
*'''proximim ''' – ''closely ''

(Note that '''proxim''' without the '''-i''' is a preposition meaning ''close to'' (something).)

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;This and That – Pronouns from Adjectives&lt;/font&gt;===

As we have already seen with personal pronouns and nouns with natural sex differences, Novial has convenient endings to distinguish sexless things, male, female and male or female. The demonstrative adjectives '''ti''' (''that'') and '''disi''' (''this'') use the same endings to provide the corresponding pronouns with such distinctions. Remember that adjectives themselves (here '''ti''' and '''disi''') do not change form or agree with their noun. However, the derived pronouns have alternative endings to indicate sex and number:

*'''ti kose''' – ''that thing''
*'''tu''' – ''that (one) '' (sexless thing)
*'''te''' – ''that one'' (male or female)
*'''ta''' – ''that one'' (female)
*'''to''' – ''that one'' (male)
*'''tus''' – ''those (ones) '' (sexless things)
*'''tes''' – ''those'' (male or female or a mixture of both)
*'''tas''' – ''those'' (female)
*'''tos''' – ''those'' (male)


*'''disi kose''' – ''this thing''
*'''disu''' - ''this (one) '' (sexless thing)
*'''dise''' – ''this one'' (male or female)
*'''disa''' – ''this one'' (female)
*'''diso''' – ''this one'' (male)
*'''disus''' – ''these'' (sexless things)
*'''dises''' – ''these'' (male or female or a mixture of both)
*'''disas''' – ''these'' (female)
*'''disos''' – ''these'' (male)

As with the third person pronouns, '''le''' and '''les''', it is convenient to use '''te, tes''' and '''dise, dises''' to indicate either sexless things or persons or a mixture of both without being specific.

Pronouns may be formed from other adjectives in the same way:

*'''yuni filia''' – ''young daughter''
*'''yuna''' – ''young woman'' (also young female of animals)
*'''yuni filio''' – ''young son''
*'''yuno''' – ''young man'' (also young male of animals)
*'''yuni home''' – ''young person''
*'''yune''' – ''a youth''
*'''yunes''' – ''youths, young ones''
*'''yunu''' – ''young thing''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Verbal Suffixes -ISA and -IFIKA&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffixes '''–isa''' and '''–ifika''' are used to make verbs meaning to ''make'', ''make into'' or ''render''. For example:

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Pluperfect Tense&lt;/font&gt;===

The pluperfect tense is formed by placing the auxiliary verb '''had''' in front of the present tense of the verb:
*'''lo had salta a sur li table''' – he had jumped onto the table

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Prepositions and Adverbs from Prepositions&lt;/font&gt;===

Adverbs are formed from prepositions by adding '''-u''' as seen in these examlpes:

*'''lo non es inu''' – ''he is not in''
*'''prou (= pro tu) ''' – ''therefore, on account of that''
*'''anteu (= ante tu) ''' – ''formerly, before that''
*'''durantu''' – ''during that time, meanwhile''
*'''li hundes kursed eku''' – ''the dogs ran out'' (of somewhere)
*'''exeptu (=exept tu) ''' – ''with that exception''
*'''lo sidad proxim li porte, e lon filia sidad proximu (= proxim lo) ''' –
''he sat near the door and his daughter sat nearby (= near him) '' 
*'''lo vadad subu''' – ''he went down(wards) ''
*'''les es kunu noktim e jornim''' –  ''they are together night and day''


===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Prepositions before the Infinitive&lt;/font&gt;===

English phrases such as ''without going, before seeing'' etc. are translated with the appropriate preposition followed by the infinitive (same as the present tense):

'''me had departa ante vida la''' – ''I had left before seeing her''

'''nus vadad por vida la''' – ''we went (in order) to see her''

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Infinitive Clauses&lt;/font&gt;===

The following examples show this English construction and how it can be translated:

*'''me voli ke vu veni''' – ''I want you to come'' (Literally: '' I want that you come'')

Use a preposition with a definite literal meaning if it makes sense: 
*'''la sendad li serveres por porta manjaje''' – ''she sent the servants to bring food''

Another way to express the infinitive clause is seen in the second of these examples:
*'''les varta ke me ariva''' – ''they wait for me to arrive'' (Literally: ''they wait for that I arrive'')
or:
*'''les varta men arivo''' – ''they wait for my arrival''

Where '''arivo''' is the verbal noun (''arrival'' or ''arriving'') derived from the verb '''ariva'''. (This will be covered thoroughly in [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_6#E.2FA.2FO_Words|lesson 6]])

However, the following is grammatically identical and may be used:
*'''me voli vun venio''' – ''I want you to come'' (Literally: ''I want your coming'').

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Comparative and Superlative&lt;/font&gt;===

Adjectives and adverbs are compared as follows:
 
*'''plu bon kam''' – ''better than''
*'''tam bon kam''' –  ''as good as''	 
*'''min bon kam''' –  ''less good than
*'''maxim bon ek''' – ''best (out) of''
*'''minim bon ek''' – ''least good (out) of''
 
*'''la es li maxim grandi''' – ''she is the biggest''
*'''la es plu grandi kam me''' – ''she is bigger than I (am) ''
*'''la es tam grandi kam me''' – ''she as big as I (am) ''
*'''la es min grandi kam me''' – ''she is less big than I (am) ''
*'''la es li minim grandi''' – ''she is the least big''

*'''lo kurse maxim bonim ek les''' – ''he runs best out of them''
*'''lo kurse plu bonim kam me''' – ''he runs better than I''
*'''lo kurse tam bonim kam me''' – ''he runs as well as I''
*'''lo kurse min bonim kam me''' – ''he runs less well than I''
*'''lo kurse minim bonim ek nus''' – ''he runs least well out of us'' 
 
'''Kam''' is used in making comparisons, even where English does not use than: 
*'''me prefera disu kam tu''' – ''I prefer this to that''

Translate ''as good as possible'' and similar phrases like this: 
*'''maxim bon posibli'''

Food can provide enjoyment beyond taste. This page explores some basic ideas for enhancing the enjoyment of your other senses.

== Sight ==
The appearance of food can be a major contribution to enjoyment. Arrange the food on the plate with the same care you would use in creating a work of art - balancing colors and forms in a harmonious arrangement. To show off the food and put everyone at ease about cleanliness, use bright white (not yellowish) lighting with pure white dishes and clear glasses. 

== Taste ==
The tongue recognises five basic flavors: salty, sweet, savoury, bitter and sour. One of the keys to a successful meal is to balance these, both within individual dishes and across different courses. It is usual to ready the palate with a cleansing neutral dish such as a consomme. Finish a formal meal with a sweet dessert, which customarily marks the psychological end of the event.

It's important to note that the hotness of a chile pepper is not a taste. The hotness is actually pain from the chemical capsaicin, so it affects the skin. Caution must be taken when chile peppers are handled.

== Smell ==
The most important sense in preparing and cooking food is the sense of smell. It adds subtlety to the experience, which the tongue itself cannot recognise. The smell of food being prepared is one of the greatest stimulators of appetite.

== Sound ==
Think about the acoustic environment. Many meals in big restaurants are ruined because their surroundings are just too noisy. A shared meal should encourage conversation, and too much background noise can ruin that. If you're going to have background music, match the mood to the food.

== Touch ==
Touch might be better described as &quot;texture&quot;.  The crumb of a baked good can be coarse or fine, the texture of one cut of meat may tend to be more tender or tough than another, and a family may prefer creamy smooth mashed potatoes or may enjoy them more with some lumps left in.  The purpose of many techniques in cookery and baking is to allow the cook to control the texture of the finished product.

== Temperature ==
The temperature at which a food is served can affect the way it is experienced. Generally, sweet foods can be served cold (like ice cream), while for more subtle and aromatic foods a warmer temperature releases more of the flavor.</text>

'''A nice cup of tea''' is the usual answer in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ireland|Ireland]] to any everyday problem. Nothing is so bad that a nice cup of [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] with a friend or family member can't make it better.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Milk clouds in tea.jpeg|thumb|right]]

;By the cup
: ''Yield: 1 cup''
* 6-8 fl oz (20-25 cL) hot [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 measure of [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] in an infuser or 1 tea bag (preferably a Yorkshire tea bag)
* Sweetener, such as [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] to taste


;By the pot

* 32 fl oz (1 L) of hot water
* 3-5 measures of loose tea, in an infuser if you like
: Serve with:
* Milk or lemon to taste

==Procedure==

[[Image:Nice Cup of Tea.jpg|right|thumb|A nice cup of tea, milk and no sugar]]
;Preparing and serving the tea
# Pour freshly drawn water (see [[#Water, temperature, infusing time, and product variations|note below]]) into a tea kettle. Electric kettles are fast and convenient.
# If infusing a pot of tea, pour some hot tap water into your teapot and let stand for about several seconds to a minute to pre-warm it. Alternately, you can swish some of the hotter boiling water from your kettle around in the teapot for a few seconds. Pour out this water before adding the tea to the teapot.
# If using loose tea, prepare the tea
## Commonly one-half to one tea measure (or rounded teaspoon if you do not have a tea measure) is added per desired cup of tea. Some people add an extra measure &quot;for the pot&quot; (e.g., if 4 cups of tea are desired, 5 measures of tea would be used. It really is a matter of personal preference.)
## If you are using an infuser, be sure it is closed tightly so the tea does not spill into the pot. Rinse the tea-filled infuser briefly under cool tap water to wash away tiny flakes that would otherwise drift into the teapot.
## If using a filter basket infuser, do not overfill the basket (refer to the instructions that came with your basket). The brief rinse is usually not necessary unless the basket's mesh is quite porous.
## Simply dropping loose tea into the teapot is also an option, though you may want to strain the tea as you pour it into the cups.
# Place the tea or tea bag into the teapot.
# When the water reaches the preferred temperature (see [[#Water, temperature, infusing time, and product variations|note below]]), pour it from the tea kettle into the teapot or single-serving teacup. As you pour, try to avoid pouring directly onto the tea (especially important for green and white teas) to avoid scalding the leaves.
# Allow the tea to infuse quietly (i.e., do not stir the teapot or &quot;dunk the teabag&quot;). Agitating the tea releases more of the bitter compounds and degrades the taste. Watch the time to avoid over-infusion (see [[#Water, temperature, infusion time, and product variations|note below]]), and remove the infuser or tea bag when the time is up. If you did not use an infuser or tea bag, pour the tea into cups for immediate consumption.
# Remember that the tannins in tea stain, so it is advisable to pour the tea over a non-staining surface, wipe up any spills quickly, and do not leave tea standing in a teapot for long periods of time.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
;Adding sweeteners and lemon or milk
[[Image:Tea bags.jpg|thumb|left|Tea bags are convenient, but tea purists often despise them]]
* Generally, green and white teas need no sweetener or milk added to them for a delicious taste if prepared properly. some research indicates that adding lemon to green tea may make some of the healthful compounds in the tea more easily available to the body, and it provides a different, fresh taste to the tea.
* Lemon lightens the color of tea and may accentuate any bitterness in the tea
* Lemon pairs well with citrus-flavored teas, such as the bergamot-enhanced &quot;Grey&quot; teas (e.g., Earl Grey, Lady Grey, etc.), and unflavored black teas. Milk pairs well with sweet, flowery, or &quot;fruity&quot; teas, or with any black tea in which you wish to reduce bitterness.
* Never combine milk and lemon in the same cup of tea or the milk will curdle into lumps.
* Always add sweeteners to tea before adding any milk; otherwise, the milk will cool the tea, and the sweetener will not dissolve properly. For better dissolving, it is preferable to add several small amounts of sweetener to the tea, stirring each time, rather than adding a large amount of sweetener at once.
* Chai teas by definition require the addition of milk, ranging from one-fourth to one-half of the total volume, and a sweetener. The milk may be warmed if serving hot chai. Otherwise, cold milk and ice cubes make a lovely iced chai.

==Water, temperature, infusion time, and product variations==
[[Image:Teestrauch Detail.jpg|right|thumb|Tea plant (''Camellia Sinensis'') growing in a tea plantation]]
For the freshest tasting cup of tea, you should always use mineral water or freshly drawn water direct from the tap that has been running for a while. Standing water loses oxygen, and the resulting tea tastes flat. If your tap water is chlorinated, a compromise can be reached by drawing fresh water and letting it stand uncovered for a couple of hours to allow the chlorine taste to leave the water; although, using mineral water is a quick and easy solution. Boiling the water for long periods also removes oxygen from the water, so always use fresh water (do not re-boil it), and use the water quickly after it comes to a boil.

[[w:White Tea|White tea]] and [[w:Yellow Tea|Yellow tea]] are the most delicate of all teas and require a water temperature of 60-65°C need a infusion time of 2 minutes. Using too high a tea or steeping for too long has a tendency to mask some of the delicate nuances of the tea and leave it a bit bitter.

[[w:Green tea|Green tea]] requires water that is (65-75°C). You may either pour the hot water from the tea kettle into the teapot prior to the boil, or allow the water to come to a full boil (the better choice if water quality is questionable) and then allow the water to cool again prior to pouring over the tea leaves. Green teas usually infuse anywhere from :30 seconds to 2 minutes. Bitterness in the tea is usually the result of overheating the water, infusing the tea for too long, or both.

[[w:Oolong tea|Oolong teas]] are 20-80% oxidized, thus their preparation method usually falls somewhere in between green and black teas. The water should just be below a boil, 75-80°C), and the infusion time is typically 2-3 minutes.

[[w:Black tea|Black tea]] (aka. [[w:Red Tea|Red tea]], having been oxidized and more stable, infuses best with water that is 80-90°C. Infusion times are generally longer, with 3-5 minutes being a typical time. ''Chai'' and other teas combined with fragrant herbs and spices may require additional infusion time to allow the full flavor to develop. Common [[w:Black Tea|Black Teas]] are [[w:Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling tea]] and [[w:Assam tea|Assam tea]] from Northern India.

Puerh Tea is the only type of tea that is truly fermented as the oxidation process is never halted during processing. These teas are often retained in storage for a minimum of 20 years before going to market. Their complex flavors robust constitution require full boiling water.

Many premium grade teas can handle multiple infusions utilizing the same tea leaf. In fact, many tea subtly change flavor in subsequent infusions revealing flavors masked by stronger overtones of the tea. White and Green tea often tolerate 3-4 infusions, [[w:Yellow Tea|Yellow tea]] and [[w:Oolong tea|Oolong tea]] tolerate 5-8 infusions, [[w:Black tea|Black (Red) tea]] tolerates 3-5 infusions, and a good Puerh can sometimes last a dozen infusions or more. A good 'rule-of-thumb' to follow is to add 30 seconds to the first infusion time for each subsequent infusion.

[[w:Rooibos|Rooibos]] (''Aspalathus linearis'', often referred to as red tea but is different from a true red tea) and [[w:Honeybush|honeybush]] (''Cyclopia spp.'') are not true teas (i.e., they are not made from the ''Camellia sinensis'' plant), but are derived from African plants and are infused in a manner similar to tea. These are herbal 'teas' often referred to as tisanes. Read the instructions that came with the product. If no instructions came with it, infuse as you would black tea, and experiment with infusion times and water temperatures in future attempts until you find the flavor that most appeals to you.

[[w:Yerba mate|Yerba maté]] (''Ilex paraguariensis'') is a South American holly plant. Maté is a tea-like infusion that ''can'' be prepared in the same manner as green tea. However, there are many other methods that produce a very different (and some would say better) flavor. Detailed maté preparation is beyond the scope of this recipe.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==A traditional view==
[[Image:Lipton Earl Grey in tin.jpg|thumb|left|Loose tea leaves traditionally offer the best flavor]]

Here's a traditionalist view on how to make it, which shares much with [[w:George Orwell|George Orwell's]] essay, &quot;A Nice Cup of Tea&quot;.

Use freshly drawn water and bring it to a boil in a kettle. Meanwhile, prepare your teapot. A stainless steel pot may be used, but earthenware is preferred. The pot should be warmed: add some hot water and let the warmth pervade the pot. Drain off the hot water, then add the tea. Remember to take the pot to the water, never the water to the pot.  Whatever tea you use (and for proper emotional rescue you should use a strong Indian or Kenyan-based blend), do not use teabags. You need to let the tea leaves swim free and with teabags there will inevitably be a papery tinge to the taste. This rule is, however, widely broken.

Measure tea according to the size of the  teapot and the strength of tea you prefer. In a large teapot (serving four cups), two [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] will give a fairly weak tea, perhaps enough to console one for a lost umbrella on a rainy day, and four should be strong enough for being stood up on a Friday night. A broken heart may need six. Add the water as soon as it boils, and leave it to stand for five minutes (and no longer) before serving. Use a mug if you must, but a cup with a saucer is far more civilised.

Traditionally you should add full-cream milk, but semi-skimmed will do. If you are familiar with the strength of tea you make and the size of the cups, you can follow the 'milk in first' technique. Otherwise, add milk to the tea, to ensure you get the right colour. Add sugar according to taste and the extent of the emotional crisis you are trying to overcome.

Serve with a biscuit or two, and prepare to feel much better.

== Pre-vote / Final-vote ==

With the amount of options open I think we need some Pre-vote process on all options before we know which open will be presented to the final vote.

=== --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 12:33, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC) ===

My preferences are for

1.6 &quot;Real&quot; Namepaces then sub-pages.

2.2 While I am in favor of flat in textbooks one need deeper hierarchies i.E. in reference sections: [[Ada Programming/Keywords/and|Programming:Ada:Keywords:and]] and [[Ada Programming/Operators/and|Programming:Ada:Operators:and]].

3.1 least surprise.

4.1 &quot;move&quot; is easy but not that easy.

: I don't want to step on your toe, but the separation between the two &quot;and&quot; examples looks very constructed: The first code example (A&gt;10 and A&lt;20) is even the same on both pages. A flat structure (i.e. {{bad link|Programming:Ada:and}}) with links from both [[Ada Programming/Keywords|Programming:Ada:Keywords]] and [[Ada Programming/Operators|Programming:Ada:Operators]] might be easier to maintain. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:57, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: I use links to the reference tables in source code examples (see [[Ada Programming/Subtypes|Programming:Ada:Subtypes]] - and therefore I need both pages for keywords which are also operators. But perhaps #REDIRECT for one of the two duplicates might be the better option - since every operator is either a keyword or a special character - but that is something to decide with the other [[Programming:Ada]] authors. My point here is more general: reference tables might need a deeper hierarchy. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: The best way of doing it is saying &quot;Ada keywords&quot; and &quot;Ada operators&quot;. Natural, and keeps the hierachy flat. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:29, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::  I find it helpful to know that typing i.E. [[Ada Programming/Types/range|http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Ada:Types:range]] into the browser will give me a description of - in this vase - range types. helps a lot on answering newbie question on news:comp.lang.ada. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't think we need to put flat vs. deep structure into policy, but allow each book to decide what is good for its own needs.  Just for reference, however, the largest wikibooks ([[Cookbook]]) uses a flat naming scheme, and we haven't had any problems with it yet. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:34, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: @Dys: It seems like traditionally all programming languages have been going into &quot;Programming:&quot;, but if we really consider a radical new start, then the structure in consideration for new books might really be: &quot;Ada&quot;, &quot;Ada/operators&quot;, &quot;Ada/keywords&quot;, &quot;Ada/and&quot;, etc. (''no'' sub-sub-page, and forget about namespaces at all, have simple books that can be moved around and between bookshelves arbitrarily). 
:: @Gent: I think we should put flat (if voted for) into policy, similar like subpages are disabled on Wikipedia (there even by software!). Sometimes people have to be forced to keeping things simple. It is ''very'' tempting to organize material (that one does not have yet) into sub-sub-sub structures, but it seems, the most successful and most collaborative wikibooks are those of a very simple and flat structure.
:: @Krischik: The structure that you present in your book, and the structure how pages are saved in Wikibooks don't have to be the same: All pages of a book can live in a flat hierarchy (in fact, in real books, they do, on pages numbered 1, 2, 3, ...), still your content, your glossary, reference sections, etc. might all provide a very different structure. (I think this is a critical point that should also be communicated to new wikibook authors). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 00:00, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: This is indeed true for Ada as well. It's just the keyword/operator/attribute/etc. pp. reference tables which have depper hirachies. The actual tutorial pages have only one level. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:20, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Advice for novices ==

It seems the discussion fell asleep again. What shall I do in cases like [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2005/March#Module-izing: Request for Advice|Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Module-izing:_Request_for_Advice]], where a user asks how best to organize a book? I would like to give simple advice, but telling everybody they can either use &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot; and linking to this discussion page might not be the best.
I want to propose the following: I guess there is not much point in this vote, since &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot; is a matter of taste and there are many books that do it one way and many that do it the other way. I don't want to interfere with excellent books that use &quot;:&quot; (like Cookbook, etc.), but my personal impression is that using &quot;/&quot; is the simplest for beginning Wikibook users.
May I therefore ask, if anybody opposes to the idea of recommending new users the &quot;/&quot; subpage delimiter as the way to organize things? A fairly recent example is for example [[Hamster Care]], that does not use any navigational templates but just the automatic link back to the book page. I would suggest the following:
* Double policy: &quot;:&quot; and &quot;/&quot; are both fine.
* New books by novices: Recommend &quot;/&quot; because it provides the basic navigation &quot;for free&quot;.
What do you think about this? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:30, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I am all in favor: Clear instructions for new books - and sub-pages do have added value.. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 14:11, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:* A happy user by clear instructions: [[User_talk:Ojmorales0002#Organization_of_the_Golden_Bough]] :-) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:47, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:* Another successful conversion: [[Talk:How To Assemble A Desktop PC#Organizing the book|Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]] --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:* I changed [[Outdoor Survival]] by myself (no naming conventions before) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:* Another conversion from 1-page to subpages: [[Talk:CPAM with TWW#Organizing the book]] --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Is there some &quot;Wikibooks Workspace&quot; or &quot;Wikibooks Community Portal&quot; where such information could go to? Sorry that things seem to change so fast now, but in the case of [[The Golden Bough]] I had to be quick (the user already added over 50 chapters, and changing all &quot;tgbChapter1&quot; now would be much more work). Also, it seems there is a strong need for clear directions and hints, otherwise why else would all these people be so happy in quickly following my advice? I hope nobody feels overrun... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:20, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I have no problem with recommending subpages to newbies, as long as that doesn't represent a policy of using subpages in general.  I'd love to see real namespaces with independent logos, recentchanges and other utility pages, etc, but I have no problem with subpages at least until that kind of functionality is available. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 22:49, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with you about the double policy, Andreas. I think we should hightlight these two alternatives in [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] over the others. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 23:41, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: I updated [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]]. Have a look and edit if necessary. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:13, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

We often wish to describe how two mathematical entities within a set are related.  For example, if we were to look at the set of all people on Earth, we could define &quot;is a child of&quot; as a relationship.  Similarly, the &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; operator defines a relation on the set of integers.  A binary relation, hereafter referred to simply as a relation, is a binary proposition defined on any selection of the elements of two sets.

Formally, a relation is any arbitrary subset of the Cartesian product between two sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; so that, for a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times Y&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the domain of the relation and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as its codomain. If an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (where, by the definition of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;), then we say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. We will use &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{y \in Y:(x, y) \in R\}&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote the set of all elements in the codomain of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to which some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the domain is related.

===Equivalence relations===
To denote that two elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are related for a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which is a subset of some Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;X \times X&lt;/math&gt;, we will use an infix operator.  We write &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x, y) \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

There are very many types of relations.  Indeed, further inspection of our earlier examples reveals that the two relations are quite different.  In the case of the &quot;is a child of&quot; relationship, we observe that there are some people A,B where neither A is a child of B, nor B is a child of A.  In the case of the &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; operator, we know that for any two integers &lt;math&gt;m,n\in Z&lt;/math&gt; exactly one of &lt;math&gt;m\ge n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; is true.  In order to learn about relations, we must look at a smaller class of relations.

In particular, we care about the following properties of relations:

* Reflexivity: A relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is reflexive if &lt;math&gt;a \sim a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Symmetry: A relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric if &lt;math&gt;{a \sim b} \implies {b \sim a}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b \in X&lt;/math&gt;.  
* Transitivity: A relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; is transitive if &lt;math&gt;{ {a \sim b} \wedge {b \sim c} } \implies { a \sim c }&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c \in X&lt;/math&gt;.  

One should note that in all three of these properties, we quantify across ''all'' elements of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Any relation &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq X \times X&lt;/math&gt; which exhibits the properties of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity is called an '''equivalence relation''' on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Two elements related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent under the equivalence relation. We write &lt;math&gt;a \sim_R b&lt;/math&gt; to denote that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent under &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. If only one equivalence relation is under consideration, we can instead write simply &lt;math&gt;a \sim b&lt;/math&gt;. As a notational convenience, we can simply say that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and let the rest be implied.


Example: For a fixed integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we define a relation &lt;math&gt;\sim_p&lt;/math&gt; on the set of integers such that &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a-b = k p&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in Z&lt;/math&gt;.  Prove that this defines an equivalence relation on the set of integers.

Proof:
* Reflexivity:  For any &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;, it follows immediately that &lt;math&gt;a-a=0=0 p&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;.
* Symmetry: For any &lt;math&gt;a,b \in X&lt;/math&gt;, assume that &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p b&lt;/math&gt;.  It must then be the case that &lt;math&gt;a-b=k p&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b-a=(-k) p&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, &lt;math&gt;-k&lt;/math&gt; must also be an integer.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;{a \sim_p b }\implies {b \sim_p a}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;.  
* Transitivity: For any &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in X&lt;/math&gt;, assume that &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \sim_p c&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;a-b=k_1 p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b-c=k_2 p&lt;/math&gt; for some integers &lt;math&gt;k_1,k_2&lt;/math&gt;.  By adding these two equalities together, we get &lt;math&gt;{(a-b)+(b-c)=(k_1 p) + (k_2 p)} \Leftrightarrow {a-c = (k_1 + k_2) p}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;a \sim_p c&lt;/math&gt;.

Q.E.D.

Remark.  In elementary number theory we denote this relation &lt;math&gt; a \equiv b (\text{mod } p)&lt;/math&gt; and say a ''is equivalent to'' b ''modulo'' p.

=== Equivalence classes ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; be an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for any element &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt; we define the equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; as the subset &lt;math&gt;\left[ a \right]\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ a \right] = \left \{ b \in X | a \sim b \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem:''' &lt;math&gt;b \in \left[ a \right] \implies \left[ b \right] = \left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: Assume &lt;math&gt;b \in \left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by definition, &lt;math&gt;a \sim b&lt;/math&gt;.
* We first prove that &lt;math&gt;\left[b\right] \subseteq \left[a\right]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary element of &lt;math&gt;\left[ b \right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;p\sim b&lt;/math&gt; by definition of the equivalence class, and &lt;math&gt;p\sim a&lt;/math&gt; by transitivity of equivalence relations. Thus, &lt;math&gt;{p\in\left[b\right]}\implies {p\in\left[a\right]}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left[b\right] \subseteq \left[a\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
* We now prove that &lt;math&gt;\left[a\right] \subseteq \left[b\right]&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary element of &lt;math&gt;\left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, by definition &lt;math&gt;q\sim a&lt;/math&gt;.  By transitivity, &lt;math&gt;q\sim b&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;q\in\left[ b\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;{q\in\left[a\right]}\implies {q\in\left[b\right]}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left[a\right] \subseteq \left[b\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

As &lt;math&gt;\left[a\right] \subseteq \left[b\right]&lt;/math&gt; and as 
&lt;math&gt;\left[b\right] \subseteq \left[a\right]&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\left[ b \right] = \left[ a \right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Q.E.D.

=== Partitions of a set ===

A partition of a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a disjoint family of sets &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} X_i = X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' An equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; induces a unique partition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and likewise, a partition induces a unique equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, such that these are equivalent.

Proof: (Equivalence relation induces Partition): Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the set of equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;a\in [a]&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cup P = X&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, by the above theorem, this union is disjoint. Thus the set of equivalence relations of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

(Partition induces Equivalence relation): Let &lt;math&gt;X_i\,,\,i\in I&lt;/math&gt; be a partition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, define &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are elements of the same &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;. Reflexivity and symmetry of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is immediate. For transitivity, if &lt;math&gt;a,b\in X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b,c\in X_i&lt;/math&gt; for the same &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;, we neccesarily have &lt;math&gt;a,c\in X_i&lt;/math&gt;, and transitivity follows. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation with &lt;math&gt;X_i\,,\, i\in I&lt;/math&gt; as the equivalence classes.

Lastly obtaining a partition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and then obtaining an equivalence equation from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; obviously returns &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; again, so &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent structures.

Q.E.D.

=== Quotients ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; be an equivalence relation on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, define the set &lt;math&gt;X/\sim&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In order to say anything interesting about this construction we need more theory yet to be developed. However, this is one of the most important constructions we have, and one that will be given the much attention throughout the book.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{tlx|currencychoice}} allows people to create a version of an accountancy text in a different currency with a single edit.

== Journal templates ==

Simple bookkeeping journal

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{bookkeeping journal| name = General | page = 1 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

An empty journal just takes the journal name and page number

{{bookkeeping journal
| name = General
| page = 1
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;border:none;&quot;&gt;
{{bookkeeping journal
| name = General
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2006&lt;br/&gt;Feb | day = 15 | description = Accounts Payable | dr = 100 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stock | cr = 80 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stationery | cr = 20 }}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

A journal with entries takes the journal name, page number and the entries. All fields of a bookkeeping entry are optional. cr is short for credit account and dr is short for debit account.

This is the result:

{{bookkeeping journal
| name = General
| page = 1
| entry =
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2010&lt;br/&gt;Feb | day = 15 | description = Accounts Payable | dr = 100 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stock | cr = 80 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Stationery | cr = 20 }}
}}

The templates are:

* bookkeeping journal - basically the table with the column headers and captain ''Name'' Journal - Page ''n''.
* bookkeeping entry - passed as the parameter to bookkeeping journal, any number of them can be passed. Takes date, day, description, post, dr and cr. All parameters are optional and leave an empty column when not set. &quot;dr&quot; and &quot;cr&quot; are short for debit and credit entry respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi DCB, welcome to Wikibooks - it's great that you are looking to develop something to help teach a course - I was wondering whether you have considered [[Wikiversity]] at all? Wikiversity is dedicated to developing course and teaching materials, although at the moment it is in something of a transitionary phase towards it's own wiki-entity, rather than a subentity of Wikibooks. I've been trying to piece together a course on anatomy for the School of Medicine, although this may be more appropriately called 'gross anatomy' (I'm no anatomist or doctor). Failing that, there's a text book in (very) preliminary development at [[Human_Anatomy|Human Anatomy]]. Whether these match your course below, I'm not sure. Regardless, I would love to help with anything you may need. Anyway - welcome to Wikibooks, and I hope you enjoy your stay =) [[User:Lor|Lor]] 02:12, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

== Organ level ==

 Organs are made of tissues and they make organ systems

== Organ system level ==

 How many organ systems are there? 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, do they really exist?

Playing to see if this could work for a course I teach ~DCB
--[[User:68.238.131.7|68.238.131.7]] 08:50, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== What is this page anyway? ==

I'm trying to figure out just what this page really is about.  Is it a bookshelf?  Is it a part of Wikiversity?  Does it intend to become a Wikibook?  Is it a test page for [[Human Anatomy]]?

I'm marking this for deletion simply because it is a bunch of stubs that don't really make sense.  If there is a consistant theme for this content, please follow the [[Wikibooks:Naming Policy]] when you add content here, and try to clean this up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:40, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

== Project on the move ==
Hello, I'm studying medicine, I think I'll get this project going, it would be a great help for me and my fellow students. I'll ask from assistants from histology and anatomy willing to help me in editing and making the proper terminology as simple as possible.
I'll try structurize the wiki page first. Anatomy shouldn't include histological terms or explanations. Histology is dealing with the cellular structure and microscopic study/description of the cell, so those shouldn't be included.

I'll be back! --www.doc 20:44, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Merger with [[Human Anatomy]] ==

It has been suggested that this book be merged with [[Human Anatomy]]. I realize that these two are distinct subjects, but at the moment we don't have enough information in either book, and there is currently no information in this book that can't be merged into the [[Human Anatomy]] book without edit. We can discuss here, if no concensus is reached (or, more likely, if nobody voices any opinions whatsoever), the issue can be dropped. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

: IMHO, I don't think that one book should redirect to the other, because that will lead to readers being sent to material that they have no interest in, which should be avoided, and will lead to questions about the merged book's scope. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:22, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

: I agree with the merger. Any non-human anatomy can be placed into a seperate subject.

: Although currently the content in here seems to be strictly human anatomy, I think merging should be done carefully and from [[Anatomy]] into [[Human Anatomy]]. The Anatomy book should be left with general information on Anatomy which is not specific to Human Anatomy. I will be working on the Human Anatomy book and will appreciate any help, even if it is just copy and pasting info from this book into the appropriate section of that one. Thanks!

== Orphaned pages ==

Found two orphans during my regular check: [[Anatomy/Gastrointestinal System]] and [[Anatomy/Pulmonary System]]. They should probably be linked on the index but I'll leave it up to someone involved with the module to place them correctly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the double lock principle, but it is not not Public Cryptography as both key are secret.
In public cryptography one key is public, the other is secret.
Nobody knowing the public key, is able to decipher a message encrypted with a public key.
Only the secret key is able to decipher a message encrypted with a public key.

So someone (Alice) is able to send securely an encrypted data to Bob, if Bob had made his key public.

Bob is able to prove that he owns a secret key only by providing:
* a plain text
* the same text crypted with the secret key
* the public key corresponding to the secret key.

Something similar to the double lock principle is Merkle's puzzle, which is the ancestor of the Diffie-hellman key exchange, which is itself a close cousin to RSA public key system.</text>

== Logical operator ==

=== Boolean operator ===

 X : Boolean := A = 10 {{Ada/kw|xor}} B = 10;

=== Boolean operator on arrays ===

The xor operation is applied to each boolean inside the [[Ada Programming/Types/array|array]].

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Month_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 
 X : Month_Array := Function_1;
 Y : Month_Array := Function_2;
 Z : Month_Array := X {{Ada/kw|xor}} Y;

=== Bitwise operator ===

The operator '''xor''' could be used with [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular types]] and also with boolean [[Ada Programming/Types/array|arrays]] to perform bitwise operations.

The Div output is the integer part of the division, the Mod output is the
remainder from the division.
The mod output will always be in the range 0...[b-1]
The div output will always be Int(a/b)
(where &quot;int()&quot; mean &quot;drop any fraction - DON&quot;T ROUND)

16 div 3 = 5
16 mod 3 = 1

8 div 5 = 1
8 mod 5 = 3

9 div 5 = 1
9 mod 5 = 4

10 div 5 = 2
10 mod 5 = 0

5 div 8 = 0
5 mod 8 = 5

x^y = x in y-th power.
This is how you calculate normal numbers:

1^3 = 1*1*1 = 1,
2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8,
3^3 = 3*3*3 = 27,

1^2 = 1*1 = 1,
2^2 = 2*2 = 4,

or when x^y, you multiply x y-times with x.

Did you get to hear or see what the vandals did on the main [[Wikiversity]] page? If not, check the page history, it was terrible. [[User:Lawman]] was the first to witness the effect.

==Wikiversity==

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Walden. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Walden~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

:'''Mirad''' ( aka '''Unilingua''' ) is an artificially-constructed auxiliary language ([http://www.quetzal.com/conlang.html conlang]) developed and published by Paris-based author Noubar Agopoff as a serious medium for easy and logical international communication.  Mirad is categorized by constructed language afficionados as ''philosophical'' because its vocabulary is mapped letter-by-letter to a semantic ontology or thesaurus. Also, the wordstock of Mirad is considered ''a priori'', that is, there is no deliberate association with words or roots in existing natural languages.  The vocabulary is &quot;from scratch&quot;, yet based on internal lexical and semantic rules that help the learner to construct and deconstruct derivations logically, mnemonically, and consistently.

:&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;&gt;For some odd reason, the author of this language called it the Latinesque name &quot;Unilingua.&quot;  In this revision of the language, the name will be the more internally consistent '''Mirad''' (pronounced ''mee-RAHD''), which means ''world language'' ('''mira''' = ''world's'' + '''d''' = ''speech''.) The proximity to the Russian word for 'world' (мир) is pure coincidence; the vocabulary of Mirad, as stated above, is not based on or related to any existing human language.&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;
:The author claims in his book ''Unilingua -- Langue universelle auxiliaire'' that this language is well-suited for universal, logical communication because it is based on principles already exploited globally by sciences like mathematics and chemistry where symbolic formulas are constructed in accordance with strict rules and a limited sequence of symbols understood by all practitioners.

:'''Mirad''' is constructed on the following principles:
::* Every vowel has numeric, vectorial, scalar, or semantic value.
::* Every consonant is semantically taxonomic.
::* Word derivation is systematic, consistent, analogical, and mnemonic.
::* Words are as ontologically unambiguous as possible.
::* Words are as short and as easy to pronounce as possible.
::* Inflection and derivation of words is regular and predictable.

:&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;&gt;Conlang afficianados, note:  Mirad is not strictly a ''logical'' language in the Sapir-Whorf sense.  It is meant to be more practical, natural, and humanly-usable.  Mirad is logical in the more usual sense that it is systematic, regular, and predictable.&lt;/table&gt;

'''Beer''' is an alcoholic beverage that can be used as a [[Cookbook:Leavening Agent|leavening agent]]. It is commonly used in the batter for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]] foods, and sometimes used in [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods. 
Beer can also be used to add flavor and moisture. Various styles of beers and ales can be used.

For uncooked usage of beer, see the numerous warnings on the [[Cookbook:Alcoholic_Drink|alcoholic drink]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ordered pairs ==
To define relations on sets we must have a concept of an ''ordered pair'', as opposed to the unordered pairs the axiom of pair gives.  To have a rigorous definition of ordered pair, we aim to satisfy one important property, namely, for sets a,b,c and d, &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=(c,d) \iff a=c \wedge b=d&lt;/math&gt;.  

As it stands, there are many ways to define an ordered pair to satisfy this property.  A simple definition, then is &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. (This is true simply by definition. It is a convention that we can usefully build upon, and has no deeper significance.)

{{theorem and proof|
theorem = &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=(c,d) \iff a=c \wedge b=d&lt;/math&gt;|
proof = 
If &lt;math&gt;a=c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=d&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}=(c,d)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Now, if &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = (c,d)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\cap \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\cap \{\{c\},\{c,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\{a\}=\{c\}&lt;/math&gt; and a=c.&lt;br&gt; So we have &lt;math&gt;(a,b)=(a,d)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\cup \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}=\cup \{\{a\},\{a,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt; meaning &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}=\{a,d\}&lt;/math&gt;.
:If &lt;math&gt;a=b&lt;/math&gt;,  we have &lt;math&gt;\{b\}=\{b,d\}&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;d \in \{b\}&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;b=d&lt;/math&gt;.
:If &lt;math&gt;a \ne b&lt;/math&gt;, note &lt;math&gt;b \in \{a,d\}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;b=d&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Relations ==
Using the definiton of ordered pairs, we now introduce the notion of a binary relation.

The simplest definition of a binary relation is a set of ordered pairs.  More formally, a set &lt;math&gt;\ R\ &lt;/math&gt; is a relation if &lt;math&gt;z \in R \rightarrow z=(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for some ''x,y''.  We can simplify the notation and write &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in R&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt;.

We give a few useful definitions of sets used when speaking of relations.

*The ''domain'' of a relation ''R'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mbox{dom}\ R = \{x \mid \exists y, (x,y) \in R \}&lt;/math&gt;, or all sets that are the initial member of an ordered pair contained in ''R''.

*The ''range'' of a relation ''R'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ran}\ R = \{y \mid \exists x, (x,y) \in R \}&lt;/math&gt;, or all sets that are the final member of an ordered pair contained in ''R''.

*The union of the domain and range, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{field}\ R = \mbox{dom}\  R \cup \mbox{ran}\  R&lt;/math&gt;, is called the ''field'' of ''R''.

*A relation ''R'' is a ''relation on'' a set ''X'' if &lt;math&gt;\mbox{field}\ R \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;.

*The ''inverse'' of ''R'' is the set &lt;math&gt;R^{-1}=\{(y,x) \mid (x,y) \in R\}&lt;/math&gt;

*The ''image'' of a set ''A'' under a relation ''R'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;R[A] = \{y\in \mbox{ran}\ R \mid \exists x \in A, (x,y)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;.

*The ''preimage'' of a set ''B'' under a relation ''R'' is the image of ''B'' over ''R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' or &lt;math&gt;R^{-1}[B] = \{x\in \mbox{dom}\ R \mid \exists y \in B, (x,y)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;

It is intuitive, when considering a relation, to seek to construct more relations from it, or to combine it with others.

We can compose two relations ''R'' and ''S'' to form one relation &lt;math&gt;S \circ R =\{(x,z) \mid \exists y, (x,y) \in R \wedge (y,z) \in S\}&lt;/math&gt;.  So &lt;math&gt;x S \circ R z&lt;/math&gt; means that there is some ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;xRy \wedge ySz&lt;/math&gt;.

We can define a few useful binary relations as examples:
#The ''Cartesian Product'' of two sets is &lt;math&gt;A \times B = \{(a,b) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A\cup B)) \mid a \in A \wedge b \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;, or the set where all elements of A are related to all elements of B.  As an exercise, show that all relations from ''A'' to ''B'' are subsets of &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;.  Notationally &lt;math&gt;A \times A&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;A^2&lt;/math&gt;
#The ''membership relation on a set'' ''A'', &lt;math&gt;\in_A = \{(a,b) \mid a, b \in A, a \in b\}&lt;/math&gt;
#The ''identity relation on'' ''A'', &lt;math&gt;I_A = \{(a,b) \mid a,b \in A, a=b\}&lt;/math&gt;

The following properties may or may not hold for a relation ''R'' on a set ''X'':
*R is ''reflexive'' if &lt;math&gt;x R x&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''x'' in ''X''.
*R is ''symmetric'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;y R x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''.
*R is ''antisymmetric'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y R x&lt;/math&gt; together imply that &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''.
*R is ''transitive'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y R z&lt;/math&gt; together imply that &lt;math&gt;x R z&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''X''.
*R is ''total'' if &lt;math&gt;x R y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y R x&lt;/math&gt;, or both hold for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''.

== Functions ==

=== Definitions ===
A function may be defined as a particular type of relation.  We define a '''partial function''' &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; as some mapping from a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to another set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that assigns to each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; ''no more than one'' &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, ''f'' is a function if and only if 
&lt;math&gt;f\circ f^{-1}\subseteq I_{Y}&lt;/math&gt;

If on each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; assigns ''exactly one'' &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called '''total function''' or just function. The following definitions are commonly used when discussing functions.

* If &lt;math&gt;f \subseteq X \times Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function, then we can denote this by writing &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''domain'' and the set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''codomain''.
* For a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the ''image'' of an element &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, we can say that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the ''value'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''evaluated'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
* For a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the ''image'' of a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{ y \in Y : f(x) = y \mbox{ for some } x \in A\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Be careful not to confuse this with &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, which is an element of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''range'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt;, or all of the values &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; where we can find an &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=y&lt;/math&gt;.
* For a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the ''preimage'' of a subset &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in X : f(x) \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;. This is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Properties of functions ===

A function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is '''onto''', or '''surjective''', if for each &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; exists &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = y&lt;/math&gt;.  It is easy to show that a function is surjective if and only if its codomain is equal to its range. It is '''one-to-one''', or '''injective''', if ''different'' elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are mapped to ''different elements'' of  &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(y) \Rightarrow x=y&lt;/math&gt;. A function that is both injective and surjective is intuitively termed '''bijective'''.

=== Composition of functions ===

Given two functions &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:Y \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;, we may be interested in first evaluating f at some &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and then evaluating g at &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. To this end, we define the ''composition' of these functions, written &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt;, as

:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the composition of these functions maps an element in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to an element in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, so we would write &lt;math&gt;g \circ f : X \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Inverses of functions ===

If there exists a function &lt;math&gt;g:Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that for &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = I_X&lt;/math&gt;, we call &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; a ''left inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If a left inverse for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; exists, we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''left invertible''. Similarly, if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;h:Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f \circ h = I_Y&lt;/math&gt; then we call &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; a ''right inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If such an &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; exists, we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''right invertible''. If there exists an element which is both a left and right inverse of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, we say that such an element is the ''inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and denote it by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Be careful not to confuse this with the preimage of f; the preimage of f always exists while the inverse may not. Proof of the following theorems is left as an exercise to the reader.

'''Theorem:''' If a function has both a left inverse &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and a right inverse &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = h = f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' A function is invertible if and only if it is bijective.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Paradigmbuff. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Paradigmbuff~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 13. Ecosystems&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

An ecosystem can be described simply as the collection of all living and non-living components in a particular area. The living components of the environment are known as biotic factors. Biotic factors include plants, animals, and micro-organisms. The non-living components of the environment are known as abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include things such as rocks and water.

The idea of the ecosystem relates to the idea that all organisms in the environment are engaged in relationships with every other aspect (like resources and other organisms) in that environment.  Ecosystems deal with energy and nutrient flow through a system/community.  For example, a household or a university could be described as an ecosystem, and a city or a state could be described as a larger ecosystem.

While ecosystems may be bound and individually discussed, they do not exist independently, but interact in a complex web.  The ecological relationships connecting all ecosystems make up the biosphere.  Because virtually no surface on the Earth is free of human contact, all ecosystems can be accurately classified as human ecosystems.

Ecosystems vary in diversity.  Some ecosystems may be very diverse with many plants and animals; whereas other ecosystems may be less diverse with fewer animals and plants. For example, tropical rain forests could be classified as an ecosystem that has high diversity; whereas temperate rain forests could be classified as an ecosystem that has lower diversity as compared to tropical rain forests.  [[Image:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|right|A tropical rain forest is an example of an ecosystem that may support several amounts of plants and animals and therefore may have a high diversity]]

== Ecosystem Concept ==
:''Living organisms and their nonliving (abiotic) environment are inseparably interrelated and interact upon each other. Any area of nature that includes living organisms and non-living substances interacting to produce an exchange of materials between the living and non-living parts is an ''ecological system'' or '''ecosystem''''' - E. P. Odum, 1959 &lt;small&gt;(emphasis added)&lt;/small&gt;
[[Image:Bald_eagle.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Bald eagle ''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'' is a top predator; a consumer whose niche is at the top of the food web]]  
Thus, a [[Wikipedia:en:Meadow_Vole|Field Mouse]] (say a Meadow vole, ''Microtus pennsylvanicus'') in its burrow in the soil is interacting with the non-living elements of that burrow as it breathes, taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. But that activity is but a moment in time and cannot, by itself, define an ecosystem.  The mouse must leave the burrow for food, interacting with plants. Plants themselves interact and exchange materials with the soil and the atmosphere and are dependent on radiation from the sun and the activity of earthworms and fungi in the soil. The latter, in turn, feed upon organic molecules left behind from the death of former living plants (and field mice). Thus, the &quot;ecosystem&quot; of our field mouse includes plants, and soil, and soil organisms&amp;mdash;and of course other field mice to insure that mice will always be a part of that ecosystem.  And perhaps present are Bald eagles (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''), dependent upon trees for nesting and roosting and a stream for water (and fish as an alternative food), feeding upon Field mice, recycling those that are caught into baby Bald eagles and droppings that are food for the plants and earthworms. Already, the &quot;area&quot; of this ecosystem is at least as large as that required to support a '''population''' of Bald eagles.

It is the inclusion of all the interrelationships within a functional system that make the concept of ecosystem so broad. And the seemingly endless networks of links and interactions that give geographical breadth to an ecosystem. Of course, an ecologist could study just the organisms, activities, and biotic/abiotic interactions within the local &quot;soil ecosystem&quot;, treating mouse and eagle excrement as we described the sun above: external, but providing important input of energy and material to the soil ecosystem.  In a sense, this is what we mean by calling &quot;ecosystem&quot; a concept rather than just a place. We may conceive of, for the purpose of study, ecosystems over a wide range of sizes or scale, from an aquarium to an ocean, and lots of places in between.  Essential are certain components that we  alluded to in our description of parts of the ecosystem supporting habitat for the Field mouse, and these we will next explore in detail.

In attempting to understand any interactive, complex system, especially one as elaborate as even a simple ecosystem, it is helpful to break the system down into various component parts.  By this mental process we can arrive at some understanding of the specific system and can make comparisons with other systems to further our understanding of ecosystems in general. An ecosystem consists of many component structures and these function together in various ways, suggesting an initial approach to describe any ecosystem is to consider separately its structural and functional aspects.

== Basic Structural Components ==

Consider first an ecosystem from a structural perspective: an ecosystem consists of living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components.  Living components include populations of organisms and the living resources they use.  Non-living components include non-living resources, such as space, and the non-living physical characteristics of habitats that differ by location, such as elevation, temperature, and humidity.  

We know and can observe that the '''organisms''' living in almost any ecosystem are not all identical individuals, but can be categorized into species (discussed previously in [[../Species_and_Populations|Chapter 9]]); and each species has a unique set of morphological, physiological, and behavioral attributes (see [[../Environmental_Response|Chapter 3]]) that will determine how each individual functions within the whole. The species present provide ways of considering their contribution to ecosystem structure. For examples: we could describe the number of species (species richness), or the number (or biomass) of individuals of each species (species diversity), or their distribution across the physical space of the ecosystem. These are a few ways an ecologist would approach describing ecosystem structure based upon the plants and animals (and others) present in it.

In addition to the organisms themselves, there are components utilized by the organisms that comprise the '''resources''' of the ecosystem.  These are both biotic and abiotic, inorganic and organic, and are exchanged between organisms and between organisms and the
environment (previously covered in part in [[../Biogeochemical_cycles|Chapter 4]]). Resources are the materials cycled by the inhabitants of an ecosystem as they carry on with life processes. We say &quot;cycled&quot; because all living things have a finite existence, and the substances of their material composition remain after death to be utilized in other ways.    

Finally, there are those factors that are the conditions under which the organisms live. The environment of a subarctic lake is vastly different from that of a forest in the wet tropics. But consider also that conditions within a pond (an aquatic environment) are very different from those just a few yards up from the shore (a terrestrial environment). While we might be describing mostly '''physical conditions''', these need not be always abiotic. In many ecosystems there are organisms that provide or create the dominant physical structure of that ecosystem. Examples are a forest and a coral reef. In a forest ecosystem, the trees are both very prominent organisms and resources to many of the other species present; but they also have a substantial effect on the conditions&amp;mdash;the microclimates&amp;mdash;that prevail in the forest ecosystem by providing shade and physical structure for many other organisms that may not directly utilize the trees as a food resource.  

It should be clear that when we speak of ecosystem structure, we are considering various aspects of an ecosystem from a perspective that need not&amp;mdash;indeed does not&amp;mdash;mesh exactly with other ways of categorizing ecosystem components. Consider the trees of a forest or the coral heads of a coral reef. Each is a living organism, a resource used by many other species, and a physical structure that determines the uniqueness of its particular ecosystem compared with the environment that would occupy the same space in the absence of either trees or corals. In describing ecosystem structure, we do not break down the components into divisions of abiotic vs. biotic, inorganic vs. organic, or by species. In the next section, we will consider components on the basis of their function in an ecosystem, creating yet another set of categories independent of the structural ones.

== Characteristics of Ecosystems ==
[[Image:Daydreameiland.jpg|left|thumb|150px| An example of a marine ecosystem]]
[[Image:Acheta domesticus.JPG|right|thumb|100px|''Acheta domesticus'' organism that helps maintain its ecosystem]] 
The complexity of an ecosystem will increase as the species diversity present in the ecosystem increases. Ecosystems that are not species rich (barren ecosystems) may ''appear'' to be physically complex but are actually considered ''functionally'' complex.

Even if few species live in an environment, often because it is an unfavorable environments, that ecosystem can be still functionally complex if it include species with remarkable biochemical specializations that allow them to survive. For instance some archaea live in environments that are 113-176° F. and some organisms can get energy from inorganic chemical sources, such as bacteria that break down crude oil. 

A healthy ecosystem will have high species diversity and is not likely to be damaged by human interactions, natural disasters, and climate changes. Every species within an ecosystem has a ''niche'', the unique way that a given species uses its environment.  New species are discovered every day and the roles they play in their environment to keep it healthy. This idea behind the species within the environment using their niches to keep it healthy can clearly be illustrated in a lake ecosystem.  In a lake ecosystem, the sun hits the water and helps the algae grow. Algae use carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and oxygen.  The oxygen is useful for any eukaryote organism and the sugars provide food for the algae or anything that eats the algae, such as microscopic organisms. Small fish eat the microscopic animals, absorb oxygen with their gills and expel carbon dioxide, which plants then use to grow. If the algae disappeared, everything else would be impacted. Microscopic animals wouldn't have enough food, fish wouldn't have enough oxygen and plants would lose some of the carbon dioxide they need to grow.

Soil is also an important part of an ecosystem. It provides important nutrients for the plants in an ecosystem. It helps anchor the plants to keep them in place. Soil absorbs and holds water for plants and animals to use and provides a home for lots of living organisms. The atmosphere provides oxygen and carbon dioxide for the plants and animals in an ecosystem.  The atmosphere is also part of the water cycle. Without the interactions among organisms and elements in the atmosphere, there would be no life at all.

== Basic Functional Components ==

We can recognize four functional components of an ecosystem: 1) ''abiotic factors'', 2) ''producers'', 3) ''consumers'', and 4) ''decomposers''.  The latter three are living components, what Odum (1959) termed the three &quot;functional kingdoms of nature&quot;, so important and universal is their presence in ecosystems. 
  
=== Abiotic Factors===
[[Image:Nerr0878.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An example of organisms that live in the intertidal zone]]Abiotic factors can increase or decrease the amount of '''environmental stress''' on an ecosystem and therefore can also affect the stability of that ecosystem. We studied many of these in detail in ([[../Biogeochemical_cycles|Chapter 4]]). Do not forget that physical (essentially geological) structure can influence ecological function: the nature of interactions of species in the sea can be very different from those in the atmosphere directly as a consequence of difference in physical properties of air and water.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_zone intertidal zone] is the shore area that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide.  It is rich in oxygen and nutrients and provides a home for many different species.  The organisms that live in this area are constantly exposed to a '''high stress''', '''less stable''' environment.  However, they have adapted to huge daily changes in moisture, temperature, turbulence (from the water), and salinity. They have to be used to living in both wet and dry conditions continually.  Water is a very powerful substance and the constant impact from the moving water can have drastic impacts on both living and non-living things.  Intertidal organisms are forced to bury into the sand, hide under rocks and/or attach themselves to larger structures to avoid being carried away by the waves.  Also, the constant flux of the environmental temperature is enough to make any creature uncomfortable.  Since this area is exposed to both water and land, the organisms here must compete with predators that hunt at both areas.

[[Image:Rainforest Fatu Hiva.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A tropical forest on a polynesian island]]Jungles or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest rainforests] are an example of a '''low stress''', '''more stable''' environment that are vital to maintaining the ecosystems of the earth.  Unlike the intertidal zone, this environment has more subtle changes that occur at a much slower rate.  Jungles are very stable environments that possess some 40% of all species.  It is also a very diverse environment consisting of several layers of organisms using different parts of the ecosystem.  As well as increasing biodiversity, jungles are beneficial to increasing our knowledge of medicinal plants and increasing oxygen output.  Since the rainforest is literally a smörgåsbord a plants and animals, discoveries are continually made of the beneficial nature of these organisms.

== Food Webs ==

A '''food web''' is a series of interacting food chains. Food chains show the order in which animals consume food. Food chains and food webs are made up of Producers, Consumers, and Decomposers. '''Producers''' are [[Wikipedia:en:Autotroph|Autotrophic Organisms]]. &quot;Autotrophic&quot; means self-nourishing.  The most conspicuous group of autotrophs are the '''photolithoautotrophs''', organisms such as algae and flowering plants that have cells containing chlorophyll and are thus capable of fixing light energy (&quot;photo-&quot;) to build complex organic substances from simple inorganic substances (&quot;litho-&quot;). In the next chapter we are going to study the energetics of this process; now, we are mostly interested in how producers &quot;create&quot; organic matter utilizing energy and inorganic matter.  The organic compounds that are created may be used structurally within the organism or may be latter broken down into inorganic matter and energy extracted by the process.  
'''Consumers''' are [[http://www.chemicool.com/definition/heterotrophic_organisms.html| Heterotrophic Organisms]], which are also termed '''macroconsumers'''. A simple definition of a heterotrophic organism is a species that is dependent on organic matter for food. '''Decomposers''' are heterotrophic organisms.  These are also termed microconsumers, saprobes, or saprophytes. Decomposers are scavengers that break down dead plants and animals.

Decomposers are vital to the food web because they break down and recycle nutrients back into the soil. These nutrients are then used by producers to sustain life. Without the enzymes that decomposers provide to breakdown organic material into inorganic material, phosphorous(P) and nitrogen(N), Producers would eventually die out and the main part of food webs would cease to exist and therefore life would cease to exist. Decomposers recycle material but they do not recycle energy. Solar irradiation still provides the energy that drives the life cycle.

Decomposition is a natural process but decomposers speed up the process of decomposition. Bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes are three main types of decomposers. Bacteria make up about 90% of all microorganisms and are the most abundant of decomposers. They can eat anything from dead trees, dead animals and oil slicks on the surface of the ocean. Fungi and actinomycetes work on harder substances like cellulose, bark, paper and stems. These decomposers usually only work to a certain stage in decomposition then bacteria will finish the process, similar to primary and secondary succession.

A study conducted in a California river by Mary Power showed the impact that fish had on the river food wed. The main fish studied in the experiment were the steelhead and roach, these fish at a juvenile stage consume insects and fish fry, which consume chironomid larvae. These larvae reduce the algae biomass in the river. She found that when the larger adult fish species were absent, smaller more abundant predators thrived and decrease the chironomid larvae population significantly, which allowed the algae biomass to increase. This results in more cyanobacteria and diatoms to flourish on the algal turfs{{ref|Power 1990}}. This study showed a good example of how consumers and producers interact, and also showed that when one trophic level is disrupted it has a domino effect on the other trophic levels involved in the food web.

With Food Webs there are a few calculations that we can use to help us better understand the system.  Chain Length is essentially the number of links between trophic levels.  But when we calculate this we use the mean length.  So to calculate Chain Length(CL) the equation is CL=(# of links/T-1) where T is equal to the number of trophic levels.  We can also calculate link density(LD).  LD=(# of Links/n) where n is the number of species in the web.  And finally we can calculate Web Connectance(C).  C=(actual links/potential links(N))  Where N=n(n-1)/2.

Food webs do pose some problems for ecological studies. Identifying trophic levels is very difficult in nature. Ecosystem boundaries are also tough to determine. Identifying all of the species in a community can be difficult. Quantifying and identifying the strengths of interactions is hard. In most cases it is very hard to determine what the eliminating nutrients are.

===Biological Magnification===
The focus of this chapter is trophic levels and nutrient transfer between trophic levels and the food webs. Not all transfers between trophic levels are positive. Biological Magnification is the tendency of pollutants to concentrate in successive trophic levels. The pollutants are usually toxic and cause death to the organism.

The first step in Biomagnification is when a producer takes up nutrients in the soil that it stores by accident as an essential nutrient. Producers will try to store massive amounts of nutrients, when &quot;mistaken&quot; nutrients are absorbed, i.e. DDT and Mercury, The concentration levels in the producers are greater than the levels in the surrounding environment. When the producer is eaten by the herbivore or omnivore the pollutants are transferred to the next trophic level. Since energy transfer between trophic levels is approximately ten percent, the next chain in the trophic level must try to consume large amounts of the previous trophic level to sustain life and the pollutant, once again, is concentrated in the next trophic level.

The pollutants, once absorbed, are stored in the bodies of the consumers. DDT and PCB's are fat soluble and when one trophic level is consumed by the other the fat moves from one consumer to the next. Water soluble pollutants usually cannot concentrate because they would easily dissolve in the organism. Polluted water leaves an organism rather easily whereas fat does not leave the body.

Three main criteria must be met for a pollutant to biomagnify:
# The pollutant must be long lived.
# The pollutant must be concentrated by the producers.
# The pollutant must be fat-soluble.

=== Guild===
Species competing for the same resources in similar fashion are known as [[Wikipedia:en:Guild_%28ecology%29|guilds]]. They are classified according to how they acquire their nutrients, their state of mobility, and their mode of feeding. Some examples of guilds are [[Wikipedia:en:Forb|forbs]], geophytes, graminoids, shrubs, trees and vines. A guild is much more stable then a single species, since more than one species can balance out the system. In a study of feeding patterns on [[Wikipedia:en:Polychaete|polychaetes]], Fauchald and Jumars (1979) utilized feeding guilds as a method of generalization and determining [[Wikipedia:en:Phylogeny|phylogenetic]] relationships, indeed claiming that guilds were very useful in summarizing data into patterns {{ref|Fauchald 1979}}.

In a 2009 study, a guild approach was used to evaluate the roles of foraging habitats and exposure timing, as well as tropic position on Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation. Five species of waterbirds forming three distinct foraging guilds in the San Franciso Bay (SFB) estuary were used in this investigation. Because estuarine waterbirds form well-documented, distinct guilds distinquished by their feeding method and habitat use and because the SFB estuary has a legacy of Hg contamination from historic mining in the Sierra Nevada Coast Mountain Range, Hg exposure was able to be evaluated on both large-scale foraging strategies (such as tropic position) occurring among guilds and small-scale strategies (such as foraging micro-habitats) that occur within guilds. As indicated by this study, SFB waterbirds accumulated alarming Hg concentrations. Concentrations that place them at considerable risk to deleterious reproductive effects. Such exposure was shown to vary as a function of micro-habitat, region, trophic level, and time spent in the estuary. These results have raised quite a bit of concern because the SFB estuary is among the most important sites for wintering, migrating, and breeding waterbird populations along the Pacific Flyaway {{ref|Eagles-Smith 2009}}.
[[Image:Spiritbear.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A bear is an example of a keystone species which provides stability to a community.]]

=== Keystone Species ===
A keystone species is a species having a disproportionate effect on the ecosystem. They provide stability to an ecosystem. Normally they are not the dominant species but are required for a community to have stability. Many times keystone species are predators that keep some type of herbivore from consuming all of the dominant plant species. One interesting aspect of keystone species is that since they normally feed on predators that consume small numbers of prey, they can effectively control a system without actually needing to have a large population size.

J.Brown and E. Heske studied the effects of the removal of ''Dipodomys'' spp. (Kangaroo rats) from the Chihuahuan Desert shrub habitat in southeastern Arizona. Twelve years after the removal of three species of kangaroo rats, the controlled plots in the habitat went from shrubland to grassland. The density of perennial and annual grasses increased considerably, and also other rodent species in the area colonized. These major changes in the ecosystem show that the ''Dipodomys'' spp. have a significant effect on the diversity and biogeochemical processes, which led the researchers to believe that the kangaroo rats are a keystone species {{ref|Brown 1990}}. 
Some other examples of keystone species would include Starfish, Sea Otters, Bears, Beavers and Domestic Cats.
*Read: [[Wikipedia:en:Keystone species|Keystone Species]]

All the examples of keystone species mentioned above are animals. However, this isn't always the case. ''Pinus chiapensis'' is an early successional, neotropical pine species found in warm, humid, mid-elevation Mesoamercian areas such as in the tropical montane areas of southern Mexico and western Guatemala. It has been discovered that forests dominated by ''P. chiapensis'' are the first to appear after disturbance, modifying drastically the environment by shading the forest floor, favoring soil development, increasing the rate of soil carbon sequestration, acidifying the soil, releasing nutrient cations by weathering the bed rock, and providing a source of food for birds and mammals. ''P. chiapensis'' trees inhibit their own development while facilitating  the growth of broadleaved species typical of tropical montane cloud forests. Ultimately, ''P. chiapensis''is a keystone species because of its crucial impacts in tropical montane cloud forest regeneration and its effect on ecosystem processes {{ref|Castillo 2009}}.

===Hypotheses of Food Web Control===
Each food web contains N numbers of trophic levels and with each number the cycle of dependence flip-flops according to the Oksanen's Model.  There are two hypotheses involved in this model one is known as the '''Bottom-up Control''' hypothesis.  The bottom-up control hypothesis states that both the top and the bottom trophic levels are controlled by resource limitations For example in a three tiered food web (three trophic levels), the bottom trophic level would contain a species of plants, which of course are dependent on the resources available to it.  The next trophic level would be some species of herbivore, these herbivores are limited and controlled by a species of predator which is also the third trophic level.  The predator or top trophic level is then limited by the plant resources keeping the herbivores alive and reproducing.

If we were to now add a trophic level, such as a secondary predator (the original predator being the primary predator), the cycle of dependence would then flip-flop, and the '''Top-bottom Control''' hypothesis would apply.  The top-bottom control hypothesis states that the food web cycle is predator limited.  We now have our plant species ==&gt; the herbivore ==&gt; the primary predator ==&gt; and the secondary predator.  The plants that were resource limited are now predator limited by the herbivores.  The herbivores are now resource limited by the plants abundance.  The primary predator is now limited by the secondary predator and the secondary predator is now limited by the resources of the primary predator, herbivore, and plants.

This cycle repeats itself and with each additional trophic level added, the limitation of the lower trophic levels changes from either resource limited or predator limited to the other. The relationships of two trophic levels when the bottom is resource limited and the top is predator limited gives a positive slope.  The more of the lower trophic level the more there is of the upper trophic level.  The inverse is true when the lower trophic level is predator limited and the upper trophic level is resource limited, it creates a negative slope the more are of the upper trophic level the less there will be of the lower trophic level.

''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - invades submucosa
*T2 - invades muscularis propria
*T3 - invades through muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues
*T4
**T4a - penetrates to the surface of the visceral peritoneum
**T4b - directly invades or is adherent to other organs or structures

Layers: are the epithelium, basement membrane (defines intraepithelial), lamina propria (defines intramucosal) - contains capillaries and lymphatics (but little chance for mets), muscularis mucosae, submucosa (loose connective tissue), muscularis propria (circular and longitudinal layers), subserosa (single layer of cells).

Difference between rectum and colon is that most of the rectum lacks serosa. Thus for the rectum, a T3 is invasion into perirectal fat; for colon, T3 is invasion of serosa.  Also for the rectum, T4 is only invasion of other organs, whereas for the colon T4 can also be perforation through serosa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hamsters as pets==

The hamster kept as pet least often is the [[w:Golden Hamster|Golden Hamster]], also you should never feed hamster your finger called Syrian Hamster. So-called '''Teddybear''' or '''Black bear''' hamsters are breeds of blue hamsters. But also four species of smaller hamsters are popular pets, often called dwarf hamsters. These are [[w:Roborovski hamster|Roborovski hamster]], (''Phodopus roborovskii'') often called Roborovski, the [[w:chinese striped hamster|chinese striped hamster]] (''Cricetulus griseus'') and the two subspecies of ''[[w:Phodopus sungorus|Phodopus sungorus]]'', the winter white Russian dwarf hamster (''Phodopus sungorus sungorus'') and Campbell's dwarf hamster (''Phodopus sungorus campellii''). The care of the dwarf hamsters is similar to that of the golden hamster, but there are differences in feeding and housing needs and temperament. Winter whites and Campell's are fairly popular, in the US the campells more so than the whinter whites, while it's other way round in [[w:Europe|Europe]]. Roborovski and Chinese striped Hamsters are somewhat more difficult to breed and keep, they are usually only available from breeders, and therefore limited to serious rodentia fans. Roborovski are especially not suitable for children.

Hamsters are [[w:nocturnal|nocturnal]] by nature, making them less than ideal as pets for people who are normally awake during the day. However, many people prefer them to [[w:rat|rat]]s, given rats' unsavory reputation (undeserved as pets).  Unlike rats, they are not particularly good at learning tricks but can be entertaining to watch.  They are also much smaller than [[w:guinea pig|guinea pig]]s, although equally as furry and appealing, so are more appropriate for homes with limited space.

== Housing ==
Hamsters can be kept both in cages and in terrariums, both of which are available in pet stores. Cages are easier to carry, their bars can be used for climbing, and they usually include a convenient front door. On the other hand, glass boxes keep hamsters from throwing litter out of their cages, provide a better view into the hamster's home, and create a quieter and more sheltered interior. In general, terrariums are more appropriate for dwarf hamsters, which  are more sensitive to a disquieting environment and which would otherwise need very narrow-grid bars to keep them from slipping through. Middle-sized hamsters, such as the Golden Hamster, especially enjoy climbing the cage walls (the cage should have horizontal and vertical bars) and are more open to the outside world, which is why cages might be the better choice for this kind of hamsters.

Despite the hamster's small size, appropriate housings should ''always'' have a floor space of at least 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm (16 by 24 inches) and be at least 40&amp;nbsp;cm (24 inches) in height. Glass boxes must not be higher than their width to allow for a sufficient air circulation. Although smaller in size, dwarf hamsters should have bigger housings than their larger relatives, at least 80 cm by 40&amp;nbsp;cm (2 feet by 4 feet). The reason for this is that the dwarfs are very active, running and digging a lot, but they often cannot be taken outside their houses for long, because they are not comfortable there and, due to their smaller size, are more endangered when leaving their domicile. Usually hamsters with a bigger and more interesting home will live longer and provide more visual entertainment.

In addition to buying the common housings sold in stores, you can also build customized dwellings. In this case, use only materials that are not dangerous to the animals. Plywood and wood from conifers is not suitable, because hamsters gnaw at their houses and both glue and resin are poisonous for them. Using standard aquarium siciloin to join pieces of solid wood, such as  birch or beech wood, creates a safe environment for the hamster, although you must check frequently to ensure that the hamster is not gnawing through the wood. You can also equip a purchased cage with several intermediate levels, connected using stairs. Using wire grid for these platforms instead of solid wood causes serious injuries and is therefore not recommended. 

The narrow and smooth plastic toy housings that can be found in some stores are not appropriate as the sole habitat for hamsters. The tight tubes are often densely closed, preventing sufficient air circulation, and the plastic surfaces, while easily cleanable, cannot absorb the hamster's urine like natural materials. The result is a damp and uncomfortable climate that is a perfect habitat for germs and [[w:fungus|fungi]]. In addition, synthetic materials are unhealthy when used for gnawing, making plastic tubes, &quot;space stations&quot;, and houses an improper and unnatural (though often expensive) permanent home for hamsters.  Reserve these habitats for supervised play and activity.

The perfect place for the hamster's home is a well-lit room of constant, moderate temperature (18 to 26°C, 64 to 80°F), in a place without strong solar irradiation that could cause dangerous heating. Especially when wire cages are used, it is also important to avoid air draft. Though they cannot see very far, hamsters become more relaxed and curious when positioned somewhat above the ground (at least 65&amp;nbsp;cm (2 feet)), from where they can perceive their surroundings.

Cover the inside of the hamster's residence, including all intermediate levels,  with a sufficiently thick layer of wooden litter for rodents, available in pet stores. Although alternative materials may work as well, most of these bear additional threats, NEVER use pine or cedar as it causes respitory infections. Cat litter is  dangerous, because gnawing and eating the chunks is deadly. 

Hamsters are nest builders and a steady supply of fresh strips of tissue or newspaper (with soy-based ink only) allows them to build a secure and comfortable spot in a corner of their enclosure or in their hiding house. Hay, from shops or even fresh from the garden, is also a valuable building material for cosy hamster nests, which, as an additional bonus, is also perfectly edible.

A sand bath can provide a hamster with entertainment and helps them groom.  In the desert (their natural habitat), hamsters will roll around in the sand, which cleans their coat and prevents it from getting too oily.  Dwarf hamsters in particularly enjoy this activity.  Be sure to use a dish that will not tip over.  Heavy ceramic and metal dishes are preferred.  You can fill the dish with fine sand (pumice or chinchilla sand is best), but DO NOT use any sort of 'dust' bath AT ALL. This can cause respiratory and eye problems.

Regular cleaning of a hamster's home is crucial for the hamster's health.  The home must be cleaned at least once a week by replacing the soiled bedding where necessary.  Hamsters are fairly neat in their bathroom habits; if their enclosure is regularly cleaned, they choose one small location in which to urinate and defecate, making the cleaning simple. They may have many (usually hidden) places used as toilets.

Another important component of a hamster's home is a hiding place where the animal can rest during the day. Not all commercially available houses are adequate. The houses should be of sufficient size and be closed on at least two sides. The same building materials are appropriate for these as for the larger cages, although even a small cardboard box will work (and which will have to be regularly replaced and NO INK!!!!).  Some houses add features such as a removable roof that helps to take away collected food (especially perishable items). 

Hamsters are solitary animals and prefer to be alone most of the time. While sometimes two or more animals can live peacefully within one home, there can be bloody fights. In their natural habitat, there is substantially more empty space so that each hamster can have its own large territory. If more than one hamster is to live in a cage, then the cage must be larger (at least 40cm x 40cm per hamster) and there must be separate hiding houses for each animal. In any case, even after a long period of peaceful coexistence or even mating, there can be violent biting. In this situation, the hamsters should be separated immediately. Note also that, if a male and female hamster live together without fighting, then they will usually reproduce rapidly, thereby causing more space problems.

== Gnawing ==

Despite their cuddly appearance, hamsters have long, thin, sharp teeth that can pierce a finger that is mistaken for a carrot or for a predator.  When they are accustomed to being handled and are not startled, however, they are not inclined to bite and can be placed in the custody of responsible school-age children. Like many rodents, their teeth grow continuously and they must have appropriate things to chew on to relieve their instinctive gnawing and to help keep the teeth at a healthy length.  They will gnaw on whatever is available, so they must be kept in enclosures that they cannot chew through. When the hamster is kept in or near a bedroom, their nocturnal nature combined with their gnawing  habit can become  distracting.

== Exercise and entertainment ==

Like all pets, hamsters need exercise and entertainment to maintain their physical and mental health.  An exercise wheel allows hamsters to run full speed to their hearts' content, but is not as mentally stimulating as more elaborate enclosures including additional toys such as plastic or wooden tubes that somewhat mimic the burrows that they might have in the wild and allow their owners to enjoy their activities.  Most commercial exercise wheels marketed for hamsters have rungs which are not suitable for hamsters due to the fact that a hamster could get injured in one.

Clear plastic hamster balls or cars are available, into which the hamster is placed and then, by its own action, explores an entire house or yard.  Use these toys ''only'' under supervision and use common sense. Unsupervised hamsters in these toys can become trapped against furniture and panic or they can roll down stairs, injuring themselves.  Do not leave them in these toys for extended periods, especially on warm days, and make sure to remove them frequently and allow them access to water or fresh fruits or vegetables.  Toys should always ''invite'' the hamster to explore and use them at its own will, without forcing or violence.

If they are handled frequently, hamsters enjoy being out of their enclosures and having the opportunity to explore.  However, they must be kept away from holes in the wall or in large pieces of furniture, because they will seek out the dark and burrow-like confines of those areas and it can be difficult or impossible to convince them to come out again.

== Food ==

Pet stores can provide basic food for hamsters that provides their non-nutritional needs, but they also like fresh [[w:vegetable|vegetable]]s and [[w:fruit|fruit]]s, dog food, and even killed [[w:insect|insect]]s, which make up an important part of their natural diet. However, not any nutrition is suitable for hamsters and some food, such as sweets made for humans or poisonous plants like the ''leaves'' of the [[w:tomato|tomato]], may be most dangerous for the hamster's health. Like with most other animals (and humans), it is not true that hamsters can decide which food is good for them and they will usually eat anything that is offered.

Hamsters should also always have fresh water available. Appropriate drinking devices can be found in stores. Being small animals that are adapted to the life in arid environments, hamsters can also ingest all necessary liquid via sufficient amounts of watery vegetables, such as cucumber, without any negative effects. However, providing water is usually more convenient and can be an easy way to add medication or [[w:vitamin|vitamin]]s to the hamsters diet. Both water and vegetables must be fresh and have to be exchanged frequently, usually once a day. Water must not be given in open jars, since it is likely to be polluted and because wetness is generally very unhealthy for hamsters (that clean themselves very carefully without the need of additional water).

In detail, the solid food components can be divided into three categories: dry, fresh, and animal food. Dry food makes up the bulk of a hamster's diet. Besides the standard rodent food sold in pet stores, most other kinds of seeds, kernels, and [[w:nut (fruit)|nuts]] can be given. Care should be taken to limit the amount of fat contained within the diet. Especially [[w:sunflower|sunflower]] seeds, nuts, [[w:almond|almond]]s, and sesame are most nutritive and are to be considered as a treat rather than as basic food. All kinds of [[w:cereal|grain]], rice, noodles (dry), dry pea] and lentils on the other hand can be provided less restrictively: about 120&amp;nbsp;g for a medium hamster and, depending on size, about half the amount for a dwarf hamster is sufficient. Bread and similar bakery products contain many ingredients (e.g. yeast) that can trouble the hamster's digestion system. They should be given in small amounts for gnawing or be replaced by special wafers as found in pet stores. All dry food should be appropriate in size. Especially small hamsters often cannot cope well with large seeds, even if they are sold under the label &quot;hamster food&quot;. Bird food like [[w:millet|millet]] is a noteworthy alternative for small hamsters.

Hay, although also belonging to the dry food category, can be provided in large amounts at any time. It does not contain notable amounts of fat, still is liked by most hamsters, supports the hamster's digestion system, serves as a hiding place, and is often used for nest building. In addition it is cheap and can even be produced in your own garden easily.

Fresh food is also an important part of the hamster's diet. As mentioned above, cucumber is a good supplement of water. Fresh grass, carrot, all kinds of lettuce, leaves and even branches' of (non-poisonous) plants are also no problem in general. However, no conifer wood must be fed since resin is poisonous for hamsters. In smaller amounts, grown hamsters also appreciate apple, pear, sweet paprika, tomato (only red parts), banana, mango, strawberry, and even small pieces of orange. Too much sweet fruits on the other hand are not healthy. All kinds of cabbage should be avoided, since they may cause [[w:flatulence|flatulence]], which is quite dangerous for the hamster's sensitive digestion system.

Very young hamsters (6-8 Weeks) should eat only carrots and small grains. Even water can damage their digestion system and be a deadly danger. Ill hamsters are also preferably provided with a more conservative diet. If accepted, herbs can also help to strengthen the hamster's health, though they cannot replace a veterinarian in case of a disease. Daisies (the flowers, not the stems or leaves) and dandelions are likewise appreciated. Plants used for hamster foods should never be placed near open windows because hamsters are more sensitive to chemical pollutions, due to their small body weight.

Finally animal food is a major component of some hamsters' natural food. As pets, a large part of this can be replaced by dry food. Still, hamsters need some animal proteins for their health. While some people like to provide living insects from pet stores to their hamsters, others will prefer to give them dry dog biscuits. Some hamsters are known to accept yoghurt (natural, without sweet ingredients) or soft cheese (low fat, not too salty), and in any case egg noodles are usually taken gratefully. If (dry or soft) dog or cat food is given, then the fat content has to be checked carefully. Furthermore, it must not contain molasses, which would harm the hamster.

In addition, a special salt stone (available in pet stores) belongs in every hamster cage. Although this huge amount of mineral salt is hardly used up by generations of hamsters, it is necessary for their life. Vitamin additives for rodents are not required and usually fresh vegetables are to be preferred. If the hamster is diseased or ill-nourished, vitamins or medications may be needed.

It might be noted that many hamsters tend to carry away food from their food source (by carrying it in their cheek pouches) and hoard it away in a cache hidden somewhere inside their container. These caches, when combined with hamster urine or a leaky water source and poor airflow, can grow mould or start to rot, creating a hazardous environment for the hamster. To keep this from happening, clean hamster cages frequently. It is because of this behavior that hamsters got their name. The German word for hoard is &quot;hamstern.&quot;   

There are also many foods that a hamster should never eat. This includes all kinds of human sweets, such as chocolate or candy, which are unhealthy and even dangerous. Furthermore, poisonous plants (also check indoor plants if the hamster is taken outside its housing) constitute a considerable danger. Other than this, mainly the various unhealthy and chemically treated products usually consumed by humans can cause problems.

Campbells dwarf hamsters are especially sensitive to [[w:Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes mellitus]], and other dwarf hamster species may be somewhat sensitive too.  Diabetes mellitus in hamsters is often caused by intake of simple sugar. Therefore it is essential to avoid hamster food and snacks containing molasses, honey, sugar, fruit sugar or other sweet stuff. Intake of sweet fruit should be limited to small snacks. Even with golden hamsters it may be useful to follow these guideline in order to avoid overweight and digestion disturbances.

==Bedding==

Bedding is an important part of a hamster's environment.  They sleep in it, walk on it, play in it, burrow in it, bury in it and use it as a litter.  Therefore, it is important to provide a safe, comfortable form of bedding for any hamster.  There are several options available when it comes to bedding.  In the past, pine shavings and cedar shavings were a popular form of bedding until it was determined that the [[w:phenol|phenols]] found in pine and cedar shavings can cause serious respiratory problems in hamsters.  Therefore, pine and cedar bedding should never be used even though it continues to be sold.  Aspen shavings are a safe alternative to pine and cedar bedding.  Other safe bedding alternatives include corn cob bedding, bedding made of recycled wood pulp (such as the brand Carefresh), newspaper pellets (such as the brand Yesterday's News), as well as others.

== Reproduction and longevity ==

Hamsters typically live no more than two to four years in captivity, less than that in the wild. Because of their short life expectancy, hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (two months). Left to their own devices, hamsters will produce several litters a year with several babies in each litter.  Male and female hamsters are therefore usually kept in separate enclosures to prevent the addition of unwanted offspring.  Extreme care should be taken when breeding hamsters because if the female is not in heat there is the possibility of her being violent towards the male - with possibly fatal consequences.

Also, remember that if the room temperature gets low enough (below about 65°F / 18°c) the hamster will go into hibernation. This can be very dangerous to your hamsters health, as once a hamster goes into hibernation its body may not be strong enough to properly wake up again. Please, don't assume that your pet is dead because it stops moving. It may just be hibernating. To get a hamster to go out of hibernation it needs to be moved into a warmer location and allowed to slowly return to temperature. Do not shock or startle a hamster in this situation.

:Nope. Go right ahead.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]

I think &quot;Distributions for Masochists (just kidding)&quot; while mildly accurate and humorous is not a very professional/helpful title. Perhaps &quot;Advanced Distributions&quot; or &quot;Source-based Distributions&quot; would be better. --[[User:Jats|Jats]] ([[User talk:Jats|talk]]) 01:55, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

The Sorceror section contradicts itself. Is it source-based or not? Since no one's likely to answer I'll probably do my own research and revised the article accordingly. --[[User:Jats|Jats]] ([[User talk:Jats|talk]]) 02:13, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

Or far from: &quot;Debian also has a very good package management system, quite possibly THE best package management system of any OS in the world.&quot;

I agree and very much like apt also, but this is extremely suggestive (and using &quot;possibly&quot; to cover that up is a bit low). Also, Ubuntu uses the exact same system, so why is theirs not labeled &quot;THE best?&quot; [[User:Sykil|Sykil]] 04:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

== Live USB ==

What about Live USB systems? Similar to liveCD, but on pendrive, and a whole lot faster (only a bit slower than fully installed system). This is very popular, because one does not need CDs for each distro he wants to try out.

== Ubuntu ==

Ubuntu section needs updating. Starting with 11.04 default desktop environment is Unity, not GNOME. Though GNOME (and KDE, XFCE, LXDE, etc.) can be easily installed from repositorium.
Additionally Ubuntu is the most popular desktop linux distro for personal use. It features utility for easy installation of closed source drivers (if available)(this is optional), and asks if user wants to install closed software such as mp3 codecs during installation.</text>

Introduccion y Faqs de la Domotica


El término domótica proviene de la conjunción del término latino &quot;Domus&quot; (casa en latín) y de automática.

A mitad de los 80 la Domitica se comenzo a hablar,se comenzo a hablar de este con el fin de representar la robotizacion de las actividades domesticas, entre otras; la Domotica tambien aparece con el fin de sustituir la idea de los edificios inteligentes, la cual no ha tenido mayores exitos.

La Domotica es una disciplina p[a[ra gente que esta dispuesta a investigar cosas nuevas. Es]t]a se aplica en la robotizacion de un hogar, es decir que vas a hacer de tu hogar un lugar seguro y practico.

El principal fin de la Domotica es

   1. facilidades en el hogar.
   2. Seguridad.
   3. El ahorro de la energia.
   4. Servicios multimedia, camaras sensores que ayudan a la seguridad.
   5. El uso de diseño de sistemas que me permitan hacer cosas un poco desagradables

Cuando hablamos de casas inteligentes o domoticas, no necesariamente hablamos de casas super lujosas, cuando la domotica empezo todo era carisimo y se consideraba que solo era apto para los millonarios como Bill Gate, pero ahora que los precios en los mercados han disminuido todo el mundo puede tener acceso a estos servicios.

Pensandolo bien, si analizamos las situaciones, podemos tomar como ejemplo las familias. Miren los sistemas Domotica no tienen que ser neceariamente igual en todos lados, ya que no todos los hogares y habitantes de ellos son las mismas con los mismos gustos y mismos quehaceres, osea que a algunas personas les sale mas caro este sistema, y a otras no.

Hoy en dia la Domotica la encuentras en todas partes, en los bancos, en los hogares, incluso en la carretera.

Si quieres utilizar la Domotica en tu hogar no tienes que cubrir lo todo, puedes escoger solo algunas areas especificas.

La fabricacion de los modulos, en el caso de los sitemas que usan los cables de electricidad para transportar la informacion entre ellos, estos son de fabricacion en serie y son facil de conseguir, tienes que tener en cuenta los siguientes detalles; por ejemplo que sean de 220V o 110V segun sea requerido --&gt;Cuando V es = a voltios.

   1. Algunos Ejemplos de Domotica:
   2. Tener una cerradura a base de codigo.
   3. Mallas electricas.
   4. Luzes de celdas Photoelectricas.
   5. Sistema de camaras, con monitores.
   6. Detectores de humo.
   7. Regulador de Temperatura.
   8. Riego Automatico.
   9. EtX....


¿Que tiene de bueno la Domotica? Bueno los sistemas Domoticos son exelentes porque son adaptables a cualquier actividad.

Domotica X10


Se le llama Domotica X10 por el sistema de automatizacion de los hogares con dispostivos de comunicacion en formato digital, los que utilizan corrientes electricas con frecuencias de 120khz., con las cuales se transportan las señales X10 digitales.

La Domotica X10 se destaca principalmente por utilizar el mismo wire de la electricidad de la casa, es decir que no requiere de otro tipo de wire mas que el que estaba previamente instalado en el hogar. Con este mismo wire se le es permitido enviar y recibir toda la informacion y el suministro de potencia.

El Domotica X10 necesita de una red electrica convencional es decir que no tienes que comprar otra con la que tienes en tu hogar es suficiente. Mediante esta red vamos a poder tener acceso a todo utencilio electrico.

Encuanto a distancia el X10 se vale de señales de frecuencia alta &quot;120khz.&quot; ademas de los wires el X10 utiliza Utencilios de Emision y Resepcion.

Domotica EIB


La Domotica EIB se basa en un sistema de control en red que robotiza todo lo que es de servicio electrico.

La EIB se origina unos 6 años despues de que habia salido la Domotica, esta es muy pedido sus servicios de edificacion ya qu todas estas instalaciones son de origen tecnico.

Mas que todo la EIB fue muy demandada por complicaciones en exeso en las instalaciones electricas tradicionales, por los diversos accidentes y anomailas.

El crecimiento de la EIB se debe a que esta basado en crotecnologia, y como todos sabemos ya este es muy demandada entre mas pequeño es mejor para nosotros. Ademas que eran muy versatiles y programables todos los aparatos que sacaban.

El EIB se origina cuando varias compañias Europeas se unen con el fin de sacar adelante el proyecto de Sistemas de Instalacion Electrica moderna que hiciera compatible la interconexion entre todos los productos de estas compañias.

Este sistema es estandar y es abierto, es decir que controlan a todos los productos, y que los productos sean de la misma caracteristica y funcionamiento que el EIB.

El EIB a sido registrado como (European Instalacion Bus Asosiacion).

Domotica Lonworks


LON (Local Operating Networks) es la abreviatura de LONWORKS, tecnología basada en el protocolo LonTalk que proporciona todas las herramientas para la implementación de redes de control distribuidas

Como digitalizar tu casa?

Se puede trabjar de diferentes maneras, uno de los puntos que mas a gradan en la domotica es la versatilidad de la domotica, la pueden trabajar con ayuda de tu PC, o tambien con ayuda de un control remoto que mediante un circuito te permite programar tu casa como anteriormente se menciono, tambien con progrmaciones estandar que son las meno versatiles gracias a que no te permiten muchas posibilidades y modificarlas te cuestan una gran suma de dinero.

1. con ayuda de tu PC.

Esta forma es muy versatil gracias a que te permite tener un sin numero de posibilidades, y gracias al avance continuo de las computadoras pudes tener diferentes opcines de configuracion de el comportamiento de tu casa; por ejemplo, puedes desarrollar en diferentes lenguajes de programacion diferentes interfaces, los cuales te permiten facilitar, complemetar y adaptar el software a las necesidades personales. Tambien pudes manejar desde tu PC los diferentes puertos bidirecccionales (paralelo, serie, juegos) y complementar la funcionalidad de tu casa.

1.1. Como Dijitalizar tu casa (Consejos)

1.1.1. Requerimientos:

a.Visual Basic 6.0. (No es un requerimiento fundamental si sabes programar en otro lenguage y puedas hacer declaraciones o modulos que te permitan manejar el puerto paralelo asignadole valores y variables podras desarrollarlo)

b.Puerto paralelo disponible. (no es nesesario utilizar este puerto, gracis a que utilizandon los declaraciones podras controlar el de serie el USB y el de juegos)

c.Puerto USB disponible (unicamente cuando inclulles dentro de tu proyecto una camara web)

d.Conocimientos Basicos de electronica y redes. (Herramienta para desarrollar tu circuito)

e.Mucho tiempo disponible

1.1.2. Pasos:

Antes de comenzar a programar tendras que empezar por hacer la lista de lo que quieres que tu casa haga, por ejemplo: si tu quieres que tu PC controle la temperatura, prender las luces, controlar el bienestar de tus plantas, darle seguridad a tu vivienda etc.. despues de esto tendras que comezar al pleneacion de tu circuito para esto te aconcejo untilazar un programa el cual te permite probar tus circuitos y es muy facil de manejar es un freeware y lo pogras descargar haciendo clik  [http://www.microcode.com/downloads/files/cmstudnt.exe Aqui] ,existen diferentes clases de circuitos (estos unicamente nos sirven para la salida de datos de 8bits de puerto):

1.1.2.1. optoacolados: estos circuitos son muy confiables gracias a que te permiten el aislamiento total de tu PC del circuito externo, para este circuito utilizaras optoacopladores de las siguientes referencias 4N26 o 4N27  que son de tipo Darlington(permiten manejar voltages superiores a los 5 voltios y 1 amperio de potencia sin sufrir daños, no es estrictamente nesesario utilizarlos gracis a que existen muchas clases de optoacopladores, con caracteristicas similares),si trabajas con:

1.1.2.1.1.Relays tendras que anexar a tu circuito trancistores darlington para apliar la potencia del optoacoplador y hacer funcionar el relay.

1.1.2.1.2.Triacs  tendras que anexar una serie de resistencias y transistores para activar el triac. ver siguiente imagen.

1.1.2.2. Con circuitos Integrados: el circuito integrado te permite reducir algunos costos pero no estan seguro como lo es con los optoacopladore, estos tranen una serie de trancistores, diodos y otros incorporados y hacen muchas cosas, tienes que utilizar el circuito integrado ULN2803  el cual esta conformado por transistores darlington, tendras que utilizar 2 condensadores no polarizados de 1uf y un regulador de potencia 7812, este circuito trabaja con relay de 5 o 12v y es mas sencillo de hacer. aunque no lo aconsejo.

Para la entrada tendra dsipones de 3 bits los tendras que saber utilizar porque como puedes ver son muy pocos, tendras que hacer lo siguente:

1.1.3.1.Con swich directos: esta es la forma ams sencilla de manejar la entrada po el puerto paralelo gracias a que tendras que contactar unicamente cualquiera de los pines siguientes a los de salida y unirlos con los siguientes al 25 o el 25.

1.1.3.2.Con circuito integrado: esta es una forma mas compleja, te recomiendo mirar el siguiente diagrama de circuito,este trabajan con el integrado 4069, con el 74HC245, tendras que anexar un controlador de potencia 7805 y 1 condensador de un 1uf.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called JUANCHO. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name JUANCHO~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Se puede trabjar de diferentes maneras, uno de los puntos que mas a gradan en la domotica es la versatilidad de la domotica, la pueden trabajar con ayuda de tu PC, o tambien con ayuda de un control remoto que mediante un circuito te permite programar tu casa como anteriormente se menciono, tambien con progrmaciones estandar que son las meno versatiles gracias a que no te permiten muchas posibilidades y modificarlas te cuestan una gran suma de dinero.

1. con ayuda de tu PC.

Esta forma es muy versatil gracias a que te permite tener un sin numero de posibilidades, y gracias al avance continuo de las computadoras pudes tener diferentes opcines de configuracion de el comportamiento de tu casa; por ejemplo, puedes desarrollar en diferentes lenguajes de programacion diferentes interfaces, los cuales te permiten facilitar, complemetar y adaptar el software a las necesidades personales. Tambien pudes manejar desde tu PC los diferentes puertos bidirecccionales (paralelo, serie, juegos) y complementar la funcionalidad de tu casa.

1.1. Como Dijitalizar tu casa (Consejos)

1.1.1. Requerimientos:

a.Visual Basic 6.0. (No es un requerimiento fundamental si sabes programar en otro lenguage y puedas hacer declaraciones o modulos que te permitan manejar el puerto paralelo asignadole valores y variables podras desarrollarlo)

b.Puerto paralelo disponible. (no es nesesario utilizar este puerto, gracis a que utilizandon los declaraciones podras controlar el de serie el USB y el de juegos)

c.Puerto USB disponible (unicamente cuando inclulles dentro de tu proyecto una camara web)

d.Conocimientos Basicos de electronica y redes. (Herramienta para desarrollar tu circuito)

e.Mucho tiempo disponible

1.1.2. Pasos:

Antes de comenzar a programar tendras que empezar por hacer la lista de lo que quieres que tu casa haga, por ejemplo: si tu quieres que tu PC controle la temperatura, prender las luces, controlar el bienestar de tus plantas, darle seguridad a tu vivienda etc.. despues de esto tendras que comezar al pleneacion de tu circuito para esto te aconcejo untilazar un programa el cual te permite probar tus circuitos y es muy facil de manejar es un freeware y lo pogras descargar haciendo clik  [http://www.microcode.com/downloads/files/cmstudnt.exe Aqui] ,existen diferentes clases de circuitos (estos unicamente nos sirven para la salida de datos de 8bits de puerto):

1.1.2.1. optoacolados: estos circuitos son muy confiables gracias a que te permiten el aislamiento total de tu PC del circuito externo, para este circuito utilizaras optoacopladores de las siguientes referencias 4N26 o 4N27  que son de tipo Darlington(permiten manejar voltages superiores a los 5 voltios y 1 amperio de potencia sin sufrir daños, no es estrictamente nesesario utilizarlos gracis a que existen muchas clases de optoacopladores, con caracteristicas similares),si trabajas con:

1.1.2.1.1.Relays tendras que anexar a tu circuito trancistores darlington para apliar la potencia del optoacoplador y hacer funcionar el relay.

1.1.2.1.2.Triacs  tendras que anexar una serie de resistencias y transistores para activar el triac. ver siguiente imagen.

1.1.2.2. Con circuitos Integrados: el circuito integrado te permite reducir algunos costos pero no estan seguro como lo es con los optoacopladore, estos tranen una serie de trancistores, diodos y otros incorporados y hacen muchas cosas, tienes que utilizar el circuito integrado ULN2803  el cual esta conformado por transistores darlington, tendras que utilizar 2 condensadores no polarizados de 1uf y un regulador de potencia 7812, este circuito trabaja con relay de 5 o 12v y es mas sencillo de hacer. aunque no lo aconsejo.

Para la entrada tendra dsipones de 3 bits los tendras que saber utilizar porque como puedes ver son muy pocos, tendras que hacer lo siguente:

1.1.3.1.Con swich directos: esta es la forma ams sencilla de manejar la entrada po el puerto paralelo gracias a que tendras que contactar unicamente cualquiera de los pines siguientes a los de salida y unirlos con los siguientes al 25 o el 25.

1.1.3.2.Con circuito integrado: esta es una forma mas compleja, te recomiendo mirar el siguiente diagrama de circuito,este trabajan con el integrado 4069, con el 74HC245, tendras que anexar un controlador de potencia 7805 y 1 condensador de un 1uf.</text>

can send reply at ranjan_shivek@yahoo.com

Here you can see the exhaust velocity for 1 cycle. The red line shows speed at the port and the blue shows the speed at the end of the pipe. Note that the speed is greater at the end of the pipe.
As torque rises, so too does temperature,pressure and volume. Therefore the speeds will rise corrispondingly.

== &quot;Manual transmission&quot; section is very poor ==

The section on how to drive a manual transmission contains many factual errors, some in direct contradiction of statements in the better article entitled Transwiki:Manual transmission driving technique.  

There's no logical connection between selecting the gear in which to leave the engine (from the best two available choices, first and reverse) when parked based on whether one is parking on an uphill or downhill slope; it's always better to leave the car in the gear that has the lower gear ratio.

Also, the &quot;aim&quot; of driving is not always to maximize fuel efficiency.  There are situations when other considerations obtain, including the case where one wants to maximize acceleration.  So it is not always best to upshift quickly (i.e., at low RPMs).

The section called &quot;Fuel Efficiency&quot; contains the very dangerous procedure of shutting the engine off while the car is in motion. Suggest editing to remove.</text>

==About Firefox==
'''Mozilla Firefox''' (originally known as &quot;Phoenix&quot; and briefly as &quot;Mozilla Firebird&quot;) is a free, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and hundreds of volunteers. Its current release is Firefox 35.1, released in January 26, 2015. It's ESR(Extended Support Release) latest build is ESR 31.4 , released on January 13 2015. 

Firefox strives to be a lightweight, fast, intuitive, and highly extensible standalone browser. Firefox has now become the foundation's main development focus. Firefox includes an integrated pop-up blocker, tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, built in Phishing protection, support for open standards, an extension mechanism for adding functionality and localization for Firefox in different languages. Firefox also attempts to produce secure software and fix security holes promptly. Although other browsers have introduced these features, Firefox is the first such browser to achieve wide adoption.

Firefox has attracted attention as an alternative to other browsers such as Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer/Adding User Styles|Internet Explorer]]. Currently , Firefox is the 3rd most popular browser in the world. Since its release, Firefox has significantly reduced Internet Explorer's dominant usage share.

==History of Firefox==
Before its 1.0 release on November 9, 2004, Firefox had already gained acclaim from numerous media outlets, including Forbes and the Wall Street Journal. With over 25 million downloads in the 99 days after its release, Firefox became one of the most downloaded free and open source applications, especially among home users. On October 19, 2005, Firefox had its 100 millionth download, just 344 days after the release of version 1.0. By January 31, 2009 Firefox had been downloaded 1 billion times.

Firefox has become the foundation's main development focus (along with its Thunderbird email client), and has replaced the Mozilla Suite as their official main software release.

Blake Ross began working on the Firefox project as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project. They believed that the commercial requirements of Netscape's sponsorship and developer-driven feature creep compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser. To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a pared-down browser (then known as Phoenix, today known as Firefox), with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite. Ben Goodger currently works as the lead developer of Firefox.

Mozilla Firefox retains the cross-platform nature of the original Mozilla browser by using the XUL user interface markup language. Through Firefox's support of XUL, users may extend their browser's capabilities by applying themes and extensions. Initially, these add-ons raised security concerns, so with the release of Firefox 0.9, the Mozilla Foundation opened Mozilla Update, a website containing themes and extensions &quot;approved&quot; as not harmful.

===Standards===
Support for software standards

The Mozilla Foundation takes pride in Firefox's compliance with existing standards, especially W3C web standards. Firefox has extensive support for most basic standards including HTML, XML, XHTML, CSS, ECMAScript (JavaScript), DOM, MathML, SVG, DTD, XSL and XPath.

Firefox also supports [[w:PNG|PNG]] images and variable transparency.

Mozilla contributors constantly improve Firefox's support for existing standards. Firefox has already implemented most of CSS Level 2 and some of the not-yet-completed CSS Level 3 standard. Also, work continues on implementing standards currently missing, including APNG and XForms. Some of the Mozilla standards like XBL is also making its way to open standards (via WHATWG).

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Comics. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Comics~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Vision of the Semantic Web ==
 

&quot;''The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.''&quot;
- Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler, Ora Lassila (2001) 

According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Web can reach its full potential only if it becomes a place where data can be shared, processed, and understood by automated tools as well as by people. For the Web to scale, tomorrow's programs must be able to share, process, and understand data even when these programs have been designed independently from one another. 

Still in its definition stage, the term Semantic Web is perhaps new to many people, even to those within IT circles. But the problems it aims to address are ones we have been struggling to solve for decades – issues such as information overload, stovepipe systems, and poor content aggregation (Daconta, Orbst, and Smith, 2003). The fundamental roots of these problems are the lack of semantic definitions in individual systems, the lack of semantic integration among data sets, and the lack of semantic interoperability across disparate systems. The Semantic Web extends beyond the capabilities of the current Web and existing information technologies, enabling more effective collaborations and smarter decision-making. It is an aggregation of intelligent websites and data stores accessible by an array of semantic technologies, conceptual frameworks, and well-understood contracts of interaction to allow machines to do more of the work to respond to service requests – whether that be taking on rote search processes, providing better information relevance and confidence, or performing intelligent reasoning or brokering.

The steps to reach this state, however, are not likely to be accomplished in a few short years. Certainly, rapid progress will be made on some ends, just as numerous websites appeared soon after the introduction of low-cost/no-cost web servers and free graphical browsers. But the progression in the development of websites moved relatively chaotically over the course of a half-dozen years – starting from an ad hoc set of scripting languages, low-end tools, and custom-built server components, and steadily progressing to a relatively unified set of core languages, application servers, content management systems, e-commerce engines, web services, and other enterprise-worthy components and offerings. The growth of the Semantic Web is likely to go through a similar progression in market dynamics. Although the business models of a connected world are better understood and the level of awareness of emerging web technologies more greatly heightened, there will nevertheless be a significant time lag until many of the pieces of the vision are assembled.

== What the Semantic Web Is and Is Not ==


'''1.	The Semantic Web is not a new and distinct set of websites.'''

The Semantic Web is an extension of the current World Wide Web, not a separate set of new and distinct websites. It builds on the current World Wide Web constructs and topology, but adds further capabilities by defining machine-processable data and relationship standards along with richer semantic associations. Existing sites may use these constructs to describe information within web pages in ways more readily accessible by outside processes such as search engines, spider searching technology, and parsing scripts. Additionally, new data stores, including many databases, can be exposed and made available to machine processing that can do the heavy lifting to federate queries and consolidate results across multiple forms of syntax, structure, and semantics. The protocols underlying the Semantic Web are meant to be transparent to existing technologies that support the current World Wide Web.	

'''2.	The Semantic Web is not being constructed with just human accessibility in mind.'''

The current Web relies mainly on text markup and data link protocols for structuring and interconnecting information at a very coarse level. The protocols are used primarily to describe and link documents in the forms presentable for human consumption (but that have useful hooks for first-order machine searching and aggregation). Semantic Web protocols define and connect information at a much more refined level. Meanings are expressed in formats understood and processed more easily by machines in ways that can bridge structural and semantic differences within data stores. This abstraction and increased accessibility means that current web capabilities can be augmented and extended – and new, powerful ones introduced.

'''3.	The Semantic Web is not built upon radical untested information theories.'''

The emergence of the Semantic Web is a natural progression in accredited information theories, borrowing concepts from the knowledge representation and knowledge management worlds as well as from revised thinking within the World Wide Web community. The newly approved protocols have lineages that go back many years and embody the ideas of a great number of skilled practitioners in computer languages, information theory, database management, model-based design approaches, and logics. These concepts have been proven within a number of real-world situations although the unifying set of standards from the W3C promises to accelerate and broaden adoption within the enterprise and on the Web.
With respect to issues about knowledge representation and its yet-to-be-fulfilled promise, a look at history shows numerous examples of a unifying standard providing critical momentum for acceptance of a concept. HTML was derived from SGML, an only mildly popular text markup language, and yet HTML went on to cause a sea change in the use of information technology. Many in the field point to the long acceptance timeframes for both object-oriented programming and conceptual-to-physical programming models. According to Ralph Hodgson, “knowledge representation is a fundamental discipline that now has an infrastructure and a set of supporting standards to move it out of the labs and into real-world use.” 

'''4. The Semantic Web is not a drastic departure from current data modeling concepts.''' 

According to Tim Berners-Lee, the Semantic Web data model is analogous to the relational database model. “A relational database consists of tables, which consist of rows, or records. Each record consists of a set of fields. The record is nothing but the content of its fields, just as an RDF node is nothing but the connections: the property values. The mapping is very direct – a record is an RDF node; the field (column) name is RDF propertyType; and the record field (table cell) is a value. Indeed, one of the main driving forces for the Semantic Web has always been the expression, on the Web, of the vast amount of relational database information in a way that can be processed by machines.&quot; (Berners-Lees, 1998) That said, the Semantic Web is a much more expressive, comprehensive, and powerful form of data modeling. It builds on traditional data modeling techniques – be they entity-relation modeling or another form – and transforms them into much more powerful ways for expressing rich relationships in a more thoroughly understandable manner.

'''5.	The Semantic Web is not some magical piece of artificial intelligence'''

The concept of machine-understandable documents does not imply some form of magical artificial intelligence that allows machines to comprehend human mumblings. It only indicates a machine's ability to solve a well-defined problem by performing well-defined operations on existing well-defined data (Berners-Lee, Handler, and Lassila, 2001). Current search engines perform capabilities that would have been magical 20 years ago, but that we recognize now as being the result of IP protocols, HTML, the concept of websites, web pages, links, graphical browsers, innovative search and ranking algorithms, and, of course, a large number of incredibly fast servers and equally large and fast disk storage arrays. Semantic Web capabilities will likewise be the result of a logical series of interconnected progressions in information technology and knowledge representation formed around a common base of standards and approaches.

'''6.	The Semantic Web is not an existing entity, ready for users to make use of it.'''

The Semantic Web currently exists as a vision, albeit a promising and captivating one. Similar to the current Web, the Semantic Web will be formed through a combination of open standard and proprietary protocols, frameworks, technologies, and services. The W3C-approved standards – XML, RDF, and OWL – form the base protocols. New data schemas and contract mechanisms, built using these new protocols, will arise around communities of interest, industry, and intent; some will be designed carefully by experienced data architects and formally recognized by established standards bodies; others will appear from out of nowhere and gain widespread acceptance overnight. A host of new technologies and services will appear such as semantically-aware content publishing tools; context modeling tools; mediation, inference, and reputing engines; data-cleansing and thesaurus services; and new authentication and verification components. Although various elements of the vision already exist, rollout of these technologies, coordination amidst competitive forces, and fulfillment of the vision will take many years.

== Benefits ==

While the full vision of the Semantic Web may be a bit distant, there are, on the near horizon, capabilities that many think will make enterprise software more connectable, interoperable, and adaptable as well as significantly cheaper to maintain. The use of semantic approaches in combination with the existing and emerging semantics-based schemas and tools can bring immediate and/or near-term benefits to many corporate enterprise and government agency IT initiatives.

Semantic interoperability, for example, represents a more limited or constrained subset of the vision of the Semantic Web. Significant returns, however, can still be gained by using semantic-based tools to arbitrate and mediate the structures, meanings, and contexts within relatively confined and well-understood domains for specific goals related to information sharing and information interoperability. In other words, semantic interoperability addresses a more discrete problem set with more clearly defined endpoints (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004).
Semantic technologies can also provide a loosely connected overlay on top of existing Web service and XML frameworks, which in turn can offer greater adaptive capabilities than those currently available. They can also make immediate inroads in helping with service discovery and reconciliation, as well as negotiation of requests and responses across different vocabularies. Considering the depth and difficulty of issues the federal, state, and local agencies have in these regards, semantic technologies may provide the first flexible, open, and comprehensive means to solve them.

Semantic computing is an emerging discipline being formed and shaped as this is written. As such, there are many definitions and interpretations, and even a few low-intensity philosophical wars being waged among thought-leaders and practitioners. That said, the release of RDF and OWL as W3C Recommendations earlier in the year has created a greater commonality in expression.

Because semantic computing makes use of various forms of abstraction and logical expression, it can be difficult to see how the languages provide many of the powerful capabilities expressed in earlier sections. But just as the Internet and World Wide Web are built upon layers of protocols and technologies, so too is the Semantic Web. Understanding several key concepts and becoming familiar with the core building blocks of the Semantic Web will form a basis for visualizing how higher order tools, components, and technologies can deliver on the promise of richer and more flexible machine-processable data. Understanding some of the foundational concepts will also allow readers to better understand the state of the technologies and the areas that still need to be refined in order to reach the full vision of the Semantic Web.


Semantic technologies differ from database schemas, data dictionaries, and controlled vocabularies in an important way: They have been designed with the connectivity in mind allowing different conceptual domains to work together as a network.

== Languages ==

'''1. XML (eXtensible Markup Language)'''

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and is a standard way of describing, transporting, and exchanging data that was pioneered by the W3C in the late 1990s. XML serves as a mechanism for marking up data through the use of customized &quot;tags&quot; in such a way as to describe the data. XML is not necessarily related to HTML and, in fact, the two were designed for entirely different purposes. Despite this fact, the two can complement each other in various ways, depending on a user's needs. 

The tags are typically the labels for the data such as “FirstName” or “StreetAddress.” When trying to use XML to define a standard interchange format, it is important to have agreement on the tags. For example, two book suppliers might wish to formalize a partnership involving data exchange. Specifying at the outset that Supplier A’s definition of “Author” is identical to Supplier B’s definition of “Writer” and codifying that in the XML structure would be an essential part of formulating proper data agreement. Additional terms that overlap and have the same meaning would also need to be formally identified, usually in something called a DTD or XML Schema. (XML Schema is a mechanism for defining XML documents in a formal way, thereby ensuring the accurate exchange of information.) 

Examples of XML Schemas in working use can be found in many government and industry registries.  According to the U.S. CIO Council XML Working Group, “The full benefits of XML will be achieved only if organizations use the same data element definitions and those definitions are available for partners to discover and retrieve. A registry/repository is a means to discover and retrieve documents, templates, and software (i.e., objects and resources) over the Internet. The registry is used to discover the object. It provides information about the object, including its location. A repository is where the object resides for retrieval by users.” 

In the context of semantics and the Semantic Web effort, XML is a set of syntax rules for creating semantically rich markup languages in particular domains. XML allows users to add arbitrary structure to their documents but says nothing about what the structures mean (Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila, 2001). In other words, whereas IT systems, databases, and content management systems have become good at describing things, they have not done so well at describing associations. More concrete and faithful descriptions that provide better senses of words, terms, and domains are needed. 

'''2. RDF (Resource Description Framework)'''

RDF stands for Resource Description Framework and has been specifically designed to provide this associative information. RDF offers ways to make data richer and more flexible, and therefore able to exist in environments outside those explicitly defined by system programmers and data modelers. RDF encodes information in sets of triples, each triple being rather like the subject, verb, and object of an elementary sentence. (This same model can also represent resource, property, and value constructs.) RDF provides an infrastructure for linking distributed metadata and also serves in conjunction with OWL as a core language for describing and representing ontologies. 

One of the primary benefits of using RDF to describe data associations is the scalability and flexibility it provides. Explicit database tables can be created that do much the same thing but the unique nature of RDF provides a flexible mechanism that allows far greater associative capabilities, thereby increasing the ability to query and make inferences on topic matters not explicitly hard-wired into tables. The benefits only increase when trying to integrate new data sources, especially when they have different structures or semantics or, more importantly, when they cross conceptual domains (as in the case of environmental and public health data or, alternatively, law enforcement and intelligence data). 
RDF triples are serialized in XML, providing a way to describe relationships between data elements using XML tags or other syntax in a format that can be easily processed by machines. In an effort to support a loosely coupled and/or virtual architecture, a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is used to identify each of the triple elements. The purpose of a URI is to uniquely identify a concept in the form of subject, verb, or object by linking to the origin where the concept is defined.

RDF Schema (sometimes written as RDFS or RDF-S) offers a way of semantically describing and extending RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships among these resources. RDF Schema does the same thing for RDF that DTD and XML Schema do for XML.
A number of query languages for RDF have been developed within academic and industry circles. In October 2004, the W3C RDF Data Access Working Group released a draft specification for SPARQL (pronounced &quot;sparkle&quot;), a query language for RDF that seeks to unify the way developers and end users write, and to consume RDF search results across a wide range of information. 

'''3. OWL (Web Ontology Language)'''

OWL stands for Web Ontology Language. (The acronym is purposely transposed from the actual name – OWL instead of WOL – as a conscious link to the name of the owl in the book Winnie the Pooh.) Whereas RDF's primary value can be seen in enabling association and integration of distributed data, OWL's main value is in enabling reasoning over distributed data. 

OWL is a highly expressive modeling language that is compatible with existing data stores and modeling constructs including XML, Rational, and object-oriented approaches. OWL also provides loosely-coupled “views” of data which makes federated knowledge bases easy to build and evolve. Most importantly, OWL has machine-actionable semantics. Run-time and design-time software tools can do “things” with models, data, metadata, rules, and logic without human assistance or highly specific application code. (Pollock, 2004) 

OWL is derived from a number of efforts to develop a set of flexible and computational logic constructs, many of which go back many years. It is the next generation of the ontology language called DAML+OIL, which in turn integrated two efforts, DAML, the DARPA Markup Language, an effort that was based in the United States, and OIL, the Ontology Inference Layer (or Language), an effort that was based in Europe. It also has roots in SHOE (Simple HTML Ontology Extensions), an effort led by James Hendler at the University of Maryland, created specifically for incorporating machine-readable knowledge into web documents thereby facilitating intelligent agent capabilities. There are three levels of OWL defined (OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full) each having progressively more expressiveness and inferencing power. These levels were created to make it easier for tool vendors to support a specified level of OWL.RDF and OWL can operate together or separately. In some cases, supporting the distributed nature of data may be the primary objective, in which case only RDF may be used. In other cases, distribution plus reasoning capabilities may be desired, and so both RDF and OWL may be featured. In other instances, just reasoning capabilities are desired, and so OWL may suffice.

'''4. Other Language Development Efforts'''

Other languages are currently being developed to address additional layers within the Semantic Web vision. For example, a Rule language will provide the capability to express certain logical relationships in a form suitable for machine processing. This language will allow the expression of business rules and will provide greater reasoning and inference capabilities. RuleML was initially proffered as a rule language, although efforts to formalize the Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL) are currently underway at W3C. A Logic language will conceivably provide a universal mechanism for expressing monotonic logic and validating proofs. A long-term hope is to eventually make use of assertions from around the Web to derive new knowledge. (The problem here is that deduction systems are not terribly interoperable. Rather than designing a single overarching reasoning system, current activities are focused on specifying a universal language for representing proofs. Systems can then digitally sign and export these proofs for other systems to use and incorporate.)

Likewise, constructs, schemas, and architectures for inferring reputation and trust are also being developed, both within the W3C and by the larger web community. These approaches are being looked at not just to infer reputation and trust by and among individuals, but also of groups of people (such as companies, media sources, non-government organizations, and political movements), inanimate objects (such as books, movies, music, academic papers, and consumer products), and even ideas (such as belief systems, political ideas, and policy proposals). (Masum and Zhang, 2004)
One challenge faced by practitioners in the field is to create frameworks and languages with sufficient expressiveness to capture the knowledge that can be described in ambiguous human languages. At issue is how to create languages, tools, and systems that will support the easy expression of simple things, while making it possible to express complex things. Another challenge is to maintain compatibility with existing syntax standards such as HTML, XML, and RDF while dealing with issues pertaining to the readability and human accessibility of the syntax. Ultimately, better tools will be developed that will minimize these issues but in the meantime complexities within some of the higher order languages may make it more difficult to develop fully compliant implementations using current editing and modeling tools.

== Semantic Tools and Components ==
 
''''&quot;Semantic Web tools are getting better every day. New companies are starting to form. Big companies are starting to move.&quot;''''

-James Hendler 

Several models exist that describe the lifecycle or stages of maturity that technologies go through. Typically these have four stages: entry (or definition), growth (or validation), maturity (or refinement), and decline (or consolidation). By most measures, the Semantic Web, as experienced in a publicly available format, is still in the entry/definition phase. Many of the semantic technologies, however, are well into the growth/validation phase. (The shift into maturity is often elusive; the tipping point being visible only after the fact, and at times passing through a period of hype and unmet expectations.)

Leaders in technology applications across government and private industry have been forging new paths and obtaining successful results from their semantic implementation projects. There are semantic research projects in a number of federal agencies. Semantic products are available from large and established companies such as Adobe, Hewlett Packard, and IBM, as well as from many small pioneering companies such as Unicorn, Network Inference, and Semagix. In addition, there are a number of open source and publicly available tools created by public and private research institutions and organizations.

What follows is a brief survey of commercial and open source tools that can be used to create applications powered by semantic technologies. One way to understand how these tools work together is to view them as either design-time tools or run-time tools. Design-time tools are used by document authors, system designers, and others as part of the creation, design, or authoring process. Examples include tools to create metadata or to create or populate ontologies. Other software components are used as run-time components to process queries, transform data, or otherwise produce operational results. Examples include mediation servers and inference engines. Many of the tools are used as a set within an implementation process – for example, modeling and mapping tools during design-time in partnership with query facilities and mediation servers at run-time.

'''Metadata Publishing and Management Tools'''

The process for creating metadata about a document or data item can occur when that item is created or authored, when it is imported into a content management system or a website, or when it is viewed or read by users. It can also be added by some other explicit or implicit action at any point over the course of the existence of that data item. In other words, metadata creation is not just a one-time occurrence. Metadata can continue to accummulate and can be modified at any time by conceivably any number of people.

At content creation, authors typically connect information such as the subject, creator, location, language, and copyright status with a particular document. This information makes the document much more searchable. RSS consists essentially of this type of information, providing newsreading applications with significantly expanded capabilities for searching and filtering information. Moveable Type from a company called SixApart is one of the more popular tools in the blogging community for creating RSS-compliant documents. The increasing popularity and simplicity of RSS is causing its use to extend outside of the blogging community into the general media and even into the enterprise. Other vendors of desktop and web-authoring tools are also moving quickly to provide RSS publishing capabilities.

The creation of metadata is only one step in the process. Metadata management tools are needed in order to maintain metadata vocabularies, perform metadata-driven queries, and provide visualization tools for monitoring changes in areas of interest. An example of a website that uses metadata as a key aspect of creating a collaborative and shared system of data is Flickr, a site for people to easily upload and share digital photos. What sets it apart from other digital photos services is that it provides photo-tagging capabilities as well as an innovative interface for viewing the categories of photos. (The tags are contained in a map and vary in size depending on the frequency of the tag within the data store.) What distinguishes it from earlier metadata implementations is that the feedback loop is extremely tight, meaning that the assignment of tags is bound closely to their use. As soon as photos and sets of photos are tagged, users see clusters of items carrying the same tag. Users can easily change tags to refine the clusters. 
In terms of tools for querying metadata, the components are not much different than current search engines, although the inclusion of metadata makes for richer data and therefore more precise and relevant searches. Query scripts and languages will likely adapt to allow users more precision although the balance between simplicity and features is constantly in flux, especially in more publicly available search engines. As with the Flickr example above, however, new visualization tools are being developed to help users navigate through complex fields of related data. 

'''Modeling Tools (Ontology creation and modification)'''

Modeling tools are used to create and modify ontologies. Knowledge modelers used them to create and edit class structures and model domains.  The tools often have an interface that is similar to a file system directory structure or bookmark folder interface. They also tend to offer the ability to import, transform, and re-purpose, in whole or in part, existing ontological structures that are often in the form of database schemas, product catalogues, and yellow pages listings. Other prominent feature includes advanced mechanisms for organizing, matching, and associating similar terms and concepts. 

Also, because it is a common practice for modelers to create smaller interconnected ontologies instead of a single large monolithic model – primarily for better reusability and ease of use – support for splitting, merging, and connecting models can be an important capability in the ontology editor. Some editors even support collaborative work methods and rich visualization and graphical interaction modes.
Protégé-2000 is a free ontology editor from Stanford University with a large and active user community. It features an open architecture that allows independent developers to write plug-ins that can significantly extend Protégé capabilities. Commercial modeling tools are available from a number of vendors including Network Inference, Language and Computing, and Intelligent Views. 
IBM’s Ontology Management System (also known as SNOBASE, for Semantic Network Ontology Base) is a framework for loading ontologies from files and via the Internet and for locally creating, modifying, querying, and storing ontologies. Internally, SNOBASE uses an inference engine, an ontology persistent store, an ontology directory, and ontology source connectors. Applications can query against the created ontology models and the inference engine deduces the answers and returns results sets similar to JDBC (Java Data Base Connectivity) result sets. As of the time of publication of this paper, SNOBASE is not, however, compatible with OWL. The Sigma ontology development and reasoning system is also a fully formed design and run-time ontology management system. It can be freely licensed although it, like SNOBASE, is not compliant with OWL.

'''Ontologies'''

Arriving at the right ontology is often a critical element of successful implementation of semantics-based projects. Even more so than database design, ontology creation is a highly specialized field. Not only are there not as yet a sizeable number of skilled practitioners, it can take considerable time to arrive at an ontology that successfully captures a conceptual domain. As a result, it is important to look at existing bodies of work that can be used (and reused) in lieu of having to create something from scratch. Likely sources of existing ontologies can typically be located in close association with ontology modeling tools, several of which are named above. Use of proprietary ontologies may be contingent upon licensing of the modeling tools, a practice which is not unreasonable considering the efforts expended to develop the ontologies. Other ontologies, however, may be open and free for use for commercial and non-commercial purposes, much in the vein of Linux, JBoss, Wikipedia, Musicbrainz, and other open source software and data repositories. 

Current ontology development efforts vary in scope and size. Some ontologies have been developed specifically in answer to localized implementations such as reconciling charts of accounts or health care records, areas where the emphasis is primarily on information interoperability – arbitrating between syntaxes, structures, and semantics – and less on logic programming. Other ontology development efforts take a more top-down approach under the assumption that a shared view of a wide knowledge domain is critical to widespread proliferation of adaptive computing and intelligent reasoning capabilities. There is significant advocacy in these latter circles on the establishment of an enterprise-wide common upper ontology under the belief that it will provide the foundation for any number of domain ontologies. New domain ontologies could be extensions of, and fully compliant with, this upper ontology. Existing ontologies and legacy data models could be mapped to this upper ontology, which theoretically would constitute a significant number of the steps toward achieving greater semantic interoperability across domains. (It should be noted, however, that additional development and engineering is still needed to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this approach.)

Several candidate upper ontologies now exist, including DOLCE (Gangemi, et al., 2002), Upper Cyc (Lenat, 1995), and SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001), but none of these as yet has gained significant market adoption. Proponents of this upper ontology approach believe that were the U.S. Department of Defense and/or the Federal Government to adopt one of these candidates, there is a good chance industry would follow, after which the US could then propose it as a standard to the International Standards Organization. 

Even where domain-specific ontologies do not exist, it is possible to jumpstart development by making use of existing taxonomies, XML standards, or other lower order data models. At the federal level, the Knowledge Management working group (http://km.gov) has made significant progress in sharing information about taxonomy projects across agencies. XML.Gov (http://xml.gov) has a mission to facilitate efficient and effective use of XML across agencies in order that seamless sharing of documents and data can be achieved. Many government agencies have existing taxonomies, or have begun to develop taxonomies for their information domains. JusticeXML, for example, is an impressive body of work that could be extended and enhanced by RDF and OWL to provide a more flexible data model, an effort that could pave the way for far easier access to federal, state, and local law enforcement information by other agencies.

'''Mapping Tools (Ontology population)'''

Once an ontology model is created, it needs to be populated with data (referred to as class instances in “ontology speak”). This process is usually accomplished by linking various data sources to the concepts in an ontology using a mapping tool. Once “maps” have been created, a query in one data source could be transformed by its map to the ontology and then from the ontology to the other data sources using their maps. The corresponding data could then be returned in the same manner without any of the data stores knowing or caring about the others. In other words, each data source may have a unique “map” to an overarching ontology that acts as a pivot table among the various sources and targets. Providing this abstraction layer requires some effort on the part of creating the ontology and then creating the data maps, but once this has been done each data source can interoperate with other data sources strictly within run-time processes. Bringing new data sources onboard will, in most cases, have little or no effect on existing data sources.

This process drastically reduces the amount of data value mapping and semantic conflict resolution that typically takes place using current enterprise application approaches – approaches that up to now typically require n-squared mappings (mapping from and to each and every data source) or alternatively, exporting to hard-coded, inflexible, and explicit standards. The modeling and mapping process makes the process far less political and far more flexible and adaptable. Anomalies specific to a single data source, for example, can be handled almost transparently, whereas addressing such anomalies within the typical standards process would entail expending significant time and energy. Most of the tools used to handle structured data forms have features that automate the process of mapping database fields to ontologies. Network Inference and Unicorn are two vendors with tools of this type. Tools that aggregate, normalize, and map unstructured data forms to ontologies typically work with a variety of unstructured data forms including Word, RTF, text files, and HTML. Semagix is a leading vendor for unstructured data.

'''Data Stores'''

Ontologies and other RDF data models can be stored in native RDF data stores or in relational databases that have been customized to support associative data techniques. Native RDF-data stores are inherently designed to support the concept of triples and can offer an efficient out-of-the-box approach to storing ontologies. RDF native databases are available from companies such as Tucana Technologies and Intellidimensions. Several high-quality open source RDF data stores also exist, including Kowari, Redland, Sesame, and 3Store. To use a relational database, the database must be designed in a somewhat non-traditional way. Instead of having a table that describes each major concept, the database design typically mimics the concept of triples by using a single table containing four columns. Three of the columns store the triple while the forth column is used to store its identification tag. (A report entitled “Mapping Semantic Web Data with RDBMSes” is an excellent resource for finding out more about implementing triple stores in relational databases.)  

Issues related to representing, storing, and querying using triples (i.e., RDF) versus traditional relational approaches, as well as the use and/or co-existence of the two types of data stores within implementations, are still working themselves out within industry and the marketplace. Each store-and-query facility provides unique capabilities that the other, at present, does not. RDF is great for situations when it is difficult to anticipate the types of queries that will be performed in the future. It is also terrific for handling metadata and for making queries that require inferences across imprecise or disparate data. For example, a query along the lines of, “How many energy producers qualify for ‘green’ status this year?” is much easier to perform using an RDF query language than in SQL (once the models have been created to tie together various data stores). At the same time, queries that are trivial in SQL, such as, “Which energy producers reduced their CO2 output the most this year?” can be quite complicated using an RDF query language.

It is important to note that RDF query languages are still evolving, which may to some extent explain this limitation. Other limitations of RDF relate to performance issues. Because queries can be broadened, for example, to include concepts instead of just terms, the search space can be dramatically increased. Because RDF data stores are relatively new and the number of implementations relatively small, system developers need to iterate over their designs, paying particular attention to queries and functions that could have negative effects on performance. In terms of industry growth, it is difficult to predict how RDF will affect the database industry. RDF data stores may remain a distinct data storage category in their own right or their capabilities may be subsumed into relational databases in a manner similar to what happened with object-oriented databases.

'''Mediation Engines'''

Mediation engines are automated tools that can dynamically transform data among different syntaxes, structures, and semantics using models instead of hard-wired transformation code. They are critical components of any interoperability architecture. Using data maps, ontologies, and other forms of conceptual models, mediation engines are run-time processes that provide an abstraction layer between heterogeneous data sets, allowing organizations to essentially agree to disagree about how data and information should be represented. Mediation engines typically work with highly structured data. Unstructured and semi-structured data must first be bound to a schema prior to creating the mediation maps (Pollock, 2004). 

'''Inference Engines'''

Inference engines (sometimes referred to as reasoners) are software tools that derive new facts or associations from existing information. It is often said that an inference engine emulates the human capability to arrive at a conclusion by reasoning. In reality, inferencing is not some mythical artificial intelligence capability but, rather, a quite common approach in data processing. One can think of a complex data mining exercise as a form of inferencing. By creating a model of the information and relationships, we enable reasoners to draw logical conclusions based on the model. A common example of an inference is to use models of people and their connections to other people to gain new knowledge. Exploration of these network graphs can enable inferences about relationships that may not have been explicitly defined.
Note that with just RDF and OWL, inferences are limited to the associations represented in the models, which primarily means inferring transitive relationships. With the addition of rule and logic languages, however, greater leaps in conceptual understandings, learning, and adaptation can take place, although implementations with these types of capabilities are, as yet, few and far between. 
Both free and commercial versions of inference engines are available. For example, Jena, an open source Java framework for writing Semantic Web applications developed by HP Labs, has a reasoner subsystem. Jena reasoner includes a generic rule based inference engine together with configured rule sets for RDFS and for the OWL-Lite subset of OWL Full. JESS is a popular OWL inference engine from Carnegie Melon University. Network Inference offers a commercial reasoner based on description logic (OWL-DL).

'''Other Components'''

Ordinary web pages are a good source of instance information; many tools for populating ontologies are based on annotation of web pages. W3C Annotea project offers free annotation tools. Commercial vendors include Ontoprise and Lockheed-Martin. Several software vendors, including Semagix, Siderian Software and Entopia, offer products that use ontologies to categorize information and to provide improved search and navigation.  

'''Applications of Semantic Technologies''' 

''Semantic technologies can solve problems that, using current technologies, are unsolvable at any price.''

-Don Hall 

There are a wide variety of applications where semantic technologies can provide key benefits. At their core, semantic approaches are an infrastructure capability that, when combined with other key technologies, represent the next wave of computing. When taken with a multi-year view, there is great promise that these technologies will help the IT industry reach the ever-elusive goal of truly adaptive computing. In some respects, though, the future is already happening. Commercial enterprises and government agencies are implementing production-level programs using existing semantic data stores, ontologies, toolsets, and applications. A few of these near-term project areas include Semantic Web services, semantic interoperability, and intelligent search.

== Semantic Web Services ==

A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. A Web service has an interface described in a machine-processable format using Web Services Description Language (WSDL).  The combination of WSDL, UDDI,  and SOAP  form a triad of technologies that will shift the entire market toward service-oriented architectures (SOA). Together, these technologies provide directory, component lookup, and exchange protocol services on top of an HTTP or SMTP network protocol. 
Microsoft, IBM, and most other large software vendors have embraced the concepts and languages that underlie the Web services model, and an increasing number of books and industry articles point to the benefits of adopting a service oriented architecture. Web services, however, are not without shortcomings. Security issues have long been a concern but several solutions that address these issues have been introduced over the last several years. Perhaps the most significant improvement opportunities for Web services that remain are in the areas of 

(a) flexible look-up and discovery and 

(b) information management and schema transformation. 

Fundamentally, Web service technologies handle messages in a loosely coupled manner but they do not currently bridge differences in description terminologies nor do they inherently enable the recipient to understand a message that has been sent.  With Web services, these parts of the exchange rely on custom-coded solutions and/or widespread community agreement upon some kind of document exchange standard (the latter is rarely achieved). 

This difficulty in ensuring flexible discovery and service initiation, as well as seamless operational use of information exchanged with Web services, has led to W3C’s efforts to incorporate semantic technologies as part of its Semantic Web Services initiative. Semantic Web Services are a Web Service implementation that leverages the Web Ontology Language Service specification (OWL-S) to provide a flexible framework for describing and initiating web services. OWL-S supplies Web service providers with a core set of markup language constructs for describing the properties and capabilities of their Web Services in unambiguous, computer-interpretable form. OWL-S markup of Web services will facilitate the automation of Web service tasks, including automated Web service discovery, execution, interoperation, composition, and execution monitoring. Following the layered approach to markup language development, the current version of OWL-S builds upon W3C’s standard OWL.


== Semantic Interoperability ==

Formally put, the use of semantic technologies makes it possible to describe the logical nature and context of the information being exchanged, while allowing for maximum independence among communicating parties. The results are greater transparency and more dynamic communication among information domains irrespective of business logic, processes, and workflows (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004). 

The technical vision is one where flexible information models, not inflexible programs or code, are used to drive dynamic, self-healing, and emergent infrastructures for the sharing of mission critical data in massively scaleable environments. Recent advances in taxonomy and thesaurus technology, context modeling approaches, inferencing technology, and ontology-driven interoperability can be applied in a cohesive framework that dramatically changes the way information is managed in disperse, decentralized communities of knowledge (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004).

NASA views semantic interoperability as an extremely promising way to make information available to all stakeholders without having to standardize on a particular format or vocabulary or re-key databases to conform to a uniform model. One example where NASA is using these concepts is to address serious and ongoing maintenance problems related to the aging wiring systems within the Space Shuttle fleet. The existing set of wiring system databases contains information about part specifications, bills of materials, drawings, change orders, standard practices, test procedures, test reports, inspection reports, failure tracking and reporting information, work orders, and repair disposition documentation. Tens of diverse databases and systems – each supporting different but related aspects of engineering and design work – are in use within NASA with related data dispersed among several contracting companies that support the Space Shuttle program. Troubleshooting wiring problems requires timely access to many cross-organizational systems, databases, and knowledge repositories, the breadth of which is enormous. The situation becomes especially critical for diagnosing and troubleshooting in-flight anomalies whereby a timely resolution is mission-critical as well as life-critical.  The work to make these sets of data richer and more accessible to the numerous parties who need access to them is still in its early stages, but as highlighted in the quote at the beginning of this chapter, semantic technologies represent one of the more promising ways to address what is largely an unsolvable problem using current data integration approaches.

A highly distilled version of how such a project works is as follows. Design-time tools are used to develop RDF and OWL models that encompass a particular domain. These models could be based on existing XML standards or defined via other means. Other design-time tools can be used to flexibly map specific data representations to these models, thus eliminating the need to explicitly convert applications to adopt a certain data standard. Run-time processes can then use these models and maps as pivot tables to transform data from source to target or to perform federated queries from a single query statement. Semantic interoperability frameworks of this type can provide a solid basis for better resolving differences in syntax, structure, and semantics – ushering in a future where organizations can agree to disagree, yet still share data and interoperate without having to change their current methods of operation.

One of the key advantages of using semantic interoperability approaches is that they do not necessarily require the replacement of existing integration technologies, databases, or software applications. A semantic framework made up of various semantics-based components and application program interfaces (APIs) can be deployed with web services or traditional middleware APIs to leverage existing infrastructure investments, and yet still provide massive benefits by virtually centralizing the query, transformation, and business rules metadata that flows through the network infrastructure’s pipes. As such, the software will fit into the customer’s existing IT ecosystem with low overhead for installation, minimal coding, and maximum reusability (Pollock and Hodgson, 2004).

== Intelligent Search ==

Related in some regards to semantic interoperability is the area of intelligent search. As mentioned above, semantic interoperability techniques can allow queries native to one system to be federated to other non-native systems. This eliminates the need to convert systems to a universal query language and enables systems to continue maintaining the information they have in their current formats. By overlaying a virtual layer on top of the data sources, queries can be defined in a universal manner, thereby enabling access to all mapped assets. Federated searching can also be made smarter by making searches more semantically precise. In other words, searches can be broadened to include concepts, or narrowed to include only specific key words. The depth – or granularity – of such searches enables the specification of the search that the individual desires. 
Another aspect of intelligent search is the ability to make searches more relevant to the person searching by making use of identity and relationship information. Relationships among people and information about them can be key links to greater relevance and confidence. Despite investments in knowledge management systems, many people still rely on their personal network of friends, neighbors, co-workers, and others to locate experts or find trusted information. Personal relationships are also useful in sales situations and in many organizational interactions. Social networking schemas and software are making broad use of this.

An example of how this information can be used on a larger scale is the case of a telephone company exploring technologies for providing more intelligent phone number look-up. Instead of providing a generic list of matched names, the telecommunications company is looking at combining information about the person searching and the list of possible names, in order to provide a more intelligent match. For example, inferring relationships between social networks could provide information on whether a person is known, or could be expected to be known, to the other person (by employing friend-of-a-friend forms of calculations). Other information such as locations or schools attended or past or current jobs could be used to infer matches. To be sure, there are significant privacy issues involved; many believe, however, that techniques such as hashing and encryption  of personally identifiable information and progressive disclosure will likely resolve many privacy concerns.
Semantic approaches for enabling intelligent search are beginning to find their ways into knowledge management systems. Whereas current knowledge management systems tend to exist within their own silos and have difficultly crossing organization boundaries, intelligent search techniques can be added as overlays to existing information infrastructures, thereby bridging physical data formats, knowledge domains, and organizational structures.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called JoeEdelman. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name JoeEdelman~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It has been suggested by those outside of mainstream science that magnetite gives organisms a sort of '6th sense', with which they can predict events in the near future (for example, earthquakes and other difficult-to-predict phenomena). Clearly this is not possible if existing scientific theories of time are accepted.

A more plausible idea is that magnetite's weak magnetic field provides some information that can be processed by an organism's central nervous system.  The degree to which this information could be gathered, processed, and perceived is not established. More conservative researchers believe the magnetite acts as a tiny compass which might explain, for example, how migratory birds seem to know the difference between north and south, as exhibited by their migratory patterns.

:Welcome to Wikibooks. I hope you enjoy being around here and doing many interesting things.
:It was a good idea of yours to put ''The Golden Bough'' on Wikibooks, and I would be interested to see what interactive and graphical stuff you and others might be able to put on it.
:However, if it is just a textbook (I mean, only text) it would belong better on Wikisource. If we could interact with it and put our own views, thoughts and exercises, as well as bring more modern myths to it. I am aware that there is a lot of the developing world that has not seen this text, and may well have different opinions about the material.
-[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 03:58, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)


:I will put the text on wikisource as well. The more developed e-book will be at wikibooks
:Thanks for the advice.

== Organization of the Golden Bough ==

Hi! I had a look at your book [[The Golden Bough]]: A Study in Magic and Religion. There is some discussion about how to organize books at [[Wikibooks:Hierachy naming scheme]], and I would like to give you the following suggestion:
* tgb is not a good way to separate your book from others.
* I recommend you to use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[The Golden Bough]] for the book and [[The Golden Bough/Preface]],[[The Golden Bough/The King of the Wood]], etc. &lt;/nowiki&gt;, that is create subpages to your book using the &quot;/&quot; slash command. In this way you will automatically get a link back to your main book, if it has the same name throughout (have a look at the book [[Hamster Care]] how it is done there.)
* For successful and not so successful alternatives have a look at [[Wikibooks:Hierachy naming scheme]]. 
I know you invest a lot of time into your book. Please consider make it a lasting effort. Thanks, and good luck in the future. If you have questions or need help, just let me know. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks Andreas, that makes sense. I will read up on how to change / move to that scheme. I have only added two chapters at the moment good thing you told me now. DO you have a quick link on how to rename the initial book or move the already created chapters. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 15:34, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: If you are logged in, then you should have the &quot;move&quot; command on top of the page, with which you can rename a page. This is the best way to do things. If you don't have this command, then I can also move the pages for you, if you want. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 15:45, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: I did it for the main page [[The Golden Bough]], worked fine, will do the other pages before continuing and Ill check any pages refrencing them as well. again, thanks a lot [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 16:02, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I redid all the links, its actually easier with the naming as you suggested, like directories in DOS. Thanks again, [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 18:35, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Great! Well done. Another thing: Most of your links are displayed as &lt;nowiki&gt;==[[headings]]==&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It seems natural to do so, because you are putting headings there, but the content is somewhere else. On other Wikibooks, people struggle with other users clicking on the &quot;edit&quot; button next to those sections to edit things, some don't notice that they should click on the heading itself.
:: I therefore recommend you, to put links not into &lt;nowiki&gt;==headings==&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but use ordinary &quot;*&quot; lists for it. Also if you put all chapters between &quot;==..==&quot;, then you get a table of contents at the top of the page, which is pointless, since the same table appears below. Therefore, the cleanest thing is not to put links between &quot;==..==&quot;, but into a list. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 18:48, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::I startigng noticing that, The idea is a left over from when I wanted the whole book on one page. I do like the horizontal bar that shows up after text when they are within &quot;=..=&quot; though, is there a way of having that or of not having a TOC? [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:03, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::::: Yes, there is a way for each of these things, but I don't think you need the line under each link on a page like [[The Golden Bough/Part 1]]. Maybe you already got used to it, but with so many chapters having each of them so big and underlined looks a little bit clumsy.. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::: In fact I am doing away with the whole part sections and adding the chapter links to the [[The GOlden Bough]] page, I will keep the toc there so that people can jump to the old &quot;Part ...&quot; heading, to save would be readers a bit of time. It also will save space on the servers and further editing. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:19, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::::: Very good. This looks much better now. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I have requested that [[The Golden Bough/Part1]], [[The Golden Bough/Part 1]] [[The Golden Bough/Part 2]] and [[The Golden Bough/Part 3]] be deleted, I have moed the links to the main page. I am way happier with how it looks now. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 20:05, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I am like an idiot, I can take out the bottom lonks as well, since they are on top due to the hierarchy. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]]

:: :-) If you want even more convenience, you could use ''numbered lists'', using the &quot;#&quot; symbol instead of &quot;*&quot;, like here:
# [[The Golden Bough/The King of the Wood|The King of the Wood]]
# [[The Golden Bough/Priestly Kings|Priestly Kings]]
# [[The Golden Bough/Sympathetic Magic|Sympathetic Magic]]
:: Could also save some time, for numbering all chapters.. and later inserting a new one.. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 21:18, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Where my version of The Golden Bough Belongs ==

: If I need to, is there a way of moving this book to wikisource. Although i thought wikisource was for 'source texts' not formatted or edited text. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:08, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Yes, the way you started organizing it, it seems it is better a book for Wikisource (which contains original work by a certain author). Wikibooks is more meant for books, where each page can be edited by anyone, so I don't think this is what you want. There could be a Wikibook that explains the main ideas of the original work (like a study guide). Unfortunately there is no easy way to transfer a Wikibook to wikisource other than copying and pasting every page.. but I'd recommend you to do this sooner than later (the sooner you do it, the less you have to copy). Just ask yourself: Is it ok, if other users change the content of each of the chapters in the book (modern language, add or remove content, rewrite parts of the book, etc.), then it could be a wikibook. Or do you want to present the book as it was originally written, then it should be Wikisource, where users mainly correct spelling mistakes and the like, but not the original content. (Both are wikis, and in both wikis the book can be presented nicely). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:25, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: Gotcha, then I think is best keep it here. I will still upload the actual text to wikisource for people to be able to use. But I want to be able to change certain things, which I, out of respect, would not want to do to the original. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 19:29, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Ok, if you really want this to be a wikibook with no compromises, then I have yet another suggestion (I hope it is not getting too many... :-) ): Assume in a year somebody comes, and wants to insert a new chapter between chapter 4 and chapter 5. The person would have to move all chapters in order to renumber them, to insert a chapter. That is why the prefered way of organizing Wikibooks is, to have the title of a chapter as the link name: Use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[The Golden Bough/The King of the Wood]], [[The Golden Bough/Priestly Kings]], etc. instead of [[The Golden Bough/Chapter 1]], [[The Golden Bough/Chapter 2]], and so on&lt;/nowiki&gt;. If you want, you can still write the Chapter number on the main page, but this is then much easier to correct, if somebody wants to add or delete or move a chapter. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:11, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: I can see a benefit in that. People can add remove, expand or compile other versions of the book (the ones in PD anyway) Thanks. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]]

== Love affair ==

By the way, I am loving the wiki world.... and I just noticed that this book will take a few, lol.
thanks all, [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 15:42, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

Nothing wrong with that, maybe the user decided to create an account in order to vote, so that's perfectly fine (as long as it is not 10 new users suspiciously voting for the same book...) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:47, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Voting closed - congraulations to [[US History]] - happy voting for May 2005 ==
:Yesterday, (as of midnight UTC) the voting closed.
:US History was 'clearly' in the lead with five votes, however there were 3 books on four votes out of the 12 nominated this month.
:I would like to congraulate the editors of US History for having brought to fruition the first Humanities Wikibook of the Month. I am sure you will agree when I say that history is very important to know ourselves and our future. US History is a very good Wikibook for this purpose.
:We have had some very close, interesting and competitive votes here and many well-deserving books.
:We now have the five books with more than 3 votes for May, which means US history cannot be featured for a long year.
:Who is prepared to design a picture and change the main page accordingly?
:Once again, well done and congraulations!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Brief History==
KDE was founded in 1996 by [[w:Matthias Ettrich|Matthias Ettrich]], who was then a student at the [[w:Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]]. He found a number of things wrong with the [[w:Unix|UNIX]] desktop at that time. Among his qualms, outlined in [http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=53tkvv%24b4j%40newsserv.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de a now-famous newsgroup post], were that none of the applications looked, felt, or worked alike to each other. He proposed the formation of not only a set of applications, but rather a [[w:desktop environment|desktop environment]], in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently. He also wanted to make this desktop   easy to use. One of his complaints with desktop applications of the time was that his girlfriend could not use them. That post spurred a lot of interest, and the KDE project was born.

Matthias chose to use the [[w:Qt toolkit|Qt toolkit]] as the toolkit of choice of the KDE project. Other programmers quickly started developing KDE/Qt applications, and by early 1997, large and complex applications were being released. In mid-1997, the [[w:GNU|GNU]] project had concerns about the licensing of Qt, leading to their founding the [[w:GNOME|GNOME]] Desktop project and [[w:Harmony toolkit|Harmony]], a now-abandoned project to clone Qt. Qt was later relicensed to provide the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]] as an option, which has mitigated these concerns. There is still considerable disagreement over the use of the full GPL for a library like Qt, and the restrictions this imposes on code linking to it, such as the KDE framework and any applications written for it. Both KDE and GNOME now participate in [[w:Freedesktop.org|Freedesktop.org]], an effort to standardize Unix desktop interoperability, although there is still some friendly competition between them.

==Making a screenshot==
[[w:Screenshot|Screenshots]] can be captured using the [[w:KSnapshot|KSnapshot]] utility. Hitting the '''PrtScn''' key activates KSnapshot.
[[File:Ksnapshot082.png|right]]
You can refine the screenshot by changing the capture mode, and clicking '''Take a New Screenshot''' (or hitting '''Alt-N''').

*'''Full Screen''' - Captures everything. (This is the default.)
*'''Window Under Cursor''' - Grabs the clicked-on window, even if another window is in front of it.
*'''Rectangular Region''' - Click and drag to select the area, and then hit '''Enter''' to return to KSnapshot and save it, or '''Esc''' to quit.
*'''Freehand Region''' - Same as '''Rectangular Region''', except that you aren't limited to a rectangle: the area you select can be any shape.
*'''Section of Window''' - The area of the window that will be captured is outlined in red. Double-click on it.

Besides PNG and JPEG, you can also save the screenshot as a BMP, EPS, JPEG-2000 (.jp2), MNG, PBM, PCX, PIC, PGM, PPM, RGB, TGA, TIFF, XBM, or XPM. You can also click the '''Copy''' button to copy it to the clipboard. The '''Send To...''' menu lets you import the image directly into another program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">KDE (K Desktop Environment) is a free desktop environment and development platform built with Trolltech's Qt toolkit. It runs on most Unix and Unix-like systems, such as Linux, BSD and Solaris. There are also ports to Mac OS X using its X11 layer and Microsoft Windows using Cygwin. A port to native Microsoft Windows using a new-from-scratch Qt toolkit is being discussed. It is developed in conjunction with KDevelop, a software development suite, and KOffice, a suite of office software.

The &quot;K&quot; originally stood for &quot;Kool&quot; (&quot;C&quot; as in &quot;cool&quot; was already given away to the Common Desktop Environment), but was changed soon after to stand simply for &quot;K&quot;, which is &quot;The first letter before 'L' (which stands for Linux) in the Latin alphabet.&quot;

=Desktop Environment: What?=
Computers are made by humans to make it easier to deal with information. Think of spreadsheets in accounting and word processors in writing lovely letters. While computers can easily store gigantic amounts of information and search and analyse it extremely fast it is difficult to represent such information in a human usable method.

Here the desktop metaphor enters. One should think of your monitor as one's office desk. It has a telephone to call other people, paper stack with your correspondence, desk drawers with your files and a garbage can for your junk.
You interact with each of these objects on your desk with physical means. You pick up a piece of paper, call the number of the top, crumple it up and drop it in the garbage or file it in the file cabinet.

To interact with your computer you usually have a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard. This is very different from the real desk where you just use your hands to pick up a document. On a computer you can’t work in this way. Here you have to move the mouse so that the corresponding mouse cursor on your monitor is hovering above a little picture that represents your document. Now you need to push the buttons on the mouse without moving its screen cursor to interact with your document.

Desktop environments are the interfaces that make such interaction of your hands through a mouse/keyboard as logical and easy as possible and display the results of your actions on the screen in a manner so that you quickly and easily understand the consequences of your actions.
KDE is a desktop environment that aims to be the best graphical interface between humans and the information they have stored in computer systems. It aims to not only provide the framework but also the applications. The framework draws on the screen, accepts user input, the applications apply such input to modify the information, and passes the results back to the framework where they are displayed.
Difficulties that are common in this method is that it takes time for a computer to do its work, so it might take some time before your actions reveal this time, called latency.  Latency is the time between input and its corresponding output. The longer this time, the less pleasing the user experience is for the user.

A second oft-sited concern of users is that buttons with the same functions are located in varying locations in the interface. KDE attempts to limit this by providing standards for the makers of the applications so that consistent interfaces are presented to the user.
Consistency is nice but consistent mysteries don’t help you! KDE tries to be clear in what the results will be of possible actions. It does so by providing pictures on buttons (icons) that represent the results of activating such buttons. However, some people don’t quickly understand icons, so straightforward text is sometimes better. KDE allows both and gives people the option of customizing their interface to their information so that they can work as effectively as possible.

And that is the goal of KDE: giving humans the most effective interface for humans to work with their information on computers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This module is aimed at explaining the rules of games such as gomoku, renju, and pente. The aim of these games is generally to get five pieces in a row. This module also aims to provide some general theory to aid in gameplay.

== Games ==

* [[/Gomoku/]]
* [[/Pente/]]
* [[/Renju/]]
* [[/Wuziqi/]]

== Terms &amp; Definitions ==

''Here are some terms used in this book'':

'''Piece''': a stone (generally either black or white) belonging to one of the two players. this can be a glass stone, a plastic stone, a symbol representing a stone, etc.

'''Row''': a line of adjacent pieces which are ''all of the same colour''. gaps in this line are allowed.

'''Unbroken row''': a row without gaps.

'''n in a Row''': n pieces of the same colour arranged in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. this row is unbroken. creating 5 in a row generally implies a win.

'''Four''': a row of 4 (not necessarily 4 in a row), in which placing one more piece results in a 5 in a row.

'''Straight four''': 4 in a row.

'''Three''': a row of 3 (not necessarily 3 in a row), in which placing one more piece results in a straight four.

'''Straight three''': 3 in a row.

'''Overline''': n in an unbroken row. (n &gt; 5)

'''Double three''': two ''threes'' intersecting each other

'''Double four''': two ''fours'' intersecting each other

'''Capture''': to execute a move which results in the removal of some opponent pieces from the board

'''Description''': Gomoku is a relatively easy game for two players. It consists of a 15 x 15 board and two sets of player pieces (one set for each player). Generally there is a set of black pieces and a set of white pieces; the 'black player' makes the first move.

'''Aim''': to get five of one's pieces in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)

'''Rules''': players alternate turns, players may not make more than one move in one turn, players may not skip their move during their turn.

'''Gameplay''': (optional) after black makes his/her second move, white may choose to play as black. (note: this is the only time in the game where players may swap the colour of their pieces)

While some original ideas were brainstormed, none of them were of approprate ease/length for a beginning (short) movie, often by very small amounts. A number of public domain works, mostly by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft H. P. Lovecraft] (focusing largely on The Call of Cthulhu), were also considered and deemed difficult but possible.

The following process was (mentally) used:

# Are we able to use the story?
# Is the story interesting?
# How many characters are there? Would we have enough volunteers (read: conscripts) to make such an attempt viable?
# How easy is the story to convert from a narrative to a script format? Would a major overhaul be necessary, resulting only in general similarity; or is it easily adaptable?
# What is the setting? Are we able to find locations/costumes/etc. necessary? What grovelling/paying would be needed?
# From what perspective would we be following the story? Would we have the camera literally 'in the eye' of the protagonist, seeing what he sees; or would we use the standard omniprescent view?
# Do we have enough equipment? Is the equipment we have capable of what we want it to do?
# Can we afford it?

This was the (mental) analysis for The Call of Cthulhu (not regimented as provided below, but more collectively brainstormed):


----


The Call of Cthulhu was written in the 1920's so the copyright has expired. The story is interesting to an audience more interested in the more abstract stories, however more average audiences would probably be confused and not understand. 

The number of main characters is enough so that with a little shuffling, the film could be made. However, the most problematic thing is the extras needed (eg. police officers in raid on cultists, shipmates on voyage to R'lyeh, etc.). If techniques such as using lighting to block out the more specific features on people's faces, and actors were moved around (eg. an actor is the main in one scene/for one character, and acts as an extra in the rest), it could be achieved. Costumes would also be difficult (requiring a number of 1900's-style police uniforms, among other things), but if we asked around through our contacts in stage and acting, we might be able to scrounge up a few. If worse came to worst, we could always improvise.

The story isnt as much not in the write style to convert to script format, the conversion would simply be difficult. Hopefully, this wouldn't be that much of a problem. If the story could be simplified (see the first note) so that it is easier to understand without detracting from the story, this would be preferable.

The story will be following a number of characters, obstenibly in the search of the main for the reason for a number of unusual events, not in the least the cause of death of his great-uncle. This will involve the 'frame' of the protagonist searching out the various other characters for their stories relating to his search, and from there showing from the characters point of view the events they are describing. This would be done in a 'flashback' sort of way, not by filming events then having a narrative over the top.

The most difficult 'setting' would be the portrayal of the city of R'lyeh and Cthulhu, however we might be able to make do using miniatures for shots of the city/god itself and never actually showing actors/surroundings and either R'leyh or Cthulhu in the same shot.

Our equipment is well within range.

Seeing as though we should be able to beg and grovel for most scenes/costumes, the majority of money would probably have to be spent on the miniatures. Using off-cuts provided by contacts in various industries such as that may prove useful.

It was a few weeks later that a number of short stories (all written by the same author) were found, and an email was sent to enquire as to the possibility of adapting his works to film (Feb 23). A reply was recieved a week later giving his approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As a first-time independent studio depending on volunteer workers and conscripts to get by, obviously the amount of funding that could be found would be very little.

==Personal Funds==

The main source of funds for the project would be coming out of our own pockets. Fortunately, people were relatively free with volunteering things such as time, equipment (film equipment, transport, etc), etc. Actual monies needed for purchase/hire of equipment/space was thankfully not excessive.

==Grants==

The government grants provided by the Commonwealth of Australia target directors of age above mine, as well as being heavily biased towards directors which have already completed a number of films.

==Fundraising==

With no large volunteer force, no goods/services and no target consumer group, the fundraising idea was essentially scrapped from the beginning.

==Backing==

Finding a person or group willing to back this project are much of the same attitude as the government, unwilling to invest in a risky, unproven young group of people.

Thankfully for us, our limited number of contacts meant that we would be able to beg and plead for rights to film at certain locations, in return for a spot thanking the benefactors on the credits. The rest (equipment, transport, etc) was easily managed through our minimal funds.

== Speedy renaming of [[Template:Adakw]] to [[Template:Ada/kw]] ==

'''Note''': Moved from [[WB:VFD]] - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:12, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

This do not require a vote, but I don't known other place to ask to move this page. We are migrating the entire [[Ada Programming]] wikibook (formerly [[Programming:Ada]]) to the new naming policy, and we have the alias [[Ada]] for templates. To avoid polluting the namespace, all the pages of the wikibook will be subpages of those two domain names ([[Ada Programming]] and the alias [[Ada]]).

We need the help of an administrator to move the [[Template:Adakw]] to [[Template:Ada/kw]]. After that, the old template [[Template:Adakw]] should be deleted, as well as many other template names listed in the [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]]. Please, do not use any template to indicate the requested renaming or removing because currently the second is a redirection to the first, and it's heavily used. Thank you very much. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 10:27, August 25, 2005 (UTC)

:I don't understand why you need an administrator to do this. Simply edit the page [[Template:Ada/kw]] to contain whatever it is you want it to contain, then mark the old template for deletion when it's no longer required. Perhaps I'm missing something here? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:12, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:World-Population-500CE-2150.png|thumb|300px|World population from 500CE to 2150, based on UN (2004){{ref|UN}} projections and U.S. census information{{ref|census}}, which are both applications of demography. No matter how much data is collected, unknown variables remain, so there are alternate possiblities for the future world population.]]Species and populations are probably the two most commonly used ecology terms, but they are often difficult concepts to grasp.  Throughout this chapter, they will be discussed in detail, expanding on the definitions from previous chapters and explaining why there are no universally acceptable definitions.  Factors influencing population growth and ways to measure and predict population growth will also be subjects of specific focus.  Populations can be affected by so many factors that it is almost impossible to take every variable into account.  Demography is the statistical study of the age structure of a population, and it can be used in research to determine what is causing a decline or increase in population size over time.  It is worthwhile to understand species concept and population growth even though they are such broad aspects, because they are fundamental to the science of ecology.

== Species Concept ==
You should have familiarity with the species concept from biology and have been presented with this basic tenant of the biological sciences in [[../Biosphere_Organization#Species and Habitat|Chapter 2]] of this textbook. If need be,
:* Reread [[Wikipedia:Species|Species]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links as necessary to understand concepts presented&lt;/small&gt;)

When initially considering the concept of species you may wonder why the division of organisms into species is necessary at all. According to [[Wikipedia:en:Ernst W. Mayr|Ernst W. Mayr]], a renowned evolutionary biologist, the existence and reproductive characteristics of distinct species &quot;prevents the production of too great a number of disharmonious incompatible gene combinations.{{ref|Mayr1996}}&quot;  Therefore, the basis for the existence of species is genotypic in nature.  However, the existence of species is not traditionally doubted whereas the appropriate definition of a species is continually a topic of debate{{ref|Hey2001}}.

[[Image:Maultier_grau.jpg‎|thumb|left|A mule is the infertile offspring of a horse and a donkey--an example of the gray area regarding interbreeding in the most common definition of a species.]]Although a species can be defined in a number of different ways, the most common definition for a living species, suggested by [[Wikipedia:en:Ernst W. Mayr|Ernst W. Mayr]], is ''any group of individuals that can breed with themselves but not with any other group''. In other words, a species is any group of individuals that is &quot;reproductively isolated.{{ref|Mayr1996}}&quot; This definition, termed the Biological Species Concept, has limitations and exceptions{{ref|Hey2001}}. Some animals that would not normally be considered part of the same species can breed with limited success. For example, a horse and a donkey can can breed to produce a mule offspring but, the mule is infertile. Accordingly, there is much debate regarding the amount of successful fertility required for two individuals to belong to the same species. There are also organisms that do not interbreed at all, but propagate through direct cloning of an individual, for example many plants and insects. Other definitions must be used to define the species of organisms such as these.

So, why is such a seemingly straight-forward concept so hard to define? One problem is that the definition of a species is used in many different contexts and undoubtedly fails to satisfy them all simultaneously. In particular, there has been a great deal of discontinuity between the application of the same species concept in a taxonomic or systematic sense and in an evolutionary sense{{ref|Cracraft1989}}. In systematic biology species serve as fundamental units (taxa) for the description and historical progression of diversity.  However, evolutionarily, species are considered only as elements of a process called speciation. Even without further knowledge of the differences between evolution and [[Wikipedia:en:taxonomy|taxonomy]], it is apparent that the concept of a species is used in different contexts by the two. This is just one example of the many obstacles encompassing the complex debate for a universally applicable definition of a species.

In fact, it seems, after years and years of debate, that it is impossible to attain a universally suitable definition for &quot;species&quot;. As Pigliucci (2006, p. 50) points out:
:''...emotions have run high for decades on the &quot;crucial&quot; question of what a biological species is, while at the same time plenty of researchers have conducted brilliant studies on individual species and on the process of speciation, apparently unencumbered by the lack of a universally-agreed-upon definition of what species are...''

The species concept is basic to biology and therefore ecology, but it is really the '''species population''' that ecologists study.

== Population Biology ==
A ''species population'' is a discrete group of potentially interbreeding organisms in the same species in a given locality. Here, potential interbreeding has nothing to do with measures of fertility; instead it is a statement that all members of a population are potentially a part of a single gene pool. In a species populations there are many factors which interfere with an individual’s ability to survive and reproduce know as their [[../Main Glossary|&quot;Fitness&quot;]].. Booth et al.(1995){{ref|Booth1995}} describes that an individual's fitness is increased with group living, also known as the [[Wikipedia:en:Allee effect|Allee Effect]], and that an individual’s ability to survive will be increased by their size and rank. In this study, Booth shows that within the group of damselfish there was a greater chance for survival if they stayed in large groups. Within these groups the smaller individuals would benefit the most from the group living, but consequently the growth of these individuals was reduced, thus taking a longer time to reach a higher social status in the group. Reed et al. 2005 {{ref|Reed2005}} supports Booth's findings,and also shows that there is a linear relationship between log population size and population fitness. Reed suggests that “conservation efforts should ultimately aim at maintaining populations of several thousand individuals to ensure long-term persistence.&quot;  

:* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Population|Population]] &lt;small&gt;The common use of the term in human demographics utilizes concepts and terms important to Population Biology&lt;/small&gt;

Diversity as a goal is split between species diversity, and diversity within a population. An area that is filled with finches and owls and many species has species diversity. But if all the finches have very similar genes, or if the population has an inbreeding problem, there is not enough diversity within that population.
[[image:Founder_effect.png|thumb|280px|left|Limited diversity with separation.]]
When there is no diversity in the gene pool, serious effects can result. This is known as the [[Wikipedia:en:Founder_effect|Founder Effect]]. A major cause of Founder Effect is when a small part of a population have moved to an area with limited interaction with species from the same population. A well known example is the Old Order [[Wikipedia:en:Amish|Amish]] in Pennsylvania. The Amish rarely interact with people outside of the community and rarely, if ever, marry outside of the population. With the limited gene variation genotype and phenotype problems are spread more frequently through the population and are not bred out compared with the rest of the overall population. The Amish carry a rare allele that causes [[Wikipedia:en:Polydactyly|polydactylism]], in which there are extra fingers or toes. This recessive allele is carried in about 1 in every 14 Amish individuals compared to the outside population, where it is carried about 1 in every 1000.

Another similar type of disturbance in a population is known as a [[Wikipedia:en:Population_bottleneck|Bottleneck]]. This disturbance occurs when a species is almost eliminated by human forces (hunting) or natural disasters. The cheetah is a prime example of a species with limited variation from a bottleneck. The cheetah's genetic make-up is so similar that a skin graft will not be rejected from one cheetah to another.

Even though the worldwide population of a species is effectively infinite, not all individuals can interbreed, due to obvious limitations such as separate continents, mountains or deserts, or great distances. A local population that does actually interbreed is called a neighborhood, or deme. So even though an overall population may not have inbreeding, neighborhoods would have potentially high inbreeding coefficients, which can increase the frequency of diseases, or ensure that a mutation be preserved in that species.

===Population Growth===
[[image:Life_expectancy_world_map.PNG|thumb|340px|right|Population growth data can be used to determine and compare life expectancies of many regions.]]Population growth is measured using time-specific life tables and age-specific life tables. Time-specific life tables are used for long lived species, such as humans, and age-specific table are used for short-lived species, such as insects. Time-specific life tables assume equal birth rates for all age classes, and are useful for large populations. Age-specific life tables follow a cohort (a group of organisms of the same species and roughly similar ages), and require periodic sampling. It is effective for short-lived species such as annual plants and insects.
There are many types of useful information that population growth can reveal, such as life histories for a population, and life expectancies such as the map shown at right. Survivorship curves can also be determined by plotting the number of individuals of a cohort against time. Fecundity can be influenced by abiotic factors, such as precipitation (Milanovich et al. 2006).

===Reproductive Rates===
Closely related to the study of population growth is the reproductive rate of a population. [[Wikipedia:en:Fecundity|Fecundity]], m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the average number of offspring produced per breeding individual. A fecundity schedule is R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ∑ l&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; , where l&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the proportion surviving), m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean number of offspring per individual, and R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the net reproductive rate of the population. If R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=1, the population is stable. If R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1, the population is decreasing, and if R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;1, the population is increasing.

== Sub-page scope ==

How big a scope do people want to give these sub-pages? On the one end of the spectrum, we could have big pages with lots of tables (like the proposed natural sciences page) which would reduce the number of pages one might have to browse through. On the other end, we could make very short pages so that once one has found the page, there won't be much clutter and the words of interest easily found.

I would lean towards smaller pages. I have nothing against longer ones and see no reason why we couldn't make a natural sciences page by including the relevant pages. I like the modular approach, but realise that it does introduce a certain amount of clutter on indexing pages.

Anyone have good arguments that tip the scales for one or the other, or a good compromise that will give the right tune. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:48, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

: How about setting a limit of vocabulary under a particular topic until it's made into a subpage.  Astronomy and Glaciology (which is a subset of Earth Science) are all Natural Sciences.  However, putting Glaciology and Astronomy directly under Natural Sciences would develop a rather large page.  Making a limit would remove the clutter from the main Natural Science page and limit the need to make numerous subpages.

: The only real problem I have is that some terms may go under multiple pages (and the main reason I decided to go with one page.)  In the Natural Science page, it's easier to solve.  All terms should go under the science they're directly related.  For example, carbon monoxide is used under Glaciology.  This is clearly a chemistry term - even though it's used in the Glaciology community.  Similarly, &quot;solid&quot; should go under &quot;Chemistry&quot; even though many others would also use the term.  Other terms may be more difficult - biochemistry (is this a Biology term?  Chemistry?), Telescope (Astronomy or Physics?), Microscope (Biology, Chemistry or Physics?).  What one person believes the term should belong, another person would disagree.  This makes it rather difficult for people to find terms they believe should belong in one section.  I guess there could be a section called &quot;Interdisciplinary Section&quot; or something similar. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 04:18, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

:: Sure, a limit could work. I'm not sure if a strict limit would be useful ... there are always situations where it's good to be able to bend the rules.
:: I don't see this problem so easily solved by putting it under a Natural Science page. You still have to section them off if you want to make browsing possible. An alphabetical list would allow for searching, but at that point we're approaching a dictionary, which Wikibooks is not.
:: I see these vocab lists more as a resource to practice phrases with new words and less as a tool to build up vocabulary (which is probably best done by the students themselves in their own context). For that end, we would be better off with a few short lists of related words per page with links to related content to allow for browsing.
:: It's true that many terms can fit under multiple categories. Since we're building a learning resource rather than a word index, I'd say that multiple entries of the same word in different lists is perfectly fine.
:: For searching, we could see if we can put a Wiktionary searchbox on the vocab pages. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:12, 31 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

Blocking is the act of walking the actors through the scene before it is shot in order to make sure the lighting is sufficient and the camera is able to get the desired focus required. 
That's close: Blocking is for all departments to be sure that they are prepared for the scene to be shot. Taking the extra 3-5 minutes to block a scene can save you time, money and patience later. It's not uncommon for blocking to last days for a big scene, such as the scene in Jarhead where the soldiers all met in a tent &quot;in country&quot;. Sam Mendes blocked that scene for 4 days before they shot it. Still closer: Blocking a scene for film also must afford the camera the most aesthetically interesting compositions that flow before the lens. It is not only the movement of actors and props to achieve optimum efficiency on the set.
Blocking is simply working out the details of an actor’s moves in relation to the camera.  

What happens in an effective scene is a combination of a number of elements, in a kind of gestalt.  All these elements together comprise blocking.  These include cinematographic details, the physical relationship of the actors to each other, their energy, and the overall sense of where they are going.  What is the chemistry or dynamic in the &quot;frame?&quot;  Simply put, what is the set-up..especially in terms of the action and how everything fits together, spatially and otherwise?

This conversation demonstrates the two most productive mechanisms that Dutch has to form novel words: '''compounding''' and the formation of '''diminutives'''.

==Grammatica 7.1 Compounds==
===Base rule of compounding===
Dutch&lt;ref&gt;like German, Norwegian and Danish&lt;/ref&gt; is often mocked for its tendency of creating long compound words such as ''randjongerenhangplekkenbeleidsambtenarensalarisbesprekingsafspraken'' &lt;ref&gt;The agreements from the negotiations concerning the salary of public officials who decide on the policy regarding areas where unemployed youth are allowed to hang out&lt;/ref&gt;. Actually compounds are seldom so excessive and overly long compounds like this one are typically '''''avoided'''''. Nevertheless, it is certainly true that compounding is one of the most important ways that Dutch forms new words for new concepts.  ''Besprekingsafspraken'' e.g. would certainly be an acceptable compound word; it would mean the agreements -''afspraken'' made during the meeting - ''bespreking''. 

Compounding of words happens in English as well. However in English, compounds are typically written as separate words, so English speakers are often not aware that a word like &quot;apple juice&quot; is a compound, much like its Dutch counterpart &quot;appelsap&quot;. Notice that when you pronounce &quot;apple juice&quot; you pronounce the word &quot;juice&quot; with much less emphasis than you pronounce &quot;apple&quot; with. This is what signals word compounding in English and Dutch alike. Apart from the orthography the two languages are actually quite similar on this point.

|het {{Nlwikt|DNA}}||[[file:nl-DNA.ogg]]||DNA
|-
|de {{Nlwikt|deurbel}}||[[file:nl-deurbel.ogg]]||door bell
|-
|}
In fact sometimes compounds are spelled as a single word even in English. For example, the word &quot;database&quot; is a compilation of the words &quot;data&quot; and &quot;base&quot;. For some words, such as &quot;mailbox&quot;, a double spelling can be used: &quot;mail box&quot; is also acceptable in English. And English spelling is not particularly predictable on this point.

In Dutch, the rule for spelling compounds is simple: if two nouns form a compound, write them together. Always.

Examples:

*apple juice → ''[[:wikt:nl:appelsap|appelsap]]'', incorrect: ''*appel sap''
*mail box → ''[[:wikt:nl:postbus|postbus]]'', incorrect: ''*post bus''

This rule even applies to words imported from English into Dutch: 

*''sciencefiction''
*''businessunit''

Or:
*Linux operating system → ''Linuxbesturingssysteem'', incorrect: ''*Linux besturingssysteem''

===Hyphenation===
In the latter case a hyphenated spelling Linux-besturingssysteem is actually more usual because Linux is a brand name. Besides, if the word becomes too long and too hard to read at one glance it is ''allowed'' to insert a hyphen. But these hyphens are to be used sparingly and never appear in simple two word compounds like ''deurbel'' (door bell).

On the other hand, a hyphen is ''required'' when one of the elements in a compound is an acronym:

*DNA molecule → ''DNA-molecuul'', incorrect: ''*DNA molecuul, *DNAmolecule''

The hyphen can also be required if one word ends in a vowel and the other begins with one and the combination of the two vowels could be misinterpreted, e.g. as a diphthong or a different vowel.

E.g. 'euro enthusiasm' is eur'''o–e'''nthousiasme, not eur'''oe'''nthousiasme, because '''oe''' codes for the sound [u].

The Taalunie&lt;ref&gt;The Taalunie is a joint institution of the governments of Suriname, Flanders and the Netherlands that a.o. regulates the official orthography of Dutch&lt;/ref&gt; calls this phenomenon ''klinkerbotsing'' (&quot;vowel collision&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;See [http://woordenlijst.org/leidraad/7/1/ this table] to see which vowel are considered to collide&lt;/ref&gt;

Klinkerbotsing is why bananenframbozenmokka-ijsje and vanille-ijsje must have a hyphen between the last letter of mokk'''a'''  and the final -e of vanill'''e''' on the one hand and and the first '''i''' of '''i'''jsje on the other, because the 'ai' or 'ei' combination would otherwise 'collide'. By contrast the word bananenmokkaframbozenijsje can be written without hyphens as there are no vowel collisions in it. &lt;ref&gt;Please do not expect all Dutch speakers to always do that right. Because English is widely known amongst Dutch speakers there is a strong tendency to follow English spelling and write &quot;bananen frambozen mokka ijsje&quot; There is even a term for it: ''de Engelse ziekte'' &quot;the English disease&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linking -s-, -e-, -en-===

''Recall'': besturing'''s'''systeem and bespreking'''s'''afspraken. Where does the extra -s- come from?

When Dutch still possessed a case system two part compounds were typically made by putting the first noun in the genitive case, e.g.:

:''de koning'' -&gt; genitive ''des konings'' (of the king)
:de mantel van de koning  -&gt; des konings mantel (the king's mantle) -&gt; de koning'''s'''mantel

English used to have something similar, which explains word like 'kinsman, kingsman' etc.

However, not all genitives were formed with -s in Dutch, some words required -e, other words -en and which word required which in the old system is about as clear as mud for a modern Dutch speaker. Besides, the old system got corrupted beyond recognition, e.g. ''bespreking'' never had a genitive is -s at all. Until 1995 the orthography of the compounds was still the traditional one that had evolved from the case system but was otherwise rather haphazard. This led to a plethora of spelling errors. In 1995 the ''Taalunie'' abandoned the historic link and formulated simplified rules for when to use -e- and when to use -en-. The basic rule is:

::''When the word only has a plural with an ending -en, use -en-; otherwise use -e-.''

For the -s- linker there was no need to formulate a rule, but let's make it specific here:

::''When the word is pronounced with and -s-, write an -s-.''

:So, because ''pan'' only has a plural ''pannen'', we now write ''pann'''en'''koek'' (It used to be pann'''e'''koek, because pan was a feminine word with a genitive in -e.)
:And because ''{{C|bende|gang}}'' has both ''benden'' and ''bendes'' as plural, we write ''{{C|bendelid|gang member}}''. (This also used to be a feminine word, its genitive was the same as the nominative: ''bende''.)
:Because we actually pronounce an -s- between ''bespreking'' and ''afspraken'' we write bespreking'''s'''afspraken.

Of course for mother tongue speakers it is usually pretty clear what plurals a certain word has and how it is pronounced. For non-native learners that is not the case. It is one of the many things they must acquire pretty much word by word. If it is any consolation: Dutch speakers will only sympathize if a non-native speaker makes an error linking compounds, because they often still do as well. Take ''besturingssysteem''. Yes an -s- is pronounced, but ''systeem'' starts with an s! In this case the extra -s- is added by ''analogy'': in e.g. ''besturingsmechanisme'' an -s- is pronounced that does not come from either noun in the compound. This -s- is then adopted for ''besturingssysteem'' as well. Yes, mistakes are made with such things by native speakers.

===Omission of repeated parts===

If you use two compound words in the same phrase that have an element in common, you can replace it by a dash:

*&quot;[[:wikt:nl:ondergrens|ondergrens]] en [[:wikt:nl:bovengrens|bovengrens]]&quot; (lower boundary and upper boundary) can be replaced by &quot;onder- en bovengrens&quot;. (lower and upper boundary)

You can omit repeated parts of compounds in English as well: &quot;standard temperature and standard pressure&quot; is often replaced by &quot;standard temperature and pressure&quot;. But note that by omitting the second occurrence of &quot;standard&quot;, the text becomes ambiguous; it can no longer be seen from the text itself whether &quot;standard&quot; applies to just to the temperature, or to the pressure as well. The exact meaning will have to be gathered from the context. 

In Dutch orthography however, by means of the dash, the difference is made clear:

*&quot;Standaardtemperatuur en -druk&quot; means standard temperature and standard pressure
*&quot;Standaardtemperatuur en druk&quot; means standard temperature, and pressure

But then in thermodynamics only pressure is standardized, of course, not temperature.

==Grammatica 7.2 Diminutives==
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|[[File:Vaas-van-porceleinfabriek-de-kroon-1346700261.jpg|thumb|right|200px|de vaas [[image:nl-vaas.ogg|noicon|20px]]]]||[[File:Healthy student breakfast.jpg|thumb|300px|Een gerbera in een vaasje [[image:nl-vaasje.ogg|noicon|20px]]]]
|}

''Recall'': een ijs'''je''', een klein'''tje'''. These are diminutive forms.

Apart from a plural the Dutch noun generally also has a diminutive. It is formed by adding ''-je'' to the noun and is always neuter in gender:

:de vaas - het vaasje

Diminutives have a plural in ''-s'':

:het vaasje - de vaasjes.

Compounding and the formation of diminutives are the two most productive ways of forming new words in Dutch. More so than in most other languages diminutives are used for a whole variety of purposes in Dutch. It is not possible to learn Dutch without a decent command of both compounds and diminutives.

===Usage===

''Het vaasje'' literally means ''the little vase'', but the usage of diminutives in Dutch is quite '''''pervasive'''''. Often the diminutive is as frequently or even more frequently used than the noun itself and in some cases leaving out the diminutive leads to confusion.

A handsize vase, say for a single flower, will generally be called ''vaasje''. The word 'vaas' is more reserved for something that needs to be carried with both hands. If you ask for a ''vaas'' people will give you something too big to put your single flower in, because that is not a ''vaas'', but a ''vaasje'' and you used the wrong word. In other words in some cases using the diminutive is '''mandatory'''

In some cases the diminutive has also acquired a life of its own (become 'lexicalized'). Compare:

:het [[:wikt:nl:ijs|ijs]] - the ice, ice cream as substance
:het [[:wikt:nl:ijsje|ijsje]] - the ice cream (cone, cup, whatever)
:de meid - the maid 
:het meisje - the girl
:de kaart - the (geographic, road) map, the postcard
:het kaartje - the ticket, the business card
:het krijt - the substance chalk
:het Krijt - the Cretaceous period
:het krijtje - the piece of chalk to write on the board with

|}

The connotation of being 'small' has largely been lost in a case like ''ijsje''. This implies that a big cone of ice cream becomes: een groot ijsje (''lit.'' a big little ice). Interestingly, there used to be a word ''ijsco'' for ice cream, but it has been supplanted entirely by its diminutive cousin. The word does live on in the compound ''ijscoman'': vendor of ice cream, usually in a car or a road stand.

The word ''krijt'' means ''chalk'' as a substance is ''uncountable'' and has no plural, but ''krijtje'' means piece of chalk and does have a plural ''krijtjes''. Similarly the uncountable word ''gebak'' (pastry) gave rise to the countable word ''gebakje'': a piece of pastry.
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;

|}
In the case of ''meisje'', the original word ''meid'' can be rather derogatory:

:Die meid hoort in het gevang!
::''lit.'' That 'broad' belongs in jail!

It can also be a somewhat colloquial term of endearment:

:Wat 'n leuke meid! -- What a cutie!
:Grote meid! -- Atta-girl!

Lexicalized diminutives are even formed from other parts of speech than nouns.

:tussendoor - in between
:een [[:wikt:nl:tussendoortje|tussendoortje]] - a snack 

There are quite a few such ''zelfstandige verkleinwoorden'' that do not occur in the non-diminutive form or have gained a whole new meaning that the non-diminunitve does not possess. See for reference [[:nl:wikt:Categorie:Zelfstandig verkleinwoord|this WikiWoordenboek category]]. 


Adverbs can be formed from adjective by adding an extra -s:

:zacht - soft
:zachtjes - softly

Even the names of persons are at times turned into the diminutive, usually as a term of endearment:

:Marietje, je bent een schat
::Mary dear, you are a darling

As we saw in the conversation substantivated adjectives like ''een kleine'' (a little one) can also be used as diminutives: ''een kleintje''. In fact. it this case ''een kleine'' would even sound odd in Dutch ears.

Even cardinal numbers are not safe:

:We gaan met z'n tweetjes
::We'll go the two of us

===Meaning===
A variety of qualities can be expressed by a diminutive:
#small size
#countable unit of an uncountable substance
#modesty of the speaker
#of little or modest importance
#informality, not official
#'gezelligheid' ~ being fun, sociable, non-threatening
#affection
#condescension (if attached to the wrong words)

The latter means some words are better left alone, e.g.:
*de moord - the murder  -&gt; &lt;s&gt;moordje&lt;/s&gt;
*de begrafenis - the funeral -&gt;&lt;s&gt;begrafenisje&lt;/s&gt;

Putting these in the diminutive is downright disrespectful and morbid. If would indicate that the speaker is involved with such things for fun on a daily basis and thinks little of it. In other words, diminutives in Dutch express a whole lot more than just small size. They are a major mechanism of producing derived terms.

===Formation===
The formation of the diminutive sometimes requires the addition of ''-tje'' or ''-pje'', the latter after ''m'':
:het eten - the food
:het etentje - taking someone out for dinner, a dinner party
:de bloem - the flower
:het bloempje - the little flower

In some cases the vowel changes like it does in the plural:

:het schip - the ship
:het scheepje - the little ship
:het pad - the path
:de paden - the paths
:het paadje - the little path, the trail

'''''but''''':

:de schildpad - the turtle
:de schildpadden - the turtles
:het schildpadje - the little turtle

In other cases an extra syllable is inserted:

:de kom - the bowl
:het kommetje
:de bloem - the flower
:het bloemetje - the little flower

Words ending on -ing can get -kje, but only if the stress of the word is on the previous syllable
:de kétting - het kéttin'''kje'''
Otherwise another syllable is inserted:
:verándering - veránderingetje

The latter also goes for words with the suffix -ling:
:leerling - leerlingetje

The suffix '''''-je''''' often causes consonants to be more or less pronounced as palatals. (Paadje as IPA /'pacə/ rather than /'patje/). 

There is considerable variation between the dialects in the formation of the diminutives. Many dialects pronounce -je as -ie /i:/. In others, the suffix tends to be -ke: meiske, blommeke.

==Grammatica 7-3. ''Willen''==

The verb ''willen'' means ''to want, to desire'' (not: will) and it is irregular
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|wil}}||{{knp2|wilt}}||||{{knp2|willen}}
|}

:ik wil
:jij wilt
:hij '''wil'''
:wij willen

As for English will the third person lacks the -t ending. In the second person it does appear for jij, u and gij alike. As usual is disappears for the jij-form in inversion:

:Wat voor ijsje '''wil''' je?

There are two different past tenses:

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|wilde}}||{{knp2|wou}}
|-
|{{knp2|wilden}}||{{knp2|wouden}}
|}
:ik wilde, ik wou
:wij wilden, wij wouden.&lt;ref&gt;Some speakers only find the regular weak past ''wilde'' acceptable in the written standard, but certainly in spoken Dutch ''wou'' and ''wouden'' (sometimes pronounced as ''wouwen'') are quite common. ''Wou'' is pretty common in the written language as well, ''wouden'' much less so, although the official spelling standard of the Taalunie has no [http://woordenlijst.org/zoek/?q=willen&amp;w=w objections to it at all]&lt;/ref&gt;


The word ''wilden'' also occurs as a noun and means ''savages''; likewise ''wouden'' can also mean ''forests''.

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knp2|gewild}}
|}
The perfect participle is ''gewild''

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Poli. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Poli~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The Italian &quot;R&quot; is always rolled, even when the lenght of the sound is short and therefore the rolling hardly noticeable. [[:it:Utente:Paginazero]] not logged --[[User:80.180.184.28|80.180.184.28]] 12:31, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I'm not a native Italian speaker, but when I hear recordings of the simple Italian &quot;r&quot; being pronounced, it usually sounds like a tap rather than a trill. For example: http://www.askoxford.com/languages/it/toi_italian/pronunciation/?view=uk , http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/modlang/carasi/site/pronuncia/pronuncia.html , http://italian.about.com/library/fare/blfareindex02.htm . --[[User:The Lazar|The Lazar]] 06:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

== Pronounciation page. ==

I rewrote it in its entirety because the first edition confused me more than anything when I took a look and wasn't very well-formatted(not that this one is). As I am not a native Italian speaker(I am however proficient), please be on the lookout for any errors. Thanks!

--[[User:Kundash|Kundash]] 23:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== A big mistake ==

I corrected all the wrong prononunciations of the vowels: long vowels (like &quot;ei&quot; in &quot;weird&quot; in English) do '''NOT''' exist in italian! Vowels are ALL short, always. Neither are letters like &quot;t&quot; or &quot;r&quot;, however. It's impossible to pronounce [pit:sa], how do you pronounce a long &quot;t&quot;? Letters like &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot; etc. are simply doubled: ['pittsa] (pizza), ['rosso] (rosso), [ven'totto] (ventotto), etc.

I am a native speaker, and I'm a phonetician, so I know what I'm talking about :)

--[[User:Molo]]

== Q ==

&quot;It is used only, but not always, when followed by approximant u. &quot;

Huh? Only, but not always? How does that work? - Elin

== 't' as in &quot;treasure&quot; ==

Using the 't' in &quot;treasure&quot; as an example seems odd, since I pronounce that word as &quot;chrezhr&quot;, with no 't' sound at all. Unless, of course, you really do mean the 'ch' sound (which from my research appears not to be the case), but either way it's a rather ambiguous example. (I'm refraining from editing because I don't know which sound I should make a better example for)

== farmacia has three syllables, not four. ==

Under the pronunciation for the letter 'f' (and again under 'i'), the example is 'farmacia', and the pronunciation given is phar.MAH.chee.ah: a typical English-speaker mistake. The correct pronunciation would be something like phar.MAH.chah (far'mat͡ʃa). In Italian, an 'i' is used in writing to &quot;soften&quot; a 'c' or 'g' before an 'a', 'o', or 'u'; the counterpart to using an 'h' to &quot;harden&quot; a 'c' or 'g' before 'e' and 'i'. The 'i' in question is part of a consonant digraph, and not a separate vowel.

*Actually, you are wrong. Go to any standard Italian dictionary or pronunciation guide (such as [http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/tag/farmacia/ Treccani], or [http://www.forvo.com/word/farmacia/#it Forvo], or [http://www.dizionario.rai.it/ DOP], etc.) This word is a big ''exception'' to the rule that the ''i'' is silent in ''-cia''.

== Examples for E ==

I really think the section about '''E''' could be clarified. Perhaps list one or two words that are much more common than ''sempre'', such as ''presto'' or ''ecco'' or ''bene''. Newcomers (and observers) to Italian are more apt to be familiar with the pronunciation of the suggested words than they will of ''sempre''.

In addition, put in an example or two of a closed ''e'', such as ''credo'' or ''ella'' or ''che''.

Also, change the order of the minimal pairs so that they match the order of the first sentence under '''E'''.

As you probably already saw I added [[Blender Tutorial Links List]] and category [[:Category:Blender|Blender]] where are also collected all [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book parts, but as you know many of them are not finished yet. Can you please tell me which of them you think are finished? I want to mark finished parts in a proper way.

Thank you! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 16:00, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I don't think I would call any of those tutorials &quot;finished&quot; yet.  However, the first 15 are usable at this point.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:46, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Moving Modeling Keyboard Shortcuts? ==

Isn't better '''Keyboard Shortcuts''' or even more precise '''Shortcuts''' ''(MMB, LMB, RMB)'', there is also word '''Hot Keys''' for this? This isn't only about Modeling anyway... --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:19, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Proportional editing ==

I posted this in the discussion for the proportional (O key) editing, but figured I'd let you know directly as well, that I volunteer to do the tutorial for it, and can get started when I'm home in the morning. I plan to have it cover both the sharp and rounded fall off, and the amount of fall off &quot;coverage&quot; with the use of the scroll wheel or zoom amounts. Let me know if there's any other particulars for it that you want me to cover, either here or on the module discussion itself.
Thanks,
--[[User:Camel|camel]] 02:25, May 9, 2005 (UTC)

On this note, I've been unable to get to the tutorial as soon as originally anticipated, but this weekend while I'm off work should be good. I'm going to have to do some playing around though, as it looks like Blender 2.37 will be out soon, and having just downloaded the CVS today it has added a fair amount to proportional editing. In particular I'm going to have to figure out the difference between &quot;on&quot; and &quot;connected&quot;. Thus far I haven't come up with much information so I'm hoping that when it goes B-Con 4 or final release that I'll be able to find at least a little information on it. In the mean time, the added features will definately be nice and make life easy, with a total of 6, up from 2, proportional editing methods. --[[User:Camel|camel]] 13:09, May 12, 2005 (UTC)

: Wow, sounds great.  Everytime they release a new Blender, our work will begin :)  Thanks in advance for your hard work on this.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:21, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

== Development Stages ==

I see you liked the usage of the development stages. However looking at the link you posted, I see we're doing it with the older version of the system. The latest &quot;correct&quot; method would be to use the stages short|00%|May 11, 2005 rather than the Image: tag. --[[User:Camel|camel]] 23:53, May 11, 2005 (UTC)

: Ooh, let's do it the right way.  Thanx for catching that.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:25, 12 May 2005 (UTC)


== OpenGL ==

I dont know if this is the right place to put this, but one question I'd think most people would ask (so there is probably and obvious answer) is how do I use Blender models in an OpenGL program?  What formats (and tools) are available for storing the textures, material properties, and vertices/lines/polygons that can be used to build OpenGL display lists?


== Blender Tutorial ==

I've been learning blender using the tutorial you started... It's very helpful!  It does need some work, but it's generally pretty good.  Kudos to you.  I plan to help work on it once I actually understand the program XP. [[User:Oracleoftruth|Oracleoftruth]] 02:02, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

: Awesome!  I'm glad it's been helpful.  Stay tuned because there's a lot of big improvements coming, most immediately in the intermediate modeling section.  If you have suggestions fo improvement, please tell us about them, or implement the changes yourself.  Best of luck to you!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:35, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Why Use Curves? ==
You’ve learned how versatile mesh objects can be, and how they can easily produce flat surfaces with sharp edges and even give a convincing representation of curved surfaces with rounder edges. So why do we need a separate kind of curve object at all?

There are important reasons.
* The various kinds of curves and surfaces/patches (Bézier, NURBS etc) were used in computer graphics before meshes were developed. In the days when memory was more expensive, they offered a more compact way to represent complex shapes. Even now, they are still common in CAD and other technically-oriented graphics applications, where they make it easy to precisely specify the shape of a curve. Thus, if you are importing data from such applications, you will need the ability to represent such curves—even if you end up converting them to meshes before applying materials and textures for rendering.
* You can use curves as guides for shaping meshes. This makes it easier to construct certain kinds of complicated curved shapes. Particularly since it is simpler to make changes to the curve (with fewer control points), than after it has been converted to a mesh. To this end, Blender defines ''scaling radius'' and ''tilt angle'' settings for curve control points, which make no difference to the appearance of the curve itself, but have an effect when it is used to deform another shape.

== Bézier Versus NURBS ==
In the following pages, you will come across two kinds of curves/patches.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If we consider that a '''surface''' needs always be two-dimensional or more. A '''curve''', that in one dimension is simply a line, needs at least be two dimensional when represented in a surface for the curvature to be expressed. What Blender calls a two dimensional “surface” is elsewhere in computer graphics commonly referred to as a '''patch'''.}}

''Bézier'' objects only occur in Blender as curves, while ''NURBS'' (“'''N'''on-'''U'''niform '''R'''ational '''B'''-'''S'''pline) objects can be curves or surfaces. If you’ve used 2D drawing programs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator, you would have come across Bézier curves before. NURBS curves are a mathematical generalization of these, which are heavily used in CAD applications. Unlike Bézier curves, NURBS curves allow the specification of a variable ''weight'' for each control point, which governs how closely the curve passes to that point.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|That‘s right, “NURBS” is singular, not plural. You will often hear people say “one NURB, many NURBs”, but really it should be “one NURBS, many NURBSes”. Or alternatively, you can finesse the issue by only using “NURBS” as an adjective: “one NURBS curve/surface/object, many NURBS curves/surfaces/objects”.}}

== More Than You Wanted To Know About Curves ==
As usual, Wikipedia has the lowdown on all the interesting trivia about
* [[w:B%C3%A9zier_curve|Bézier curves]]
* [[w:Nurbs|NURBS curves]]

[[Image:Agedashi.jpg|right|frame|Agedashi tofu]]

'''Agedashi tofu''' (or '''''agedashi dofu''''') &amp;#25562;&amp;#12370;&amp;#20986;&amp;#12375;&amp;#35910;&amp;#33104;  is a simple [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] way to serve hot tofu. Silken (''kinugoshi'') firm tofu, cut into cubes, is lightly dusted with potato starch or cornstarch and then [[deep frying|deep fried]] until golden brown. It's then served in a hot tentsuyu broth made of dashi, mirin, and shoyu (Japanese soy sauce), and topped with finely chopped green onions or grated daikon. It is eaten with chopsticks.

==Ingredients==
* 4-6 oz. (~115-170 g) soft [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|potato or corn starch]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] for [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep frying]]

;Sauce:
* ½ cup (120 mL) )[[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]]
* 2 Tbs (30 mL) [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|light soy sauce]]
* 1½ Tbs (22.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]]

;Condiments:
* [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]]s, thinly sliced
* Grated [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* Grated [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] (white radish)

==Procedure==


# Cut the soft tofu into rectangular pieces about 1&quot; thick.
# Arrange the layers on rack with paper towels and leave for 10-15 minutes to drain.  Change the paper and turn over the slices.
# In pan, mix sauce ingredients, heat in a pan until boiling. Turn off the heat.
# Sprinkle starch on a plate.   Arrange the tofu slices on it.  Sprinkle more starch over the tofu.   
# Heat the oil to 355°F (180°C) for deep frying.
# Pat any excess starch off the tofu slices and slide them into the hot oil, one by one.  Don't add too many slices at once, because tofu lowers the oil temperature.  Fry until golden, turning once.
# Remove and drain on paper towels.
# Arrange the tofu dish, pour the sauce.  Top with a mound of grated daikon (radish), a bit of grated ginger, and sliced green onions.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite newsgroup 
 |     author = 
 |      title = (required)
 |       date = 
 |  newsgroup = 
 |        url = 
 |      quote = 
 | accessdate =&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}}
 }}

For example, the instantiation:
&lt;pre&gt;
*{{cite newsgroup 
 |     author = Pat Rogers
 |      title = Ada as a real time language
 |       date = 2002-08-28
 |  newsgroup = comp.realtime
 |        url = http://groups.google.es/group/comp.realtime/msg/355d3c9ab43fcb77
 |      quote = you don't need an RTOS to write real-time systems with Ada
 | accessdate = 2009-01-05
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
gives:
*{{cite newsgroup 
 |     author = Pat Rogers
 |      title = Ada as a real time language
 |       date = 2002-08-28
 |  newsgroup = comp.realtime
 |        url = http://groups.google.es/group/comp.realtime/msg/355d3c9ab43fcb77
 |      quote = you don't need an RTOS to write real-time systems with Ada
 | accessdate = 2009-01-05
}}

I wonder if a threaded forum would be helpful.

----

The overwhelming sense I have of Wikiversity is that of trying to run before walking. This could and should be one of the most exciting developments on the Web and education, however it is paralysed by two fundamental errors:
* the empty replication of a traditional epistemology
* the maintenance of a distinction between teaching and learning

Further to the discussion of governance, are Wikiversitians simply wanting to set up as new gatekeepers of the traditional domains: &quot;meet the new boss...&quot;? Why do &quot;we&quot; need to &quot;keep up with&quot; people who are &quot;on this course&quot;? Just because traditional universities do this doesn't mean Wikiversity needs to or should.

I agree with Andrew, there is an opportunity to do something different but it doesn't have to do with finding out what we can teach; it is about what we want to learn. Learning is far more difficult than teaching. That is why many teachers stop learning as soon as they can and simply replicate aging knowledge. (Of course the good ones don't!)

The long list of faculties and courses that are unpopulated are perhaps testimony to the need to come up with something else. Take it all down! Archive all unpopulated categories.</text>

[[Image:Sv6.png|thumb|Let's make this jeep.]]
The idea of this tutorial is to learn to face a complex project. A vehicle is a nice object to use to test yourself and find new problems.

First, we must understand that a project does not reproduce the real world; a project shows an idea or thought and will result in a final image or video. Whatever does not appear in the final result is unnecessary to include in the model.

What vehicle should we make?  Let's go with the classic jeep.  This will allow for a lot of doodads.

Let's decide what objects of the jeep model will need to be made - body, wheels, seats, and a rocket launcher for good measure.  Objects we can ignore include the engine, which remains hidden under the hood.  There are many additional objects you can make such as a steering wheel to customize your jeep.

'''Portobello mushrooms''' are large mushrooms that can be prepared as a vegetarian entrée.  They can substitute for [[Cookbook:hamburger|hamburger]] patties, or be eaten alone.

==Ingredients==
* One large [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Portobello mushroom]] per person
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] (as desired)

==Simple Grilling Preparation==
# Remove stems from the mushrooms, wash and dry.
# Brush with olive oil.
# [[Cookbook:Grilling|Grill]] for about 10 minutes, alternating sides, until both sides are grill-marked.

When cooking on a barbecue mixing the oil with a water based liquid (e.g. balsamic vinegar) will cause the fire to flare more and give the food more flavour, baste them as they cook.  Adding other flavours such as garlic and chilli works well. If you are in a hurry, just use vinaigrette dressing.

The first step to building a computer is acquiring the parts.  This guide will start with a quick explanation of essential parts and elaborate on them further on.

A computer is made up of a '''case''' (or '''chassis''') which houses several important internal components, and provides places to connect the external components, including non-peripherals.

Inside the case go the following internal parts:

*'''[[Wikipedia:Power Supply|Power Supply]]'''/'''PSU''' – ''power supply unit'', converts outlet power, which is alternating current (AC), to direct current (DC) which is required by internal components, as well as providing appropriate voltages and currents for these internal components. 

*'''[[Wikipedia:Motherboard|Motherboard]]'''/'''mainboard''' – As the name indicates, this is the electronic centerpiece of the computer: everything else connects to the motherboard.

These are the parts that a standard PC will use.  We are not considering such esoterica as headless, touchscreen, or voice-controlled systems.  You might want to make a check list (perhaps using a spreadsheet) of parts to use as you go about your process of research and selection. That way you won’t find yourself sitting down with a pile of brand new hardware only to find that you forgot an essential component.

Before you jump onto the web and start spending lots of money on expensive computer parts, there are three important questions you should answer which will guide your purchases:

# What will be the main function of the computer?
# What useful parts do you have on hand, from an old computer or otherwise?
# How much can you afford to spend on the system?

== What operating system am I going to use? ==
Before you buy components, be sure that they are supported by the operating system you plan to use.  Almost all commonly available PC devices have drivers (small programs that allow the operating system to recognize and work with a hardware device) available for current versions of Windows (generally, XP, Vista, 7, 8 or newer); if you want to run an alternative operating system, you'll have to do some research; many alternatives have extensive 'Hardware Compatibility Lists' (HCLs) as well as software compatibility.

=== Windows information and hardware support lists ===
'''Microsoft Windows''' is a series of operating systems made by the major software corporation Microsoft. Nearly everybody who has worked with computers has used Windows in some way or another. Windows is ideal for most personal computing and fits the needs (or wants) of just about anyone: gamers, video/graphics editors, office workers, or the average guy who wants to surf the web and play a bit of solitaire here and there. Today, Windows 10, Windows 8.1 , WIndows XP , Windows 7 are the 4 most common versions of the operating system (Windows 10 being the latest, Windows 7 being the most common of the three).

Windows in general supports most processors and motherboards based on the i386 (x86; 32-bit) or x86_64 (AMD64/EM64T; 64-bit) architectures. Put simply, most available consumer processors (especially from AMD or Intel) will work with the Windows 10 operating system, as well as most internal and external devices, including Wireless Receivers, Graphics Cards/GPUs, and Storage Devices.

For other hardware, see [http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx/ Microsoft's compatibility list].

=== GNU/Linux information and hardware support lists ===
As one of the most popular open-source (free) operating systems, '''GNU/Linux''' is a very good (and popular) alternative. Linux is a UNIX-like series of operation systems and comes in many different distributions (AKA &quot;distros&quot;), such as [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu], [http://www.debian.org/ Debian], [http://www.opensuse.org/ openSuSE], [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora], and [http://www.mandriva.com/ Mandriva]. Linux can perform many of the same functions as Windows and features similar programs. Linux is also much more flexible than Windows because it's open-source, making it developer-friendly. Some companies also sell versions of Linux with technical support.

Linux has versions for many different architectures, including i386, x64 and PowerPC. It also support all kinds of processors, enabling it to be used on Palm PCs and even iPods.  There are many different versions of Linux, produced by different companies and organizations. These are called 'distributions' or 'distros' for short. For a desktop PC, you should make sure to pick a desktop distribution, one where the company/organization has desktop users in mind, e.g. [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu], [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora], or [http://www.mandriva.com/ Mandriva]. It should be noted, however, that many popular programs, especially games, are not available for Linux, and the only way to run them is with special compatibility layers or programs like [http://www.winehq.org/ Wine], which may or may not work with a specific program. Even if you manage to get a certain program running, you may still encounter issues in the program's emulation.

All this is important to bear in mind as different distributions will support different hardware (generally more 'bleeding-edge' distributions will support newer hardware – look at [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora], [http://www.suse.com/ SuSE], [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu], compared to the latest stable release of [http://www.debian.org/ Debian]). A good rule of thumb to ascertain compatibility, is to buy hardware that is 12 to 18 months old, as it most likely has Linux support with most distributions, but won't be too old. You may also buy newer hardware, and if it follows common standards (eg. x86, ISA, SATA), it should be supported.

=== BSDs information and hardware support lists===
'''BSD''', or the '''Berkeley Software Distribution''', is also a UNIX-Like series of operating systems and could be considered the alternative to Linux (an alternative to an alternative?). Now, BSD is an open-source (free) operating system and has its own descendants, such as [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD] and [http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD]. BSD Hardware Support is similar to Linux's - it can handle most hardware. Unlike Linux, however, BSD tends not to support &quot;new&quot; hardware (such as Core i7 and Xeon processors) but can handle a lot of both older and modern components. [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD] is also very compatible with many Linux applications as they are both UNIX-based and can be installed on a variety of platforms (even Xbox consoles!)

===Hackintosh===
Hackintosh is a Windows-based computer which runs Mac OSX. This is '''extremely''' risky and could damage your whole motherboard if it is not done properly. Mac OSX is designed with Apple PC's in mind and trying to port them to a PC is risky and difficult. If you still want to attempt the same , read this.
# You should be using a comparable Intel CPU which should've been used by Apple in one of their computers.
# You'll need to find out which version of Mac OSX will work with the CPU. For instance , an Intel Core2Duo T7200 with GMA950 graphics is not supposed to run OSX 10.8 or later. Also using new Intel CPU's on a older version of Mac OSX can cause kernel panics.
# Graphics also matter. Look up your CPU/GPU combination to see if it works.
# You'll be violating the Apple EULA.
# You'll need to (mostly) get modified installers , as the official installers may block installation.
# Only Mac OSX 10.4 and higher can even run on Windows-based PC's , as OSX till then ran on PowerPC processors.
# You'll need patience and tinkering up with things if something goes wrong.
# A unsupported motherboard could be destroyed by Mac OSX , as it may write to NVRAM and corrupt it.
# Updates can be quite difficult(like Mac OSX upgrades).

== What will be the main function of the computer? ==
If you're going to build a computer from scratch for a specific purpose, you'll want to keep that purpose in mind when choosing your components; don't just go to the store or an online shop and start buying. Consider what you want to use the computer for, you may be able to save money by specifying expensive, premium parts only where needed.

Any reasonably configured computer built from current components will offer adequate Internet browsing and word-processing capabilities. For an office computer, this is often all that is needed. As long as you provide enough RAM for your chosen operating system (256 MB to 1 GB for XP or Linux, 2 GB for Vista) any processor you can buy new will provide acceptable performance.  If the computer is for gaming, a fast processor, the addition of a high-end graphics accelerator card (or two) and extra RAM will provide  a more satisfactory gaming experience. Besides gaming, computers intended for video editing, serious audio work, CAD/CAM, or animation will benefit from beefier components which are specifically designed for that purpose.

Here are some general system categories. Your own needs will probably not fit neatly into one of these, but they are a good way to start thinking about what you are going to use your computer for. With each we’ve indicated the components you should emphasize when building the system and we've also included sample builds for each configuration , which you're free to modify it to fit your needs and budget.

===Simple web surfer===
To provide basic functionality to a user who just needs web surfing, a little word processing, and the occasional game of solitaire, it’s important not to go overboard. Such a user has no need for a top of the line processor or 3D graphics card. A modestly configured system with an adequate Internet connection will suit this user best and can be assembled quite cheaply.

This usage pattern is not going to stress any particular component, you should be looking at a mid- to low-level processor (historically, and currently, at about the $125 price point or less), enough RAM for the OS and a mother board with built in Ethernet, video and audio. You can use a mid-level case/power supply combo (these components are often sold as a pair). 

If you have a little extra money, spend it on a better monitor, mouse/keyboard, and case/power supply in that order.

===Office computer===
An office computer can be expected to do word processing, spreadsheet and database work, network access, e-mail and a little light development of spreadsheets, databases, and presentations. It might also be called on to do page layout work, some 2D graphic creation, and/or terminal emulation.

None of this stresses any particular component either, but since office workers often run several applications at the same time, and because time is money in this space, a strong mid-level processor is suggested. Typically this would be the processor one or two places from the top of the line. Plenty of RAM will also facilitate multitasking and save time.

You will not need much in the way of 3D graphics power so current generation integrated graphics solutions from both AMD and Intel are perfectly adequate for office tasks.  You should be aware that they will appropriate a portion of the system RAM for video duties thus reducing the total amount of RAM available for the OS and other programs so play accordingly and increase the total system RAM amount to compensate.  Choosing the fastest operating frequency RAM your motherboard and budget can support will positively improve the performance of integrated graphics.  If you decide that you need a dedicated graphics card after all, opt for an inexpensive model.  A sub $75 (for this and other prices in US dollars see [http://www.xe.com/ucc/ www.xe.com/ucc] or other currency converter of your choice for conversion into your local currency) video card with 1 GB or more should be more than sufficient.  However, do your research carefully because many inexpensive graphics cards actually have poorer performance than current generation integrated graphic solutions.

You’ll want a sturdy case (computers kept under desks get kicked by users and poked by cleaning staff) with a reliable power supply but nothing fancy. If you plan on keeping the system running nearly all the time, look for a power supply with a good reliability record. Any extra budget after the above should focus on a better monitor, better/more ergonomic mouse/keyboard and more RAM.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - Nvidia Quadro(or AMD FirePro) models are generally intended for workstation models. While they cost quite more for the same graphics performance than their equivalent GeForce model , they are optimized for workstation programs and have a wider set of certified and approved drivers for these purposes. That said , most office users will be fine using a GeForce or Radeon(AMD) model.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- For those who do not want to be bothered with overclocking , an i7-6790 could be a better choice and is slightly cheaper.

===Server===
A server these days can be anything from a home unit serving MP3's and homework files to the kids, to a machine running a business-critical system for a small business, to a 3u rack mount unit serving up millions of hits a day on the Internet. 

The thing that most servers have in common is that they are always on and therefore reliability is a key characteristic. Also they serve more than one user while storing and processing important information. For this reason servers are often equipped with redundant systems such as dual power supplies, RAID 5 arrays of four or more hard disks, special server grade processors that require error-correcting memory, multiple high-speed Ethernet connections, etc.

All of this is a little beyond the scope of the current work, but, in general, servers need lots of RAM, fast redundant hard drives, and the most reliable components your budget will allow. The CPU choice should be made in accordance with the use of the server. A simple print/fax server will do fine with a CPU stolen from a museum, whereas a server running a database and a front end for that, will work much better with a top of the line CPU. 

On the other end of the hardware list, since nobody is usually sitting at them, you can get away with the cheapest possible keyboard, mouse and monitor (in fact many servers run &quot;headless&quot; with no monitor at all). Graphics are also a very low priority on these machines, and a read only CD/DVD-ROM optical drive (used, infrequently, for installing software and updates) will do just fine. We're not including sample builds for this configuration because of the huge variety of possibilities.

===Gaming system===
We’re not talking here about the occasional game of solitaire or a secret late night Zuma obsession. We’re talking about cutting edge 3D gaming – first-person shooters or real-time strategy games with thousands of troops on the screen at the same time, with anisotropic filtering and anti-aliasing and mip-mapped specular reflections and a lot of other confusing terminology describing visual effects that will make anything less than a top-of-the-line system fall down on its knees and beg for mercy.

A top of the range processor is not critical to gaming performance (though it does help), but you will need at least a mid range one and plenty of RAM, as well as a motherboard to match, since the speed of the motherboard buses can limit high-end components. Please remember that if you plan on running the latest games in 1080p, or even higher, on highest settings, or even with three monitors, you will need a high end processor. This will stop the chances of bottlenecking the GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) and not give you the gaming experience you need. The most important part will be the video card (or cards) with cutting edge GPUs. [[w:ATI|ATI]] (who have been bought by [[w:AMD|AMD]] so the ATI cards now are labelled as AMD) and [[w:NVIDIA|NVIDIA]] have been competing for &quot;king of the graphics card&quot; honors for years and the competition is so keen that new cards running on new GPUs are released, it seems, twice a month.  

If you want to run two or more screens, the best idea would be to run two or more(up to 4) cards in either Crossfire X (AMD) or SLI (NVidia). But this is expensive and not all motherboards support both company's methods, so do your research and buy the best current cards you can afford. Also be aware that not all types of Intel CPU's can work fully with CrossFireX or Nvidia. For instance , all consumer Inter i7's can utilize up to 16 PCI Gen3 lanes , with another 8 PCI Gen2 from the CPU(1/2 bandwith of x8 PCI Gen3). This essentially means that  with these types of CPU's , running more than 2 graphic card will be difficult as you may lose performance instead because there will not be enough bandwith for the graphic card(you'll have to go for something like x4 , x4 and x8) , unless there is a PLX chip , which are not there in many motherboards. The Extreme i7 and the Xeons which do not use the same socket as the consumer products can utilize up to 40 PCI Gen3 lanes with an additional 8 PCI Gen2 lanes from the CPU. This is enough to fully power 4 graphics cards(at x8 , x8 , x8 and x16)  

The other component which can offload some of the burden from your CPU is a good audio card. The DSPs (Digital Signal Processors) on the audio card can take over a lot of the sound processing and free up the CPU for other tasks. Currently [[w:Creative Labs|Creative Labs]] and ASUS Xonar are the leading brands, but again do your research (partly by reading on) and get the best audio card you can afford. Some motherboards have audio cards already built in, though these are generally of lesser quality, depending on the quality of the motherboard.

Finally all of these components are going to require a pretty hefty power supply, particularly if you decide to run two graphics cards in Crossfire (ATI) or SLI (NVIDIA) mode, in which case make sure the power supply is rated for the dual-graphics card mode you choose. Generally a serious gaming rig will require at least a 500 watt supply; units are available up to 1500 watts (1.5 Kilowatts) and two Kilowatt supplies are more rare. Keep in mind that having a higher-rated power supply will not actually increase the power your computer draws. The rating is the maximum that the power supply is designed to provide. Get the best you can afford.

As you may have noticed, pretty much every component inside the computer needs to be top of the line;  the same is true outside the case. You’ll want a big monitor, and a high sensitivity mouse. There are even gaming keyboards with the keys specially arranged, not to mention joysticks, throttle controllers, driving wheels, etc.

So, given that your budget is not bottomless, how do you prioritize? Well, the processor and video card are the components that will have the most effect on your gaming performance. Next comes the motherboard and RAM. If you use one instead of two or more video cards, you can also use a less expensive power supply. One of the advantages to building your own computer is that you can get the components you can afford now and plan to upgrade them later.

A note on cases for gaming rigs – it is not necessary to get a case with a side window that reveals glowing blue fans and revolving animated heat-sinks. A well-built plain case will do just as well and let you spend more money on the components that matter. But if you have the cash, and that’s your taste, there are lots of flashy add-ons available these days.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - It means that 4 top-of the line Nvidia Titan X are used together in one PC. This therotically allows for up to a 400% boost in gaming performance compared to one graphics card , but there are limitations on the system , which brings it down to about 320%. Some games may also not work properly with SLI(AMD calls it CrossFire) , but most do. If you do use anything higher than Dual SLI , you '''cannot''' use the CPU shown on the 'Performance' build , rather you must go with something like i7-5930 K. You should also take power demands into account.

=== Entertainment system/media center ===
This is a computer designed to sit in the living room with the rest of your A/V gear. The idea is that it will record and serve audio and video files for replay via your existing television and stereo. The current notion is that this computer should be built in a special case that makes it look more like a stereo component, the size of which can present a challenge when it comes to getting all the necessary parts fitted.

For this system a mid-range processor will be fine, along with a generous amount of RAM. A fast Ethernet connection will facilitate sharing large files. You’ll also want a TV tuner card (or two) to get video in and out of the machine. Many of these also provide [[w:digital video recorder|DVR]] (digital video recorder) functionality, often without the monthly subscription fees and [[w:digital rights management|DRM]] (digital rights management) restrictions required by companies like Tivo. A wireless keyboard and mouse provide for couch-based use and a separate monitor may be unnecessary as your TV will fill that role.

All components should be as quiet as possible since you'll likely be watching/listening in the same room. For this application it makes sense to trade a little power for passively-cooled (without fans) parts. Following this logic, one may consider fan-less CPUs and mainboards.

===Workstation===
A workstation was, originally, a single-user computer with more muscle than a PC, intended to support  a demanding technical application, like CAD or complicated array-based simulations of real world phenomena. The niche that these computers filled – between high end PC’s and low end minicomputers – has essentially evaporated. The serious scientific applications have migrated to clusters of PC's with near super-computer speeds, and end-user applications, like video editing, music production and CAD, run well on high-end PC's. One sector that still uses large workstation farms from Sun or Silicon Graphics is serious, Pixar-style animation.

For any of the following uses, you will need the fastest processor and the most RAM you can manage.

{{NOTE|On a Microsoft Windows 32-bit OS (with the exception of Windows Server 2008 Enterprise and Datacenter , whose limit is 64GB by virtue of PAE.), the maximum practical RAM available for programs is 3.2 Gigabytes. The 4th gigabyte will be partially absorbed by system overhead or remain partially unused due to the OS incapacity to address memory at that range. For Windows XP RTM and SP1 , it can use the full 4GB RAM , but nothing more. Starter SKU's of Windows impose even greater restrictions , with Windows XP Starter being limited to 512 MB and the Vista variant 1GB.

On most 32-bit OS's,the maximum practical RAM available for programs is no more than 4 Gigabytes because 32 bits of binary number can't express any number greater than 2^32.Some systems have used special ways to break the limit, called [[w:Physical Address Extension|Physical Address Extension(PAE)]].}}
====Video editing====
Big and fast hard drives are key. Solid State Drives or 10000 RPM Raptors in Raid 0 as working space with multiple 1 Terabyte or larger drives for storage is a good target. SATA/600 is highly recommended and SCSI subsystems should also be considered. A large amount of memory (8 gig or more, using a 32-bit OS is not recommended) would be beneficial, as would a fast CPU,with many cores/threads, especially if you intend to render effects or wish to quickly transcode video. Most editing and transcoding programs utilize some form of GPU acceleration (primarily OpenCL and/or CUDA), where the graphics processor is used, along with the CPU, to perform many calculations at the same time, greatly reducing processing time, compared to CPU-only processing.

====Music production====

Plenty of disk space is important, you'll also want at least 2 GB of RAM, but a music production (recording and mixing) workstation is chiefly distinguished by specialized external components – studio reference monitors instead of normal speakers, mixing consoles, microphones, etc. If you want to record external sources, like vocals or instruments, you'll need an audio interface which allows you to plug mics or instruments into your computer.

Audio interfaces allow anything from a single microphone or instrument on up to pro level systems that have 32 or more simultaneous inputs. These separate inputs will allow you to record each one as a separate track in your DAW. Most use Steinberg's ASIO interface (a software driver that connects your hardware to your DAW software). If you don't wish to invest in anything other than the onboard sound card your computer comes with, consider ASIO4All, a free driver that imitates the ASIO framework for almost any sound card.

One piece of advice, if you have extra money, get better microphones - even if you have to trade the Bluesmobile.

====CAD/CAM====
('''C'''omputer '''A'''ssisted '''D'''esign / '''C'''omputer '''A'''ided '''M'''anufacturing)

A CAD/CAM  workstation is usually a machine that runs a single, very intense, application. These machines often utilize specialized video hardware, like the Nvidia Quadro series of GPU's, which are designed specifically for CAD/CAM rendering. Since these machines are usually devoted to a single, expensive, application it's especially important to pay close attention to the requirements of that application. Spec the hardware to support the software - always a good idea but especially important here. 

Some examples of this specialized software are [[w:Autodesk 3ds Max|Autodesk 3ds Max]], [[w:Autodesk Maya|Autodesk Maya]], [[w:AutoCAD|AutoCAD]], [[w:Cinema 4D|Cinema 4D]] and [[w:Maxwell Render|Maxwell Render]] amongst [[w:Comparison of computer-aided design editors|many others]].

== Do I plan on [[Wikipedia:overclocking|overclocking]] my computer? ==
Overclocking consists of running components at faster internal speeds than they are rated for. If you are serious about [[Wikipedia:overclocking|overclocking]] your computer, you need to do extensive research into the components you select, as some parts respond to overclocking better than others. Processors that respond well to heavy overclocking are generally not very expensive (though overclockable memory is), but the price of a component is by no means a guarantee of its overclocking potential. Overclocking usually voids your warranty and is risky (you can destroy your entire computer), so be warned! You need to think hard about cooling the computer as overclocking generates heat. Anything from a few extra fans to a liquid-cooled system may be necessary depending on the nature of your system.

For Intel CPU , as of Haswell/Skylake , only the K series CPU's(which cost about 20-40 $ more than the equivalent non-overclock variant) and the Extreme Series generally allow full overclocking , while others have limited(Turbo Boost) or none. Examples are i7-4770K , i5-6600K or i7-4960X. The cheapest Intel CPU overclockable is Pentium G3258 , and there are no overclockable Celeron or i3 versions. Some processors(within the same model!) may be able to overclock higher or lower. For example , a good Haswell 4770K chip can clock up to about 4.6 Ghz , an excellent one may be able to hit 5Ghz ,  while a bad one may stop at 4.3 GHz(assuming that all use the same cooling method).

A rare exception is the Broadwell-based i7-5775C and i5-5665C, which is fully overclockable and has a top of the line integrated graphics.

== Do I plan on [[Wikipedia:underclocking|underclocking]] my computer? ==    
This can be ideal for always-on entertainment systems. Underclocked parts run cooler, often enabling passive cooling options to be used, which leads to a much quieter system , and you'll also save on power.

However , you'll lose performance instead from the CPU.

== Can I use any of the parts from my old computer? ==
This depends on your situation; if your computer is more than four years old, chances are that most of the parts will be too old, slow or incompatible for your new machine. On the other hand, if you are upgrading from a fairly new machine, you may be able to use many of the parts. All of this assumes the old computer will no longer be used. If you, or someone else, is going to continue using your old computer, it's probably best just to leave it intact.

One important point – if you are selling your old computer it's a good idea to erase the hard drive before giving it to its new owner. Special precautions must be taken to ensure that you are not giving away your sensitive or personal information. Don't forget that a simple 'delete' command does not actually erase the data on your hard drive. The original data will still be present and can later be recovered by someone else using special programs and/or equipment. To avoid this, programs are available that will effectively 'shred' your data, making it unrecoverable.  Driver floppies or CD's that come with some hard drives may also have programs to do this, that write 0s or 1s (either way, &quot;blankness&quot;) to the whole drive. Lower-tech approaches include drilling a few holes in the drive or taking a blowtorch to it. Obviously, either prevents it from being used again (Be planet friendly and try to avoid this).

Since monitor technology moves quite slowly, you can probably keep your current monitor and use it on the new computer if it's of sufficient size and clarity for your work. The same can go for keyboards, as well as mice, printers, scanners, and possibly speaker sets. On the inside, you may be able to take out the floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, and possibly the sound card and hard drive (depending on how good they are, of course). Sometimes so much is used from the old computer, that the line between an upgrade and a new computer can become blurred.

Reusing a hard drive is an easy way to keep data from your old computer. With most Windows operating systems moving a boot drive from one motherboard to another will entail a series of reboots and installation of new drivers. In the case of newer Windows systems, like 2000 and XP, an entire 'refresh install' may be necessary to allow Windows to install a new Hardware Abstraction Layer. Back up your data before trying this.

== Where do I find the parts? ==
Once you have decided what you’re going to use your computer for, and have reviewed which parts are available for reuse, you should make a list of what components you will need to buy. A few hours of research can save you years of regret, so make sure that the computer you build will do what you need it to do. 

Computer terminology can be confusing, so if there are terms you don’t understand, be sure to look them up. Wikipedia is an excellent place to start if, for example, you’re not clear on the difference between, say, DDR and DDR2 memory.

There are several places to buy parts:

* '''Internet retailers''' generally offer the best price for new parts.  If a part needs to be returned, you may be stuck for the shipping; check return policies before you purchase.
* '''Auction sites''' like eBay and several others offer very good prices for used parts.  This is especially useful for parts which do not wear out.  Returns can be problematic or impossible. Some auctions may not be legitimate. Always check the shipping cost before you bid.
* '''Local PC shops''' - Their prices are often higher, but they may make up for this by providing a lot of expertise. Get opinions from other sources, however, as they may be eager to sell you parts you don't need.
* '''Big local retailers''' often lack technical expertise and charge higher prices, but can be useful because they usually handle returns quickly.  Also good if you need something right away.
* '''Trade shows''' that occur from time to time also provide a good place to shop, as the prices are often significantly reduced, and the variety of prefabricated computers built towards specific computing needs tend to be higher.

Also, your local town dump may have a special section for computers and monitors that others have got rid of. These can be more or less brand new computers with trivial problems such as a busted power supply or faulty cables. Of course if the dump does have such a section, you should ask permission of those in charge. They're usually glad to let you go through it, but don't leave a mess. Taking advantage of this can yield incredible finds, with a price tag of nothing or very little.

=== OEM vs Retail ===
Many hardware manufacturers will sell the same components in both OEM and Retail versions.  Retail hardware is intended to be sold to the end-user through retail channels, and will come fully packaged with manuals, accessories, software, etc.  OEM stands for &quot;original equipment manufacturer&quot;; items labeled as such are intended to be sold in bulk for use by firms which integrate the components into their own products.

However, many online stores will offer OEM hardware at cheaper prices than the corresponding retail versions. You will usually receive such an item by itself in an anti-static bag. It may or may not come with a manual or a CD containing drivers. Warranties on OEM parts may often be shorter, and sometimes require you to obtain support through your vendor, rather than the manufacturer. OEM components are also sometimes specified differently than their retail counterparts, parts may be clocked slower, and ports or features may be missing. Some of the support may be less (as in the case of Microsoft). Again, do your research.

== What should affect the choice of any part/peripheral? ==
Many things should be taken into account when deciding what parts to buy.  Below are some things to consider.

=== Compatibility ===
You’ll want to make sure that all the parts you buy work together without problems. The CPU, the motherboard, and the RAM in particular must be compatible with each other. Check the motherboard manufacturer's web site; most will list compatible RAM and processors. Often quality RAM that is not on the approved list (but is of the proper type) will work anyway, but the manufacturers list of processors should be rigidly adhered to.

Again, you’ll also want to make sure that your operating system supports the hardware you choose. Windows is supported by almost everything, though watch out for older components if you're planning on using Vista or higher. If you have any interest in running Linux, MacOS or another operating system now or in the future, buy parts that are supported by that OS (Operating System). It is also worth checking around the Internet to make sure there is no history of your chosen components clashing (e.g. certain combinations of hardware causing instability, crashing, etc.)

=== Ergonomics ===
Ergonomics is the science of designing things so that they work with the human body. This is obviously important when choosing peripherals such as a keyboard or mouse but should also be considered when selecting a monitor, and especially when setting up the computer for your use. If your wrist hurts or you’re getting a crick in your neck, look at the physical setup of your computer, check your chair height and posture. An ounce of prevention here can avert troublesome repetitive strain injuries. Learning to type without looking down at the keyboard is very useful for avoiding neck strain.

=== Operating temperature ===
Modern components, notably processors, GPUs, RAM, and some elements on the motherboard, are very small and draw a lot of power. A small area doing a lot of work with a lot of power leads to high temperatures. Various factors can cause electronic parts to break down over time and all of these factors are exacerbated by heat. Very high temperatures can burn out chips almost instantly, while running hot can shorten the useful life of a part, so the cooler we can make these parts, the better.

If you are not going to overclock your system, stock air cooling, when paired with a good case with adequate fans, should be enough to keep your system cool. If you want a quiet computer then components designed for passive (fan-less) cooling can be paired with very low noise case fans (or a well-vented case). In general, high-end parts will require more attention to cooling.

To keep your system at a proper operating temperature, you can monitor vital components with software (which usually comes with your motherboard). If you are seeing high temps, make sure the interior of your case is dust free, and remember that most cooling solutions can not reduce the temperature of your computer parts below room temperature.  Of course, unless you happen to have your computer outdoors in a climate such as the Sahara, room temperature will be well within the thermal limits of any component on your computer.

Which brings us to overclocking. It's specialty cooling solutions that make overclocking possible, a processor that might run stable at a maximum of 3.3 GHz at 60C could hit speeds as high as 5 GHz with specialized cooling systems.  A sensible person wanting a 20% overclock could add a special fan/heatsink to his CPU and some extra case fans. An enthusiast seeking a major overclock might go with a water-cooling solution for the CPU and GPU and sometimes other chips.  The real fanatics have been known to use liquid nitrogen or total immersion in pure water or oil.  You should not try any of the more extreme solutions unless you really know what you're doing.

=== Price ===
Today, there are a wide array of hardware components and peripherals tailored to fit every home computing need and budget. With all these options to choose from, it can be a bit overwhelming if you've never bought computer parts before. Shop around and remember to factor in shipping and handling, and taxes. Some places may be priced a bit higher, but offer perks such as free shipping, limited warranties, or 24-hour tech support. Many websites, such as [http://www.cnet.com CNET] and [http://www.zdnet.com ZDNet] offer comprehensive reviews, user ratings, and links to stores, including price comparisons. 

Since prices for any given part are always falling, it’s tempting to just wait until the part you want goes down in price. Unfortunately the reason prices decline is that better/faster parts are coming out all the time, so the part you want this year that costs $500 may well be $200 next year, but by that time you won’t want it any more, you’ll want the new, better part that still costs $500. At some point you’ve got to get on the bus and ride, even if the prices are still falling.

Usually the best bet is to buy just behind the bleeding edge, where, typically, you can get 90% of the performance of the top of the line part for 50% or 60% of the price. That last 10% is very expensive and if you don’t need it, you can save a lot of money with the second-tier part. 

It's a good idea to think about future upgradeability when selecting some components. While the computer that you're building today may be fine for your current needs you may want to upgrade it later. So look for components that support the newest standards and have room for future expansion, like a motherboard that will allow you to fit more memory than you are planning to use, or a case that has room for extra hard drives. If your current machine is maxed out the only possible upgrade is often a new machine.

You may also find that by over-specifying in some areas you can save money on others, e.g. if you don't currently need fantastic sound but you do need IEEE1394 (Firewire, iLink) then you might want to purchase a sound card anyway as some of the higher end sound cards also have a IEEE1394 port.

=== Performance ===
If money is no object, this is an easy question; just buy the most powerful components you can find. If, like most of us, there are limits to what you can/want to spend, then focus on those areas where more powerful parts will pay off for you and scrimp on others. Always look for that sweet spot on the price/performance curve where you get the most bang for your buck.

== Primary components ==
These are the components that will be the core of your new computer. It is impractical to put together a PC compatible computer without these components and a bare set of peripherals.

=== Chassis (case) &amp; power supply ===
{{Wikipedia| ATX#Power_supply}}
{{Wikipedia| Power supply unit (computer)}}

In earlier eras most cases were beige, and since most components drew far less power than similar components do now, power supplies received little attention. Recently, however, cases for the home market have become considerably more elaborate, with lights, side windows, glow-in-the-dark cables and other shiny/glowing embellishments. Cases now come in a plethora of styles and colors to suit anyone's taste. And as current components require much more power, power supply quality and size is an important issue.

If you are only building an office computer, the style of case will be of little concern to you. You might want an inexpensive ATX case (ATX is a specification which refers to the size of the motherboard. Any ATX motherboard, and the parts designed therefore, will fit in any ATX case), and an inexpensive power supply as you won't be running a high-end processor or graphics card. As a guide, you’ll want a power supply with a rating of more than 300 watts; any less won’t reliably power modern components. Most case/PSU bundles are adequate, but tend to feature a lower quality power supply than those that are sold separately from cases. If possible, avoid power supplies with sleeve bearing fans, as these are of considerably lesser quality.

Before purchasing any PSU, make sure that the supplied wattage is sufficient for your components. Power requirements are usually listed in the manuals that came with your components. It is important to note a power supply's total power, and the power at each voltage: 3.3, 5 and 12V. If any of these do not meet your requirements, the rest of the specifications don't matter.

Some companies have calculators to help you determine what your power supply needs are; if you are the type to just plug in the numbers without reading the details, you should buy a power supply that is 1.5 to 2 times the wattage that results from these calculators.

For a quiet system, you can choose a fan-less power supply -- more expensive but well worth it if noise is a concern, but be sure to monitor system temperatures to make sure cooling is adequate.

For cases and power supply here are some things to consider:

==== Form factor ====
Form factor is the specification that provides the physical measurements for the size of components and where mounting devices for them are located.

* [[Wikipedia:EATX|EATX]] or Extended ATX boards are 12&quot;x13&quot;. This format is almost exclusive to workstation computers.
* [[Wikipedia:ATX|ATX]] is the most common form factor and is the de facto standard.  In this form factor the motherboard is (usually) vertically mounted for more space and more efficient cooling than some other standards.
* [[Wikipedia:microATX|microATX]], or µATX, is smaller than standard ATX, but at the cost of fewer expansion slots.  Many cases that support ATX also allow micro-ATX. Flex ATX is even smaller than micro-ATX, but only allows 2 expansion slots. 
* [[Wikipedia:WTX|WTX]] is intended for workstations and servers. Note: WTX has been [[wikipedia:WTX|discontinued as of 2008]]. 
* [[Wikipedia:BTX (computers)|BTX]] is another formfactor designed for more efficient cooling. 
** '''PicoBTX''' 8&quot;x10.5&quot;
** '''MicroBTX''' up to 10.4&quot;x10.5&quot;
** '''BTX''' up to 12.8&quot;x10.5&quot;
* [[Wikipedia:Mini-ITX|Mini-ITX]] is even smaller than BTX, at 6.75&quot; square.
* [[Wikipedia:NLX (motherboard form factor)|NLX]]

Many OEM computers use non-standard form factors. Be sure to choose a motherboard compatible with your case's form factor.

The Mini-ITX form factor is much different in important ways unlike its relatives the Micro-ATX and the Flex-ATX. The mainboard size can be up to 170mm x 170 mm which is smaller than the Flex and Micro-ATX can be. Usually at less than 450 watts, the Mini-ITX PSU is energy efficient(but you may not be able to use high power GPU's and to a lesser extent , CPU's). The Mini-ITX is also backward-compatible with the Flex/Micro-ATX models

==== Number of storage drive spaces ====
Internal hard drives/floppy drives (which go in the small 3.5&quot; bays) and internal CD/DVD drives (which go in the large 5.25&quot; bays) take up space in the case, so make sure you consider how many drives you will need and what size slot they require.  Note that optical drives and floppy drives will need what are called &quot;external&quot; slots (meaning they have a hole in the case through which their face can be accessed), while hard drives do not need to be manipulated manually often, so they can usually go into an &quot;internal&quot; slot.  This is not to be confused with an external drive, which doesn't go into the case at all.

Note that it's possible to buy adapters to fit items that go in small bays (usually hard drives) into large bays. It is, however, not possible to do the reverse.

==== Power rating  ====

The power supply unit (PSU) you choose needs to supply enough stable DC power to all the components and even to some of the peripherals. It needs also to be consistent, by complying with accurate standard voltages, i.e. the 12 volt rail needs to supply 12 volts (within normal tolerances of 10% or so) steadily under any foreseeable load, likewise the 3 and 5v rails at their respective voltages. Cheap power supplies tend to fall down in these areas. There are several tech-heavy websites that actually throw a multimeter on the PSU in the course of a review, seek these out and make sure you select a quality PSU.

In selecting a power supply, check carefully that it has the power feeds you need, e.g. six-pin PCI power, 20 vs. 24-pin motherboard connectors, etc. If you are planning on running two or more video cards in SLI (NVIDIA) or Crossfire (AMD) mode, make sure your power supply is approved for that. Both companies have certification programs.

There are several calculators that try to help you select an adequate PSU for your system, such as:

* http://web.aanet.com.au/SnooP/psucalc.php
* http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psucalculator.jsp

Choose an efficient PSU. Efficient PSUs run cooler and more quietly and thus do not create as much noise (important if you plan to sleep (or think) in the same room with it or use it as a media center PC). They also reduce the wastage on energy. 

If your budget allows, consider opting for a modular PSU. These have connectors that can be added or removed, which allows for more versatility and also reduces clutter.
The power supply also has an exhaust fan that is responsible for cooling the power supply, as well as providing a hot air exhaust for the entire case. Some power supplies have two fans to promote this effect. 

It is important to buy a power supply that can accommodate all of the components involved. Some may argue that it is the most important part of a computer, and therefore it is worth spending the money to get a decent one.

More information about this can be found at [http://www.silentpcreview.com/article28-page1.html &lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0066cc&quot;&gt;Silent PC Review&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;], [http://www.overclockers.com.au/wiki/Power_Supply_Unit &lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0066cc&quot;&gt;OCAU Wiki&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;], among others.

==== Fans ====
[[
Image:Slotluefter_(smial).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A supplemental fan.  This one mounts in an unused expansion card slot.]]

Most cases mount one or more case fans, distinct from the fans that may be attached to the power supply, video card and CPU. The purpose of a case mounted fan is to move air through the system and carry excess heat out. This is why some cases may have two or more fans mounted in a push-pull configuration (one fan pulls cool outside air in, the other pushes hot interior air out). The more air these fans can move, the cooler things will generally be. 

Fans for case cooling currently come in two common sizes, 80&amp;nbsp;mm and 120&amp;nbsp;mm, and computer cases tend to support one size or the other. The larger 120&amp;nbsp;mm fans spin more slowly while moving a given volume of air, and slower fans are usually quieter fans, so the 120&amp;nbsp;mm fans are generally preferred, even though they cost a little more. Good 80&amp;nbsp;mm fans can still be fairly quiet, so while fan size is a factor, it shouldn't be a deal-breaker if the case has other features you like.

Make sure the power plug on the chosen case fan is supported by your motherboard; 3- and 4-pin Molex connectors are common. Fans can also be powered directly by the PSU, but in that configuration, the motherboard can't control or report the fan's speed.

Variable speed fans with built-in temperature sensing are available, but they may need to be specially ordered from an electronics supply warehouse.  They also may not have power plugs attached to their wire leads, but this can be remedied by a competent technician.  Variable speed fans tend to run quieter than constant speed fans, as they only move as much air as needed to maintain a set temperature within the case or the power supply box.  Under typical operating conditions they may be barely audible.

Since fans run continuously when the computer is turned on, bearing selection may be important for long life.  The least expensive fans use '''sleeve bearings'''.  As the fan ages, the lubricant in the sleeve bearing dries out and eventually the bearing wears, allowing the fan blade to nutate or vibrate, making it very noisy.  In severe cases the bearing may seize and the fan will stop turning entirely, possibly jeopardizing the computer when ventilation fails.  The most expensive fans tend to be those that use '''ball bearings''', but they also have very long service lives.  It isn't uncommon for a ball bearing fan to run continuously for 7 to 10 years&amp;nbsp;— possibly longer than the useful technological life of the computer within which it is mounted.  Ball bearing fans tend to be slightly noisier than sleeve bearing fans.  A fairly recent type of fan bearing is a '''magnetic''' or '''&quot;maglev&quot;''' bearing, which uses a magnetic field to suspend the fan rotor without physical contact.  Such fans exhibit practically zero bearing wear and barring a failure in their motor drive components, have essentially an infinite service life.  Maglev bearings also tend to be completely silent, and when used in a variable speed fan, can produce practically silent ventilation.

=== CPU (processor) ===

We discuss choosing a CPU in the next chapter,
[[How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Choosing the parts/CPU]].

=== Motherboard ===
[[Image:Asus_a8n_VMCSM02.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A PC motherboard: IDE connectors and the motherboard power connector (white with large holes) are on the left edge. Between them and the large quadratic CPU socket in the lower middle are the longish RAM sockets. The extension slots are above the CPU socket (two white, one black) and the ports for external devices are on the right edge.]]

The motherboard is a very important part of your computer. The difference between a cheap and a quality motherboard is typically around $100.  A good motherboard allows a modest CPU and RAM to run at maximum efficiency whereas a bad motherboard restricts high-end products to run only at modest levels.  

There are six things one must consider in choosing a motherboard: CPU interface, Chipset, IDE or SATA support, Expansion slot interfaces, and other connectors.  One must also make sure that the motherboard is of a form factor compatible with the case.

==== CPU interface ====
The CPU interface is the &quot;plug&quot; that your processor goes into.  For your processor to physically fit in the motherboard, the interface must be an '''exact match''' to your processor.  Intel currently has two mainstream formats, the LGA 2011-v3 for their current i7 Extreme/Xeons processors  (i7-5820K or i7-59xx) or the LGA 2011 supporting their older (cannot be interchanged)high-end Core i7 39XX and 49xx CPUs (as well as Xeon CPUs for servers), the LGA 1150 for the current generation desktop Core i5 and i7 series, and LGA1155 for the previous generation core i5/i7 processors(Ivy Bridge).AMD currently uses four sockets: AM3+, AM3, FM1, and FM2.  The AM3 and AM3+ sockets are compatible with DDR3 RAM. The FM1 and FM2 sockets are used for AMD's line of A-series APU processors, which are also compatible with DDR3.

Check with the motherboard manufacturer to ensure that the slot on the motherboard will support the CPU you want to use. It is important to know whether the motherboard's bus can support the  exact CPU you plan on using.

If the motherboard, CPU, and heatsink/fan are not compatible and installed correctly, you can destroy the CPU and/or the motherboard in a matter of seconds.  Most modern processors come with a stock cooling fan which will work well at stock speeds, stick with this if you have any doubts.

==== Chipset ====

The function of BIOS is highly important. Some BIOS feature crash proof functions essential for updating the firmware. Other motherboards allow BIOS control of overclocking of CPU, RAM and Graphics card which are much more stable and safer for overclocking. Newer BIOS have temperature controls, and functions that shut down the computer if the temperature gets too high.

The CPU chipset is also important. Some low-end motherboards use cheaper chipsets(low-end). These have  limited ports and features.

For instance , take the support of SATA 3 and USB 3 ports. The low-end H81 chipset supports only 2 of these , while the high-end Z97 supports 6 of them.

==== IDE (ATA) or SATA interface ====
Used for connecting hard and optical drives, most motherboards used to have two parallel, 40 pin IDE interface connectors which are now mostly used for backwards compatibility if they are present. These old PATA (parallel ATA) connections have been largely replaced by SATA (Serial ATA) connections for hard drives and optical drives. SATA connections are simple - one plug, one cable, one device. 

In the older PATA/IDE standard up to two devices could be connected to each port in a Master/Slave configuration. A 44 wire ribbon cable was used for this connection with three connectors, one on each end and one in the middle (actually slightly off center). One end was plugged into the motherboard connection and the other end plugged into the first (or only) device. If two devices are connected the second is connected to the middle connection. The device plugged into the end must be configured as a master (usually via a jumper on a set of pins on the device) while the second must be configured as a slave – OR both must be configured as “cable select”.

Two devices connected on the same IDE port can contend for access to the bus, causing a reduction in the effective speed of the drives. The newer serial ATA (SATA) interface has four or more separate motherboard connections that allow independent access and can increase the speed at which hard drives work. The cables are also narrower, improving the flow of air inside the case.

The support for older (PATA) IDE drives is starting to disappear. The new G/Q/P 965 chipset series from Intel completely dropped support for such devices. Nevertheless, many motherboard makers are still including an additional IDE controller on their boards, and it still remains possible to buy an extra PCI IDE controller.

==== Expansion slot interfaces ====
[[Image:PCIExpress.jpg|thumb|right|300px|PCI Express slots (from top to bottom: x4, x16, x1 and x16), compared to a traditional 32-bit PCI slot (bottom)]]
Old motherboards may have one or more the following slots:
* AGP - for graphics cards (ranging from AGP 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x)
* PCI - for expansion cards and low-end graphics cards

Due to the evolution of new graphics cards on the serial PCI-Express Technology, current newer motherboards have the following connections:

* '''PCI-Express(Gen 1/2/3) 16x/8x/4x''' for mainstream graphics cards (PCI Express Gen 1 x16 is 4 times speed of AGP 8x)
* '''PCI-Express(Gen 1/2/3) 1x''' for faster expansion cards (replacing older PCI)
* '''PCI''' for use of old expansion cards (will eventually be phased out)

Older AGP 8x graphics cards are generally being discontinued in favor of PCI-Express 16x, as the speed and efficiency is about 4 times that of the AGP 8x technology.  Old PCI cards are either now built into the motherboard (for sound cards, LAN cards, IEEE 1394 firewire and USB 2.0 interfaces) or becoming PCI-Express variants.

==== Other connectors ====
[[Image:USB_Male_Plug_Type_A.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Male USB &quot;A&quot; connector]]
; '''Universal Serial Bus (USB)''': In addition to the USB 2.0 ports provided on the back panel, most motherboards will have connectors for additional ports, either on the front of the case or in a panel that fits where a PCI card might otherwise be connected. USB 2.0 ports (and be sure that your chosen motherboard supports the faster 2.0 standard) are used for connecting various peripherals such as printers, external hard drives etc. USB connectors are also used for connecting MP3 players, some cameras and an assortment of less serious devices like fans, Nerf missile launchers and drink warmers. Given the growing popularity of USB devices, the more ports your motherboard supports, the better.

USB 3.0 ports are now available on the majority of motherboards and they are even faster than USB 2.0&amp;nbsp;— up to 5&amp;nbsp;Gbps. Although the majority of keyboards , mice and other such devices use USB2 , almost all HDD's available now support the USB 3.0 standard as they are much faster under that.USB 3.0 ports are backwards compatible and can be used with USB 1 or 2 devices, although these will not receive the benefit of USB 3.0 speeds.

[[Image:SerialPort_ATX.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Subminiature D9-M serial port connector]]
; '''Serial (COM) or parallel (printer) ports''': Use of traditional 25-pin subminiature D parallel printer ports and RS-232 9-pin subminiature D serial ports has been waning since the early 1990s since the introduction of the Universal Serial Bus. Many motherboards no longer offer parallel ports&amp;nbsp;— formerly used almost exclusively for connecting printers&amp;nbsp;— altogether, while serial ports, which once numbered as many as four, are now usually solitary. The principal use for serial ports once was to connect to a mouse or an external modem; both of these devices now connect via USB. Unless you are connecting old peripheral hardware, these ports will be of minimal importance.  Even so, USB-to-Parallel and USB-to-Serial adapter cables are available, allowing late model computers to communicate with older peripherals

[[Image:Firewire6-pin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Firewire connector]]

; '''IEEE-1394 Firewire''': Firewire ports are principally used for connecting DV (Digital Video) cameras and external hard drives. This technology got a foothold because it was much faster than USB 1.0 and 1.1. With the near-ubiquity of USB 2.0, however, Firewire 400, the original, and still the most common IEEE-1394 implementation, was actually a little slower. For this reason, and in spite of the existence of a faster but seldom implemented Firewire 800 specification, Firewire is obsolete. Like USB, most motherboards that support Firewire will have one or more external ports on the back panel and the ability to connect one or more additional ports. One or two Firewire ports will suffice for most users.

Note that, regardless of the motherboard's native support, additional ports of all kinds can always be added via a PCI or PCI-E 3 expansion card.

=== Memory ===
The amount of random access memory (RAM) to use has become a fairly simple choice. Unless one is building on a very restricted budget, one just has to choose between installing 4 or 8 gigabytes. 4 gigabyte of RAM is plenty for most modern operating systems, but all of them will run a little faster with 8 or 16 gigabytes. While 32-bit operating systems can address 4 gigabytes, they can utilize little more than three gigabytes as system RAM (actually 4 gigabytes minus Video RAM minus overhead for other devices). If one wishes to utilize the full 4 (or more) gigabytes of RAM, one needs to install a 64-bit operating system. It really comes down to a financial decision. Some specialized applications may profit from more than 8 gigabytes of RAM. If one plans on using such, make sure to check that both the operating system and the motherboard will accommodate the amount of RAM one has in mind. One might also choose to get 4 gigabyte of high quality RAM over 8 gigabytes of lesser quality, especially if one plans to overclock , though that is quite rare now.. 

Another thing to consider when choosing the amount of RAM for one's system is the graphics card. Most motherboard-integrated graphics chips and PCI Express graphics cards marketed with the &quot;Turbo Cache&quot; feature will use system memory to store information related to rendering graphics; this system memory is generally not available at all to the operating system. On average, these graphics processors will use between 64 megabytes and 512 megabytes of system memory for rendering purposes.

The actual type of RAM one will need depends on the motherboard and chipset one gets. Old motherboards use DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM or DDR2. DDR3(DDR4 in some cases) is the current industry standard. Chip sets that use dual-channel memory require one to use two identical&amp;nbsp;— in terms of size and speed&amp;nbsp;— RAM modules. 

For older motherboards(ones before the Core i series) , the RAM should usually operate at the same clock speed as the CPU's Front Side Bus (FSB). The motherboard may not be able to run RAM slower than the FSB, and using RAM faster than the FSB will simply have it run at the same speed as the FSB. Buying low-latency RAM will help with overclocking the FSB, which can be of use to users who want to get more speed from their systems. This won't apply for motherboards using Core i series , as the Front Speed Bus has been replaced with QPI(QuickPath Interconnect)

If one is upgrading an existing computer, it is best to check if one's machine requires specific kinds of RAM. Many computer OEMs, such as Gateway and Hewlett-Packard, require custom RAM, and generic RAM available from most computer stores may cause compatibility problems in such systems.

Overclocking of RAM is possible , but you will have to keep the same precautions(actually more) for RAM. If your RAM temperatures get too high , they can get damaged. For this purpose , there are dedicated RAM coolers that can be used , but most will not find any need for them. The benefit of overclocking RAM , unlike overclocking your CPU , is limited to a few applications.

==== Labeling of RAM ====
RAM is labeled by its memory size in megabytes (MB) and clock speed (or bandwidth).



For example , 

# DDR4-2133 8 GB is a 8GB DDR4 stick running at 2133 MHz
# DDR3L-1600 4 GB is a low-power DDR3 stick running at 1600 MHz. Commonly seen in laptops , but also seen in some desktops.
DDR RAM has 4 versions: DDR (also DDRI), DDR2 (or DDRII) ,  DDR3 and DDR4. DDR and DDR2 are currently obsolete.
# DDR4 supports DDR4-2133 and higher.
# DDR3 supports DDR3-1333 to DDR3-3000(generally overlocked).
# DDR2 supports DDR2-400, DDR2-533, DDR2-667, DDR2-800, DDR2-1066
# DDR supports DDR-200, DDR-266, DDR-333, DDR-400 (mainstream) and DDR-533 (rare)
DDR RAM can be labeled in two different ways. It can be labeled by approximate bandwidth; as an example, 400MHz-effective DDR RAM has approximately 3.2&amp;nbsp;GB/s of bandwidth, so it is commonly labeled as PC3200. It can also be labeled by its effective clock speed; 400&amp;nbsp;MHz effective DDR RAM is also known as DDR-400. There is also DDR and DDR2 labeled as PC and PC2.
* 256MB DDR-400 = 256MB PC 3200 RAM
* 256MB DDR2-400 = 256MB PC2 3200 RAM
SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM) is labelled by its clock speed in megahertz (MHz). For example, PC133 RAM runs at 133&amp;nbsp;MHz. SDRAM is obsolete, as all new motherboards have withdrawn support for SDRAM. It is now superseded by the more efficient DDR3/4 RAM.
* 128MB SD-133 = 128MB PC133 RA
=== Hard drive and SSD===
[[
Image:Hdd_medalist.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A hard drive]]
Things to consider when shopping for a hard drive or SSD:

; Interface 
: The interface of a drive is how the hard drive communicates with the rest of the computer. The following hard drive interfaces are available:
:* '''[[w:Advanced Technology Attachment|Parallel IDE]] drives''' (PATA, also known as ATA or IDE) use cables that can be distinguished by their wide 40-pin connector, colored first-pin wire, and usually gray &quot;ribbon&quot; style cables. This technology is largely obsolete because SATA uses thinner cables, eliminates contention for the IDE bus that can occur when two PATA drives are attached to the same connector, and promises faster drive access. SSD's are generally not available for IDE , as they are too slow for a SSD(one notable exception is Transcand as of November 2014).   
:* '''[[w:SATA|SATA]] drives''' have the advantages outlined above. If you want Serial ATA, you will either need to purchase a motherboard that supports it (all newer motherboards do), or purchase a PCI card that will allow you to connect your hard drive. Note that some older motherboards will not allow you to install Windows XP to a Serial ATA hard drive. There are 3 types of SATA. SATA 1 provides up to about 150 MB/s , SATA 2 provides about 300MB/s , SATA3 provides up to about 600 MB/s. Most new computers and HDD's come in SATA 3 , but older computers may use SATA 2/1. Although they are both backwards and forward comparable , SSD's should be used in SATA 3 since they are too fast for SATA 2 or 1.
:* '''[[w:SCSI|SCSI]]''', although more expensive and less user friendly, is usually worthwile on high performance workstations and servers. Few consumer desktop motherboards built today support SCSI, and when building a new computer, the work needed to implement SCSI may be outweighed by the relative simplicity and performance of IDE and SATA. SCSI hard drives typically reach rotational speeds of up to 15,000 RPM, and are more expensive.
:* '''[[w:USB|USB]]''' can be used for connecting external drives. An external drive enclosure can convert an internal drive to an external drive.
:*'''[[w:IEEE1394|IEEE1394]]''' This format is most commonly known as &quot;Firewire&quot; (Apple) or &quot;I link&quot; from Sony. The theoretical speed of IEEE1394 is double that of USB 1.0.
:*PCI-E uses the PCI lanes of your computer. These lanes can be used to connect premium SSD's , and they are much faster than SATA-based SSD's.
====SSD====
SSD is a hard storage systems that use flash memory rather than rotational platters. Because of this , they make virtually no noise and generate far lesser heat than a HDD. If you plan to upgrade a computer , it is an excellent idea to replace an HDD with an SSD as the performance of the computer can be boosted by a wide margin. However , there are some important drawbacks.
# They are significantly more expensive than a comparable HDD.
#  SSD sizes top out at about 2 terabytes , while comparably , for HDD , it is about 8 TB.
# They cannot last forever. The majority of SSD's use NAND cells , which will wear about after a certain amount of writes. However , this problem is mitigated to a lot of extent by using technologies so that all cells wear out at the same time. Also , good SSD's have huge data life (150 TB) and high warranty period(10 years).
There are some important precautions to note if you do buy a SSD.
#'''Do not defragment the drive!''' SSD , unlike HDD , does not need to get defragmented and will instead cause unnecessary writes and can wear out the drive faster. If you do use a SSD in a Windows OS before Windows 7 , make sure to disable automatic disk defragging. Windows 8 already identifies the drive and makes necessary optimizations.
#Use SATA 3. As outlined above , using SATA 2 or below reduces speed. If you can afford it , go for a PCI-E SSD as they are faster.
; [[w:Cache#Disk_buffer|Cache]] : The cache of a Hard drive is a faster media than the hard drive itself and is normally 8MB (low end and laptop drives), 16MB, 32MB (standard desktop drives), or 64MB (high end, high capacity desktop drives). The existence of a cache increases the speeds of retrieving short bursts of information, and also allows pre-fetching of data. Larger cache sizes generally result in faster data access.

; Form factor
:* 3.5 inch drives are usually used in desktops.
:* 2.5 inch drives are usually used in laptops.
A 2.5 inch disk can be used in desktops using adaptors , but not vice-versa.

; Capacity : The smallest desktop drives that are widely available hold about 160 gig of data, although the largest drives available on the market can contain 6TB (6072GB). Note that the advertised capacity is usually more than the actual size due to the binary differences in calculation. Few people will need disks this large - for most people, somewhere in the range of 300-750GB will be sufficient. The amount of space you will need can depend on many factors, such as how many high-end games and programs you want to install, how many media files you wish to store, or how many high-quality videos you want to render. It is usually better to get a hard drive with a capacity larger than you anticipate using, in case you need more in the future. If you run out of space, you can always add an additional hard drive using any free IDE or Serial ATA connector, or through an external interface, such as USB or FireWire.

; Rotational Speed : The speed at which the hard drives platters spin. Most laptop (2.5 inch) drives spin at 5400 RPM, while common desktop drives come in at 7200. There are PATA and SATA drives that spin at 10,000 RPM and some SCSI drives hit 15,000. However drives above 7,200 RPM usually have limited capacity, and a much higher price than comparable 7,200RPM drives, making such drives advisable only when the fastest possible speeds are required. SSD's do not have rotational components.

; Noise and Heat : Modern hard drives are fairly quiet in operation though some people are sensitive to the faint hum and occasional buzz they do make. If your HDD is loud, it’s time to think about replacing it. Hard drives will also throw some heat and adequate air circulation should be provided, usually by case fans. There is software available that will allow you to monitor both the health and temperature of your hard drive(s), it’s a good idea to check from time to time. SSD's do not generate noise and heat as HDD does because they have no rotational parts. Try not to heat the HDD above 50C.

; Warranty : Many manufactures offer warranties ranging from 30 days (typically OEM) up to five years. It is well worth spending an extra few dollars to get the drive that carries a longer warranty. Good quality SSD can provide up to 10 years warranty(like Samsung 850 Pro).

== Secondary components ==
These components are important to your computer, but are not as central as the Core Components.

=== Video output ===
Some form of video output must be provided by the hardware of a computer as to permit the use of an image display. The majority of home and office computers, which predominantly use 2D graphics for office applications and web surfing can use an 'onboard' or integrated graphic processor which will be included on most low to mid range motherboards. For gaming, or 3D modeling, a good quality graphics/video card may be needed and relying on one will undoubtedly permit a simpler upgradeable path. Then there is also high computational tasks from running physics models to process large blocks of data has created a move towards modular Graphical processors units (GPU) that can even be stacked to grant more power, a trend that predates even multiple core cpus.

Currently, two companies dominate the 3D graphics accelerator market; nVIDIA and AMD (formerly known as ATI). nVIDIA and AMD build their own graphics products, and license their technologies to other companies. Both companies make a complete line of cards with entries at every price/performance level, and each brand has its own supporters. Video cards have their own RAM, and many of the same rules that govern the motherboard RAM field apply here: to a point, the more RAM, and the faster it is, the better the performance will be. Most applications require at least 512MB of video RAM, although 1GB is rapidly becoming the new standard. On the other end, 4GB to 8GB video cards top the consumer end of the video card market.  As a rule of thumb, if you want a high end video card, you need a minimum of 2GB of video memory -- preferably 4GB.  Don't be fooled, though; memory is only part of the card and the actual video processor is more important than the memory. 

It is generally better to choose your video card based on your own research, as everyone has slightly different needs. Many video card and chip makers are known to measure their products' performances in ways that you may not find practical. A good video card is often much more than a robust 3D renderer; be sure to examine what you want and need your card to do, such as digital (DVI) output, TV output, multiple-monitor support, built-in TV tuners and video input.  Another reason you need to carefully research is that manufacturers will often use confusing model numbers designed to make a card sound better than it is to sell it better.  For example, the NVIDIA GeForce GT series claim to be part of the current line up (as of December 2014, the 700/900-series of cards), however, they are inadequate for modern gaming, in many cases, and perform much closer to old, mid-end 500 and 600 series cards than to the GTX 700 series cards. 

Newer technologies such as SLI and Crossfire allow the use of two(up to 4) video cards to render the same video scene, similar to using two CPUs or a dual-core CPU. These systems tend to be expensive, as only some video cards offer this option, and you'll need two of them. However, it can be a useful upgrade path to consider. A SLI-capable motherboard is usually not much more expensive than the regular model, and will work fine with a single video card. You can use it with one card now, and buy another one in the future (which will probably be much cheaper by then), which means you will take advantage of your old video card too. If you do plan to use 2 or more graphics cards , make sure that your PSU is up to the task by making sure that it has enough power and also making sure that it has the requisite ports required.

If you have a CPU that does not have a graphics processor(like Haswell Extreme(Intel) or Athlon(AMD) , then you will need to buy a discrete video card(otherwise your computer will simply not work!)
==== Interface ====
There are four different current graphics card interfaces: integrated, PCI, AGP and PCI-Express.

Most retail computers will ship with an integrated graphics card. It is important to understand that an integrated graphics card uses the system's RAM, and relies heavily on your system's CPU. This will mean slow performance for graphic-intensive software, such as games. Most motherboards that have integrated graphics will also have one of the other three slot interfaces available so it isn't hard to place a new card to suit your needs if the need ever arises. 

Older video cards use the standard PCI slots that are now growing obsolete due to limited speed and memory. These cards are needed for a few rare systems lacking an AGP or PCI-E slot (usually low end desktop systems designed to be cheap.)  They are also useful for adding additional video cards to a system.

Although the AGP standard has now, by and large, been superseded by PCI-E, the cards are still available as are a few motherboards that support them. There are 4 different speed and bandwidths of AGP, 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x. While 8x is the fastest and most common for high end products, the true performance of your AGP card is limited by the lower AGP value of your graphics card and motherboard. For example, an AGP 8x card on a 4x motherboard can only run at up to 4x. AGP has mostly been phased out and there will not be an AGP 16x due to technical limitations.

The newest trend in graphics card is the PCI-Express (not to be confused with PCI-X) system that supports up to 16x speeds. While most motherboards have only one PCI-E 3 16x slot, those with two such slots can combine the power of two video cards using technologies known as SLI for NVidia, and CrossFire for ATI. However, you will have to match the video cards to a motherboard supporting the multiple card technology of choice, and use two similar video cards that both support dual video cards.

Keep in mind that to provide best picture quality your graphics card must be capable of displaying the same resolution as your LCD display's native resolution.

=== CD/DVD ===
[[Image:CD-ROM_drive.jpg|thumb|right|200px|CD-RW writer]]

Optical drives have progressed a long way in the past few years, and you can now easily purchase DVD writers that are capable of burning 9GB of data to a disk for an insignificant amount of money.  Even if you don't plan on watching or copying DVDs on your computer, it is still worth purchasing a burner for their superior backup capabilities.

When purchasing a DVD writer, you will want one that is capable of burning both the '+' and '-' standards, and it should also be Dual Layer compatible.  This will ensure that you can burn to almost all recordable DVDs currently on the market (the other major format, DVD-RAM is almost unused, for the most part, so don't worry about it).

==== Cleaning CD's ====
Dust can be removed from a CD's surface using compressed air or by very lightly wiping the information side with a very soft cloth (such as an eyeglass cleaning cloth) from the center of the disc in an outward direction. Wiping the information surface of any type of CD in a circular motion around the center, however, has been known to create scratches in the same direction as the information and potentially cause data loss. Fingerprints or stubborn dust can be removed from the information surface by wiping it with a cloth dampened with diluted dish detergent (then rinsing) or alcohol (methylated spirits or isopropyl alcohol) and again wiping from the center outwards, with a very soft cloth (non-linting : polyester, nylon, etc.). It is harmful, however, to use acetone, nail polish remover, kerosene, petrol/gasoline, or any other type of petroleum-based solvent to clean a CD-R; the use of petroleum based solvents will damage the polycarbonate surface and the CD-R will become unreadable.

=== Floppy drive ===

[[Image:Diskettenlaufwerk.jpg|thumb|right|150px|3.5&quot; floppy drive]]

Though Floppy drives have been made largely obsolete in recent years by devices such as USB &quot;Thumb Drives&quot; and CD writers, they are sometimes installed anyway because they are sometimes required for BIOS updates and exchanging small files with older computers. Floppy drives block air movement with wide cables, and can make computers set to check the drive take longer to start (most have an option in their BIOS to disable this.). One option to overcome the cable problem and to make it easier to install is to buy an external USB floppy drive, these are potentially a little bit faster and can be plugged into a different system (such as a laptop without a floppy drive.) However, not all systems support booting from a USB floppy drive -- most notably older motherboards. 

==== 8&quot; Floppy Disk ====

In the late 1960s IBM invented the 8-inch floppy disk. This was the first floppy disk design. Used in the 1970s and as a read-only disk it had storage-write restrictions to the people it was distributed to. However, later on a read-write format came about.

Today's it is near impossible to to find a computer that uses 8-inch floppy disks or even obtain the necessary hardware and consumables.

==== 5.25&quot; Floppy Disk: ====

This disk was introduced some time later, and was used extensively in the 1980s. These also have fallen in disuse, less rare than the previous format but also no longer supported by contemporaneous hardware.  

==== 3.5&quot; Floppy Disk: ====

This storage medium is the most common of those listed in this section, still in somewhat wide use today. Floppy disks hold from 400 KB up to 1.44 MB. The most common types found are 720 KB (low-density) and 1.44 MB (high-density). Floppy disks have largely been superseded as a transfer medium, first by rewritable CD-ROM (CD-RW) drives and now by flash drives, but are still used as backup storage for small amounts of data. A fair proportion also survive as original installation media for older software applications.

Several other floppy types and sizes have been introduced, such as 2&quot;, 2.5&quot; and several competing 3&quot; and 3.25&quot; formats as well as the ~120 MB SuperDrive which was compatible with standard 3.5&quot; disks, but none of these were ever very popular and all are quite rare now. Recently, it has become increasingly common for computers to be manufactured without floppy disk drives, and even some motherboards lack standard floppy disk connection headers, so it is expected that the floppy disk will soon fade completely from general use

It should be noted  that floppy disks are not suitable for long term storage of data, even in a backup role. Never keep your only copy of an important file on a floppy disk.

=== Sound card ===
Most motherboards have built-in sound features. These are often adequate for most users. However, you can purchase a good sound card and speakers at relatively low cost - a few dollars at the low end can make an enormous difference in the range and clarity of sound.  Also, these onboard systems tend to use more system resources, so you are better off with a real sound card for gaming.

Sound card quality depends on a few factors. The digital-analog conversion (DAC) is generally the most important stage for general clarity, but this is hard to measure. Reviews, especially those from audiophile sources, are worth consulting for this; but don't go purely by specifications, as many different models with similar specs can produce completely different results. Cards may offer digital (S/PDIF) output, in which case the DAC process is moved from your sound card either to a dedicated receiver or to one built into your speakers.

Sound cards made for gaming or professional music tend to do outstandingly well for their particular purpose. In games various effects are oftentimes applied to the sound in real-time, and a gaming sound card will be able to do this processing on-board, instead of using your CPU for the task.  Professional music cards tend to be built both for maximum sound quality and low latency (transmission delay) input and output, and include more and/or different kinds of inputs than those of consumer cards.

=== Modem ===
A modem is needed in order to connect to a dial up Internet connection. A modem can also be used for faxing. Modems can attach to the computer in different ways, and can have built-in processing or use the computer's CPU for processing.

Modems with built-in processing generally include all modems that connect via a standard serial port, as well as any modems that refer to themselves as &quot;Hardware Modems&quot;.  Software Modems, or modems that rely on the CPU generally include both Internal and USB modems, or have packaging that mentions drivers or requiring a specific CPU to work.

Modems that rely on the CPU are often designed specifically for the current version of Windows only, and will require drivers that are incompatible with future Windows versions, and may be difficult to upgrade.  Software Modems are also very difficult to find drivers for non-Windows operating systems. The manufacturer is unlikely to support the hardware with new drivers after it is discontinued, forcing you to buy new hardware. Most such modems are internal or external USB, but this is not always the case.

Modems can be attached via USB, a traditional serial port, or an internal card slot. Internal and USB modems are more easily autodetected by the operating system and less likely to have problems with setup. USB and serial port modems often require an extra power supply block.

Gaming modems are normal modems that default to having a low compression setting to reduce lag, but are generally no longer used by gamers, who prefer broadband connections.

=== Network interface card ===
[[
Image:Ethernet_pci_card.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Network interface card]]
A Network interface card, or Ethernet card, is required in order to connect to a local area network or a cable or DSL modem.  These typically come in speeds of 10Mbps, 100Mbps, or 1000Mbps (gigabit); these are designated as 10Mbps, 10/100Mbps, or 10/100/1000Mbps products.  The 10/100 and 10/100/1000 parts are most commonly in use today. In many cases, one or two Ethernet adapters will be built into a motherboard. If there are none, you will have to purchase one.  These typically are inserted into a PCI slot. To get the full speed of 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet, it's best to get a motherboard with that connector built in. A typical Ethernet card usually costs around US$13.

== Peripherals ==
Anything outside the case that connects to your computer is considered a peripheral. The keyboard, mouse and monitor are pretty much the bare minimum you can go with and still be able to interact with your computer. Your choice in peripherals depends on personal preference and what you intend to do with your computer.

=== Mouse and keyboard===
There are, broadly, two types of mouse: optical and mechanical. Mechanical mice use a rubber coated ball bearing that contacts the mousepad or other surface and actually rolls around. Optical mice use a bright light and a sensor to track the movement of the mouse.

When choosing a mouse, there is generally no reason not to choose an optical mouse.  They are considerably lighter (and as such, reduce [[w:Repetitive_strain_injury|RSI]]) as they have no moving parts, they are much better at smoothly tracking movement, and they don’t require constant cleaning like ball mice (though it may be wise to brush off the lens with a q-tip or other soft tool on occasion). Make sure that you spend money on a decent-quality mouse made by companies such as Microsoft or Logitech, as lower-end optical mice will skip if moved too fast. Mice of medium-to-high quality will track your movement almost flawlessly.

Although three buttons are generally enough for operating a computer in normal circumstances, extra buttons can come in handy, as you can add set actions to each button, and they can come in handy for playing various video games.  One thing to note is that with some mice those extra buttons are not actually seen by the computer itself as extra buttons and will not work properly in games.  These buttons use software provided by the manufacturer to function.  However, it is sometimes possible to configure the software to map the button to act like a certain keyboard key so that it will be possible to use it in games in this manner.

Wireless keyboards and mice do not now display the sort of noticeable delay that they once did, and now also have considerably improved battery life. However, gamers may still want to avoid wireless input devices because the very slight delay may impact gaming activities, though some of the higher end models have less trouble with this. The extra weight of the batteries can also be an inconvenience.

=== Printer and scanner ===
For most purposes, a mid-range inkjet printer will work well for most people.  If you plan on printing photos, you will want one that is capable of printing at around 4800dpi.  Also, you will want to compare the speed of various printers, which is usually listed in ppm (pages per minute).  When choosing a printer, always check how much new cartridges cost, as replacement cartridges can quickly outweigh the actual printer's cost.  Be aware of other possible quirks as well.  For example, Epson has protection measures that make refilling your own ink cartridges more difficult because an embedded microchip that keeps track of how much ink has been used keeps the printer from seeing the cartridge as full once it has been emptied.

For office users that plan to do quite a bit of black and white printing buying a black and white laser printer is now an affordable option, and the savings and speed can quickly add up for home office users printing more than 500 pages a month.

Scanners are useful, especially in office settings, they can function with your printer as a photocopier, and with software can also interact with your modem to send Faxes.  When purchasing a Scanner, check to see how &quot;accessible&quot; it is (does it have one-touch buttons), and check how good the scanning quality is, before you leave the store if possible.

Finally, &quot;Multi-Function Centres&quot; (also called &quot;Printer-Scanner-Copiers&quot;) are often a cost-effective solution to purchasing both, as they take up only one port on your computer, and one power point, but remember that they can be a liability, since if one component breaks down, both may need to be replaced.

=== Display ===
When choosing a display for your computer, you have two choices: a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) screen, or a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen.  Both technologies have their advantages and disadvantages but CRT's, now nearly obsolete, are almost unavailable new - making the argument moot. Used CRT's on the other hand, can be had nearly for free and still work if you have the room for them.

==== LCD panels ====
Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) have the advantage of being a completely digital setup, when used with the DVI-D or HDMI digital connectors. When running at the screen's native resolution, this can result in the most stable and sharp image available on current monitors. Many LCD panel displays are sold with an analog 15-pin VGA connector or, rarely, with an analog DVI-I connector. Such displays will be a bit fuzzier than their digital counterparts, and are generally not preferred over a similarly-sized CRT.  If you want an LCD display, be sure to choose a digital setup if you can; however, manufacturers have chosen to use this feature for price differentiation.

The prime disadvantage of LCDs is &quot;dead pixels&quot;, small, failed areas on your monitor, which can be very annoying, but generally aren't covered under warranty; this can make purchasing LCD displays a financial risk.  In fact, most LCD panel manufacturers allow for a certain number of dead pixels in their product specification.

LCDs are acceptable for fast-paced gaming, but you should be sure that your screen has a fairly fast response time (of 12 ms or lower) if you want to play fast games. Nearly all flat panels sold today meet this requirement, some by a factor of 3.

When picking an LCD, keep in mind that they are designed to display at one resolution only, so, to reap the benefits of your screen, your graphics card must be capable of displaying at that resolution. That in mind, they can display lower resolutions with a black frame around the outside (which means your entire screen isn't filled), or by stretching the image (which leads to much lower quality). Running at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle will either make everything on the screen smaller, at a significant quality drop, or will display only a part of the screen at a time.

==== CRT (cathode ray tube) displays ====
The other key type of display is the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) display. While CRT technology is older, it often outperforms LCD technology in terms of color reproduction (color gamut), although LCD displays are quickly catching up. CRTs are becoming increasingly difficult to find and have almost vanished from mass-market retail. High end CRT's are still available, though they are rapidly being discontinued, and now cost a considerable amount. 

There are two types of CRT displays, ''shadow mask'' and ''aperture grill''. An aperture grill display is brighter and perfectly flat in the vertical direction, but is more fragile and has one or two mostly-unnoticeable thin black lines (support wires) running across the screen. CRTs are generally two to four times as deep as similarly-sized LCDs, and can weigh around 10 times as much. If you purchase a CRT display over the Internet, shipping is much more expensive than an LCD, due to the significantly greater weight.

Sometimes CRTs with a flat screen instead of a curved one are called &quot;flat screens&quot;.  This is not to be confused with the term &quot;flat panel&quot;, used to refer to LCDs.  In order to withstand atmospheric pressure, the glass at the front of a flat screen CRT needs to be very thick, and thus they are limited to diagonal sizes of 20 inches, or so.  A flat screen CRT will be noticeably heavier than its curved screen counterpart.

For improved contrast and readability, some CRTs were manufactured with an anti-reflection coating.  Such tubes make colors appear more vibrant and blacks appear jet black.  Also, if the user has a light from behind, such as from a lighting fixture or windows, annoying reflections on the screen will be much less noticeable.  The coating  typically consists of magnesium fluoride, the same material used to coat binocular optics and some corrective eyeglass lenses.  It is relatively soft, and must be cleaned with care, using special lens cleaning cloths or papers to prevent scratching of the coating.  Another way to clean them is with a boiled 100% cotton flannel cloth and commercial glass cleaning solution, such as Windex.  Oily fingerprints show up very clearly on coated screens, so one should avoid touching them.  With reasonable care, however, the screen may only need to be wet-cleaned once a year and in the meantime can be wiped with a soft dust cloth or brushed with a soft, natural-bristle paint brush to remove any dust that may accumulate.  If you're shopping for such a display on the used market, you will recognize it by the faint, purplish reflection of room lights and daylight. 

Lower-end CRTs use an etched glass tube face.  It gives the glass a dull, non-specular appearance that helps cut down on glare, but such tubes do not provide the high contrast and color brilliance of tubes treated with an anti-reflection coating.

Flicker in CRT's can cause headaches in some people when run at lower frequencies, so it may be ideal to pick a screen offering higher vertical refresh rates at whichever resolutions you intend to use. Most people who have problems with low frequencies (60&amp;nbsp;Hz) find it preferable to have at least 80&amp;nbsp;Hz at the intended resolution. Many won't be bothered by this at all, however.

CRT displays and early LCD displays were developed at a time when television and computers used screens with 4:3 (width x height) aspect ratios.  If your application requires a wide-screen display, even at the expense of reduced performance, a modern 16:9 aspect ratio LCD screen should be chosen instead.

=== Speakers ===
Computer loudspeaker sets come in two general varieties; 2/2.1 sets (over a wide range of quality), and &quot;surround&quot;, &quot;theater&quot;, or &quot;gaming&quot; sets with four or more speakers, which tend to be somewhat more expensive. A 2-speaker set is adequate for basic stereophonic sound.  A 2.1-speaker set adds a sub-woofer to handle low frequencies.  Low-end speakers can suffer from low bass response or inadequate amplification, both of which compromise sound quality. Powered speakers with separate sub-woofers usually cost only a little more and can sound much better. At the higher end, one should start to see features like standard audio cables (instead of manufacturer-specific ones), built in DACs, and a separate control box. 

The surround sets include a sub-woofer, and two or more sets of smaller speakers. These support 5.1 or 7.1 standards that allow sound to be mixed not only left and right, as with standard stereo speakers, but front and back and even behind the listener. Movies and video games make use of this technology to provide a full-immersion experience. Make sure your sound hardware will support 5.1 or 7.1 before buying such a speaker system.  If your budget allows, you can avoid the computer speaker market entirely and look into piecing together a set of higher-end parts. If you are buying a speaker system designed for PCs, research the systems beforehand so you can be certain of getting one that promises clarity rather than just raw power.  Speaker power is usually measured in RMS Watts. However, some cheap speakers use a different measure, Peak Music Power Output (PMPO), which appears much higher.

Headphones can offer good sound much more cheaply than speakers, so if you are on a limited budget, but want maximum quality, they should be considered first.  The advantage of headphones is that the acoustic environment between the audio driver is fully contained and controlled within the earcups and is not dependent on room acoustics.  There are even headphones which promise surround-sound, though these have not been favorably reviewed.

Now that you have selected your parts, you get to what is arguably the most fun part of the process: putting the parts together.

== Tools and equipment ==
[[Image:Cross slot screw.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Combination flanged-hex/Phillips-head screw used in computers]]
You won’t need many tools to assemble your computer, in fact the only one you must have is the screwdriver, but if you can get most of the following together, you’ll find things go a little easier. 

=== Basic tools ===
Before you begin building or refitting a computer, you should have some basic tools:

# #2 Phillips-head (cross-shaped) screwdriver
# Needle-nose pliers
# Anti-static Wrist Strap
# A large level working space

[[Image:Antistatic_wrist_strap.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An [[w:antistatic wrist strap|anti-static wrist strap]] with crocodile clip.]]

=== Optional, but useful tools ===
Some other tools and equipment can come in handy as well, such as:

# Spring action parts grabber.  
# Electrical tape
# Wire or nylon ties
# Flashlight, preferably hands-free
# A second, working computer to swap parts, look for tips, ask for help on-line, download drivers and patches, etc. - very useful
# A can of compressed air - useful when working with older parts that have collected dust. A better alternative but also more costly, is a vacuum cleaner designed for cleaning electronics.
# Magnetic screwdriver
# Zip ties or velcro ties for cable management

== Preparation ==
Proper preparation is the key to a successful build. Before you begin, make sure you have all the tools you will need, secure a clear, well-lit workspace, gather all the components you’ll be using and unpack them one at a time, verifying that everything that is supposed to be there is actually present. At this point you should leave the parts themselves in their protective anti-static bags, and assemble all the accompanying manuals. Now I know you want to get started, but trust me, ''read the manuals'', check the diagrams, make sure you understand where each part goes and how it attaches. If there is anything you don’t understand, now is the time to do a little extra Internet research or call the manufacturer with your questions.

Find a dry, well-ventilated place to do your work.  You should have plenty of light and if possible, you should choose an area without carpet on the floor, as carpet tends to generate a lot of static.  An unfurnished basement is a good work location.

Safety precautions are important for your own security. Please read the safety precautions thoroughly.
}}

=== Safety precautions ===
# Static electricity is the biggest danger to the expensive parts you are about to assemble, even a tiny shock, much too small for you to feel, can damage or ruin the delicate electronic traces, many times smaller than a human hair, that make up your CPU, RAM and other chips. It’s important to use your anti-static wrist strap to prevent damage to these components. Once you have the power supply installed in the case, clip the end of the wrist strap to the outside of the power supply. (Never plug your computer in while you are connected to it by a wrist strap.) This will ensure that you, the case and the power supply are all connected to a common ground, in other words there will be no inequality of charge that will allow a spark to jump from you to the case. It’s also helpful to have an anti-static mat to set the case and other components on.
# Nobody but you is at fault if you shock your components with static electricity. Make sure that you take the precautions in the previous paragraph to ground yourself from static electricity. (Note: if you really must work on a computer and have not got proper anti-static equipment, it is ''usually'' OK if you make sure that you do not move about much; are not wearing any static-prone clothing; handle components by the edges; and regularly (once a minute or so), touch a grounded object.). The ''case metal'' of your PC's power supply will usually be a suitable grounded object. As noted above, touch it every few minutes while you are working on your PC if you haven’t got a wrist strap.
#Turn off your computer and switch off your Power Supply at the wall before installing or removing any components - if power is flowing to components as they are installed or removed, they can be seriously damaged. In order to have a computer properly grounded, you need it plugged in at the wall but turned off at the power supply and at the wall. The neutral line may be earthed
# Never cut the grounding pin off your power cord. This &quot;safety ground&quot; stands between you and potentially lethal voltages inside the power supply.
# Be wary of sharp edges!  Many lower-end PC cases have sharp, unfinished edges.  This is especially so on interior surfaces, and where the case has been cut or punched-out.  Use care and take your time to avoid cutting your hands. If your case has this problem, a little time with some sandpaper before you begin construction can spare you a lot of pain. Be extra careful not to cut yourself when installing the I/O Shield.
# Dismantling discrete electronic components such as your Power Supply or Monitor is dangerous. They contain high voltage capacitors, which can cause a severe electric shock if you touch them. These hold a charge even when the unit is not plugged in and are capable of delivering a fatal shock.

== Construction ==
Start by putting your case down on your work surface, with the case door facing up, and open the case.

=== Motherboard ===
[[Image:ASRock_K7VT4A_Pro_Mainboard_Labeled_English.svg|center|800px]]

Find the [[w:motherboard|motherboard]] standoffs (spacers) that should have come with the case. They are screws, usually brass, with large hexagonal heads that are tapped so you can fasten screws into the top. These hold the motherboard up off the case preventing a short-circuit. Set these aside.

[[Image:Mainboard_Slotblende_V1a.JPG|thumb|right|250px|I/O Panel Shield of an ATX Motherboard]]

Remove the I/O Shield from the back of the case where the ports on the back of the motherboard will fit, and put in the I/O Shield that came with your motherboard. There may be small metal tabs on the inside of this face plate, if so you may have to adjust them to accommodate the ports on the back of the motherboard.

Some case styles make it difficult to install the motherboard or the CPU with the power supply installed. If the power supply is in your way, take it out and set it aside (we'll put it back in later).
  
Now locate the screw holes on your motherboard and find the corresponding holes on the motherboard plate (or tray) in the case. Put a standoff in each of these holes on the tray and position the motherboard so that you can see the holes in the top of the standoffs through the screw holes in the motherboard.

Now is the time to make sure the ports on the motherboard are mating with the backplate you just installed, and make any necessary adjustments. The small metal tabs are intended to make contact with the metal parts of the connections on the back of the motherboard and ground them, but you may have to bend these tabs a bit to get the ports all properly mounted, this is where those needle-nose pliers may come in handy.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Bulbgraph.png| 
If you have trouble lining up the screw holes, double check that you have the standoffs in the proper holes on the tray. With lower quality cases there are sometimes alignment problems and you may have to forgo one or two screws. If this is the case, make sure you remove the corresponding standoffs. Some combinations of motherboards and cases may also use different types of screws in different places or provide non-matching screw holes that cannot be used in a specific case.
The motherboard can possibly be damaged if you try to push it into position with the wrong set of standoffs underneath or when trying to use the wrong set of screw holes.
}}

Now fasten a screw through each of the motherboard screw holes into the standoffs underneath. These screws should be snug but not tight, there is no reason to torque down on them, hand tight is fine, otherwise you can damage the motherboard.

Once the motherboard is installed, it is time to plug the other components.

=== CPU ===
[[Image:Intel_Socket_1150_IMGP8593_smial_wp.jpg|thumb|An example of a CPU socket, LGA1150. This is the current processors for consumer Haswell desktop CPU's and some Xeons.]]
[[Image:Socket_2011_IMGP3918.jpg|thumb|LGA2011 socket. These processors are used by i7 Extreme and most Xeons. Note that LGA 2011 CPU's are not comparable with its successor(LGA 2011-3) even though they look similar and have the same number of pins.]]

Installing the CPU, and the CPU’s [[w:Heat sink|heat-sink]] and fan, are by far the most difficult steps you’ll have to complete during your build. Here, more than anywhere else, it will pay to read the instructions carefully, look at the parts, study the diagrams that came with your CPU and/or third party cooling solution, and make sure you thoroughly understand what you are going to do ''before you try to do it''. During the process, if anything does not seem to fit or make sense, put the parts down and look things over carefully before you proceed. Some operations, especially installing the heat-sink/fan combination, can require pretty firm pressure, so don’t be afraid to push a little harder if you’re sure everything is set up correctly.

The details of the installation process differ in slight but important ways for each manufacturer’s processors, and even within a manufacturer's product line. Therefore, for these details, you should rely on the instructions that are provided with the CPU. 

The two things that go wrong the most often and most expensively (minimum of a killed CPU, sometimes more) in building one's own computer are both related to the CPU and its cooler:
#Switching the computer on &quot;just to see if it works&quot; before adding any CPU cooling unit. Without cooling, CPUs heat up at extreme rates (a CPU heats up anywhere between ten times and a thousand times as fast as a cooking area on your stove!) By the time you see the first display on the screen, your CPU will already be severely overheating and might be damaged beyond repair.
#Mounting the CPU cooler improperly. Read the instructions that came with your CPU and cooler very carefully and ensure you are using all components in the correct order and correct place.

If you buy a third party cooling solution for your CPU make sure you get one that is compatible with the CPU you have. &quot;Compatibility&quot; here just means, &quot;Can you fit it in next to your RAM or whatever else is sticking up in the neighborhood.&quot; Most brands come with multiple mounting brackets that will suit many different chipsets, but it is best to check for compatibility just in case. 

After the CPU is installed in the socket and secured in place, it's time to add thermal paste and then install the cooler. The plain metal back of the CPU, which is what you're now seeing, is exactly matched by the bottom plate of the cooler. You add thermal paste ''only'' on the CPU, ''never'' on the cooler's surface. Very little is needed. The two flat metallic surfaces will spread the paste between them, and it will spread a bit more when it becomes hot. (The cooler surface may have a protective piece of film over it; don't forget to remove it. But see below for the possibility of &quot;thermal pad&quot; being supplied, instead of paste. This is rare nowadays, but ''read the instructions.'') A pea-sized dot is the amount usually advised, though some people make a thin &quot;X&quot; on the CPU surface, and some draw a line. (There are numerous videos on Youtube advocating one or another, some with photos using glass plates.) Don't overdo -- you don't want paste squeezing out the edges. Some people suggest spreading paste over the whole surface, then cleaning it off with a razor blade, then adding the pea. The idea is to close invisible imperfections in the metal. This is probably overkill, and involves extra handling of the CPU, never a good idea. Try not to touch the mating surfaces of the CPU and cooler -- the oils from your skin will impede heat transfer. You should receive a tube or applicator of thermal paste in the CPU or cooler package. If you didn't, it's readily available, and in any event will come with instructions. 

''See [http://www.arcticsilver.com/instructions.htm Arctic Silver Instructions] for more info on how to apply and remove thermal paste/grease. (It was written to be specifically for Arctic Silver paste, but the same techniques can be applied to other brands of thermal paste.)''

If using a thermal pad supplied with your cooler, make sure you remove any protective tape from the die just before installing and do not get it dirty - and do not combine thermal pads with thermal paste, it is either one or the other. Then, check that you install the cooler in the right orientation and that you set it flat on the CPU die without exerting undue pressure on any edges or corners - the latter can make small pieces of the die break off, killing the CPU.  

One option you may consider, before installing the heat-sink, is to &quot;lap&quot; the heat-sink, which means to smooth out the bottom surface.  To do this, you will need a very flat surface; a piece of thick window glass will work. Fasten your sandpaper on the flat surface, invert the heat-sink on the sandpaper and sand in small circles, applying minimum pressure. Check frequently and when you see a uniform pattern of scratches, switch to finer grained sandpaper (the numbers go up as the sandpaper is finer, so something such as 220 is coarse while 2000 will be very fine.)  Remember that you are not trying to remove any material, just polish out surface irregularities. If you get it right, you should have a surface which feels completely smooth to the touch (but don’t touch it, the oil in your fingers can cause corrosion of the fresh surface) with a mirror finish.  Some companies producing heat-sinks lap the surface themselves, so if the surface already looks like a perfect mirror, leave it alone.  A lapped heat-sink is more effective as it will have better surface contact with the chip. 

Tighten the cooler using only the specified holding devices - if you did everything right, they will fit. If they do not fit, check your setup - most likely something is wrong. After mounting the cooler, connect any power cables for the fan that is attached to the cooler. 

As an aside to the instructions above, it has been my personal experience that fitting the CPU and heat sink is best done on a supportive surface (a telephone directory on a table in my case) prior to installation, to avoid excessive flexing of the motherboard. 

A last note: if something goes wrong and the cooler has to be removed (like maybe you realize you didn't take the protective film off the cooler surface), the paste will have to be removed from the CPU for the restart. ''Don't panic!'' All it takes is a coffee filter (not paper towels or anything else that will leave fibers) and a little isopropyl alcohol (from the drugstore). Thermal paste removes easily with a little gentle rubbing. Work from the outside edge in. 

If you've got the CPU and its cooler installed, and the motherboard in the case, you’re over the hump, there are just a few more easy pieces to go before that momentous first power-up.

=== Memory slots ===
[[Image:DDR2_ram_mounted.jpg|thumb|left|325px|RAM module in a socket]]

Next, you will need to install your RAM (random access memory).  Find the RAM slots on your motherboard; they will look something like the picture on your left. To install the RAM modules, first push on the levers (white plastic in the picture) on either side of the DIMM socket, so that they move to the sides. Do not force them, they should move fairly easily. &lt;!--(They are the white 'handles' you see in the picture.)--&gt;

Put the RAM module in the socket. Line up the notch in the center of the module with the small bump in the center of the RAM socket, making sure to insert it the right way. Push down on the module until both levers move up into the notches on the sides of the module. There should be a small &quot;snap&quot; when the module is fully seated. Although this does require a fair bit of force, do not overdo it or you may break the RAM module.

[[Image:RAM n.jpg|thumb|right|Different types of RAM modules]]

Take a good look at your seated RAM, if one side seems to be higher than the other, odds are it is improperly seated - take it out and try again. As you handle the RAM, try not to touch the copper stripes you can see along the bottom edge, as doing so is the best way to damage the part.

Start adding RAM at the slot labeled &quot;Bank 0&quot; or &quot;DIMM 1&quot;. If you do not have a stick in &quot;Bank 0&quot; or &quot;DIMM 1&quot; the system will think there is no RAM and will not boot.

On newer motherboards with 4 slots, you'll see alternating colours. For example, slot 1 is blue, slot 2 is black, slot 3 is blue, slot 4 is black.

If you were to put 1 gigabyte of RAM in your personal computer, it is best to use dual channel 512MBx2 sticks. Put the first 512MB stick in '''slot 1''', and put the 2nd stick in '''slot 3''' (the two slots that are blue) - leaving slot 2 empty. This will give you better performance, vs. putting 1GB in slot 1, or two 512MB sticks in slot 1 and 2.

=== Power supply ===
Installing your power supply is pretty straightforward, if it came with your case it was pre-installed and if you took it out earlier to get the motherboard in, now is the time to put it back. Otherwise a few moments of screwdriver work will get the job done. Generally there will be a bracket on the top of the case where the power supply is mounted and a few screws used to fix it in place. Some cases place the Power Supply differently, see the documentation that came with yours.

Some power supplies come with modular cables, so you can plug in only those you’ll be using, now is a good time to figure out what you’ll need and plug them in. Other power supplies have all the cables hardwired in, you’ll want to separate out the ones you’ll need and neatly coil the remainder somewhere out of the way.

If your power supply has a switch to select 115v or 220v make sure it is set properly, this is important. Many newer power supplies can automatically select and don’t have such a switch.

Once you get the power supply installed make sure you check the motherboard documentation carefully for the location of the power sockets. You may then connect the main power, a 20 or 24 pin plug, into the motherboard. There may also be an additional four or eight pin power lead that needs to be plugged in to the motherboard (the CPU power connector) usually located near the processor socket. 

=== Video card ===

[[Image:Fitting-expansion-card.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Insert the card into a matching slot on the motherboard.]]

If your motherboard has a built-in video adapter you want to use, skip this section.

If you have an AGP video card:
Install the video card into the AGP socket. This is always the top expansion slot near the back of the computer. AGP slots are often brown, but can also be strange colours such as fluorescent green. Check the motherboard for levers (or similar devices) that are part of the AGP slot to help hold the card in place. These must be retracted before insertion of the card. Check the motherboard's manual for information on how to use these devices (if your motherboard has one.) Push the card into the socket (AGP slots are often pretty tight, do not be afraid to push it until it is well inserted), then screw it in at the top of the metal bracket. If it has a power connector, connect it to a 4-pin molex connector. If it has a pass through, do not connect it to a hard drive.

If you have a PCI Express video card, install it the same way as an AGP video card, however the slot where it goes looks a little different having an extra spot on the slot as opposed to the 2 slot parts on an AGP slot. PCI Express slots used for video cards are commonly 16x as opposed to AGP 8x.

When your card is properly installed the line formed by the top of the card will be exactly parallel to the motherboard, if one side seems to be higher than the other, chances are that it is not fully inserted, press a little harder on the high side or pull it out and try again.

=== Installing drive jumpers ===

[[Image:P-ata_and_80pin-cable.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The drive jumpers are in the middle (between the connector for the cable and the power connector) but the location may vary.]]

If you are using SATA drives there is no need to adjust jumpers -- you can skip this section.

Before you install IDE/ATA (PATA) drives, you will need to set the drives jumpers.
Each IDE/ATA channel can handle two drives, a master and a slave.
Consult your drive's instructions on how to set the jumpers. The jumper configurations are usually either printed on the back, or on the top of the drive. Drives can be configured in 2 ways: Drive Select or Cable Select.
[[Image:Jumper_(comp)_ubt.jpeg|thumb|left|100px|A jumper]]
* &quot;Cable select&quot;: Use this if you have 80-pin cables. Cable select automatically assigns slave/master based on the plug on the IDE cable the drive is plugged into. Put the jumper on CS.
* &quot;Drive select&quot;: If you are using a 40 pin cable, you must use &quot;drive select&quot;. Master/slave status is determined by the jumper. In this mode, configure the drive on the end connector as the master, and the drive connected to the middle connector as the slave. If the IDE channel has only one drive, check your motherboard documentation for the appropriate setting, which is usually master.

Note that Drive Select will always work, while Cable Select will only work if you have the proper cable.

=== Installing drives ===
Next install the hard drive and optical drives.

How a drive is physically installed will depend on the case.

[[Image:SATA_Data_Cable.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A Serial ATA connector]]
[[Image:Floppy Drive Cable-1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Floppy Disk Drive Cable]]
Most new drives are SATA (Serial ATA) which use simple, small cables for a data connection. The ends of the cables are L shaped, just look carefully at the cable ends and the connector on the drive and match them up. Only one drive can be connected to each SATA port on the motherboard. Some SATA drives have two different power ports - make sure you connect ONLY ONE of these ports to the power supply, connecting both can damage the drive.

Older drives have PATA (Parallel ATA) connections which use a flat ribbon (IDE) cable for data connection. When using an IDE cable, plug the two connectors that are closer together into the 2 drives, and the third to the controller or motherboard. The connector furthest from the board should be attached to the drive set as Master. Make sure the drive that you will install your OS on is the primary master. This is the master drive on the Primary IDE bus which is usually the IDE 40 pin port on the motherboard labeled “Primary” or “IDE 1”.. 


{{NOTE|IDE connectors are often keyed, as to prevent inserting them backwards. It does not take much force to bypass this and possibly ruin your motherboard. Look carefully at the drive and the cable connection before you try to connect them. You should see a &quot;missing&quot; pin on the drive, and a corresponding blocked socket on the connector. If you break a pin on the drive, you will probably have a worthless drive.&lt;br&gt;

Most parallel IDE cables have a colored stripe down one side. That colored stripe signifies &quot;pin 1&quot; - and usually will line up next to the molex power connection on your drive. Use this rule of thumb if your connectors are not keyed.}}

Next, plug a 4 pin molex power connector into each hard drive and optical drive. If you are installing the power connector to a SATA drive, some drives have the option of using either the SATA power connector (a flat about 1&quot; wide connector) or the standard molex connector; use one or the other, ''not both''. Connecting both can break your hard drive. For better data transfer, you can purchase heat-protected high-end data cables at your nearest electronics store.

If you install a floppy disk drive, the cable is very similar to the IDE cable, but with fewer wires, and a strange little twist in the middle. Floppy drives do not have master/slave configurations. The floppy disk connector is not usually keyed, making it all too easy to plug it in the wrong way! One wire in the IDE cable will be colored differently: this is pin 1. There is usually some indication on the floppy drive as to which side this is. The power plug for a floppy is 4 pins in a line, but rather smaller than the standard hard drive power connector. Plug the end of the cable with the twist into the floppy drive (&quot;drive A:&quot;). Plug the other end of the floppy ribbon cable into the motherboard. If you install a second floppy drives, plug the middle connector into &quot;drive B:&quot;. The twist between drive A: (on the end) and drive B (in the middle) helps the computer distinguish between them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/fdd/confCable-c.html PC Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other connections ===

[[Image:Mainboard_pins.png|thumb|right|300px|Some cables are attached to pins on a board (e.g. motherboard or extension card)]]

In order to turn the computer on, you will need to connect the power button and while you are at it, you might as well do the reset buttons and front panel lights as well.


There will be a set of pins, usually near the front edge of the motherboard to which you will attach the cables sometimes already connected to the front of the case, or if needed supplied with the motherboard. Most of the time the plugs will be labeled as the pins they will connect to in the motherboard, there they can be difficult to read since the print is very small or you may not be in the right orientation to do so.  The documentation that came with your case and motherboard should tell where these connectors are.

{{NOTE|The front panel LEDs are polarized: usually the positive wire is a color while the negative wire is white or black, this may be important if you have to do alterations or do not have the proper cables.}}

In addition, you can connect any case-specific ports if they are supported by the motherboard. Many cases have front mounted USB, Firewire and/or sound ports.

{{DecoratedTextBox|image=Bulbgraph.png| 
Other connections of this type to remember can be power for the CPU fans, various temperature sensors and [[w:Wake-on-LAN|Wake-on-LAN]] cables (if the feature is supported) from the network card to the motherboard.
}}

=== Prepare for power up ===
Some people will put power to a system several times during assembly and for experienced builders this may serve some purpose. For first timers though, it’s best to assemble a minimal complete system before powering up. Minimal because that way there are comparatively few potential sources of trouble, complete so that you can test everything at once and because the fewer times you have to put power to an open machine, the better..

If you’ve been working along with us you should now have such a minimal system put together. Briefly this includes a case with a motherboard in it, a processor (and its cooling unit) and some RAM plugged into the motherboard, hard and floppy drives installed, and some kind of video available. If your motherboard has built-in video, you might want to use that for this first try, even if you are going to install a video card later.

For this test, you’ll want to have the computer open, so that you can see all of the fans, and you’ll need to connect a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse (OK, you don’t really need the mouse . . .)

Monitors will either have a VGA, DVI, or a new HDMI plug (see picture, as they are a lot less apparent than PS/2 / USB  by comparison). Most monitors use VGA connectors, and so most graphics cards have VGA output. If you have one type of plug and the graphics card has another, you can easily buy an adapter. Some cards even come with one.

There are two standard connectors for mice and keyboards; PS/2 connectors and the more modern USB connectors. Plug the mouse and keyboard in the appropriate slot. 

Note: If you intend to install an operating system from a boot CD or floppy, or modify BIOS settings you will need to use either a PS/2 keyboard, a USB to PS/2 converter, or a motherboard that supports USB devices. Otherwise your keyboard will not work until the operating system has loaded USB drivers.

Once you have this all set up, it’s time to double check, then triple check that you have made all the necessary connections and that you haven’t left any foreign objects (where’s that screwdriver?) in the case.

== Power up ==
Take a moment to check one more time that everything is as it should be. Make sure you've removed your wrist strap, turn on the monitor, then press the power button, and observe the inside of the open machine. (''Do not touch any part of the inside of the machine while it is powered up – you will NOT die but your computer might.'') The first thing to look for is that the CPU cooler fan spins up, if it does not, cut the power immediately. This fan should start up right away; something is wrong if it doesn’t and your CPU is in danger of overheating so stop now and troubleshoot. 

'''NOTE:''' If you have a Gigabyte brand motherboard, the CPU fan may twitch and stop turning.  Wait 10-15 seconds and it should start.  If it does not, there is a problem and you should immediately cut power as stated above.  Other fans such as case fans should turn on and spin.

If the CPU fan spins up, check that all the other fans that should be spinning – case fans and fans on the power supply and video card (if installed) are also spinning. Some of these fans may not spin up until a temperature threshold is passed, check your documentation if anything is not spinning.

If the fans spin, you can turn your attention to the monitor, what you are hoping to see is the motherboard’s splash-screen, usually featuring the manufacturer’s logo. If you see this, take a moment to bask in the glow, you’ve built a computer!

If this happy event does not occur, if smoke appears, or if the computer does not do anything, unplug the power cord immediately and check the steps above to make sure you have not missed anything. Give special attention to the cables and power connections.  If the computer does appear to come on, but, you hear beeps, listen carefully to the beeps, turn the computer off, and refer to your motherboard's manual for the meaning of the beeps.  Some boards have an optional diagnostic device, usually a collection of LEDs, which when properly plugged in will inform you of the nature of the problem.  Instructions for installing this as well as the meaning of its display should be in the manual for the motherboard. If the computer turns on but the only thing that comes on is your power supply, turn it off. This probably means something is shorted, and leaving it on could damage the parts.

If all is well it is time to turn the computer off, and close it up. Then you may want to turn it on again and set certain options in the Computer's BIOS (usually by pressing 'F1' or 'Del' a few seconds after boot.) These options will be explained in the motherboard manual. In general, the default options are OK, but you may wish to set the computer's hardware clock to the correct time and date. The BIOS is also where you determine the default boot order of the system, typically Floppy, then CD-ROM, then Hard Disc.

If you want a further quick test, before you install an operating system, you may find a bootable CD-ROM such as [http://www.knoppix.net Knoppix] extremely useful.

== Additional hardware and peripherals ==

Now that you have a working system it’s time to think about installing an operating system, which is covered in the next section. It’s best to leave the installation of additional components (like  sound-cards, modems, and second video cards) and peripherals (printers, joysticks, etc. ) until after the OS install in order to allow the plug n’ play features of the OS to do their trick.

Now that you’ve got a functioning computer, you’ll need to install some software if you’re going to do anything with it.  An operating system or two must come first, then hardware drivers (so that the operating system can access your hardware) followed by security software and utilities. And that’s as far as we’re going to go with you, but you’ll also want to install some application software – games, word processors, databases, programming languages – whatever floats your boat... That’s pretty much the point of this whole computer business after all, though I hope you’ve found the journey of building it yourself has been worthwhile in its own way.

In this section we’ll consider what software you’ll want to install and how you might go about doing so.

== BIOS updates ==

One important step that can be required as the starting point after you have a working PC, depending on how stable your BIOS is (bugs or any lacking specific software and hardware support), is to do  an update of it (called &quot;flashing&quot; the BIOS). This step can be overlooked if you are sure that any later versions of your BIOS will not solve any issues or requirements you have. 
The simplest way it to as an initial step is to, another computer, download the flash update and put it on a USB thumb drive (or another a bootable support media) and boot the new computer with it. If you do not have another computer or thumb drive, you will need to put off this step until after you install the operating system (you can also use a boot disk that permits you to get an OS running out of it) to get the new computer connected to the network.

== Operating system(s) ==
If you have a workable machine that recognizes the basic hardware (CPU, memory, HD, mouse and keyboard) you can now start installing an operating system (OS). You may select from several available on the Internet or from your local computer store.

Options can be varied, there are many operating systems to choose from, including commercial ones like Microsoft Windows (of which the current version is Windows 10) or free ones like GNU/Linux distribution (a Free Software operating system) or BSD. It all depends on the uses you will be giving to your machine (function and required software) and the price tag you are willing to pay and the support you require. Simply put, can you accomplish your day to day tasks with the software that will run under the operating system in question? Do you require some special software availability, ability to run on older equipment ? Have you considered the costs ?  Determine your needs before installing an operating system.

Note that you also have the option of installing more than one operating system in what is called a multiboot setup. Having installed an OS, you can always install another later. The complexity of doing so may vary, depending on how the last one automates (or not at all) the process. If your multi-boot setup is Windows-only, install the oldest Windows version first.

{{NOTE|If you are going to install Windows OS in a multiboot setup, you should start by installing Windows first. This is because Windows tends to overwrites the software that GNU/Linux requires to start up, even if something is already there.  Newer versions of Windows will tend to be more cooperative.}}

=== Installing Windows ===
The installation of Windows is relatively easy. Push the power button on the front of the PC, put the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM in your optical drive, and follow the on-screen instructions (you may have to restart with the CD in place). If you are doing a Windows-only install, just allocate all of the hard drive to Windows. Again, for a Windows only install, the NTFS file system is faster and more efficient.

Some people find that it's useful to create separate partitions for the operating system and data.  This means that if something goes wrong with the operating system, the partition can be formatted and the operating system can be reinstalled  possibly without losing data. If you have already allocated the whole disk to 1 partition and you want to change it later, you can do so and create new partition(from the existing partition) using Disk Management in Windows Vista and later. Windows XP and lower users can find 3rd party tools to do the same.

If you are installing Windows on a RAID drive, or a SATA drive in some cases, you are going to have to provide drivers to the Windows installer so that it can access the hard drive on the raid controller. To do this during the Windows install wait for &quot;Press F6 to install any third party SCSI or RAID drivers.&quot; to appear at the bottom of the screen and duly hit F6. Then you will see a screen that says &quot;Setup could not determine the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in your system, or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter.&quot; At this screen you are going to want to hit 'S' to &quot;Specify Additional Device,&quot; another screen will pop up asking you to insert the floppy disk containing the drivers, followed by a screen asking you to choose the appropriate driver out of the set contained. Windows Vista and later handles this differently. Usually at the prompt where you are asked to choose a partition, you can click Load Driver and browse(or ask Windows to search) for the driver. Unlike XP, you are not limited to floppies. A USB flash drive suffices.

If you do have a copy of Windows 7 or later , you can install that and then upgrade to Windows 10 for free , though there are some minor restrictions.

=== Installing Windows to dual-boot with GNU/Linux  ===

If you are dual-booting, some extra factors must be considered. NTFS, which is the default file system that Windows uses, is fairly well supported in Linux. [http://www.ntfs-3g.org/ NTFS-3g] has reached a usable stage, with users reporting no data corruption or loss during ordinary use of the latest versions of the driver, providing GNU/Linux users with a reliable way to read and write NTFS partitions. This system is now in widespread use and most up-to-date Linux distros will support the NTFS file system. Previously only read support was safe, and this may still be the case for some distributions. However, NTFS does have some advantages over FAT32, in that a 4GB file size limit no longer exists. Though Linux supports NTFS, Windows does not have built-in support for any of the standard GNU/Linux file systems. However, there are Windows applications, such as [http://www.fs-driver.org/index.html Ext2 IFS] that can be used to read/write ext2 and ext3 systems.

When it comes the time to partition the hard disk(s), remember to leave space for GNU/Linux (a good amount is on the order of a third of your total hard disk space). You may want to have a spare FAT32 partition (of around 1 third of your disk space) on which to share documents between Windows and GNU/Linux, though this will most likely not be necessary unless you are using a distro which cannot read/write NTFS.  You should also modify the partition table as necessary - you may not need as much space for Windows or you may need more in your FAT32 transfer area.  But you must ensure that you leave at least 3GB(Windows XP/2000) or 20GB(Vista and higher) for your Windows installation, since the standard installation of Windows takes up about 2 GB(7.6 GB for Vista and 11GB for Windows 8) of hard drive space, and it is always wise to leave extra on, to allow for any changes that may occur. Windows 8 in particular blocks installing on drives less than 16GB(20GB for 64-bit) free space. If you have 16 GB or higher RAM, you'll need more space.

=== Installing GNU/Linux ===
{{see also|Linux Guide}}
{{see also|Wikipedia:List of Linux distributions}}
{{see also|Wikipedia:Comparison of Linux distributions}}

The primary problem faced in installing GNU/Linux is choosing between distributions. Of the many variants of GNU/Linux, Fedora, SuSE, and Ubuntu are generally recommended, as they are updated regularly and compatible with a broad range of hardware:

* Fedora, currently at version 17. Used to be the de facto GNU/Linux.
* openSuSE, currently at version 13.2.
* Ubuntu, currently at version 15.4. Increasingly gaining popularity as an easy to use desktop GNU/Linux.
* Debian , currently at version 8.1

Some GNU/Linux variants may support hardware that these do not. If you have obscure or old hardware, you may want to search forum sites for various GNU/Linux variants to ensure compatibility. For example, Puppy Linux is a small Linux distro designed to run on older systems, as is Damn Small Linux.

For example, let’s consider Ubuntu. It's a variant of Debian, and is the current standard for easy-to-use GNU/Linux distributions. One can download the .iso image or order a CD set (containing a combined installation CD and LiveCD) from its website. An .iso is nothing more than a special file format that your CD drive burning software uses to create a copy of the software, in this case a copy of Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

The installation of most distros GNU/Linux is relatively easy. Push the button on the front of the PC, put the CD-ROM in your optical drive, and follow the on-screen instructions. By default, the installation version of Ubuntu will erase all files on the hard drive and partition 1.8 GB for the OS. If you want to customize, follow the on-screen instructions carefully.  The LiveCd version does not erase your hard drive and is intended solely for a user to test drive Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

When installing a GNU/Linux distro, you may be asked to choose between alternatives – whether to run KDE or Gnome, for instance, or to install vi or Emacs or nano. If the terms are unfamiliar a quick Google will usually bring enlightenment. Also, as in these two examples, most such choices are a matter of preference and either choice will work.

== Security ==
After installation, security should be your priority. 

=== Updates ===
From time to time, software companies and independent programmers release new and improved versions to their software; these are known as updates.  Updates usually install new features or fix problems. Usually, you should download the latest updates to improve system performance though it's sometimes wise to wait a little while to be sure the update itself does not cause problems.  Many programs update themselves and this process is know as an automatic update.  If you have to manually update your software, do so through the software developer's site, not through a secondary source.  This approach will reduce the chance of contracting a virus or other piece of malicious software.

==== Windows ====
A newly installed Windows computer using a broadband connection can be attacked within moments of being connected to the Internet. In severe cases, the attacks can render a system unbootable or make a second reinstallation faster or easier than manually removing the malicious programs causing the problems. The SANS Institute provides a PDF guide called [http://isc.sans.org/presentations/xpsurvivalguide.pdf Windows XP: Surviving the First Day], which explains how to update a new Windows XP box without immediately becoming infected by viruses and worms. To avoid having your new computer attacked, install a firewall, or activate the one that came with your OS. Both Windows and GNU/Linux have in-built firewalls: In some GNU/Linux distributions, it is enabled by default; in Windows XP Service Pack 2, it can be found by going to the Start button and choosing &quot;Control Panel&quot; then double-clicking the &quot;Windows Firewall&quot; icon. Windows 8 includes antivirus however, but still it is recommended to use Windows Update.

As soon as you are on the Internet, run your operating system's update facility to fix any security flaws that have been found since your CD was printed.  To do this under Windows, simply click on your Start Menu, click on 'All Programs', and then click on Windows Update, and follow the instructions(Open Settings and click Update and Security in Windows 10). If you use other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office, then it can be valuable to use [http://update.microsoft.com Microsoft Update], which covers updates for all Microsoft products , and can be done within Windows Update. For either of these, you can also switch on &quot;Automatic Updates&quot; from the Security Center program mentioned above.

==== GNU/Linux ====
[[Image:YaST2-openSUSE-11.png|thumb|The YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) Control Center]]
The method of updating your GNU/Linux system varies greatly from distribution to distribution. 

For SuSE, there are two ways:
# YaST (Yet another Setup Tool), the default package manager/system management tool for SuSE
# ZENworks updater, a GUI-based updating service

For Fedora, type
: &lt;code&gt;yum update&lt;/code&gt;
as the root user inside a terminal window.

It is perhaps easiest to update the OS from Debian-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu and Linspire. For Debian and Linspire you type the following into a terminal window while running as the root user:
: &lt;code&gt;apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;

Ubuntu has you run sudo to switch run a program as root. Type the following into a terminal:
: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;

Most distros, including Ubuntu, also have a GUI-based updater program.

==== Automatic updates ====

If your computer will be running overnight (or if you're just lazy), it may be good to have your computer update itself.

'''Debian-based (LINUX) -''' [[w:Debian|Debian]]-based operating systems (including Ubuntu, but Ubuntu already has a more simplified automatic updater) will typically use a [[w:cron|cron]] script for receiving automatic updates by the console (although you can download some GUI-based updating tools - that is, if you're working with a GUI).

'''Ubuntu (LINUX) -''' As Ubuntu is based on Debian, you can use a cron script, but an easier way of doing it (if you're using [[w:GNOME|GNOME]]) is to go to the &quot;System&quot; menu, then &quot;Administration&quot;, then &quot;Software Sources&quot;. Then open up the &quot;Updates&quot; tab and select &quot;Automatic updates&quot;, also select &quot;Install security updates without confirmation&quot;. 

'''SuSE (LINUX) -''' SuSE uses [[w:YaST|YaST]] to manage updates, packages (applications), and system settings. YaST can be configured to use automatic updates in the YaST control centre.

'''Microsoft Windows -''' Microsoft has always used the [[w:Windows_Update#Future|Microsoft Update]] service (formerly called &quot;Windows Update&quot;) to manage updates both automatically and manually (although by default it usually is a automatic update). Windows XP and higher reminds you when the computer is needed to be restarted if an update requires one via a special icon in the notification area.

{{NOTE|If you have Windows 10(Home) , updates are installed automatically , and they cannot be disabled.}}

=== Anti-malware ===
Anti-virus, anti-spyware, and anti-spam programs (which generically are all called anti-malware programs) of commercial quality or better can be found for free online quite easily and can protect your computer from various nasties you might get while surfin' on the Internet. Windows programs are listed in the software section below. (Usually these are not needed for non-Windows OSes). Third-party firewalls for Windows are recommended as the built-in default one Windows provides is not nearly powerful as, for example, ZoneAlarm, a third-party Firewall solution that not only monitors incoming traffic, but monitors outgoing traffic as well. Windows 8 and higher include antivirus(Windows Defender), though you can still use any antivirus you want if you want extra features or protection. '''Windows 7 and Vista, through they include Windows Defender, do not include antivirus protection(only spyware).'''

Security software is important and should be set up first. The best procedure is not to connect to the Internet at all until your choice of anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software is installed and activated, then connect to the Internet and update each of these programs. 

If you are using software that must be downloaded from the Internet for this purpose, you can use another computer to download and burn the installation files to a CD or thumb drive. If this is not possible, download, install and update your anti-virus solution of choice first, disconnect from the Internet and run a complete system scan. Then you can reconnect and install your other security software and be reasonably confident that you are not infected. 

Once secured, your system should be safe for prudent Internet browsing, remember to schedule regular scans and keep your security software up to date.

== Drivers ==
Now that your computer is relatively secure, you will need to install software to control your various hardware components. This type of software is known as a [[Wikipedia: Device_driver |driver]]. 

Although, most of your hardware will come with a CD containing the necessary driver, consider downloading the driver straight from the company's Internet site.  This will ensure you have the latest edition of the software. Knowing where to download the driver is also good in case you lose the CD that came with the device.  

If you do not have a fast Internet connection (broadband), the company usually provides an option to receive the driver cd in the mail, in which case you'll want to use the CD you have now and update the driver later.  Even if something seems to be working fine, downloading new drivers may help increase computer efficiency, though there is always a risk that a brand new version may break something. Downloading drivers for your motherboard's chipset can often help if you are having a problem. Finally, many monitors will not go above a certain refresh rate without the proper driver, which may be of great concerns to gamers.

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you can generally find drivers for your selected hardware on the manufacturer's website.  Most GNU/Linux systems already have all of the drivers installed, with the exception of proprietary modem and graphics drivers.  If you can't find the driver you need, a simple [http://www.google.com Google] search will  often yield the best results. Windows Update also often can install the latest drivers(though you'll mostly have to atleast go to Windows Update to install it, as they may not be considered important).

== Software ==

Before buying software for your new PC, remember that there is an abundance of useful software, free for the downloading, available on the Internet. From web browsers to word processors to graphic manipulation programs, there is plenty of software available online.

Though most of what is available is safe and useful, it’s always a good idea to do a little research and make a backup before installing anything new. The following are some proven and reliable programs that are available, free (or gratis), for individual use (and sometimes more, check the license). 

Broadly speaking, there are three types of licenses:
* Proprietary - This is the type of license that comes with most software that is purchased. Source code is not available, and you cannot make copies for others.
* Freeware - The software is zero cost (free), and you may share copies with others. You cannot make copies and sell them, however. The source code is usually not available.
* Free software/Open Source - The source code is available. This means that if you know how to program, you can make and distribute variations of the program yourself, fix bugs you find, etc. You may share copies with others, and you may pay for the software on disk, or download it for free. (The &quot;free&quot; in &quot;free software&quot; refers to &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;free speech&quot;, not as in &quot;free beer&quot;.) 

Of course, there is a lot of overlap and many exceptions to these generalizations. Be sure to check the license that comes with your software to be sure of what your rights are!

=== Additional Software ===
For additional software some excellent sources of free and open-souce software are

*[http://filedoggy.com FileDoggy] - Free only software and its updates with links to developers pages in one place. 
*[http://filehippo.com FileHippo] - Windows only software, up to the bleeding edge on all updates. Also includes links to developers pages, if you're interested in Linux or Mac versions of software. Also has automatic updates software. 
* [http://www.tucows.com Tucows] - a downloads site with freeware, shareware, open-source as well as commercial software.  It has many mirrors all over the world for speedy downloads from local servers.
* [http://www.download.com/ Download.com] - similar to tucows
* [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge] - a site featuring many OpenSource projects.  You can start your own, or get software for almost every need.  Most projects have GNU and Windows versions.  The mirror system isn't as large as Tucows, but you can still usually get a mirror on the same continent.
* [http://www.linuxrsp.ru/win-lin-soft/table-eng.html Table of equivalents] - can be useful if you want to know more about specific programs when changing from windows to GNU or vice-versa.

Of course, it is also possible to ''buy'' copies of software, particularly for the Windows operating system.

If you're serious you’ve probably at least glanced over this book as you considered building your own computer, and I hope it has inspired you to go ahead with that project. Throughout we’ve tried to steer you clear of some of the pitfalls and alert you to some of the safety issues involved, and in so doing, we have undoubtedly overemphasized the dangers and difficulty. In sooth, it’s pretty hard to hurt yourself building a computer and most people get through their first build without burning up any parts. With a little planning, anyone who can use a screwdriver can build a computer.

The computer you build will always mean a little bit more to you than one you buy, not least because you designed it yourself and will no doubt be upgrading it from time to time for years to come. You may find a little smile of satisfaction creeping onto your face each time you hit the power button, and I think you’ll find that smile is an ample return for your time and effort.

Lastly, if you go through with it and build your own PC, you’re bound to run into something we've missed here; a problem we didn’t anticipate, something we forgot to mention, or something that has changed recently. If you do, please come back here and add to or change this book. You don’t have to know everything to contribute, just one thing that’s true. If this guide has helped you at all, think of it as payback.

Numbers that are the basic of Mathematics. Strange that Hindi numbers are unorganized unlike Sanskrit and other Southern Indian languages. Like other Sanskrit derived/Indian languages, Hindi numbers also follow decimal format.

Hindi cardinal numbers up to 100 have no specific standardization. Up to 20, the numbers are unique. After that each tenth number (such as 30, 40 etc) is unique. The rest of the numbers take the form of prefix of incremental digit and the base of preceding tenth number. However these prefixes and bases vary slightly and in a random manner. Although the pattern isn't regular, don't worry too much. They're just slightly different and with some practice you'd soon get the hang of it. Here are the numbers from 21 to 100. Try to follow them and find any similar pattern.

Once you have got through the numbers 1-100 the rest of the numbers are regular. For example if we need seven hundred sixty seven it will be सात सौ सड़सठ (sāta sau saṛasaṭha).

Another point to be noted in Hindi in case of cardinal numbers is that Hindi (and all other Indic languages) often use quantities like lakh and crore which are less common in English speaking countries. The opposite is true for quantities like million, billion (We are talking about the US billion which is 1 followed by 9 zeros, not the UK billion which is 1 followed by 12 zeros.), trillion etc.

===Ordinals===
Hindi ordinals are a piece of cake once you are thorough with the cardinals. Only the first six ordinals are unique.

As you would have noticed by now that in Hindi 'वां' acts just like 'th' in English which you can add to the end of cardinal numbers to form the corresponding ordinal numbers. If you're wondering about the irregularities of the second options, then let us just tell you that they are the Sanskrit ordinal numbers that are used often in Hindi. You just have to remember ten of them (for they sometimes appear in texts/speeches). After ten, any ordinal numbers you would encounter would be most likely in the general form of ordinal number+&lt;i&gt;vāṃ&lt;/i&gt;

'''Note''' :- As we mentioned before that the Hindi cardinal numbers are not standardized and several variants exist for the same number. For example सड़सठ and सरसठ are both correct for representing sixty seven. All of these variant forms could be considered correct, however for maintaining uniformity throughout this wikibook we'd be using the forms that are mentioned in this text which is also advocated by the Central Hindi Directorate, Government of India, Ministry of Education and Social Welfare (BGMH, pp. 64-5)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Hindi}}
Family relation names in Hindi are very specific to the speaker. For example there are different names for your uncles such as your father's brother and your mother's brother. Since these vary a bit from place to place, the following are some standard examples. The listed words are the names that one would use to refer to a relative of a specified relation, not the generic word for an uncle for example. This is because there are often different words to express a maternal relation and a paternal one. The same occurs for elder family members vs younger ones.

Note the polite word जी (jii or ji) is often added as a suffix to names to denote respect. It is very common to use when referring to or especially addressing an elder, and sometimes for others depending on customs or the situation.

The transliteration from the [[devanagari]] is in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRANS ITRANS] form, which allows for perfect transliteration, meaning accurate representation of the characters in a different script. Commonly if the transliterated form is written for casual usage, a simpler approximation is used, such as spelling the doubled vowels with just one and not bothering to use the correct capitalized forms to denote the retrolflex vs dental consonants. For example दादाजी would often be spelled dadaji instead of the more precise transliteration daadaajii, and similarly बेटी would often be written as beti instead of beTii. These simpler cases are ambiguous, but if the context is known, the correct spelling and pronunciation can be inferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a cool book. You might want to consider inserting &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to suppress of the automatic table of contents on pages like [[Dichotomous Key:Hexapoda]] (just place &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; as the very last line of the page, as I've done it on that page). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:15, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Beginner's question ==

Hi, I like this book, but I am no expert on this field. I just tried to see, if I can use the book nevertheless. As a test, I wanted to go from &quot;Start&quot; to &quot;dog&quot;, but I already failed at Animalia #5: Which part is developing first? Or is it a Bilaterium at all? What is the correct path to &quot;dog&quot;? (I would be nice, to have links from certain keywords to Wikipedia where those technical terms are explained). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:11, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:If you go down to the bottom of [[Dichotomous Key:Animalia]], there's a glossary box.  It isn't filled in or easy to find at the moment, but I'm getting there.  That wouldn't really help you identify a dog either, since you'd need to inspect fetal dogs to see whether the mouth or anus develops first in order to answer that question.
:Regarding the difficulty in going from start to dog, little can be done about it, really.  The higher taxa like Chordata, for example, are distinguished by technical characteristics that may be difficult or impossible for most people to describe.  I've been kicking around in my head some ideas about having alternate keys.  For example, next to Animalia#5, there could be a separate key leading either to a new section or new page that would use more easily identifiable characteristics.  The problem is that, especially in the higher taxa, the only really good characteristics are difficult for laymen to identify -- if there was an alternate key of some sort, it would be much more complicated to make because there would be numerous exceptions and caveats.
:FTR, dogs are deuterostomes.  Also, they have a notochord.  Once you get that far (this would take you to [[Dichotomous Key:Chordata]]), the rest of the keys you should be able to follow without too much difficulty.  (nobody's done the [[Dichotomous Key:Canidae]] yet, so you won't actually be able to get all the way down to the dog -- unfortunately, I don't think there are any very familiar animals done all the way to species yet) [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 15:12, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::There is now a familiar species that can be traced all the way from start to finish -- humans.  Like dogs, they (we) are deuterostomes and they have a notochord.  You also have to be able to count molar cusps to get all the way to the end, but the rest of it should be easy to follow. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 17:55, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::BTW, I should probably mention here that I have proposed moving the Dichotomous Key (and [[Field Guide]]) to Wikispecies, because it seems likely to get more attention from knowledgeable people there, and it fits in well with that project's scope. Nobody at the Wikispecies Village Pump has replied, so I'm not going to do it in the immediate future, but I think it will happen sooner or later. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 18:00, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::: Thank you very much for the answer. I think the way you implemented the glossary on [[Dichotomous Key:Mammalia]] is the most useful and intuitive way. It would be sad to loose a good book from Wikibooks, but it definitely looks like there is more connection with Wikispecies. Anyhow, this book will profit from tight linking to both Wikipedia and Wikispecies. What you should demand as soon as possible (even if you decide to move your book later), is to have a prominent link to your book, possibly even on the main page of Wikispecies. This might also draw experts' attention to this wikibook.
::: Another suggestion (from the naive novice?): I don't know if it is a good idea, but it might be helpful for some questions (like the one which opening develops first) to have a few well-known examples that would follow later down the road (e.g. &quot;Deuterostomes (containing e.g. dogs)&quot;). That could help sometimes in pointing to the right direction at least... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 04:29, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::::Thanks for the advice.  I've been considering ways to incorporate something along the lines of your suggestion.  I'll see what I can come up with. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]]

== Unused Templates ==

I have found a number of unused templates that seem to deal with this wikibook. Let me know if any of these are still useful:

*[[Template:Animalia]]
*[[Template:Arthropoda]]
*[[Template:Aves]]
*[[Template:Carnivora]]
*[[Template:Hexapoda]]
*[[Template:Mammalia glossary]]
*[[Template:Mollusca ]]

There may be more, but I can't find any others. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:07, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

: Each of these seems to have been older versions of the currently used ones. Since these were deprecated and unused, adding in no meaningful way to any module, this book or the wikibooks project as a whole, I've speedy deleted them on grounds of no meaningful content. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:13, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

== 2 legs errors ==

There are several animals listed under Animalia &gt; 2 legs that are completely incorrect.

The only items that would fit here are &quot;Birds&quot; and &quot;Other&quot;, although some amphibians only have two legs, or two legs and two vestigial legs.

:That is correct, however, the purpose of the key at this point is to narrow down the possibilities. &quot;number of legs&quot; in itself is not a very descriptive term, but it is one that even the most amateur of biologists can observe. So many creatures undergo metamorphosis, such as amphibians and many arthropods, that every possibility must be considered. If you'll notice, there are some categories listed under both &quot;2 legs&quot; and &quot;4 legs&quot;, in an attempt to simply narrow down the huge number of animals there are to choose from, including their various forms. 
:An additional reason for this is that, although it is incorrect, if someone looks at an amphibian and thinks &quot;it has two arms and two legs&quot;, amphibians will still be a choice. If it is even remotely ambiguous, it is included under both. More specific features will be used in later parts of the key.[[User:Sesamehoneytart|Sesamehoneytart]] ([[User talk:Sesamehoneytart|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sesamehoneytart|contribs]]) 15:45, 26 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

== Organizing the book ==
Hi, I noticed your book is growing well, and you might want to split it up into several pages for a better online-experience. I therefore suggest you to split up your book into a couple of sections. The main page should just include a short introduction (your abstract would be fine, please also explain what TWW means) and a table of contents, like
 [[CPAM with TWW]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/Cross-Platform Application Management With CPAM HPMS]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/Porting TWW HPMS to other OS]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/GNUstep and TWW HPMS]]
 [[CPAM with TWW/Authors]]
and so on. Using subpages via &quot;/&quot; will give you an automatic link back to the main page of your book. Have a look at [[Hamster Care]] and [[How To Build A Computer]] how it is done there. For more information and possibilities look at the current discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. Use a flat hierarchy (that is, all pages should be a direct sub-page of &quot;CPAM with TWW&quot;) and avoid introducing red links or empty pages by too many subdivisions. 5 or 6 chapters should just be fine for your book as it is now. Also have a look at the discussions at [[User talk:Ojmorales0002#Organization of the Golden Bough]] and [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]] for successful recent conversions. If you need any help or have questions, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:53, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)
== About Organizing the book ==

Thanks for the suggestions, points taken. It is growing but I am not sure when it can pass alpha stage of quality.

I am struggling between the wiki syntax of moimon and mediawike, and also the balance of family,work and my poor english.

Does this wikimedia support Graphviz ? I have lots of idea want to express them in graph. This book has another version which is in docbook format, in that format I used Graphviz to generate losts of jpg/png  to be included in docbook format of this book.

--tjyang 12:41, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Hi T J Yang. English should not be your main obstacle, since in the perfect Wikiworld, other people will come to brush up your English (if you wait long enough :-) ). About the pictures: YES, please put pictures into the book. If you are logged in you can upload pictures to Wikibooks so that you can use them here. You might also upload them to the [[commons:Main Page|Commons]], and use them immediately in all wikis, also Wikibooks. Keep the work, it is getting a very nice Wikibook! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 19:47, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Andrea, thanks for the encouragement.
What I really hope wikibooks can support is this extension.

== Overview ==

* Problems we are facing

Computers created by mankind are a reflection of human races. 
 
* Possible Solutions 
The Java environment is a good example aim to do same &quot;things&quot; across different incompatible paltforms. X Windows and GNUstep are  another two examples aim to provide unified and consistent programming environment for application developers. 

A solution to deal with application management across different OS is needed. 
Given GNUstep's cross-platform declaration on application development activities, so should the application management activities cross-platform unified. by unified, we don't mean to through away your existing investment on your application, we like to work with your existing system but to come up with a least denominator standard we can all agree upon. like ...TBA.

In this project we like to use GNUstep application as an example to demonstrate the benefits of using CPAM. There are currently different package sources to create GNUstep package for different OS paltforms. We will demonstrate using one package source to create native package for different OS. and also using same tool to maintain GNUstep package.

This book will explain using HPMS to package GNUstep for deploying GNUstep on different OS platform easily. Also we explore the possibility of integrating HPMS funcation into GNUstep to add HPMS into GNUstep.

==== Project Overview slides ====
 TBA.

===  Brief introduction  of a few PMS and its package format ===
** RPM
** Solaris pkgadd
** HP-UX SD-UX
** GNUstep pkg 
** MacOS X pkg
** Debian dpkg
** ipkg for Embeded Linux system.
* Comparison of PMS
* Comparison of HPMS
 
===== Architecture of a HPMS =====
&lt;pre&gt;

HPMS                      TWW

PMS      RPM      PKGADD         MSI         SD-UX
       --------- -----------  -----------  ----------
       | Linux | | Solaris |  | Windows |  | HP-UX  |
OS     |       | |         |  |         |  |        |
       --------  ----------   -----------  ----------
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Why doing it ====
* Automation of  package management to improve efficiency.
* A software compiling process is very complex and needs to be exact on what other software you need to compile with and how you configure the compilation flags to the compiler. This complex process can actually be programmed into a script and be repeatable by easy commands without waiting for the  original author to reproduce the process. 

* Lots of time is spent by experienced gurus to assist new developer/packager with compiling the source.
* Time can be better spent on software developement instead of on  the compiling and packaging process.

* The software and package creation processes can be reproduced easily by others with simple commands.
* Improves QA testing by generating bug fixes quickly.

=== When ===
TBA.

=== Who ===

==== Technology Provider: TWW Inc. http://www.thewrittenword.com ====

This project is using CPAM tools created by TWW Inc.The company created TWW tool sets to help cross-platform open-source package creation and deployment. Currently GNUstep is not available in the list of their supported packages. The good thing is that we have a chance to invite steppers to create the package sources together. All sources of their supported packages are available at ftp://support.thewrittenword.com.  Those package sources need to be compiled with the vendor's compiler. The gcc compiler is used only on RedHat plaform.

==== Team member ====
* [[User:Tjyang|T.J. Yang]]

* Put your name and contact information here if you are serious about this project.

=== Plan ===

* Introduce the CPAM(Cross-Platform Application Management) tool implemented by TWW Inc. to the GNUstep CPAD community
** Cross-Platform is easier said than done because each platform's features are barriers for others.

* Release GNUstep package source implemented by TWW CPAM. 
** I will release a working package source for others to try and review. 
** The package sources can generate native package format for RHAS rpm,Solaris pkgadd and HP-UX depot formats. 

* Write a tutorial on learning TWW CPAM.
** I am willing to help/assist a few persons to get familiar with TWW tools if they promise to write up what they learned in a tutorial article.

=== Integrate GNUstep developement process with TWW CPAM ===
=== Current TWW HPMS supported Systems ===

please see http://www.thewrittenword.com/evaluate/ for currently supported OS platforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Porting TWW HPMS to other OS ===
There are two tasks need to be done when porting TWW HPMS tools to other OS.
* Porting the TWW HPMS tool itself
* Porting the package sources.
* The makefile to automate the TWW tools porting. 

==== Linksys NSLU2 ====
* A Makefile to build TWW tools for nslu2.
* compile sbtuils tool to generate sb
* use sb to compile and build pb and pkgutils

* Porting sbtools 
{{{

}}}
* Porting pbtools
* Porting pkgutils

==== Mac OS X ====
Doing our homework, following are some good documents about software packaging on Mac OS X.
* [http://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/PackageMaker_Howto.html PackageMaker Howto]
* Local PMS
The package management system is getting better but still fall short of a basic functionality that a PMS shoule have. Ex, you can't list out current installed package using command line tool. you can't remove a package using a command or handle package dependency automatically. 

/Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker.app/Contents/MacOS/PackageMaker is getting better in 10.3.8. we can now create a .pkg with command line. Be aware to supply absolute path after -p or -f options.

Following is an partial makefile to create TWW CPAM tools in Mac OSX's local PMS format.

==== Microsoft Windows ====
The first problem of porting TWW HPMS tool to Win32 platformat is which package creation software and  Unix foundation software to base upon. 


* Unix foundation software
** cygwin notes for sbutils package source.
   &quot;aux&quot; need to be renamed to &quot;auxx&quot;. 
   perl -pi -e 's!\/aux\/!/aux!' Makfile
   http://cygwin.com/setup.html is the place to understand cygwin package format.
** mingw
** SFU

* Package Creation tools
** MakeMSI (see http://users.cyberone.com.au/dbareis/makemsi.htm) automatically builds (or updates) MSI files (or any other type of Windows Installer databases). It uses an XML like scripting language which can be invoked via explorer or the command line. It also builds MSI documentation which includes file (MD5 checks installed files against expected etc.) and product verification buttons. It includes a very powerful preprocessor.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dialogs can be created and easily formatted without a dialog editor.
There are a number of &quot;frameworks&quot; for different uses and user skills. Custom action code can be integrated and has some ADSI/COMPLUS/scheduling and other support.
&lt;p&gt;The following is a small sample script (one file, one shortcut, one smallish VBSCRIPT based Custom Action). 
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
;--- Load MAKEMSI (via wrapper which configures MAKEMSI to work how I like it) ---
#include &quot;DENNIS.MMH&quot;

;--- Create INSTALLDIR (we wish to install file(s) here) ---
&lt;$DirectoryTree Key=&quot;INSTALLDIR&quot; Dir=&quot;[ProgramFilesFolder]\TryMe&quot; CHANGE=&quot;\&quot; PrimaryFolder=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;

;--- Add &quot;TRY.MM&quot; and shortcut to same component (file must be keypath) ---
&lt;$Component &quot;TryMe&quot; Create=&quot;Y&quot; Directory_=&quot;INSTALLDIR&quot;&gt;   ;;In this case GUID autogenerated (at least 1st time)
    ;--- Add the files to the &quot;TryMe&quot; component -----------------------------
    &lt;$File SOURCE=&quot;TryMeWithAdvShortCut.MM&quot; KeyPath=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;

    ;--- Add the shortcut (advertise the &quot;complete&quot; feature) ----------------
    #(
        ;--- Advertised shortcut in &quot;Start-&gt;programs&quot; -----------------------
        &lt;$Shortcut
                   Dir=&quot;ProgramMenuFolder&quot;
               Feature=&quot;\&quot;                        ;;root feature is my &quot;complete&quot; one
                 Title=&quot;Open TryMeWithAdvShortCut.MM (via default association)&quot;
           Description=^Simply opens &quot;TryMeWithAdvShortCut.MM&quot; in associated handler (probably notepad)!^
                  Icon=&quot;@.\TryMe.ico&quot;
               WorkDir=&quot;INSTALLDIR&quot;
        &gt;
    #)
&lt;$/Component&gt;

;--- Display a message during a non-silent install (logs if silent) ---------
#data &quot;PopupCaData&quot;
   ;--- Some data we'd like to pass to the CA -------------------------------
   &quot;InstallationDirectory&quot; &quot;[INSTALLDIR]&quot;
   &quot;SystemFolder&quot; &quot;[SystemFolder]&quot;
#data
&lt;$VbsCa Binary=&quot;Popup.vbs&quot; DATA=^PopupCaData^&gt;
   &lt;$VbsCaEntry &quot;HiThere&quot;&gt;
       ;--- If the VBSCRIPT &quot;MsgBox&quot; or similar function was used this would prevent a silent install ---
       #(
            CaMsgBox &quot;I&quot;,
                     &quot;Hi this is a message from '&lt;?InputFile&gt;'! This was displayed via a VBSCRIPT MSI custom action.&quot; &amp;
                     vbCRLF &amp; vbCRLF &amp;
                     &quot;Note that I have enlarged this message box so that when an error occurs you will see the whole text! &quot; &amp;
                     &quot;This and most tweeking MAKEMSI does to the user interface is optional (most performed by &quot;&quot;UISAMPLE.MMH&quot;&quot;).&quot; &amp;
                     vbCRLF &amp; vbCRLF &amp;
                     &quot;The installation directory is &quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; VbsCaCadGet(&quot;InstallationDirectory&quot;) &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;. &quot; &amp;
                     &quot;The system directory is &quot;&quot;&quot;       &amp; VbsCaCadGet(&quot;SystemFolder&quot;)          &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;.&quot;
       #)
   &lt;$/VbsCaEntry&gt;
&lt;$/VbsCa&gt;
&lt;$VbsCaSetup Binary=&quot;Popup.vbs&quot; Entry=&quot;HiThere&quot; Seq=&quot;StartServices-&quot; CONDITION=^&lt;$CONDITION_INSTALL_ONLY&gt;^ DATA=^PopupCaData^&gt;

** Wix at http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix, it has XML,scriptting and command line support to generate a MSI package.
# The challenge of using Wix tool set to geneate a Unix package is the GUID. Fortunately mallow.exe come to the rescue. it can scan a src directory and generate GUID for each component(directory or file).
# We need to figure out how to make pb to generate wxs xml file and communicate with candle and light to gernate msi pacakge with the help of mallow.
 
# Following is an small batch file to illustrate creating a msi package, installing and remove this package.
candle and light are a pair of commandline package creation tool similar to rpmbuild in redhat,packagemaker in Max OS X or pkgmk in solaris.
&lt;pre&gt;

=== Package Management Process ===

Software engineering process include design and implement software via software developers to generate source codes. The source codes will then need to be built,packaged and be managed. 
We can divide this process into three general steps. 

* Software build process(SB) and SB can be divided into following processes on a build machine
** source unpack
** source patch
** source configure
** source build to generate binary and documentation
** binary test
** binary install
** binary uninstall

* Package build (PB) process is much straight forward
** prepare the configuration script
** prepare init script to start/stop application service 
** call up local PMS to pack the binary,documentation and scripts into local PMS format.

* Package Management (PKGUTIL) Process
** upload and administrate packages on package depot server.
** install 
** remove
** upgrade/patch
** auto installation upon package dependence.

=== TWW HPMS introduction ===
TWW Inc. has three tools to match the package management processes.

* How to get TWW tools ?

=== TWW Inc. ===

All the TWW tools and sources of their supported packages are GPL compliant. 
They are freely available at their ftp site ftp://support.thewrittenword.com. 
But their support labor and binary packages are not free of charge.
We are glad TWW Inc. find a way to do open-source works and still can make a living out of it.     
Please support TWW Inc. if your workplace need such kind of service ( http://shopping.netsuite.com/tww ).

      <text xml:space="preserve">= GNUstep and TWW HPMS =

GNUstep aim to enable same source code to generate same software application with lease efforts. The approach is an intrusive approach with it own merits. we believe by incorporate CPAM ablitity within GNUstep. it can be most errogant and humble, intrusive and compatible. 

== GNUstep package by TWW HPMS tools ==
Following are quick examples for GNUsteppers. It is not a HellowWorld type of easy example. The package source still need to be refined. Goal of  gnustep-core-1.0.sb is to digitalize this document at http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/User/GNUstep/gnustep-howto.html.

=== Software Build: gnustep-core-1.0.sb in a XML file ===
* This sb file can reproduce the build process with following command

 sb gnustep-core-1.10.sb;sb -i gnustep-core-1.10.sb

* Following command will list out the software modules in a GNUstep core

 [root] sb -q module-names gnustep-core-1.10.sb
 gnustep-base
 ffcall
 gnustep-examples
 gnustep-gui
 gworkspace
 gnustep-make
 gnustep-back

* gnustep-core-1.10.sb 
Note: HPUX portion of instruction is most like not correct.

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Thomas G. Graf. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Thomas G. Graf~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the tutorial to create and design themes for the Window Manager Enlightenment DR17.

'''What we need'''

--&gt; SORRY, IM JUST WORKING ON THE TUTORIAL &lt;--
--&gt; IF YOU WANT, WRITE SOME TEXT ABOUT THEMING E17 &lt;--

If you don't know how to install Enlightenment17 Themes, go to [http://get-e.org/ (Un)official Enlightenment Documentation]

Themes are not yet a part of Enlightenment17. If you want to install this nevertheless, you must place a new theme in the ~/.e/e/themes/ directory and name it &quot;default.eet&quot; or if you have a very recent build, name it &quot;default.edj&quot;, because the .eet extension has been depreciated. 
Then restart Enlightenment with &quot;enlightenment_remote -restart&quot;.

Further discussion like this belongs on the talk page.

== Consider Moving? ==

Popski,

I see you've already found this page:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D

Would you consider moving your Memobook wikibook?  Right now it is here:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_MemoBook

It seems to make more sense (to me, anyways) if it's here:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_MemoBook

... and we can keep all the English Blender 3D books under http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D 

Let me know.  Thanx.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:13, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Ok, done.

== .blend? ==

Popski,

Would you mind sharing the .blends for your pawns with the material settings you used?  I really like them and would like to create a materials tute with them.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:59, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: No problem [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]], but I am looking for a global solution of sharing .blend files. The best would be if we could upload and download .blend files on [http://commons.wikimedia.org Commons], but for this we will have to wait... You can read more about this topic [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Main_Page#File_Types here]. Second reasonable place for this is  [http://openclipart.org/cgi-bin/navigate Open Clip Art Library]. Answer about this option you can read [http://openclipart.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OpenContentDiscussion here]. Maybe is on [http://www.blender3d.com Blender Community] to do this. I didn't ask them yet... In the meantime I will try to collect this files and put them somewhere on [http://ljudmila.org/ Ljudmila.org]. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 10:58, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: I absolutely agree about putting them on the commons, and in fact several days ago put up this feature request http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1790 ....   haven't seen any action on it and don't know if there will be.  Maybe we can find another, temporary host for these things...  I do have a website will some free space and could fit some blends on there, still thinking about it.  I hope the wikimedia folks will allow these other sorts of files because I could see it being very beneficial for Blender users.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:13, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: We could wait for years for our public 3D model repository... :/ Ok, [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] you can download models temporary from my [http://stella.homelinux.net/ home server]. Have fun! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:45, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

* Here is now possible to upload also .blend files: http://www.ourmedia.org --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 09:42, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

* [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898 Here] is talk about uploading all this files.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 19:12, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

== [[NeoRandom Chess]] ==

This seems like primary research to me, which as a general rule we don't allow. See [[Wikibooks:About]] for details. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:11, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

===Moving/Renaming of NeoRandom Chess===

I hope you notice that I didn't delete the NeoRandom Chess Wikibook, and I don't intend to either.  From the discussion on the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] regarding this Wikibook, the concensus (from what I was able to read as well as my own opinion) was to keep this Wikibook, but to rename it to merge it into the larger Chess Wikibook.  I know you consider this to be your own invention, and I have no problem with that either.  In terms of renaming the page, you are also welcome to change it back, or to rename it from a more generic &quot;Random Opening Chess&quot; back to &quot;NeoRandom Chess&quot;.  As a registered user you have this capability... it is not something that is exclusive to any admin or developer.  Just try to avoid getting into a page move fight, and make any changes of that nature something that is discussed on the &quot;discussion page&quot; of any Wikibook module you are working on first.

Seriously, I want to thank you for your contributions here on Wikibooks, and I hope that you contribute much more to this project.  There are many positive things that can happen here, and I hope you don't get the wrong impressions about anybody else trying to make Wikibooks a more productive place to be at.  It is very likely that the NeoRandom chess page will be here on Wikibooks for several years, perhaps long after you have moved on and do other things with your life besides contribute to Wikibooks.  By becoming a sub-page of the Chess Wikibook, that future will be ensured much better than if it were simply left as a stand-alone &quot;article&quot;.  I also think it is a neat variant of Chess, and when I get a good Chess partner I may try it out in a &quot;quick game&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:30, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

== Hi Popski ==

Hey man, remember me?  Just wanted to show you my new wikiblog. [[User:Spiderworm/blog]]  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:56, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Finding a bat==
The first thing you need to do is find a bat that suits you. The bat should be as tall as your hip when stood on the ground. The length may vary if you are a somewhat experienced batter and you know what length you like. Weight is a key issue when looking for a bat. As bat speed is key, a hitter should look for the lightest possible stick to swing, but keep this in mind: from a physics perspective, the formula &lt;math&gt;m1v1i x m2v2i = m1v2f x m2v2f&lt;/math&gt; where m1 is the mass of the ball, m2 is the bat, and v1,v2 are their respective speeds(i being initial, f being final). Wacky math aside, a heavier bat moving at the same speed as a less massive bat will empart more force on the ball, making the difference between a high fly, and a home run. An appropriate test for finding a bat of proper weight for your strength category is to hold the bat handle in one hand, parallel to the ground for 45 seconds. If you can hold it up, you should be strong enough to swing the stick.  This is just a general rule of thumb. if you find your speed is too slow, shave two ounces off the bats' mass.

==Gripping the bat== 
The grip the batter uses is important because it determines the bat speed. Your bottom hand should be placed half an inch from the knob of the bat. The “door-knocking” knuckles of you top hand should be roughly aligned with the &quot;door-knocking&quot; knuckles of your bottom hand. Reach back behind you and touch the head of the bat to your buttocks or your lower back. Now bring the bat around and hit the ground. Examine your knuckles and this is where you should try to have them. Remember to grip the bat loosely.

==The Stance, feet== 
Lets first start from the feet and work our way up. This process is long and perhaps the most important to get right. First, you need to place your front foot about 6-8 inches away from the top corner of the plate. Place you back foot parallel to your front foot and about shoulder-width apart. Now tilt your front foot at a little less than a 45-degree angle. It should be pointing at about the space between the second basemen and the first basemen (given you are a right handed batter). Now bend your knees and transfer your weight so that about 75% of it is resting on your back foot. Also, always remember to be on the balls of your feet, and not flatfooted.

==The Stance, body, arms, and head==
Now that you have the feet set, next on the list is the rest of your body. Your hip, shoulder and head should all be pointing to the pitcher. The hands should be held around the batters dominant breast. The back elbow should be at a 45-degree angle downward allowing for the bat to be at a 45-degree angle across your shoulder. The top of your top hand should be in the general area of the top of your back shoulder. Your chin should be in the area between either on your front shoulder or about an inch from it, and your head needs to be still at all times. Make sure you are comfortable because you must be relaxed in order to be a great hitter.

==The Stride and Load==
A batters stride should be short and only about three to four inches. All you're going to do is take a little step forward and point your toes toward the pitcher, keep in mind that most of your weight is on your back foot. Now onto the load. In the load technique you should shift your upper body weight slightly back in order to get that extra bit of power before you swing. Note that the Stride and Load are done at the same time. Also, against a live pitcher, the batters stride foot should go down as well as upper body weight shifting back at exactly the same time as the pitcher's front foot hits the ground. This is done in order to help your timing and reduce the risk of getting thrown off by a curve or change up.

==Head action and ball tracking==
The batter's head needs to be perfectly still and he must watch the ball from the pitcher's hand to the time it hits the bat. Your chin should transfer from your front shoulder to your back shoulder during the swing of the bat. You should make connection with the ball out in front of your body. Note that this all takes place during the swing.

==The Swing==
After the load and stride the next step for you is to swing the bat. The swing should be in a straight and slightly downward motion, always keeping your hands on the inside of your body. While this is happening the batter's back foot should pivot and the hips would turn forward so they too are now facing the pitcher. At the same time your hips are completely forward, the bat should be parallel to the ground and about waist height with both arms fully extended on a downward slant. This is where the point of contact should be.

==Extension and Finish==
After the point of contact, your arms should extend to shoulder height. At this point your wrists will involuntarily flip over and the bat should be pointing at the left fielder (given again that you are a right handed batter). Even during and after the extension, your head should still be looking at the invisible spot that was once the point of contact. The final step is to let the bat carry itself over your shoulder and run to first base.

__NOTOC__
This wikibook discusses the information necessary to obtain the [[wikipedia:CompTIA|CompTIA]] Network+ certification.  The Network+ certification is an internationally recognized validation of the technical knowledge required of foundation-level IT network practitioners.  The CompTIA Network+ and A+ exams can be applied together toward the Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA) program, and other corporations such as Novell, Cisco and HP also recognize CompTIA Network+ as part of their certification tracks.

The Network+ certification ensures that the successful candidate has the important knowledge and skills necessary to manage, maintain, troubleshoot, install, operate and configure basic network infrastructure, describe networking technologies, basic design principles, and adhere to wiring standards and use testing tools.  Although not a prerequisite, it is recommended that CompTIA Network+ candidates have at least nine months of experience in network support or administration or adequate academic training, along with a CompTIA [[A+ Certification|A+ certification]].

It is written in the recipe that flour will be rolled in a ball but there is no actual mention of the amount of flour to use. And maybe an idea of the amount of samosa it will make would be a nice idea. [[User:24.201.116.26|24.201.116.26]] 04:18, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

One ball makes two samosas. The amount of flour required depends on the size of the samosa and the amount of filling.

--------------------------------------------------
This recipe is terrible. Olive oil????? use plain vegetable oil, mustard oil or ghee. add cumin and coriander seeds to the mix

Where on earth do they use olive oil for Samosas?</text>

== Page size ==

The article is currently at 35K. This might cause problems with older browser. I was wondering if we should even care about it and maybe split this up or scale this guide down.

is anyone against splitting it up? -CarbonUnit

How sould we split this up? - CarbonUnit

: Perhaps move the &quot;secondary components&quot; and &quot;peripherals&quot; sections onto a new page? (The distinction between them is getting more blurry, because manufacturers of &quot;secondary components&quot; that go inside the case are starting to distribute the same functionality in a &quot;peripheral&quot; that plugs into USB or ethernet.) --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 16:32, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

::I think it would make sense to split it.  IMO, the question is how exactly should it be split up?  I'm thinking each of the major questions could be a subpage, with the list of necessary components linking to each of those subpages.  But that's just my opinion.  Or, choosing the parts, then acquiring the parts, then a description of what to look for in each.  [[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 00:13, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::I've begun copying individual sections to new subpages.  Already finished with CPU; see [[How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC/Choosing_the_parts/CPU]]. &amp;mdash;[[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 03:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Looks good so far.
::: Alas, it appears that the CPU section on this page is slowly diverging from the [[How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC/Choosing_the_parts/CPU]] page.
::: In the name of [[Wiki:OnceAndOnlyOnce]], I moved all the text from the CPU section of this page to that page.
::: Hopefully that leads to one page with all the best up-to-date information, rather than 2 pages that each have some up-to-date information and some obsolete information.
::: Even though that edit reduced this page from 101,730 bytes to 84,877 bytes, it still seems a bit long to me. What else can we split into a separate page?

== On the other hand.... ==

'''''On the other hand''', somebody who is going to be playing the latest games on their new computer   is going to need a lot more graphics power. However, they may not want to spend much on computer   peripherals such as scanners, printers, or webcameras, because they have no interest in such devices. '''On the other hand''', someone may want a computer that offers both office and gaming experiences, and in that case they should expect to spend additional money on peripheral devices, along with   high-powered internal components.''

Sounds wrong.

:Then fix it! Every page has an edit button on it.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]

== Meta: Editing ==

Section editing seems *horribly* broken here; is there a known reason?&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Baylink|Baylink]] 00:57, 2 August 2005 (UTC)



== Addressing low wage / adventurous teenager  groups ==

You are nicely describing how to build a machine by assembling parts, however, this is likely to be out of the scope for a larger readership of this book. What about the not so unlikely case that one finds a machine on the street waiting to be collected for transport to a landfill site, free for grab, or one is donated one, that one is interested to understand better. This might also be appropriate to readers in the third world. If this proposal gets some backup, then I might start something in that direction.

== Buying parts ==

I feel there should be a part on where to get parts. For example, buying parts online can be very cheap, but have problems of their own (such as rebate issues, shipping time, shipping cost, potentially limited warrenty, no way to test the part befroe you get it). Some online distributors which could be noted: www.pricewatch.com, www.newegg.com, www.tigerdirect.com, www.geeks.com.

== Places to get parts outside the USA ==

So far, '''*all*''' the online computer dealers I've seen only ship within the USA. And I live in Mexico. So, I'd really like some suggestions about what to do if you're not from the States. [[User:201.128.248.147|201.128.248.147]] 02:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== Dual Core ==

Seeing how dual-core CPU setup is getting quite common these days, I suggest elaborating on that a bit in the CPU section, such as advantages and disadvantages and so forth.

== 4800dpi resolution ==
&quot;For most purposes, a mid-range Inkjet Printer will be more than enough for most people, and ''you will generally want one that is capable of printing around 4800dpi''&quot;

Unless you want to print a bunch of photos, is 4800dpi really necessary? Most text and simple graphics are printed well below 1200dpi.

:Even if you're printing photos, you don't ''really'' need 4800dpi.  A 3x5&quot; photo at 4800x1200 dpi, about the standard of a mid- to high-end inkjet = 86,400,000 = 86.4 MP.  But it does look better with 4800dpi.  --[[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 03:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:: I agree that 1200dpi is more than adequate for text and simple graphics.
:: However, a &quot;pixel&quot; on screen requires more than one &quot;dot&quot; on paper to adequately reproduce. A digital color photograph that looks great at 72 pixels per inch on screen looks horrible when printed on paper at 72 dots per inch or even 300 dots per inch. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 17:51, 10 February 2011 (UTC)

== dial up is &quot;more than adequate&quot; ==

Given the number of pages with graphics, ads or other features that any one using the web, even passively, is likely to use, I find the idea that dial up is &quot;more than adequate&quot; misleading. I feel it should be changed to just &quot;adequate&quot; to give the true level of quality offered by dial up.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
#As someone who was until recently using dial-up, it's not adequate at all for the web. Wikipedia pages will take up to half an hour to load. Dial-up can really only handle IRC and email (oh, and telnet).

== Language Usage ==

It seems to me that there is some very relaxed usage of language throughout this wikibook. I've slowly begun going through each section and changing the language to a more proper and concise format. It would be nice to have some help though as I'm sure to miss something. Certain sections seem as though they are written by an avid gamer and don't really reflect the general computer market. Please be careful about language use when editing, and make sure to use proper full sentences that get your point across clearly.

== Audience ==

There have been other discussions and comments in above topics about the target audience and what information should be included, so I'm just starting this topic for that purpose.  Have at it.  --[[User:Bpogi|Bpogi]] 21:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

I would bet pesos to pizza (the geek version of dollars to donuts) that most people who read this article are near the novice end of the spectrum.  Tech professionals already know this stuff and would not go out of their way to look for a generic guide, although they might look for information specific to the hardware they are looking to install.  Even power users, or people who think they are power users, are apt to just dive in and start playing with the parts. With that in mind, you should assume that the reader knows little to nothing about standard terminology, safety and compatibility concerns, etc.  Peter B. Steiger, Cheyenne WY

== Old systems ==

Mabey you should state at the beginnig whether this book will tell you how to assemble a system out of old parts.

     The problem with that is that old parts can be too slow for modern OSes, unless you are running Linux. A lot of the parts in old PCs are incompatible with today's hardware and software.[[User:Microsoftwin108576|Microsoftwin108576]] ([[User talk:Microsoftwin108576|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Microsoftwin108576|contribs]]) 22:21, 26 December 2015 (UTC)

== Motherboard Bandwidths ==

Motherboard bandwidths do not seem to be mentioned in this WikiBook. Sometimes there can be subtle issues in motherboard bandwidth, and it is important to check for them. An important example is the 780i, in which there is not truly enough northbridge-southbridge bandwidth to feed system RAM to its two PCI-E 2.0 x16 slots, nor is the interconnect bandwidth truly sufficient. Note: This does NOT mean the 780i motherboard is weak on bandwidth compared to the competition.

== Windows vs Linux ==

Hello,

I feel this WikiBook is biased towards Windows, it says that Windows is a &quot;perfect&quot; solution for &quot;every&quot; need, whereas GNU/Linux based Systems are a &quot;good&quot; alternative, also mentioning &quot;preform many of the same functions as Windows and features similar programs&quot; . The text In my humble opinion, neither is perfect and will ever be and maybe we should also mention that Linux/UNIX can do lots of things Windows CANNOT do, even for Joe Customer ( supports more/especially older hardware), is safer, has less virii and other malware, allows better multiuser usage ( ~/bin , ~/etc, etc.. etc.. ) and can have higher performance in a lot of situations, especially with lots of programs loaded and regarding program launch time.

We should also consider the &quot;ranking&quot; as well as the fact that some VERY obsolete systems are mentioned( even though we could mention FreeDOS as arguably the &quot;best&quot;/ most modern DOS ), whereas some other, maybe more pro-user oriented but still easy-to-use systems are not mentioned at all ( I think Solaris here, has very good support, even the free one is great + great application integration + good security/performance/updates/etc + easy installer) [[Special:Contributions/84.161.35.36|84.161.35.36]] ([[User talk:84.161.35.36|talk]]) 16:46, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

== Prices of parts ==
The part prices given in the text are useless to anyone outside of North America. Someone's added a link to XE, but manufacturers sell components in Australia (this also may be true in other areas) at a much higher price than amount in US$ and shipping. Perhaps a more comprehensive list of shops would be better.

=== Accuracy of the information provided ===
T''hanks for taking time to clarify this. The matter I raised was of technical accuracy and not politics. My comments are inline ..''

I would like to comment about the information on Linux operating system. I had created that section but it was edited and some of the information was edited. The edited form is inaccurate and full of mis-information.
* There is no OS called Linux in this world, Linux is name of the kernel which is a small part of the OS (if you call the OS linux the you should call windows kernel.dll and OS X -&gt; MAC-3, name of the respective kernels). Word linux for OS is a misnomer, It is a GNU OS with linux kernel. GNU OS also runs with BSD kernel and HURD kernel. I believe this needs to be clarified in the document. The OS is called GNU/Linux and not Linux.

*:Being a Linux&amp;reg; developer for a decade, I happen to know this is wrong. I was there; were you? 
''I was in primary school then, but does that matter?''
It is traditional for the term &quot;OS&quot; and the name of any particular OS to refer both to the kernel and to the system in general. Sorry if you don't like that, but that's the way it is. When Linux&amp;reg; was being formed, people like Theodore T'so and H. J. Lu went looking for userspace code. This is much like AT&amp;amp;T and Sun did in grabbing BSD code, much like Richard Stallman planned to do, and of course the obvious thing that anybody would do. Some code, none of it being terribly special, came from the GNU project. Please note that a BSD C library existed, and the gcc compiler was not exactly a major undertaking. The code you see today exists primarily by the efforts of companies that consider themselves to be Linux&amp;reg; vendors. The core Linux&amp;reg; developers, to this very day, do not use the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;. A good number of them seem to find it offensive. What you are seeing here is a political power grab. Richard Stallman has even changed some of the FSF software and licenses in an effort to force his views on the world. Even if the idea of cobbling together a full system from available parts was unique to Richard Stallman (hah!), he would still have no moral right to rename the efforts of others. The Hurd has swiped many parts (ext2 driver, hardware drivers, TCP/IP...) from Linux&amp;reg;, yet Richard Stallman refuses to acknowledge this in the name of ''his'' OS. Apparantly he doesn't see the hypocracy. One final thing... the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; is a violation of the Linux&amp;reg; trademark. You're not allowed to abuse a trademark like that. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:51, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
''I believe its your preference (and respect it), if you want to call the whole system Linux, but I would be nice if we clarify in the document the system known as Linux&amp;reg has Linux kernel and other SW which comes from other sources. So that next time a Apache bug is published people do not think it as a Linux bug. May be GNU/Linux is violation of trademark (do not know legal issues).'' 

* Linux is Open Source SW -&gt; Linux Kernel and most of the SW comes under GPL hence its a Free SW and not Open Source. There is a subtle difference bw Free and Open Source but subtituting one for other leads to mis information. (SW like Mozilla, covered by MPL, BSD etc are open source but not Free).

*:When using the term &quot;operating system&quot; to mean the whole system, Mozilla is included. It comes on the same CD-ROM as everything else and it gets installed along with everything else. There are other examples if you now suddenly wish to use a restrictive definition of &quot;operating system&quot;. So it is correct to use the term &quot;Open Source&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:51, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
''again from purely technical accuracy point of view shouldn't we tell that stuff like Kernel, gcc gnome etc are Free SW while mozilla etc are open source, and pointg the readers to definitions and difference between two.
''
These are the major concerns that I have, I hope you would correct it as soon as possible so that it becomes more factual.

:Let's not perpetuate Orwellian newspeak, political correctness, and similar. Linux&amp;reg; is an OS developed by Linus Torvalds and others. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:54, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

''Agreed may be these details are out of scope of the document but I believe they would add technical accuracy to it. Besides my intent has been to point out this rather than promoting any point of view.''

The notion of technical accuracy applied to political information like Free vs Open and Linux vs GNU / Linux is ludicrous. And who cares anyways?

The subject of OSes is more than large enough to deserve several books devoted to it. And those books have more merit that stay away from politics. There are a thousand websites where users can educate themselves about the politics of FLOSS and Linux, why should all that crud be reproduced here? It boggles the mind. A book on the politics of OSes has about as much educational value as The Book of Crime.

If you want to discuss the politics of OSes, move it to a more aptly named book, like The Politics Of Operating Systems, then at least people could stay away from the book since they'd know it had nothing of interest. Truth in advertising is a good idea!

==== &quot;Red Hat GNU/Linux&quot; vs. &quot;Red Hat Linux&quot; ====

Someone renamed all the Linux distributions:
http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=A_Neutral_Look_at_Operating_Systems&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=137024

While I admire the [[:w:Be Bold]] technique of *doing* something rather than whining about it on the talk page, I reverted those changes.

In my opinion, people that make stuff can call it whatever counter-intuitive, incorrect name they want. Does &quot;mince meat pie&quot; ([[Cookbook:Mincemeat Tart]]) actually have any meat in it ? No. But when a chef gives me tasty pastries, I let him call it whatever he wants to call it. [To go a little off topic, it's called [[Mincemeat]] because traditionally it was actually made with meat, and I don't just mean suet.  Disgusting idea, I know]

This thing may, technically, be a &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; distribution from &quot;Red Hat, Inc.&quot;. But if the people that make it give it the name &quot;Red Hat Linux&quot;, then that is its name. They are, of course, free to change that name to something technically more accurate.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:33, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Worse than that: the whole &quot;GNU/&quot; thing is Stallman's personal and illegitimate effort to take credit for the efforts of others. He's had quite some success pushing the idea with people who don't know the history behind Linux, GNU, BSD, X11, TeX, and all the rest. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:05, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== To Do List ===
''Hey... I thought I'd add a bit of direction to this before it really gets underway.  Add a few ideas if you have them, and if they seem to be complete, remove them.  Nothing worse than trying to start something that's already finished :P'' --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 07:11, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

*Write information on various Linux distros.  Debian is already here(''writing something about Debian-based systems? Ubuntu, etc.''), but I'd like to see the rest of the Big 6 (Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake, Gentoo and Slackware) get some info; even add a few of the BSD's.  If this does happen, seperate the BSDs from the Linucies under the &quot;Open Source&quot; heading.
*Write info on differences between versions of Windows (e.g. Why one should upgrade from 98 to XP).
*Explain (dis)advantages of both proprietary and FLOSS OSes (IN GENERAL).
*Identify strengths/weaknesses of each system (e.g. OS X is good for Multimedia; Windows is good for Gaming).


::&quot;Why one should upgrade from 98 to XP&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
::Was _THAT_ an _UP_grade?

Absolutely not. Nothing on that list should be in this book. Even proprietary vs FLOSS is a general software development issue and has nothing to do with operating systems. If you're going to write a book about operating systems and you're going to bother calling it &quot;neutral&quot;, there shouldn't be any irrelevant political crap.

=== Structure ===

The strucure of your book is somewhat wrong, as the for-profit Linux distributions are still GNU/Linux operating systems, and Mac Os X is still a BSD operationg system based on an open source core. I propose the following structure instead:

##MS WinXP/Win2003
#Unix-based OS
##Solaris
##BSD
###partly proprietary distributions
####Mac OS X
###free distributions
####FreeBSD
####NetBSD
####OpenBSD
##GNU/Linux
###partly proprietary distributions
####Red Hat and Fedora
####SUSE
###free distributions
####Debian
####Slackware
####Gentoo
####Mandrake

----
The structure of the book isn't &quot;somewhat wrong&quot;, it is grossly and egregiously wrong. The notion that &quot;for profit&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; (political monikers) have anything at all to do with the nature of operating systems is contemptible. Whoever made the current structure demonstrated cynicism equal to the most corrupt politicians in history. This isn't an advocacy page for Linux goddamnit!

The list should be structured historically, with Unix under a single heading and including both Linux, BSD and Unix System V as subheadings. There should be absolutely no mentions of Redhat, Gentoo or other distributions. There should be a Unix-like category to have somewhere to put Plan 9. DOS falls into the category of CP/M derivatives and hence so do Windows and ReactOS. OS/2 should be put under CP/M-like. Mac should be in its own category, with OS X being shared between Mac and Unix.

As for Kernigh's claim that &quot;there are no OSes missing&quot;, it's obvious that he knows nothing about operating systems. There's no mention of EROS, Plan 9, or QNX. And that's just modern OSes.

:Oops... what I meant by &quot;no OSes missing&quot; was that there would be no OSes in the book that are not linked from the TOC. It is obvious that there are some OSes missing from the book. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:27, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Welcome to Wikibooks! It would improve this book if you contributed sections for EROS, Plan 9, QNX, and other systems. Also, the split between &quot;proprietary&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; in this book should leave. It does not work because &quot;proprietary&quot; Mac OS X contains some open source code while &quot;open source&quot; Linux distributions sometimes have proprietary code. Meanwhile, the Unix-likes are forced to split into two group. The Unix-likes should be together.

:I have restored the old TOC to [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]]. I suggest that someone restructures the TOC to be better. Once the new TOC is finished, remove the old TOC. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:27, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

==== New Structure, Redirects, and Red Links ====

I have rearranged the pages, abolishing the separation between &quot;Proprietary OSs&quot; and &quot;Open Source OSs&quot;. Here is the list of redirects which I created when I moved the pages. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:51, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

=== Neutrality ===

A neutral look on Operating Systems should start with a definition of an operation system and the mechanisms that are used by them.  This is independent of the Operating System.  Next, each Operating System could be discussed in function of these mechanisms.
For example: task scheduling.  There are many kinds of the (round robin, multiple priority round robin, etc.).  Of course, these 'general' pages could be constructed while developing the specific ones.

''The notion that an operating system can be characterized by a long list of functions and mechanisms is ludicrous. These things are utterly trivial and nobody would learn anything of any significance from such a book. Are you writing a book about operating systems or an outdated technical spec that nobody will use? OSes are characterized by the '''concepts''' and '''principles''' they use.''

''So for example, there are functional OSes, there are object oriented OSes, there are OSes with capabilities, there are stateless OSes and stateful OSes, there are uniform OSes and non-uniform OSes.''

:In theory, but not in practice. EROS and KeyKOS are going nowhere. I see that you wish this to be a book about failed OS experiments. Back in the real world though, we do have more than just UNIX and Windows. Look at embedded systems. We have [[w:ThreadX|ThreadX]], [[w:VxWorks|VxWorks]], [[w:Palm OS|Palm OS]], [[w:Symbian OS|Symbian OS]], [[w:QNX|QNX]], [[w:Cisco IOS|Cisco IOS]], MC/OS, [[w:Virtual Real-Time Executive|VRTX]], and [[w:TRON_Project|TRON]]. TRON is the world's most popular OS! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:28, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

''The principle embodied by Plan 9 for example is that everything is a file(system). The previous sentence almost completely characterizes Plan 9, where a long dissertation of &quot;mechanisms&quot; would only serve to DISinform and UNeducate people.''

''As for the definition of an OS, which one should that be? Would that be the one made in the early early 70s that no longer applies? Or do you want to go the radical route and provide an actually useful, practical and informative definition? On the, frankly non-existent, chance that you want to be useful and informative, an Operating System is:''

  '''A set of principles and concepts and all of the software which obeys these principles.'''

''This definition explains why X Window is not part of Unix but 8 1/2 is part of Plan 9.''

:Well, it includes the web browser. I've read sworn testamony that attests to this. The practical answer is that the OS is whatever you get on that first set of CDs, no more and no less. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:28, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::I do not expect that we will find a perfect abstraction to describe operating systems. It would help Wikibooks if the anonymous user/users who posted this would contribute to [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]] by editing the pages or adding new ones.

=== What Distinguishes Two Operating Systems ===

Someone restored the obsolete TOC and justified it by writing
&quot;It contains some operating systems that are not yet moved to the new version.&quot;

This is ''factually'' wrong. We aren't interested in the various versions of BSD and they do not merit the appelation of different OSes. They're the same OS. So are all of the Linux distros. They're all the exact same OS just configured slightly differently. You might as well be talking about the differences between different patch versions to Windows 98.

The only distribution of Linux that you'd have even a half chance of arguing is a different OS is RtLinux, and you wouldn't have that chance with anyone that's studied OSes (as opposed to someone that's studied Unix - and how typically provincial of Unixers to think that they're the center of the universe!). None of the Unixes (System V, Solaris, Linux, BSD, even AIX while we're at it) are appreciably different from each other, they're all exactly the same OS.

The minimum distance between two branches of an OS tree that distinguishes different OSes is that between Unix and Plan 9. We should apply the same standards to OSes that we apply to biological species, whether they can interbreed. Since software for any Linux distribution is ''binary-compatible'' with any other Linux distribution, it is obviously the same species of OS. Since software for any Linux is source compatible with any other Unix, all Unixes are still the same OS.

You only start getting a different OS when you look at HURD, QNX, VSTa, or Plan 9, all of which are Unix derivatives. And these are different OSes because software for one requires porting to run on another.

There is vastly more difference between VisualWorks Smalltalk and Dolphin Smalltalk than there is between two clones of Unix, and all dialects of Smalltalk are still considered the same language. This is especially relevant since you can treat languages as operating systems and vice versa.

=== Proposal to Rename the Book ===

24.200.176.92 recently proposed the renaming of this book to ''A Political Look at Mainstream End-User Operating Systems''. The proposal was made at [[User talk:Kernigh]]. I am currently opposing the rename because I think that it would limit contributions to this book. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:44, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

I don't think we should be so unhesitant to supply an audience for this rude user. The suggestion was not made in a serious and constructive manner. Turning the book into a list of failed OS experiments is no more useful than turning it into yet another Linux-versus-Windows, Linux-versus-BSD, or Linux-distribution-table. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:22, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

''I was rude to Kernigh. To you I was merely brutally honest. You have contributed nothing of any interest to this book and this book as it is currently construed, and as you wish to preserve it, has nothing of interest to contribute to the world. So it's funny how I was rude to the guy who didn't complain and not rude to the ham-fisted lout that responded with force.'' [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 01:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

This should be called A Look At Operating Systems for x86. You've left out the operating system that runs 99% of the world's financial transactions and most other commercial activity (z/OS).

:I agree slightly. Wikibooks should already strive to be neutral. I believe the current title, &quot;A Neutral Look at Operating Systems&quot; is redundant. I agree with the anonymous person above except that to avoid confusion call it &quot;An Overview of Operating Systems for PCs&quot; or something like that. x86 architecture is not implied with all the OS's shown. However I believe this book seems to be mainly looking at personal computers. Correct me if I'm wrong- I haven't read the whole thing. --[[User:Evolutionist79|Evolutionist79]] ([[User talk:Evolutionist79|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Evolutionist79|contribs]]) 20:37, 26 April 2011 (UTC)
::Other operating systems omitted include zVSE, TPF and zVM for mainframes, i(5) for the AS400 and OS/2.  Perhaps their omission can be justified by the dirth of publications on the internal structure and logic of these widely used, proprietary operating systems.[[User:Ccalvin|Ccalvin]] ([[User talk:Ccalvin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ccalvin|contribs]]) 12:31, 6 March 2013 (UTC)

== merge ==

I suggest merging the [[Operating Systems]] Wikibook into [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]].
As far as I can tell, both books have the same topic and target audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It would be a good idea to start some independent research on the islam. Because I want to know how fullgrown people can believe this? I want to know what is the real reason behind it, and why do so many people in poor counties go over to the islam. Why do people in industrialized countries with no future and no hope convert to islam instead of geting an education to fight their situation. Furthermore it would be very interesting to know why the followers of Mohammed dislike philosophy.

:''I want to know what is the real reason behind it, and why do so many people in poor counties go over to the islam.'' The countries of the [[w:Gulf Cooperation Council|Gulf Cooperation Council]], including [[w:Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] where [[w:Mecca|Mecca]] and [[w:Medina|Medina]] are located, are wealthier than most parts of the world, though less wealthy than the [[w:G8|G8]]. Some poor countries, like [[w:Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[w:Mauritania|Mauritania]], have a Muslim majority, but some, like [[w:Haiti|Haiti]] and [[w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], have few Muslims. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:05, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

== Merge to [[Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf]] ==
I think that most users look for books on a bookshelf, which makes these Islam books difficult to find. I have marked the module {{tl1|mergeto|Wikibooks:Humanities bookshelf}} and I suggest moving the Islam books to that bookshelf and redirecting the [[Islam]] module to the bookshelf. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:05, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

Regarding &quot;2. Never pronounce the words. Your mouth should be absolutely still.&quot;:
If I remember rightly, Tony Buzan's speed reading book isn't at all worried about ''sub''vocalisation. In fact it encourages it. I suppose the argument above applies only to actual physical vocalisation, as the voice in your head can go as fast as you like.

==Hopping brain==

I would dispute the statement that &quot;the brain is faster than the eyes&quot;.  It is impossible to move the brain.  It really just sits there in the brain case.  But the eyes rotate and succade quite fast. Regards, June.

:I guess the idea is that the brain can handle more characters per second (a speed measure) than the eyes can supply.

::The brain does actually move around a lot inside the head, but suggesting it can keep up with the eye is quite ridiculous. I can skim over this page quite easily with my eyes, but my brain can't put the information together fast enough for it to have any meaning.

==Two words at a time==

From the text: ''Reading research shows that it is possible to read as many as two words at one time. So keep practicing.'' Haha, clearly it is possible to take in more than two words in a glance. But I find this pessimistic statement incredibly amusing... it really adds to the character of the book I had in mind long time ago when I started it. I wanted the book to be simple and sound without the typical &quot;you'll be a millionaire and have fantastic sex in 21 days&quot; pitch. -Daniel</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Norse culture and language, basics of Norse mythology ==
Norse mythology refers to the pre-Christian beliefs of the Scandinavian people. It is the most well known version of the older mythology common to the germanic tribes, including the closely related anglo-saxon mythology. The language spoken during the period that the norse gods were worshipped, was Old Norse. By the time this language split up into different languages (not including dialects), Christianity had taken root in much of Northern Europe.

== Sources ==
Originally, much of Norse mythology consisted of spoken legends, told from the elders and parents to the children, and that way passed on. However, some of it is written, like the Eddas and the first part of Heimskringla (written by Snorri Sturlason between 1220 and 1230 on Iceland), which is also known as The Norwegian King Sagas, as it tells about the Norwegian kings, and their supposed relation to the Gods. The original title of this work is not known, as the oldest version lacks the title page, and starts with &quot;Kringla Heimsis&quot;.
Other than this, there are also runestones, which for practical reasons cannot contain very much information, and the surviving myths and folklore.

== The universe as seen by the believers of norse mythology ==
The universe was believed to be a collection of flat, circular discs, known as the nine worlds. The worlds were:
 Alfheim          World of the Light Elves
 Asgard           World of the Aesir
 Jotunheim 	 World of the Giants.
 Midgard 	 Home of mankind. 
 Muspelheim 	 World of fire and the fire-giants, home of the giant Surt.
 Nidavellir 	 Home of the Dwarves
 Niflheim 	 World of the ice and that of the dead, which is also known as Hell.
 Svartalfheim 	 World of the Dark Elves
 Vanaheim 	 Home of the Vanir

All the nine worlds were connected by the Psychic energy of Odin, or Yggdrasill, the roots and branches connecting the different worlds.

In Niflheim, the dead resided. However, unlike the stories known today of Hell (notice ''Hel'' versus ''hell''), Niflheim was a material place located in connection with the other worlds.  
Surrounding Midgard it was believed a Giant worm lived near the edge of the plate, Midgardsormrinn. 
In the beginning, there was nothing but an endless void, called the Ginnungagap, and Muspelheim and Niflheim, terrible worlds of pain. Out of this void came Ymir, the first living creature. He was a giant, and became the father of the race of frost giants. Ymir was the father of a six-headed son that was nourished by a cosmic cow called Audumla. Audumla fed herself by licking the salty rime-stone, until that stone was licked into a shape of man. This stone-man was named Buri and he was the first primeval god. Buri was the father of Bor. 
Bor married the giantess Bestla, and became father of Odin, Ve and Vili. 
After a time, Ymir grew so evil and large that the three gods slew him, and used him to create the universe. Midgard was created by Ymir's eyebrow as a place for the humans to dwell. The first humans were Ask (ash) and Embla (elm). 
Sol is the goddess of the Sun, riding the heavens. Her brother Mani, is the moon. It's easy to trace the present day Norwegian words Sol (sun) and måne (moon) to these norse gods.

== War of the Aesir and Vanir ==
The war between the Aesir and Vanir started when the Aesir, tired of her endless talk about gold and wealth, tortured the Vanir goddess Gullveig. When the Vanir demanded equal status as the Aesir, the war broke out. [not finished]

These notes are stupid, and they break the spirit of wikipedia. It is an abuse to adopt an esoteric formatting convention that will exclude users, and a total maintenance nightmare to keep it in sync. Consider revisiting when wiki books further matures.

This is just a list of &quot;For X ... we use Y&quot; which isn't very helpful for the learner.  I think it needs to be compiled into a table.  I'm learning Chinese and its quite unhelpful to have to remember measure words seperate from the nouns to which they relate.  Ideally after measure words are introduced all further nouns introduced as new vocabulary should have their measure words with them.

--[[User:Glisher|Glisher]] 13:06, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I'd like to second Glisher's remark and take it one step further. It would be very helpful to have access to an online (or downloadable) chinese dictionary that includes the measure words with the noun. The two resources I am using: zhongwen.com and NJStar bilingual dictionary fail in this regard, which is surprising to me (i am a beginner). Can some kind person direct me to a suitable resource? Many thanks.

----
== Vowel Harmony ==

Finnish, like all Finno-Uralic languages, has vowel harmony and it affects what vowels go with which words. It also affects the postpositions and endings of words.
 
In Finnish, there are eight vowels, '''a, e, i, o, u, y, ä''' and '''ö'''. They are grouped into three groups; front, neutral and back vowels. See the diagram:

[[File:Finnish vowel harmony Venn diagram.svg|centre|225px]]

The vowels in blue are front vowels (or &quot;hard&quot;), the vowels in green are neutral and the vowels in yellow are back vowels (or &quot;soft&quot;).

In Finnish, single words contain only vowels of the same type as the initial, stressed syllable. So, for example, the word,  '''aaltoileva''' contains only neutral and back vowels, while '''äidillä''' contains only front and neutral vowels. With respect to vowel harmony, compound words are separate words, e.g. '''''työmaa''''', with '''''-ta''''' suffixed '''''työ|maa|ta'''''.

When a word contains only neutral vowels, its suffixes use front vowels. For example, when the postposition '''''-lla''' or '''-llä''''' is added to '''kieli''', it becomes '''kielellä''', not '''kielella'''.

As a consequence, Finnish speakers often have trouble pronouncing foreign words which do not obey vowel harmony. For example, some Finns may pronounce ''olympia'' as ''olumpia'' because of the difficulty in producing the sounds of ''o'' and ''y'' in a row. 

Vowel harmony applies to foreign words, too. For example, ''chat'' is heard as '''''tsät''''' and consequently the frequentatitive verb &quot;to chat&quot; is '''''tsättäillä''''' (also spelled chattäillä, chattailla, chättäillä, etc.). (Note: Is this really about &quot;vowel harmony&quot; if there's only one vowel in the word &quot;chat&quot;? ''ch'' turns into ''ts'' because producing the ''ch'' sound takes effort, and ''ts'' does not.)

== Mutations ==
 
=== i → e ===

You may have noticed that '''nimi''' (name) changes to '''nimesi''' (your name), and '''Suomi''' (Finland) changes to '''Suomesta''' (from Finland). This is because there is an i → e mutation. This mutation is where on some suffixes like '''-n''', '''-a''', '''-ä''', '''-si''' changes the last vowel from i to e. 

This is a slight verbal mutation that makes this change in the word, that is reflected in this mutation. It affects words that are less than two syllables and it usually is the &quot;old&quot; words like '''nimi''' and '''suomi''' and it is something that you have to learn by heart because it is not regular. The word '''taksi''' (taxi) does not change to '''taksessa''' (because it is a new loan word), instead it is '''taksissa'''.

=== The k, p and t mutation ===

Like the i to e mutation, when you put a suffix after a word, some consonants change when you agglutinate. For example '''Helsi''nk''i''' changes to '''Helsi''ng''issä''' after you put a suffix, here '''-ssä''', after it. This is called ''consonant gradation'' and it mainly affects the consonants '''k, p''' and ''' t'''. So words like '''pan''kki''''' change to '''pan''kin'''''. Here is a short, not a complete list:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!initial ending
!new ending
!result
|-
| -kk:
| -k:
|'''pankki → pankista''' (bank → from the bank)
|-
| -pp:
| -p:
|'''kauppa → kaupasta''' (shop → from the shop)
|-
| -tt:
| -t:
|'''tyttö → tytön''' (girl → girl's)
|-
| -nk:
| -ng:
|'''Helsinki → Helsingistä''' (Helsinki → from Helsinki)
|-
| -uku/-yky:
| -uvu/-yvy:
| '''puku → puvusta''' (suit → from the suit)
|-
| -k:
| -:
|'''Turku → Turusta''' (Turku → from Turku)
|-
| -t:
| -d: 
|'''katu → kadulta''' (street → from the street)
|-
| -p:
| -v:
|'''hupi → huvit''' (amusement → amusements)
|-
| -rt:
| -rr:
| '''murto → murron''' (break-in → of the break-in)
|-
| -ti
| -si
| '''löytää → löysi''' (to find → found)
|}

== End Note ==

Now there is a lot to go through, but take your time and hopefully this will help you to no end. But beware that there is more to go through, as we haven't covered the suffixes yet!

      <comment>/* Aggregate Demand */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{macrobar}}

Fiscal Policy concerns the use of changes in the amount of government spending, &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; and taxation &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; to influence the national economy. This policy can affect both Aggregate Demand (&lt;b&gt;AD&lt;/b&gt;) and Aggregate Supply (&lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt;), though it is worth noting that the affect on AD is much more direct and immediate, whereas AS is affected through indirect means over a greater period of time. It is also just about impossible to isolate the two effects - any change in fiscal policy will ultimately affect both AD and AS.

==Aggregate Demand==
As we already know, &lt;b&gt;AD = C + I + G + (X - M)&lt;/b&gt; where 'G' stands for government spending. Taxation is accounted for in the affect it has on the other components of aggregate demand (for example, consumption will fall if more is spent in paying taxes!).

Increases in government spending will increase aggregate demand, which will have affects on the economy overall. It leads to an increase in output and average prices, other things being equal. However, the degree to which output/prices rise depends on the elasticity of AS. This can be easily shown on an AD-AS diagram: [[Image:Aggregate_Demand-Aggregate_Supply.jpg|right|thumb|400px|AD-AS diagram]] If Aggregate Supply is elastic, a large increase in output may result with little risk of inflationary pressures. However, if AS is inelastic increased government spending may not be the best way of boosting the economy, as it is at risk of 'overheating' - that is, at risk of causing inflation rather than growth in output.

Similarly,,, a fall in government spending will 'cool' the economy, and cause a contraction in AD: &lt;i&gt;diagram&lt;/i&gt;&gt;

==Aggregate Supply==
Specific changes in fiscal policy can be used to affect aggregate supply:
===Capital Spending===
Government spending on infrastructure, such as new transport networks, increases the potential output of an economy. Also, lower corporation taxes mean that businesses can invest greater sums at the same time, contributing both to AD and AS.

Capital spending could also include investment in 'human capital', such as retraining, higher education and vocational training as ways to increase the supply of labour, reduce unemployment and provide a more productive workforce. Human capital is becoming ever more important as many developed countries now aim for a knowledge-based economy, in which labour is more productive.

===Workforce Incentives===
Changes in the benefits system, such as a reduction in income tax, could create greater incentive for individuals to return to work. This increases labour supply, and hence overall supply as labour is a factor of production. It could be argued that &lt;b&gt;welfare and benefit reform&lt;/b&gt; is more important ie. fewer benefits for the unemployed to incentivise them to work.
===R&amp;D and Innovation===
Increased G could encourage developments in technology, which also increase the potential output of an economy, though without an accompyaning increase in demand, this will only increase 'slack' in the economy, reducing inflationary pressure, rather than an actual increase in total output.

These AS effects are dependent upon carefully &lt;b&gt;targetted government spending&lt;/b&gt;, and it is important to note that government spending alone will not necessarily affect AS.

==Fiscal Policy Terms==
*&lt;b&gt;Expansionary Fiscal Policy = G &gt; T&lt;/b&gt;. That means that government spending is greater than the rate of taxation, so it is a boost to the economy. The disadvantage to this is that a &lt;b&gt;budget deficit&lt;/b&gt; will ultimately build up
*&lt;b&gt;Contractionary Fiscal Policy =  G &lt; T&lt;/b&gt;. This has a contractionary, deflationary effect on the economy, but it will improve the government finances over time

{{TODO|todonote=Add Darwin. Also add non-free BSD variants (now that this page is moved out of &quot;Open Source OSes&quot; hierarchy).}}

The BSDs originate from the custom [[w:Unix|Unix]] distribution created at the University of California at Berkeley. The distro was called the [[w:Berkeley Software Distribution|Berkeley Software Distribution]]. Because BSD was a modified Unix, it was only available to those with Unix source code licenses from AT&amp;T. Later versions of BSD became free software without any AT&amp;T code.

Today, there are four main free operating system projects derived from BSD. This page also mentions three other distributions based on those projects. They all have Wikipedia articles: [[w:DragonFly BSD|DragonFly BSD]], [[w:FreeBSD|FreeBSD]], [[w:PC-BSD|PC-BSD]], [[w:DesktopBSD|DesktopBSD]], [[w:NetBSD|NetBSD]], [[w:OpenBSD|OpenBSD]], [[w:MirOS BSD|MirOS BSD]].

These are also called *BSD projects because they have &quot;BSD&quot; at the end of their names to show their ancestry. The BSD licensing allows for almost any redistribution and modification. Thus, the BSD projects frequently take code from each other; a new feature from one BSD project might appear later in the others.

BSDs are distributed as complete operating systems with kernel and userland. The BSD projects provide a &quot;ports tree&quot; with Makefiles that automate downloading, patching, building, and installing software and handling dependencies; [[w:FreeBSD Ports Collection|FreeBSD ports]] and [[w:Pkgsrc|NetBSD pkgsrc]] are examples. They also provide binary packages of popular ports.

== DragonFly BSD ==

[http://www.dragonflybsd.org DragonFly BSD] is the newest of the four projects. It was started in 2003 as a fork of FreeBSD 4.X by developers that wanted changes in the system design. They are still working on their goals. The following is from [http://www.dragonflybsd.org/goals/ their goals page]:

:''DragonFly is going to be a multi-year project. It will take a lot of groundwork to even approach the goals we outline here. ... First and foremost among all of our goals is a desire to be able to implement them in small bite-sized chunks, while at the same time maintaining good stability for the system as a whole. ... It's a laudable goal that will sit foremost in our minds, even though we know it is probably not 100% achievable.''

== FreeBSD ==

[http://www.FreeBSD.org FreeBSD] is a high-performance system and regarded as one of the most mature and robust network operating systems. (Some of its clients, such as [http://www.Yahoo.com Yahoo!] seem to agree.) It also has many of the portability advantages of NetBSD and security advantages of OpenBSD.

Here are examples of features that reached FreeBSD before the other BSD projects.
*FreeBSD was the first system with a [http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html ports collection] based on Makefiles. This assisted in porting Unix software to FreeBSD and installing it. The ports trees of the other BSD projects are derived from this one.
*FreeBSD was the first to have the [[w:Soft Updates|soft updates]] feature to improve disk performance and recovery of filesystems from system crashes.

=== PC-BSD ===
[http://www.pcbsd.org/ PC-BSD] is a project to build a system based on FreeBSD and KDE. It is very easy to install. After the other BSDs are installed, they give the user only a root shell prompt, and no graphical user interface is configured. After installing PC-BSD, a KDE desktop environment is already configured. PC-BSD also has a graphical installer which helps the user create a first non-root user account and includes customizing BSD disklabel.

PC-BSD users can download *.pbi files, double-click their icons, and install them as binary packages. This is a rare feature among BSD and even Linux distributions, but common on Windows and Mac OS X. Optionally, KDE menu and desktop items are created. Not only are the *.pbi packages available, but the FreeBSD ports collection is also available.

Both OS installation and *.pbi files are demonstrated in the [http://www.pcbsd.org/index.php?p=tour PC-BSD tour].

=== DesktopBSD ===
Another project was started with a goal to provide user-friendly BSD system. [http://www.desktopbsd.net DesktopBSD] was started independently from PC-BSD and these two projects still remain separate. Similarly, DesktopBSD provides easy-to-use graphical installer and installs fully configured desktop system based on KDE.

DesktopBSD developed its own graphical tools integrated with KDE: ports manager, disk mounter and network configuring tool.

== NetBSD ==
The focus of [http://www.NetBSD.org NetBSD] is to provide a stable, [[w:Multiplatform|multiplatform]], research and server operating system. NetBSD is widely regarded as being one of the most portable operating systems.

NetBSD runs on a very wide variety of architectures. There are at least 54 architectures including some very exotic ones such as the Sega Dreamcast. These architectures involve at least [http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/#ports-by-cpu 17 processor types]. These platforms are supported from a single CVS tree, avoiding the need for third party patches to use various hardware. The higly cross-compilable system (with full toolchain), and excellent documentation make it very useful for developers.

The NetBSD packages collection, pkgsrc, is also portable. pkgsrc supports the other BSDs, Linux, Darwin, and Solaris.  A bootstrap script is provided as part of pkgsrc to adapt it to the host OS and build the necessary support tools.

== OpenBSD ==
[http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD] was forked off NetBSD when [[w:Theo de Raadt|Theo de Raadt]] had a disagreement with the NetBSD Core Team. Theo founded OpenBSD in the early 1990s. Due to living in Canada Theo was able to legally incorporate strong [[cryptography]] into OpenBSD without encumberance by US laws.

OpenBSD is widely thought of as &quot;the most secure OS&quot;. Its motto is &quot;Secure by Default&quot;. OpenBSD developers review all of the code by hand in order to search for security holes. The default installation of OpenBSD leaves a lot of features turned off, contributing to its motto. OpenBSD runs well on many different platforms due to its NetBSD lineage. OpenBSD is also the origin of [http://www.openssh.org OpenSSH], which is the most popular implementation of ssh, which replaces insecure network logins with the secure ssh protocol.

The OpenBSD project has been replacing many of the GNU programs in their system with programs having BSD-licenses, non-copyleft versions, but they still use GNU gcc and binutils to build. They also use CVS, a source-revision control system under the GNU GPL license, but plan to replace it with their own [http://www.opencvs.org/ OpenCVS] when ready. OpenBSD also includes some large packages like perl, Apache 1.x, sendmail, and bind in the base system instead of putting those things into their ports collection. Thus the base OpenBSD system (with no added packages) has more components than the other BSDs.

=== MirOS BSD ===
[http://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de/ MirOS BSD] was a set of patches, and now is a fork, of OpenBSD. The project is based in Europe. They have resurrected some features that OpenBSD dropped, and moved some packages from the base system to MirPorts, the ports collection. There is a plan to port MirOS to Linux kernel.

== Quasijarus ==
[http://ifctfvax.harhan.org/Quasijarus/ Quasijarus] is different from the other BSDs. It is a fork of 4.3BSD-Tahoe (without the later 4.4BSD changes that the other *BSD projects have). Like 4.3BSD, it only runs on [[w:VAX|VAX]]. Essentially, it is a slightly modified 4.3BSD-Tahoe system.

Linux,&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; sometimes called GNU/Linux, is a free and open source operating system developed by a loosely knit collection of developers around the world.  The Linux kernel was first created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish college student. The Linux kernel was built on top of the GNU tools which gave the GNU/Linux OS commonly called Linux. It was designed to imitate the behavior and inner workings of UNIX&amp;reg; while remaining free to all to use.

Linux appears in many commercial operating systems like Red Hat and Novell's SUSE, and also in many non-commercial varieties, like Debian, Gentoo, Knoppix and others.  In all, there are hundreds of &quot;distributions&quot;, or Linux based operating systems, available for download on the internet, free of charge.  Some are discussed in more detail below. If you find a distribution that's not listed below, check if it's based on one that is. These derivatives generally have one or more areas they are intended to be different, but otherwise they will be similar. An extensive timeline graphic for currently functioning distributions and also for those which are no longer active can be found here: [http://futurist.se/gldt/ futurist.se/gldt].

== Linux&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; ==
[[Image:Tux.svg|100px|right]] Linux is the leading UNIX clone. The system generally consists of the [http://www.kernel.org Linux Kernel], [http://www.gnome.org User interface], [http://gcc.gnu.org development tools], [http://www.libreoffice.org Office Software] and other utilities.

Linux consists of [http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php Open Source] software. This means users have the right to receive the source code of the operating system. They are also free to study, modify and redistribute the source code. The [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU Public License] is used for about 2/3 of a typical Linux system.

Linux is a result of sustained effort of a huge community of programmers all over the world. Many of them are volunteers working on various projects in their free time. A number of companies also pay developers to work on the software. Linux is available in a variety of different distributions (flavors) including [http://www.ubuntu.com Ubuntu], [http://www.redhat.com Redhat], [http://www.slackware.com/ Slackware], [http://www.gentoo.org/ Gentoo], [http://www.novell.com/products/linuxprofessional SUSE], [http://www.mandrivalinux.com/en Mandriva] and [http://www.debian.org Debian].

One of the keys to the success of Linux is its open development model. This allows the users to contribute to improving the Operating System. The code submitted by individual developers undergoes a rigorous peer review process. This allows only high quality code into the OS. This review process weeds out bugs and security holes. The huge community of programmers (about a million) are able to fix bugs very quickly. Because of this, Linux is considered a very secure and high quality OS.

Linux is easily the most versatile operating system in the world. In addition to desktop computers, Linux is used in tiny {{cite web|url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/|title=embedded devices|archiveurl=http://archive.is/mvBm|archivedate=2012-12-09}}, all sorts of network equipment, [http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org large servers] and even in [http://www.forbes.com/home/enterprisetech/2005/03/15/cz_dl_0315linux.html super computers]. In all these environments Linux provides robust performance, powerful networking, and a high degree of reliability. Linux is in general considered more secure than the Windows alternatives. Viruses, worms, trojans etc. are not as prevalent in Linux environments. This is because of a secure design which does not allow any single user/virus to disrupt the whole system. All normal Linux distributions come with solid firewall abilities. Users generally don't have to install anti-virus software.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.techthrob.com/tech/linuxav.php &quot;Do I Need an AntiVirus Program on Linux?&quot;];
[[Wikipedia: Linux malware]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Linux desktops have not been considered very user friendly. In recent time Linux desktops have significantly improved. [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] and [http://www.kde.org KDE] are two very popular Linux desktops that feature a very user-friendly environment and plenty of useful software. Some distributions come with all the software that a typical user will ever use packaged with the operating system itself, eliminating the need to purchase extra software as one must do for typical proprietary operating systems. Maintaining and managing Linux desktops can also be very simple. 

Linux is free to download in most cases. Product support is available from the commercial Linux vendors and others. Linux often has low TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) because of its increased reliability, low software costs, and low administrative costs. This is particularly true for small businesses that are unable to negotiate low Windows costs, and for the very large businesses that can devote people to taking advantage of Linux.  However, Linux is also the subject of a very complex copyright [[w:SCO-Linux controversies|dispute]].  Service disruptions from viruses and annoyances from spyware are almost unheard of for Linux users.

In recent times Linux has proliferated to [http://www.tuxmobil.org cell phones], [http://www.osdl.org/lab_activities/carrier_grade_linux telecom equipment], [http://www.osdl.org/lab_activities/data_center_linux/index.html/document_view data centers] and [http://linuxbiometrics.com/modules/news biometrics computation]. Linux is expected to become the operating system of choice for consumer electronics and entertainment industries in future.

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds.

== Live CDs / Live USB ==
{{See also|Live distro and Full Linux Install}}
People who are entirely new to Linux should try a [[Wikipedia:Linux_Distribution|distribution]] ([[wikipedia:ISO image|ISO image]]) on a [[w:LiveCD|LiveCD]] or [[Wikipedia:Live USB|Live USB]] which is a full Linux system with video, ethernet and Wifi networking, web browser, flash player and sound that will run entirely from the CD/USB and will not modify their current operating system.  These live CDs/USBs often run slowly but they will give the user an indication of whether that distribution will run on his/her machine, and the user is likely to see that Linux is a user friendly environment with high quality applications, multimedia functions, and network access.

This helps new users to test out how Linux looks before installing it into their system. These live CD also make excellent emergency boot disks, if the system using some other operating systems does not boot up correctly.  Many can even install a complete Linux system while running the live CD, making the installation very simple.

For this, open an ISO image with [[wikipedia:UltraISO|UltraISO]] or similar choose 'Bootable'- 'Write disk image' to burn onto a bootable USB / CD-DVD. 

=== Knoppix ===
[http://www.knoppix.net/ Knoppix] was one of the first live CDs.  It has better hardware detection than most distributions, and many Linux users keep a Knoppix disk since it makes a nice rescue and demo system. Knoppix also allows you to test-drive several popular desktop environments, including KDE, IceWM, Window Maker, Fluxbox, Lars, TWM and Xfce.
The book [[Knowing Knoppix/Knoppix for the first time]] has more details.

=== Fedora ===
[https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora Fedora] distributes a popular live CD that uses GNOME and another one that uses KDE.

=== Ubuntu ===
The standard &quot;desktop version&quot; of [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD Ubuntu] is a LiveCD.
The book [[Using Ubuntu Linux/Live Boot]] has more details.

== Distributions for New Users ==
{{See also|Live distro and Full Linux Install}}

People who have chosen to use Linux and need a desktop distribution should try a Live distro (Live DVD/USB) and easy-to-use.  Each of the following distros help new users by providing a lot of hand-holding.  In fact, the default installation will install and configure software such that any new user can immediately become productive.

=== Fedora ===
[http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora] is a fast paced development that is updated every six months with new version, although the previous version is kept updated for the following 18 months.  The Fedora system is tightly connected with RPM packages, and many open-source programs come ready made for Fedora (such as Mplayer, Gnutella etc...) Fedora is a completely free Linux distribution, meant to be developed with the most cutting edge versions of programs, that are updated with either Yum or Red Hat Networks. Users can choose between the GNOME desktop and the KDE desktop at login time.

=== Mandriva Linux ===
[http://www.mandriva.com Mandriva] Mandriva Linux was the first distro to focus on ease of use.

=== Puppy Linux ===
[http://www.puppylinux.org Puppy Linux] is for beginners and runs fast on old hardware. It also takes up little space on the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive. It makes it easy to modify and add to the basic distribution. When one is combined into a disk image it is called a puplet. Users can upload their puplets to the project's website.

Puppy is a single-user system. That is, the user always has root privileges. This is the same poor security model that gets Windows 9x users in so much trouble.

A slightly more difficult distribution that also has low system requirements is Damn Small Linux. DSL has a better security model than Puppy.

=== Ubuntu Linux ===
[http://www.ubuntu.org Ubuntu] is based on Debian and produces a new release every 6 months rain or shine.  Ubuntu provides free Ubuntu Linux CDs to anyone who asks for them, which makes Ubuntu free-as-in-pizza even if you don't have a high-speed Internet connection.
In the default configuration, you cannot log in as root, or use the &quot;su&quot; command to become the root user.
Instead of the traditional root superuser, Ubuntu uses [[w:sudo|sudo]] to give certain users administrative privileges.
Although one may enable the root account, it is not recommended
[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31053] [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo] [http://opensource.weblogsinc.com/2005/04/11/ubuntu-and-kubuntu-root-and-sudo-help/].

Ubuntu only officially supports a subset of the packages in Debian, but you can access the rest of the packages with a little work.  The default setup includes [[w:GNOME|GNOME]], but there's also a [[w:KDE|KDE]] version of the distribution called [http://www.kubuntu.org Kubuntu].

There are also other versions of Ubuntu available such as [http://www.edubuntu.org Edubuntu] (suited for educational use) and the lightweight versions (in early development) [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu Xubuntu] and [http://www.ubuntulite.org/ UbuntuLite]. Even though the different Ubuntu versions are available as different installations, the only difference between them is what software they have included. So basically they are all the same distribution, and they all have the same software packages available on-line.

=== openSUSE ===

[http://www.opensuse.org openSuSE] is focused on desktop Linux for Business users.  Most of the configuration is done [[w:YaST|YaST]], an open source tool.

=== Moblin ===
{{Wikipedia-inline| Moblin}}
Moblin (&quot;mobile Linux internet&quot;) is a project developing a version of Linux and applications for netbooks and mobile internet devices.

=== Others ===
*{{Wikipedia-inline| Linux Mint}}

== Distributions for Power Users ==

Regular users of Linux, generally called power users, may prefer distributions like [[w:Debian|Debian]] or [[w:Slackware|Slackware]] to the others due to the easy customization and power these distributions give. Due to this, they also make excellent distributions for servers. New users are encouraged to read the extensive documentation available before trying to use these two distributions unless they have some one who is nearby to help them in case of trouble, or if they have some experience in Linux and want to learn more. Both Debian and Slackware have many derivatives, some of which are also for advanced users. Users considering either one should look into the derivatives as well.

=== Debian GNU/Linux ===
[http://www.debian.org/ Debian] is a non-commercial distribution known for its package management system and strict requirements of its packages and releases.

Debian comes in three branches: stable, testing and unstable. New packages to be included in the distribution are initially pushed to the unstable branch.  Once the package has been shown not to cause too many crashes it is pushed to testing where it will stay for several months while thousands of users test it and work out bugs.  Once most release critical bugs are solved, the package will be a candidate for the stable branch.

An advantage is that the Debian stable branch is very stable indeed and almost bug free but at the price of being a bit outdated. Debian stable often does not include support for the latest hardware and software features desktop users like to see. Therefore, most desktop users of Debian prefer some kind of mix of Stable, Testing and sometimes even Unstable for their final desktop configuration.

Debian also has a very good package management system, quite possibly THE best package management system of any OS in the world.

Debian is also known for being a completely free (as in freedom) operating system, and unless you include the 'non-free' branch in your sources file, everything will be Free Software. The word Free does not pertain to cost (you can sell these things) but to freedom: every package in Debian gives you the right to use, distribute, and modify the software (even for money).

See [[Using Debian]] in a Graphic environment.

=== Slackware ===
Slackware is one of the oldest distributions. Its emphasis is on simplicity of design and following Unix conventions. The result of this focus on design simplicity is that configuration is often left to the user.
(development source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware)

=== Arch ===
Arch tries to provide a stable and functional minimal core of software and then provide a lot of flexibility for users to customise on top of this. Arch operates a &quot;rolling release&quot; policy, so you can install once and then keep up to date, rather than having to wait for periodical releases and then doing a major upgrade.

== Source-based Distributions ==

Some distributions allow you to build a Linux system starting with just [[w:Source code|source code]].  These distributions are not recommended for new computer users, since it is more complicated and everything has to be compiled.  Installation is slow, but some people find it worth the trouble, as when installation is completed you are left with a powerful, high-performance system. Additionally it is a great learning experience.

=== Gentoo ===

The aim of [http://www.gentoo.org/ Gentoo] is to provide an up-to-date, customizable, and high performance GNU/Linux distribution.

Gentoo is a non-commercial source-based distribution, which means that when installing programs for Gentoo, scripts will download the source code for the program and then compile it to fit your computer configuration (CPU optimizations).  Gentoo uses [[w:Portage (software)|Portage]], a very sophisticated and advanced package manager, to achieve all of this.  The inspiration for Portage came from the BSD Ports packaging system.

Installing a complete system can take quite some time, so it is also possible to install Gentoo with pre-compiled packages, at the cost of some speed optimizations.  Gentoo users claim that the optimizations and configuration options (USE flags) make their computers noticeably faster, but critics of Gentoo argue that the optimizations are overrated and that the increased speed from optimizations are lost when you consider the amount of time the computer has to spend compiling programs.  Also, excessive optimization can lead to instability.

Compared to other distros, Gentoo software tends to be more bleeding edge, which means it is newer and has more features, but is less stable.

=== Linux From Scratch ===
[http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ Linux From Scratch] is not a distribution at all.  Instead, it is an online book that guides a user through the process of downloading, compiling, installing, and configuring each component of a typical GNU/Linux system.  Although it tends to be impractical for most desktop users, setting up a Linux from Scratch system can be a great learning experience.

=== SourceMage ===
[http://www.sourcemage.org/ SourceMage] is derived from [[w:Sorcerer_(Linux_distribution)|Sorcerer]], probably the first source-based distribution with a good package manager.  It uses Sorcery, a powerful package manager with full dependency resolution and featuring a lot of innovative features, completely written in [[w:Bash|bash]].

Perhaps the main difference between Gentoo and SourceMage is the ease of use and installation, which is faster because of the project's emphasis on speed.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.sourcemage.org/FrequentlyAskedQuestions/DiffGentoo &quot;FrequentlyAskedQuestions: DiffGentoo&quot; See Speed under &quot;Other Distinctions&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

It's mainly targeted at Linux From Scratch users bored from the process of maintaining their systems manually, and will look somewhat familiar for Debian users, as its package manager shares some concepts with Apt, but is far more flexible. Also, SourceMage has a Social Contract similar to the Debian Social Contract.

'''Description''': Wuziqi is the Chinese name for the board game known as [[../Gomoku/]] in Japanese, although the board doesn't have to be 15x15 (it could be infinite).

'''Aim''': to get five of one's pieces in a row

'''Rules''': Players alternate turns, players may not make more than one move in one turn, players may skip their move during their turn.

'''Gameplay''': Either Black or White may make the first move (This decision is up to the players).

'''Description''': 

'''Aim''':
*''Black'': to get exactly 5 pieces in a row, without making any forbidden moves
*''White'': to get 5 or more pieces in a row, or to force Black to make a forbidden move &lt;!-- what moves ARE forbidden?!? --&gt;

'''Rules''': players alternate turns, players may not make more than one move in one turn, players may skip their move during their turn.

'''Gameplay''': 

''Opening sequence'':
#The Black player plays the first '''three''' moves. They do this by placing the first black piece, then they (still the black player) place the first white piece, then the second black piece.
#:
#The current White player then is permitted to choose to become the new Black player, if he or she finds the opening situation particularly disadvantageous for White. (Note: This ensures the original Black player does not intentionally play a poor first move for White.)
#:
#The new White player (and the White player for the rest of the game) places the second white piece on the board.
#:
#The new Black player (and the Black player for the rest of the game) places '''two''' black pieces on the board. White is essentially given a choice between two potential black moves. White chooses which of the two moves the Black player may make, and the rejected potential move is removed from the board.
#:
#White plays his or her next move, and the game continues as in the rules above.

'''Description''': Pente is unlike a lot of n in row games in that it also involves capturing pieces

'''Aim''': to get five of ones pieces in a row OR to capture 5 sets of opponent pieces

'''Rules''': During their turn, a player places a stone of their color onto the board.  If the stone is horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjecent to an opponent's stone and is opposite of a corresponding stone, the opponent's stone is captured. 

'''Gameplay''': White moves first (unlike [[../Gomoku/]] and [[../Renju/]]), and players alternate turns.

== Variations of Pente ==

'''Pente+/-'''

When a player captures a set of pieces, they may choose to add this to their set of captured pieces or subtract the capture from their opponent's set of captures.

We will teach you to make a realistic ball rolling down the hill using Blender's game engine. 

First, make a plane. Subdivide it a few times and scale it up a lot. Now, make a sphere. It can be any kind except ''meta''. With the sphere selected, go to the game engine settings. (It is the little purple Pacman-icon.) You will see something that says ''Actor''. Press it. Now press ''Dynamic''. You will see a bunch of settings available now. Change ''Size'' to 1.4. Also enable ''Rigid body''. This will let the ball roll. Edit the plane, pulling vertices up or down. For this example, make it look like a canyon. Put the ball at the start point and press the P-Key. You will see the ball fall in, and roll. If it doesn't go the way you wanted, Pull some vertices of the canyon downwards. Incline your plane to let the ball roll. If you just see white, don't worry. Press escape to exit the game mode. Press Z key. Go back into game mode and it will look like wireframe. the ball will roll through the canyon. Well done! You should give it finishing touches, like effects, color, etc. And that's it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since we only had a limited number of people in our 'talent pool', we had to mix and match for the best match of character to actor. While this meant that sometimes the preferred act was not provided, it meant that we would be able to film without constantly reusing actors in main roles.

==General Casting==

The general casting period was more or less finding out who would be willing and interested in joining in such an undertaking. Fortunately, the number of volunteers that were found numbered almost enough to cover all roles that were needed. It was at this period that specific characters were considered for each actor.

==Dividing Potentials==

A side effect of casting in this way meant that most of the cast and crew would know each other. This meant that when shortlisting actors for specific characters, we could typecast into who we thought would be the most successful at portraying a character.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Prepositions / Preposizioni ==
The &quot;standard&quot; prepositions that are taught at school are
* ''di'' ('of', 'belonging to'; used in place of the English genitive)
* ''a'' ('to')
* ''da'' ('from', 'by')
* ''in'' ('in', 'on' with abstract nouns)
* ''con'' ('with')
* ''su'' ('on')
* ''per'' ('for', 'in order to')
* ''tra'' ('among', 'between')
* ''fra'' ('among', 'between')

Remember that the above translations into English are only approximate.  ''bravo in matematica'' obviously translates into English as ''good at mathematics'' and not ''good in mathematics''.

When prepositions are used together with definite articles, the preposition and the article are sometimes condensed into a single word.  For example, &quot;of the student&quot; becomes &quot;dello studente&quot; and '''not''' &quot;di lo studente&quot;.

More specifically, the following table lists all the possible combinations (except those not in common use today).
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! !! il !! lo !! la !! i !! gli !! le
|-
! di
| del || dello || della || dei || degli || delle
|-
! a
| al || allo || alla || ai || agli || alle
|-
! da
| dal || dallo || dalla || dai || dagli || dalle
|-
! in
| nel || nello || nella || nei || negli || nelle
|-
! su
| sul || sullo || sulla || sui || sugli || sulle
|-
|}

Please note that using these combinations is '''mandatory''': you cannot choose to use plain preposition + article instead. ''Con'', ''per'', ''tra/fra'' and all other prepositions don't have contracted forms, they simply use preposition + article. Originally ''con'' and ''per'' also had contracted forms (''col, collo, etc.'' and ''pel, pella, etc.'') but these are never used anymore (with the exception ''col'' (= con + il) which is still occasionally found). 

The prepositions ''di'' and ''da'' '''may''' take an apostrophe and become '' d' '' before a vowel.  Examples where this is the rule, and not simply a matter of personal preference, are
* ''d'altra parte'', lit. &quot;from other side&quot;, meaning &quot;on the other hand&quot;
* ''d'altro canto'', lit. &quot;from other place&quot;, as above
* ''d'altri'', &quot;of others&quot; (but ''di altri'' is acceptable)
* ''d'oro'', &quot;made of gold&quot;, &quot;golden&quot;
* ''d'argento'', &quot;made of silver&quot;
* ''d'oltreoceano'', ''d'oltralpe'', etc.

For euphonic reasons, the proposition ''a'' usually becomes ''ad'' before a vowel, though this is not mandatory. When the vowel following the preposition is another 'a', using ''ad'' can probably be considered mandatory. Examples: ''ad altri'' (to others), ''ad essere'' or ''a essere'' (to be), ''ad oltranza'' or ''a oltranza'' (ad libitum).

Historically, ''per'' has been a combinable preposition (with combined forms ''pel'', ''pello'', ''pella'', ''pei'', ''pegli'',  ''pelle''), but this usage is never encountered in contemporary prose, even though it is still present in the dialects of Tuscany.

'''Gado-gado''' is a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] with a [[Cookbook:Peanut Sauce|peanut sauce]] dressing.

== Ingredients ==

* For the salad:
** mixed vegetables ([[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]], [[Cookbook:Chayote|chayote]], water spinach, yardlong bean, [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]). [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|Cauliflower]], [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]], [[Cookbook:Watercress|watercress]], [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]es, or [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]] are sometimes included but less common.
** [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
** [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|soybean cake]]
** deep fried [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]]
** boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
** deep fried kerupuk (fish or prawn crackers)
** deep fried [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]

* For the [[Cookbook:Peanut Sauce|peanut sauce]] (4 servings):
** 300 gr [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]]
** 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
** 4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
** 1 gr [[Cookbook:Terasi|terasi]] (fermented prawn paste)
** 125 gr [[Cookbook:Gula Jawa|Gula Jawa]] (Indonesian Palm Sugar)
** [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
** fresh or dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]
** fresh [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] juice, or [[Cookbook:Rice vinegar|rice vinegar]]

== Procedure ==
For the [[Cookbook:Peanut_Sauce|peanut sauce]]
#[[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] prawn paste with cooking oil until fragrant
#Fry the peanuts until golden brown, remove from the pan and leave to cool, and drain off all but a little of the excess oil
#Grind the peanuts to make paste
# Add [[Cookbook:Grinding|ground]] fresh chili pepper, garlic, salt, brown sugar and prawn paste to the peanut paste, grind to mix
# Put peanut paste in a pan, add some water to dissolve (use [[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]] for richer taste) 
# Add some sugar into the peanut sauce to taste and bring to the boil
# [[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] peanut sauce until thick and season with the lemon or lime juice.

For the salad
# [[Cookbook:Boiling|Hard-boil]] the eggs and [[Cookbook:Slicing|slice]] 
# [[Cookbook:Steaming|Steam]] or boil the potatoes then remove the skin
# Deep fry the boiled potatoes until golden brown, then slice
# Wash, shred or [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]] cabbage, spinach and water spinach
# Boil water in a pan, put cabbage in boiling water until cooked, strain
# Use strained boiling water, boil spinach and water spinach, one after another, strain
# [[Cookbook:Blanching|Blanche]] bean sprout for about 30 seconds, strain
# Peel chayote, wash, slice, and boil until tender
# Wash then slice cucumber
# Place the salad, sliced potatoes, fried tofu, fried tempeh, and eggs in a large plate, either randomly or in layers
# Pour the peanut sauce over the salad
# Spread deep fried shallots on top and serve with kerupuk.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Prawn crackers are non-vegetarian. You can substitute them with ''kerupuk sayur'' or ''emping'' if you wish this dish to be completely vegetarian.
* Put some ''kecap manis'' (Malay/Indonesian sweet [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]) to taste.
* You may substitute the peanut sauce recipe for the procedure here.
* [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashew nuts]] is secret ingredient to make peanut sauce tastes richer.
* Some cooks like to [[Cookbook:Blanching|blanche]] or [[Cookbook:Steaming|steam]] the cabbage, cauliflower, and carrots rather than serve them raw.
* Use chunky [[Cookbook:Peanut_Butter|peanut butter]] as substitute for ground peanuts.
* Use [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|chili sauce]] to substitute fresh or dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]].

I'm starting to have second thoughts about this wikibook's name...it might be too long/cumbersome, but if we change it we should do so soon before people begin linking.  I wouldn't mind removing the apostrophe from the name as well. [[User:Jxn|jxn]] 05:32, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:It's quite a long title. I suggest Enlightenment. There's currently nothing there. --[[User:Snaxe920|Snaxe920]] 04:26, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

==Content Layout==
I am looking for input and ideas on the layout for this wikibook.  Should it be multiple pages?  Should there be separate subsections for installation?  Should different OS's each have separate installation instruction pages?  What should the first page include?  Do we need a Table of Contents?  Please give me some ideas. [[User:Jxn|jxn]] 05:20, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I have been using e for nearly 4 years - basically as long as I've been using GNU/Linux, and am excited to discover this user's manual.  My feelings are that we certainly should go for multiple pages.  Perhaps the main page should have an introductory section (like it already has), and then a series of headings and links to help people quickly find the sort of information they are looking for.  I think that the main page should not be too long.[[User:Latch.r|Latch.r]] 01:00, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

==Things that need to be added to this wikibook==

The end section (starting at &quot;Decisive Moments&quot;) is not only difficult to comprehend, it suggests bias (i.e., the arbitrary selection of &quot;low points&quot; in American politics).  Should it be removed?

------

&quot;The U.S. Constitution makes no mention of political parties. This was a smart move; it would be anti-Constitutional to show any preference to any political party.&quot;

So...if the '''U.S. Constitution''' made mention of parties..it would be
''anti-constitutional''... what kinda crack are you on?

== Linked in to Bookshelf ==

Ok, I've added this to the Political Science Bookshelf.  Can we remove the notice now?  [[User:Chadlupkes|Chadlupkes]] 02:57, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

:To remove the notice, just edit the page and delete the {{tl|cleanup-link}} tag found at the top of the page, like I have now done. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

How about some mention of the real power behind politics in America, big money, and its effects on our system. That would be a good start. Then maybe touch on how the two party system is monopolistic and other ways in which real democracy is stifled in this country. This article reads like the bullshit propaganda I was fed in elementary school.

::I have added some more material to the page, especially drawing out the item on the '48 election. I concur these pages must be written as neutral as possible. In terms of sources, I refer you to the Truman autobiography, especially volume 1. I would hesitate to refer to &quot;parliament&quot; without making a section that compares the US Senate and House with the UK House of Lords and Commons. Some comment asbout &quot;checks and balances&quot; may also be useful. Perhaps even a digression to why people feel the need to identify with any party at all. Also no discussion of &quot;party less&quot; people, the so called independent voters who are largely responsible for shifts in the political spectrum rather than third parties. Finally, is the &quot;Taxed Enough Already Party&quot; really the Federalist Party by any other name.[[User:Kerojack|Kerojack]] ([[User talk:Kerojack|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kerojack|contribs]]) 21:34, 10 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

==Surgical Technique==
*No universally accepted definition of &quot;resectable&quot; vs &quot;unresectable&quot; tumor
*Lymph node dissection classification (PMID 12117328)
===Classification of Neck Dissection===
**&lt;u&gt;Radical neck dissection&lt;/u&gt;: all ipsilateral cervical LN groups from inferior border of mandible superiorly to clavicle inferiorly and from lateral border of sternohyoid muscle/hyoid bone/contralateral anterior belly of digastric muscle anteriorly to anterior border of trapezius posteriorly. All lymph nodes from Level I - V. Spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein, and sternocleidomastoid muscles are removed. No removal of suboccipital, periparotid, buccal, retropharyngeal, and paratracheal lymph nodes
**&lt;u&gt;Modified radical neck dissection&lt;/u&gt;: excision of all lymph nodes routinely removed by radical neck dissection with preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structures, ie, spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein, and/or sternocleidomastoid muscle.
**&lt;u&gt;Selective neck dissection&lt;/u&gt; (SND): cervical lymphadenectomy with preservation of 1 or more of the lymph node groups that are routinely removed in the radical neck dissection. The lymph node groups removed are based on the patterns of metastases, which are predictable relative to the primary site of disease
***Supraomohyoid neck dissection: SND I-III. Oral cavity cancers. In case of oral tongue, some recommend SND I-IV. For cancers involving midline, bilateral SND I-III
***Lateral neck dissection: SND II-IV. Oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. If retropharyngeal LNs, they can be dissected as well
***Posterolateral neck dissection: SND II-V. Cutaneous melanoma
***Anterior neck dissection: SND VI. Thyroid, larynx, hypopharynx
**&lt;u&gt;Extended neck dissection&lt;/u&gt;: removal of 1 or more additional lymph node groups or nonlymphatic structures, or both, not encompassed by the radical neck dissection. Examples of lymph node groups include the parapharyngeal (retropharyngeal), superior mediastinal, perifacial (buccinator), and paratracheal lymph nodes. Examples of nonlymphatic structures include the carotid artery, hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and paraspinal muscles.


===Selective neck dissection===
*'''Goettingen, Germany, 2001''' (1986-1997) PMID 11226954 -- &quot;Efficacy of selective neck dissection: a review of 503 cases of elective and therapeutic treatment of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.&quot; (Ambrosch P, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2001 Feb;124(2):180-7.)
**Retrospective. 503 patients, selective neck dissection. pN0 49% vs pN+ 51%. Postop RT pN0 14% vs. pN+ 62%. Median F/U 3.4 years
**Outcome: 3-year RR pN0 5% vs. pN1 5% vs. pN2 12%. RT marginal benefit for pN1 and significant benefit for pN2 or ECE
**Conclusion: Results achieved with selective neck dissection compare favorably with reported modified radical neck dissection

===Cricopharyngeal myotomy===
*'''RTOG 85-30''' (1989-1994)
**Randomized. 125 patients. Arm 1) standard surgery vs. Arm 2) surgery + cricopharyngeal myotomy
**'''1999''' PMID 10488976 -- &quot;Failure of cricopharyngeal myotomy to improve dysphagia following head and neck cancer surgery.&quot; (Jacobs JR, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1999 Sep;125(9):942-6.)
***Outcome: No difference in oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency at 6 months
***Conclusion: No benefit for cricopharyngeal myotomy

==Surgery + Post-op RT vs Primary RT==
*'''RTOG; 1993''' (1985-1990) PMID 8262821 &amp;mdash; &quot;Is a surgical resection leaving positive margins of benefit to the patient with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a comparative study using the intergroup study 0034 and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group head and neck database.&quot; Laramore GE et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Dec 1;27(5):1011-6. 
**Compared pts treated on a prospective Intergroup study (surgical group) with pts from a historical database who received RT alone, matched for similar characteristics. 109 pts in the surgical group had positive margins and most received post-op RT.
**4-yr LRC 44% (positive margins) vs 24% (RT). No difference in MS or 4-yr OS. 
**Conclusion: incomplete surgery (+adjuvant RT) affords improved local control compared to RT alone

==Surgery + RT vs. Primary Chemo-RT==
*'''Singapore''' (1996-2000)
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to slow accrual.'' 199 patients, resectable Stage III/IV SCHNC excluding NPC and salivary glands (larynx 32% (supraglottis 23%), oral cavity 27%, oropharynx 21%, hypopharynx 12%). T4 56%. Arm 1) surgery + adjuvant RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) RT 66/33 + concurrent cisplatin 20 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles. 90% received at least 1 cycle of chemo

***Outcome: 3-year DFS: S+RT 50% vs. chemo-RT 40% (NS). Organ preservation (larynx/hypopharynx 68%, oropharynx 55%, oral cavity 21%, paranasal sinus 0%). Chemo-RT group had poor surgical salvage of 47%, with no long-term survivors
***Conclusion: Chemo-RT not superior to surgery+RT, but can be attempted for organ preservation in larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx


==Pre-op RT vs Post-op RT==
*Historically, pre-op RT was favored since it facilitated regression of tumor, and improved LRC over surgery alone
*However, morbidity of this approach lead to greater emphasis on post-op RT in 1960's and 1970's (see Fletcher PMID 13403033 (1957), PMID 4190460(1970))
*Randomized trial RTOG 73-03 demonstrated significantly better LRC for post-op RT
*Please see [[Talk:Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Post-op|discussion tab]] for more trials


*'''RTOG 73-03''' (1973-1979)
**Randomized. 320 patients. Operable stage T2-T4 any N (but not fixed); oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, or maxillary sinus. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 50 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op RT 60 Gy. In addition, OC and OP lesions may be randomized Arm 3) definitive RT 65-70 Gy, with surgery reserved for salvage (n=43).

***Outcome: LRC post-op 65% vs pre-op 48% (SS). Higher rate of persistent disease and recurrence in pre-op. Trend toward improved survival, 38% vs 33% (p=0.1). 
***Toxicity: Complication rate similar. 
***Definitive RT arm: For OC and OP lesions (three-arm randomization), 4-yr OS pre-op 30% vs post-op 36% vs definitive 33% (NS), and LRC 43% vs 52% vs 38% (NS); however total number of patients was small
***Conclusion: Post-op RT superior to pre-op RT

***Only pre-op vs. post-op subset (n=277). Oral cavity (14%), oropharynx (17%), hypopharynx (43%), supraglottic larynx (26%) 
***Outcome: LRC pre-op 58% vs. post-op 70% (SS), &lt;2 years no difference (failures 59% vs. 58%), but marked &gt;2 years (failures 27% vs 8%); OS no difference due to late (&gt;2 years) deaths from DM and from second primaries
***Supraglottic larynx: LRC pre-op 53% vs. post-op 77% (SS); 78% failures &lt;2 years
***Toxicity: no difference
***Conclusion: Post-op RT better for LRC (especially in SGL), but no impact on OS due to distant failure and second primaries
**Comment: some argument for definitive chemoRT instead of surgery and post-op RT since after 2 yrs, distant mets are primary cause of failure resulting in similar 10 OS in this trial. LRC still better for post-op vs definitive RT alone. Also, different doses used, at the time believed equivalent given the setting

***Intervention group: Induction Chemotherapy with TCF (Docetaxel, Cisplatin and 5FU)followed by surgery and post-op RT
***Control Group: Upfront Surgery with Post-operative radiotherapy. In both arms, Post-op RT was 54 to 60 Gy EBRT, those with high risk features (defined as positive margins, ECE and vascular invasion) were given 66 Gy of EBRT(no chemoradiation was given)
***Conclusion: Similar outcome.Response rate: 80.6%  ; pCR rate:?;Toxicity:None with Grade III or IV;Post-op Complications: Similar; Recurrence Rate: Similar; Survival: DFS and OS are similar.

==Surgery alone vs Postop RT==
*For patients with locally advanced disease, surgery + postop RT has been widely practiced since Maccomb and Fletcher publication in 1957
*Two small randomized trials suggested improvement in LRC for postop RT over surgery alone. Similarly, several single institution retrospective series showed benefit for improved LRC
*SEER analysis suggests that postop RT in patients with LN+ results in 5-year CSS/OS increase by 10%. Surgery alone cures a third of patients, adjuvant RT adds 10% survival benefit, although this varies dramatically by site and nodal stage
*Current indications include pT3-T4, pN2-N3 disease, nodal disease in Levels IV-V, PNI+, or LVI+

==Post-op Chemotherapy + Radiation==
*Historically, resectable locally advanced HNSCC were treated with surgery + adjuvant RT. Unfortunately, recurrence rates were ~30%, DM rates ~25%, and 5-year OS was ~30%. Majority of recurrences were loco-regional. Patients with SM+ did particularly poorly
*RTOG 85-03(1992,IJROBP)evaluated sequential post-op cisplatin/5-FU followed by RT. There was no benefit in loco-regional control or overall survival
*Meanwhile, early randomized data from Yale (1993,IJROBP) showed an LRC and DFS benefit for concurrent mitomycin C. The LRC and DFS benefit, though without impact on OS, was confirmed in a study from Slovenia evaluating adjuvant mitomycin C and bleomycin
*An early randomized French trial (Bachaud, 1996, IJROBP) demonstrated a survival benefit with concurrent cisplatin
*Concurrent cisplatin with RT was subsequently evaluated in two large randomized trials in US (RTOG 95-01) and Europe (EORTC 22931). The EORTC trial showed significantly better LRC, DFS and OS; the RTOG trial showed significantly better LRC and DFS without impact on OS. Patients had &quot;high-risk&quot; features, which variously included SM+, LN+, ECE, PNI+, LVI+, and T3-4 disease. Joint analysis showed significant benefit for ECE+ or SM+ disease
*Current NCCN recommendations (v2.2008) specify ECE+ or SM+ for concurrent chemo-RT; patients with pT3-T4, pN2-N3, nodal disease in levels IV-V, PNI+ or LVI+ may be treated with RT alone or considered individually for chemo-RT
*However, concurrent cisplatin may be reasonably toxic and a concurrent carboplatin was evaluated. Two trials were closed early due to slow accrual; analysis of the smaller data sets revealed no impact on DFS or OS

*'''RTOG 85-03 / Intergroup 0034''' (1984-1989) -- cisplatin/5-FU
**Randomized. 442 patients. Completely resected tumors of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. R2 excision not allowed. Arm 1) Post-op RT alone vs Arm 2) Post-op chemotherapy (cisplatin/5-FU x 3 courses q3wk) followed by RT. RT dose 50-54 Gy; boost to 60 Gy for close margins (&lt;5mm) or ECE.

***Outcome: 4-year OS RT 44% vs. chemo-RT 48% (NS); DFS 38% vs. 46% (NS); LRC 70% vs. 74% (NS); reduced first failure in neck 10% vs. 5% (SS), DM 23% vs. 15% (SS)
***Subgroup analysis of high-risk group (margins &lt; 5mm, CIS at margin, ECE) showed a trend to improvement in LC with chemo. So it may be important to select high-risk group to see a benefit from chemo.
***Conclusion: No benefit for adjuvant sequential chemo-RT over RT alone

**Retrospective subgroup analysis of combined data from postop chemo-RT trials EORTC 229131 and RTOG 9501. Both trials concomitant cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W and RT 60-66 Gy. Difference in &quot;high-risk&quot;: EORTC SM+ , ECE, clinical involvement of Level IV-V from oral cavity/oropharynx primary, perineural disease, or vascular embolism vs. RTOG SM+, ECE, 2+ LN. Difference in endpoints: EORTC PFS vs RTOG LRC. Difference in dose: EORTC 66 Gy in 91% vs RTOG 66 Gy in 13%. 
**Risk factors: ECE or SM+ had negative impact on OS. No other factors (2+ lymph nodes, PNI+, LVI+, Stage III-IV disease) showed difference

===Radiotherapy dose===
*Fletcher: 60 Gy 
*Peters, 1993: 63 Gy for ECE+, otherwise 57.6 Gy
*RTOG 9501: 60 Gy +/- 6 Gy boost (given in 13%)
*EORTC 22931: 66 Gy to high risk region, 54 Gy to large field
*Recommendations (NCCN v2.2008):
**Primary: &gt;= 60 Gy in 2 Gy/fx
**Involved nodal stations: &gt;= 60 Gy in 2 Gy/fx
**Uninvolved nodal stations: &gt;= 50 Gy in 2 Gy/fx


*Fletcher recommended 50 Gy in 25 fractions to control microscopic disease in an ''undissected'' neck. But Fletcher recommended 60 Gy in 30 fractions for a post-operative neck because of hypoxia due to disturbed vascular supply (in the ''Textbook of Radiotherapy, 2nd edition'').
*Peters (M.D. Anderson), 1993 (1983-91) - PMID 8482629 &amp;mdash; &quot;Evaluation of the dose for postoperative radiation therapy of head and neck cancer: first report of a prospective randomized trial.&quot; Peters LJ et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Apr 30;26(1):3-11. 
**Purpose: 1) define groups with high and low risk for recurrence, 2) determine the optimal radiotherapy dose, 3) study the dose-response relationship for normal tissue injury
**Randomized. 302 pts. (report based on 240 pts). Eligible pts: oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or unknown primary.  Used a points system to assign pts to low or high risk.  Low-risk pts randomized between 57.6 Gy and 63 Gy. (originally randomized to 52.2-54 Gy as well, but this arm was dropped.) High-risk pts randomized between 63 Gy and 68.4 Gy.  All gross tumor had to be removed but + margins allowed. 54 Gy was given to surgically undisturbed sites with subclinical disease (i.e. contralateral neck) or putative sites of unknown primary. 57.6 Gy to dissected but pathologically negative neck. The randomized dose was given to the pathologically involved neck and primary &amp;mdash; separate randomized doses to neck and primary, but when the primary site was randomized to a higher dose, it took precedence; if neck was to receive higher dose than the primary, then neck boosted with electrons to the higher dose. 
**''Disease control by dose:'' 2-year loco-regional recurrence rate of 26%. Disease-specific survival continued to decline up to about 5 years due to metastatic disease or second primary tumor. Low risk pts receiving &lt;= 54 Gy had a higher primary failure rate than those with &gt;= 57.6 Gy; no increase in control with doses above 57.6 Gy. Also, the point system they used did not accurately predict for recurrence since high and low risk pts receiving the same dose had the same LF rate. 
**''Analysis of prognostic factors:'' analyzed a subset of 199 pts who received at least 57.6 Gy. Only independent risk factor was extracapsular extension; more than 1 positive LN was of borderline significance. Also a cluster of 2 or more risk factors was associated with worse prognosis. Crude recurrence rate was 20-30% if ECE+ but only 5-13% if ECE- and fewer than 4 other risk factors. With 4 or risk factors other than ECE, did just as bad as with ECE. 
**''Dose response for high risk group:'' for pts with ECE, 2-yr control rate was 52% for 57.6 Gy vs 74% for 63 Gy. No added benefit for 68.4 Gy. 
**Conclusions: 57.6 Gy is adequate dose for post-op RT without extracapsular extension; 63 Gy for pts with ECE. 
**See list of risk factors used in this paper (separate section above).

===Alternative Fractionation===
*Evidence for intensifying RT through accelerated fractionation/hyperfractionation after surgery is not strong
*Some benefit might be seen in patients who delay start of RT &gt;7 weeks, but this is on subset analysis
*Balanced against this is the fact that toxicity typically tends to be significantly higher


*'''Sklodowska-Curie Cancer Center, Poland''' (2001-2004) -- conventional RT 5-days/week vs. accelerated RT 7-days/week
**Randomized. 279 patients, high-risk SCC larynx (57%) vs. oral cavity/oropharynx (43%). High risk determined by score using tumor site, SM status, SM width, LVI, grade, number of LN+, ECE, and LN grade. Surgery + lymph node dissection. Arm 1) Conventional RT 63/35 over 7 weeks vs. Arm 2) Accelerated RT 63/35 over 5 weeks

***Outcome: 3-year LRC CF 64% vs. CAIR 70% (NS). Planned subset analysis oropharynx/oral cavity 53% vs. 74% (SS), larynx 72% vs. 67% (NS). LC 73% vs. 81% (NS); neck control 81% vs. 83% (NS). 3-year OS 52% vs. 55% (NS)
***Toxicity: Confluent mucositis CF 33% vs. CAIR 60%, but considered acceptable. Late toxicity Grade 3-4 CF 6% vs. 13%
***Conclusion: Improvement in LRC restricted to patients with oropharynx/oral cavity; no benefit in patients with larynx

*'''Italy Multi-Institutional''' (1994-2001) -- conventional 60/30 vs. accelerated concomitant boost 64/35
**Randomized. 226 patients, locally advanced oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx, with high-risk features (pT4, SM+, N2-3, PNI+, LVI+, ECE+, subglottic extension) after surgery. Arm 1) conventional RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) accelerated RT &quot;biphasic concomitant boost&quot; during first/last week to deliver 64 Gy over 5 weeks. Primary endpoint LRC
**'''2005''' PMID 15708255 -- &quot;Accelerated versus conventional fractionated postoperative radiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer: results of a multicenter Phase III study.&quot; (Sanguineti G, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Mar 1;61(3):762-71.) Median F/U 2.5 years
***Outcome: 2-year LRC CF 80% vs. AF 78% (NS), trend to benefit for patients with RT delay &gt;7 weeks. 2-year OS 67% vs. 64% (NS)
***Toxicity: Confluent mucositis CF 27% vs. AF 50% (SS), duration same. Late toxicity 18% vs. 27% (NS), though data preliminary
***Conclusion: Accelerated fractionation not beneficial overall, might be option for patients who delay starting RT

**Risk adapted, part randomized. 213 patients, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx. Risk factors ECE, &gt;1 nodal group, &gt;=2 LN+, &gt;3-cm LN, oral cavity, SM+, PNI+ (Peters 1993)
***Low risk (no risk factors): no RT
***Intermediate risk (1 risk factor, excluding ECE): conventional RT 57.6/32
***High risk (ECE or 2+ risk factors): randomized Arm 1) conventional RT 63/35 in 7 weeks vs. accelerated RT 63/35 in 5 weeks concomitant boost. Undissected neck received 54 Gy and dissected but negative neck 57.6 Gy.

***Outcome: 5-year LRC low risk patients 90% vs. intermediate risk patients 94% vs. high risk patients 68% (SS). High risk CF ~60% vs. AF ~75% (NS). 5-year OS low risk 83% vs. intermediate risk 66% vs. high risk 42%, CF ~35% vs. AF ~50% (NS)
***Treatment time: 5-year LRC &lt;11 weeks 76% vs. &gt;11 weeks 62% vs &gt;13 weeks 38% (SS); 5-year OS 48% vs. 27% v. 25% (SS). Surgery-RT interval &gt;6 weeks detrimental
***Conclusion: Risk stratification appropriate. Accelerated fractionation better for patients with delay &gt;6 weeks of starting RT, combined treatment time should be &lt;11 weeks

*'''Cairo, Egypt''' -- conventional RT 60/30 vs. accelerated RT 46.2/33 TID in 2 weeks

***Outcome: 3-year LRC AHF 88% vs. CF 57% (SS), 3-year OS 60% vs. 46% (NS). No benefit for T(pot) evaluation on multivariate analysis, though rapid tumors higher risk of DM. Surgery-RT gap shouldn't exceed 6 weeks
***Toxicity: acute mucositis more severe in AHF, fibrosis and late edema also worse in AHF
***Conclusion: Accelerated hyperfractionation improved local control, but without survival impact

***Outcome: 3-year DFS 46%, no difference between arms. AHF better survival in fast growing tumors (thymidine labeling index &gt;10.4%)
***Toxicity: Acute toxicity higher in AF arm, but 3-year late toxicity CF 87% vs. AF 64% (SS)
***Conclusion: No survival benefit for AF overall, but benefit in faster growing tumors

===Overall treatment time===
*Based, in part, on the fact that overall treatment time for intact head &amp; neck cancers influences outcome and the theory of accelerated repopulation. (Withers' data - Radiobiology). 
*Overall treatment time should be less than 100 days.
*RT should begin within 6 weeks of surgery

**Retrospective. 208 pts. 
**Overall package time (&gt;= vs &lt; 100 days) was significant on multivariate analysis.

**Retospective. 420 pts. 
**Surgery to radiotherapy interval was not a significant predictor for failure.

**Oral cavity.
**Improved local control for the unfavorable group if overall &quot;package time&quot; (i.e. from surgery to end of radiotherapy) was within 100 days. For surgery to XRT interval (cutoff: 45-50 days), there was a nonsignificant trend. Also a trend for shorter duration of RT.

**Retrospective. 111 pts. Examined time from surgery to start of RT (S-R interval).
**Of 50 pts with S-R interval of 6 weeks or more, 11 (22%) had a local recurrence. 8 of these 11 had RT dose &lt; 56 Gy. Of 17 pts with a delay of 6 weeks who had at least 60 Gy, only 2 (12%) had LR. For those who started RT within 6 weeks and had at least 60 Gy, 3/20 (15%) had a LR. The effect of delay was significant only in those who had &lt; 60 Gy.
**Conclusion: prolonged delay in starting RT does not by itself have a negative impact if doses of 60 Gy or more are given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pros==
#Ratpoison is extremely lightweight and will therefore run on ancient hardware as well as a 32-way SPARC.
#Rodent usage is minimized and the keyboard is promoted, relieving your arms and shoulders and decreasing the risk of injury
#Ratpoison works very well with multiple monitors

==Cons==
#A bit cumbersome to work with
#Not suited for UNIX beginners, this is a window manager written by experts for experts
#Some programs are not written for this kind of window managers and do not work very well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As stated in the introduction, these instructions assume a working X Windows system.

==Starting ratpoison==
To launch ratpoison as your default window manager you need to edit the file ~/.xinitrc in your homedir; this might already have been done for you by a package manager. The file should just contain the command &quot;ratpoison&quot;, without the quotes. Now start your X server:

 startx

Within a second or two, you'll see a cursor in the middle of the screen superimposed on a dappled grey background, and a small welcome text in the upper right corner that welcomes you to ratpoison- this welcome manager instructs you to type in &quot;C-t ?&quot; if you have any questions. Now is where the fun starts, but first some background on how to interact with and control ratpoison.

==The almighty escape key==
Ratpoison is only controlled by the keyboard; no matter what you click with your mouse on the root window, nothing will happen. Instead, you give it a keyboard command. All ratpoison commands are initiated by typing the escape key sequence. By default, this is Control-t (in Emacs notation, which is preferentially used by ratpoison documentation and users: &quot;C-t&quot;). Try typing C-t, and you'll see that the mouse changes into a white square. This means that ratpoison has taken over the keyboard and is ready to interpret any letter typed as a command (as opposed to normal operation where anything typed is sent to an application to deal with). After typing C-t, try hit the &quot;c&quot; key (note that this is a lowercase key; capital C does not currently do anything). Immediately an X terminal opens up and takes over the screen (assuming xterm is installed as it usually is); in other words, the command c creates a console window. Now you can do anything you could do on the command line, and you can even run your graphical programs like Firefox (the command for starting firefox from a terminal is &quot;mozilla-firefox&quot;)- ratpoison will automatically switch to the newest windows.

Note that if constantly pressing C-t to prefix all commands is uncomfortable (if you, for example are using the Dvorak keyboard layout) you can change it dynamically or in the configuration file. Please see one of the advanced chapters for more information on adjusting key bindings.

==Key strokes==
Try a few different key strokes- you can find the command list in the ratpoison manual or info documentation, or you can type C-t ?, which will give a brief list of sequences. Remember, all key strokes are preceded with C-t.

A useful pair of commands are C-t n (shifts your view to the '''n'''ext window; like conventional alt-tab) and its inverse C-t p (shifts your view to the '''p'''revious window; if you just C-t n'ed, for example, a C-t p will take you back to the original window).

Actually, shouldn't the bookshelf link to Using Ratpoison's cover, and the ToC be the next logical subpage?  If that's the case, then this subpage is a duplicate, and an admin SHOULD delete it.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:41, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Organizing the book ==
I noticed your new book [[Using Ratpoison]]. It seems to get very professional. I just want to let you know at an early stage, that a prefered way of creating subpages is &quot;/&quot; or &quot;:&quot; (without spaces before and afterwards), where &quot;/&quot; gives you the additional advantage that you get an automatic link back to your main page. Have a look at the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]] or the recent conversion at [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. 
I'd therefore recommend to organize your book like this:
 [[Using Ratpoison]]        &lt;- should be what you currently call Table of Contents
 [[Using Ratpoison/Cover]]  &lt;- Move your cover here (you can link from the bookshelf here)
 [[Using Ratpoison/Introduction]]  &lt;- move &quot;What is Ratpoison&quot; and &quot;Pros and cons&quot; here
 [[Using Ratpoison/Your first steps]]
and so on.
Avoid having too many subpages if you don't have the content yet. For your book, 3 or 4 subpages are enough (more can be easily created later as soon as you have enough content). If there are questions, just ask. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:11, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:Thank you very much for your feedback. This is in fact my first wikibook, so I am glad for any hints that I can get. I will edit the pages subsequently as soon as I can find some spare time. [[User:Etnoy|Etnoy]] 08:16, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty here to implement this.  Don't forget that the pipe character '|' can be used to show a link name that differs from the link path, for clarity's sake.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:04, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Actually, it looks like Etnoy has this well in-hand, the bookshelf just needs a little cleanup.  [[User:Orethrius|Orethrius van Degaurde]] 07:09, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Ratpoison ==

I've been doing a bit of work on the ratpoison book lately- I'm essentially rewriting it and adding in my notes from the past few days (I recently installed a fresh Debian and decided to learn Ratpoison), so my additions reflect my middling knowledge; for example, I'm currently hoping to find out soon how to remap C-t to maybe Win or C-z. Incidentally, what is the copyright on that ratpoison logo? --[[User:Marudubshinki|Maru]]  [[User talk:Marudubshinki|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki|Contribs]] 23:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

There are so much implementation defined pragmas that the language defined ones are not easily seen. A possible solution (if this is seen as a problem) is to make two lists: language defined pragmas, and implementation defined pragmas. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 10:18, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

      <comment>/* What are the different types of conlangs? */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navlist/Top}}

Conlanging, the art of creating a language, is a very in-depth, but fun, process. It is considered an art form by many. The people who conlang are called conlangers. Conlanging isn't just a hobby, though. You can learn a lot about how real languages work by creating conlangs and improving them.

== Why construct a conlang? ==
* To learn about linguistics.  Conlanging has been used as a teaching tool in university-level linguistics.
* To explore how the way we speak affects the way we think.  This is related to the ''Sapir-Whorf hypothesis'', which we'll have more to say about later.
* To have private conversations with trusted individuals.
* For a personal diary, or similar personal writing.
* For use as a lingua franca to bridge gaps between people with different languages, on a regional or global scale.  The most famous example, amongst many, is [[Esperanto]].
* For use in a work of fiction.  This is typically done in works of alternative history, fantasy, and science fiction.  Some well-known recent examples are [[Klingon]], [[Na'vi]], and [[w:Dothraki language|Dothraki]].
* For the sheer pleasure of artistic creation.  A famous example is Tolkien's [[w:Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] &amp;mdash; which then ''inspired'' him to works of fiction.

== What are the different types of conlangs? ==
''For a more exhaustive list, see [[Conlang/Types|the next chapter]].''
* Engineered Languages (engelangs) &amp;mdash; designed to meet objective criteria.  These are often experimental.
** Logical Languages (loglangs)&amp;mdash; built around the structure of logic.
** Philosophical Languages &amp;mdash; constructed to meet some philosophical goal.
* Auxiliary Languages (auxlangs) &amp;mdash; designed as common second languages for people with different native languages.
** International Auxiliary Languages (IALs).
* Artistic Languages (artlangs) &amp;mdash; designed as or for works of art.
** Fictional langauges &amp;mdash; designed to be used by the people in the fictional worlds of books, movies, games, and so on.  Some of them may be spoken by aliens (exolangs or xenolangs), using sounds we can't easily make, or using grammatical structure different from the way any of our languages work.
** Alternative Languages (altlangs) &amp;mdash; designed as a plausible alternative way a language might have evolved from some real language, based on some alternate history.

Since each kind of conlang has a different goal, each involves a different process of creation.

The most common conlangs are artlangs.  Many conlangers create a con''world'' to go with their conlang.  They create a conrace, with a conculture.  The process of creating a conworld is outlined in the [[Conworld|Conworld wikibook]].

The different types of conlangs will be discussed, with examples, in [[Conlang/Types|the next section]].

== Where do I start? ==

This wikibook is designed to help you, the conlanger, create a fairly involved conlang.  It will take you step-by-step through the process.

As you work through the steps outlined in this wikibook, you will probably have numerous questions.  A good central place to find resources, including community resources like mailing lists and blogs, is the [https://conlang.org/ Language Creation Society].

      <text xml:space="preserve">We don't know the future, but we can guess what it may be like. It may be our idea of paradise (like the Culture) or our idea of hell (like 1984). A conworld set in the future has much less to go on than one set in the past. That may be one of the main reasons that futuristic conworlds are rarely seen, though there are certainly other factors.

A '''consociety''' is a fictional constructed society, usually for use within a [[conworld]]. A consociety details information about a given people, their cultural practices and lifestyles, as well as politics, government, and morals. This book will help you develop a fleshed-out, in-depth consociety for use in anything from novels to video games to role-playing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Kinetic Energy ==
Kinetic energy is the energy of a mass in motion. In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;K_E =  \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;
:where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.

== Potential Energy ==
Potential energy in a constant gravitational field is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;P_E = \ mgh&lt;/math&gt;
:where m is the mass of the object, g is the strength of the gravitational field (&lt;math&gt;9.8 m/s^2&lt;/math&gt; on earth) and h is the height of the object.

Work-Kinetic energy relation
:&lt;math&gt;W = 1/2mV_F^2 - 1/2mV_I^2&lt;/math&gt;

Potential energy, kinetic energy relationship
:&lt;math&gt;K_E = P_E, 1/2mV^2 = mGH &lt;/math&gt;

The law states that P_E (potential energy) is the energy of a given mass and position a certain amount of energy at such a height. When the object is in motion, K_E (kinetic energy), the potential energy is than transfered to kinetic energy. Since due to the third law of thermodynamics which states that energy can not be created nor destroyed, but only tranfered, such transfer of energy can occur

For a given equation, in order to figure out the work of the position, it can be done one of either two ways. The calculus method (which involves integration of the function) and the algebraic way (which involves the work kinetic energy relationship)

Calculus method (ex)-the compression of a spring from 1 m to 4 meters

Since integration basically finds the area of the given function (which can also be shown by the graph if possible). If F = Kx, where F is the force, K is the force constant, and x is the distance it was compressed.  If the original function is F = Kx, since K is a constant, this than becomes K*(integral)X which then becomes K*x^2/2.

In order to figure out the work due to a changing amount of velocity, first determine how much &quot;energy&quot; is in the given system. Your equation from now on will be mgh + 1/2mV^2 = energy at full height.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Tying a reef knot =

The Boy Scout instructions for this knot are: right-over-left and under; left-over-right and through. 

More formal, tie a left-handed overhand knot and then a right-handed overhand knot or vice versa.

Do not tie two knots of the same handedness. That makes a [[Scouting/Knots/Bends/Granny knot|Granny knot]].

= Description =

[[Image:SquareKnot.png|443x221px]]

'''This knot is the first knot most Boy Scouts learn, and in fact mastery of the knot is listed among the joining requirements in several countries.'''

The Reef knot is only useful in basic applications. It should be used to bind small laces or ropes together, provided not too much force is applied on it, but should not be used as a [[Scouting/Knots/Bends|bend knot]]. It is easily tied and since it won't jam, also easily untied. It is used to tie packages, and as a base for the shoe-bow. Sailors used it for binding rolled sails or better reefed sails.

If you pull on one end, at right-angles to the knot, it will loosen and invert (turning into a lark's head knot), hence its original purpose: it secured the furled-in sails, and is easily undone one-handedly by a sailor who is holding on with the other hand. The weight of the sail would drag the lark's head undone.

== Critics ==

A number of knotting guides have voted this knot &quot;the worst knot&quot;, and noted that more deaths and injuries have been caused by its misuse than all other knots combined. Its symmetry and initial feel of security have led to it having a wide and undeserved reputation as a secure knot, which it certainly is not, especially if the ropes are of differing sizes or materials, or if the rope is likely to be bumped.

The International Guild of Knot Tyers (IGKT) warns that this knot should never be used to bend two ropes together even though many scout troops, and other organisations around the world, insist on teaching it for this very purpose. It is likely that this is the cause of most of the deaths referred to above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Taxation is the method by which a government gains revenue to spend on things like [[w:public services|public services]] and [[w:welfare|welfare]] benefits. There are many methods by which &lt;b&gt;tax revenue&lt;/b&gt; can be gained, and different definitions and structures to taxation which are outlined below. Also, conflicts in choosing methods and forms of taxation occur, pitting priorities such as reducing iniquity of income against maximising incentive for economic growth.

==Principles of a Good Tax System==
The following were first proposed by the great economist [[w:Adam Smith|Adam Smith]], and are still applicable today, although many other economists have added and improved on his theories:
# &lt;b&gt;Efficient&lt;/b&gt; - A tax system should raise enough revenue such that government projects can be adequately sponsored, without burdening the tax payer too much, or disincentivising investment or work
# &lt;b&gt;Understandable&lt;/b&gt; - The system should not be incomprehensible to the layperson, nor should it appear unjust or unneedfully complex. This is to minimise discontent, and costs.
# &lt;b&gt;Equitable&lt;/b&gt; - Taxation should be governed by people's &lt;i&gt;ability to pay&lt;/i&gt;, that is, wealthier individuals or firms with greater incomes should pay more in tax while those with lower incomes should pay comparatively less.
# &lt;b&gt;Benefit Principle&lt;/b&gt; - Those that use a publicly provided service (which is funding primarily through taxation) should pay for it! However, conflicts in principle may and often do arise between this and principle 3.

==Direct and Indirect Taxation==
*&lt;b&gt;Direct taxes&lt;/b&gt; are paid on the income of the wage earner and is usually collected before the worker collect his/her wages.
*&lt;b&gt;Indirect taxation&lt;/b&gt; is often avoidable and is not taken from wages. An example of indirect taxation is VAT (Value Added Tax) or sales tax placed on goods and services. 

The benefits and costs of both forms of taxation are many. Taxation is required in a civilized society to provide for goods and services the private sector cannot provide profitably. The administration of these needs is also funded by taxation.  

Direct taxation can decrease the incentive to work.  As the marginal rate of income taxation increases, the incentive to work decreases.

On the other hand, indirect taxation may result in people with similar incomes and wealth paying different amounts, simply as a result of slightly different circumstance. For example, someone who has to travel 50km to work every day will pay more tax over the year than another who can walk, even though they may earn the same amount of money.  In this particular example it is important to note two things:  1) The choice to live 50km away is a choice that can be avoided, and 2), the worker who travels farther uses marginally more public services (roads, safety costs, pollution control efforts) than the closer individual. VAT taxes can be avoided by increased savings, and although generally considered a &quot;regressive&quot; tax, affecting lower incomes proportionally more than higher incomes, the VAT tax does allow for the taxation of undeclared income when purchases are made.

==Taxation Structure==
It is worth knowing some termnology to make understanding easier. The marginal rate of tax (&lt;b&gt;MRT&lt;/b&gt;) is the percentage taken in tax of the &lt;i&gt;next (insert currency unit here) earned&lt;/i&gt;. So, if your MRT is 10%, every next part of your income you earn will be taxed at 10%. However, this doesn't make your average rate of tax (&lt;b&gt;ART&lt;/b&gt;) 10%. Consider the following:
* Say your income is &amp;sect;10,000. If the first half of your income is taxed at 5%, and the second half at 15%, your MRT is 15%. However, your ART is 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;[(0.05 x 5000) + (0.15 x 5000)]/10000 = 10%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
===Proportional Taxation===
Proportional taxation means that &lt;b&gt;MRT = ART&lt;/b&gt;, so if a low income earner is taxed at 20%, so is a higher income earner. The &lt;i&gt;proportion&lt;/i&gt; of tax paid is always the same, though in absolute terms it goes up the higher your income.
===Progressive Taxation===
Progressive taxation means that &lt;b&gt;MRT &gt; ART&lt;/b&gt; (if you are pedantic, if MRT and ART do not equal zero!). For example, in the UK there are three rates of income tax - 10% 'starting tax', 22% 'standard tax', and 40% high rate of tax. For a low income earner, ART will be around 10-22%, whereas a very high income earner will pay more like 30-40% ART. Thus, higher income earners pay a greater proportion of their income in tax than low earners.
===Regressive Taxation===
Essentially, &lt;b&gt;ART &gt; MRT&lt;/b&gt;. This is very rarely done intentionally by a government, as it would be extremely unpopular and would be seen as supporting wealthy, high income individuals over more needy households. However, indirect taxation could be said to partly support this. Very high income earners may spend a lower proportion of their income on goods and services, and so pay &lt;i&gt;proportionally&lt;/i&gt; fewer taxes as a percentage of their income.

== Availability of Drivers ==

It is a modern myth that Windows has better hardware support than Linux. In fact, Linux is the operating system, or kernel if you want, that has support for the largest number of hardware out there. Therefore the sentence &quot;Microsoft Windows is better in terms of hardware compatibility&quot; should be removed.

== Recommended Software List Linking ==

I noticed that some of the Software in the Recommended Software List was split between Wikipedia links or linking to the software web site. Should we make them all link to Wikipedia, link to an external website, or just leave it alone? --[[User:Aurora98|Aurora98]] ([[User talk:Aurora98|talk]]) 03:48, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== Mmm? ==

Shouldn't it be &quot;Installing the software&quot; instead of &quot;Assembling the software&quot; on the table of contents? Just an opinion.. [[User:Icez|Icez]]
:Fixed it. However, you could have fixed it yourself.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 07:41, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

== Recommended Software List ==

If you want to add stuff to the aforementioned list, please ensure that you do the following:

# If there is an equivalent program on the list already, so not add it.  Mention it on the talk page so that others can look at it before it gets added.
# There should be no doubles of programs, unless their job is completely different.  (E.g. MSN Messenger does a different job to AIM).


This is all just to ensure that the list doesn't get crowded with unnecessary programs... --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 10:40, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

:How do we keep this NPOV, if we can only choose one program to be bleesed by our guide? I'm thinking that the recomended software for both Linux and Windows should be removed.[[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]]

We can't truly have a NPOV but its useful for someone who is assembling a PC. I'm a little confused as to why there are suggestions of desktop environments, those in my opinion are purely personal preference.[[User:71.116.38.46|71.116.38.46]] 02:07, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

== Mac OSX86 ==

Should we include how to install Mac OSX86 (for those who don't know a hacked version of Mac OS X top work freely on PCs) or should we be afraid of lawyers?

I think it might be a good idea not to encourage any illegal activities.[[User:71.116.38.46|71.116.38.46]] 02:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

I personally think that we should only stick to mainstream stuff. Mac OSX86 is both illegal and not as mainstream as, say, Linux or BSD. My opinion, but I think it's best we just keep it how it is, and just expand on the description of the existing operating systems. --[[User:Aurora98|Aurora98]] ([[User talk:Aurora98|talk]]) 02:32, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

==Operating Systems==

There needs to additional explanation as to the function of an operating system.  Assume your readership is fairly new to the subject of computer software in general.

[[User:4.245.113.84|4.245.113.84]] 22:24, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

==OpenSuSE==
Hey, just thinking that perhaps it shouldn't say that opensuse is the best GNU/Linux OS. I'm pretty sure there's some rule against being biast like that. Maybe it should be something like &quot;one of the more well known Linux distros&quot;. Also, I changed it to version 10.2 (from 10.1).
:Yeah, it's called having a POV. The rule on Wikipedia is to make the articles NPOV. I assume that carries over mostly to WikiBooks as well. ---[[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 04:50, 26 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[w:Overclocking|Overclocking]] is the practice of making a component run at a higher clock speed than the manufacturer's specification. The idea is to increase performance for free or to exceed current performance limits, but this may come at the cost of stability. 

Extensive overclocking will result in the destruction of hardware so ensure proper cooling before overclocking.

Overclocking is like souping up a car: if you just want to get where you're going, there's no need for it. But it is fun and educational and can get you a machine that provides performance all out of proportion to its cost.

Think of the 3GHz on your new 3GHz Pentium 4 as a speed limit asking to be broken. Some other components in your computer can also be overclocked, including RAM and your video card in many cases. Over clocking is possible because of the way electronic parts, especially VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) chips are made and sold.  All processors in a given line, the Pentium 4 for example, are made the same way, on a large die that is cut up into individual processors, those processors are then tested and graded as to speed, the best chips will be marked as 3.0 GHz the second best 2.8 etc. As time goes by and production processes and masks improve, even the lower rated chips may be capable of faster speeds, especially if vigorous cooling is implemented. Also many manufacturers will mark chips that test faster at slower speeds if there is higher demand for the lower end component. 

It’s important to note that not every chip will be overclockable; it’s really the luck of the draw. Some companies that sell ‘factory overclocked’ systems engage in a practice called “binning” where they buy a number of processors, test them for overclocking potential and throw the ones that don’t overclock in a bin to be resold at their rated speed. Even with processors that have a reputation for overclocking well, some parts simply will not exceed their rating. 

That said, effective cooling can give a boost to a chip's overclockability. With luck you will be able to get extra performance out of your components for free. With luck and skill you can get performance that is not possible even when using the top of the line components. Sometimes you can buy cheaper parts, and then OC them to the clock speed of the higher end component, though the cost of extra cooling can compromise any money you may be saving on the part, not to mention warranty and part life issues.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;'''WARNING: OVERCLOCKING MAY VOID THE WARRANTY ON THE PARTS BEING OVERCLOCKED. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, AS OVERCLOCKING MAY ALSO CAUSE SYSTEM INSTABILITY, AND MAY ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE TO COMPONENTS AND DATA. REMEMBER THE 3 &quot;C'S&quot; WHEN OVERCLOCKING: CAREFUL, CONSERVATIVE, and CAUTIOUS.'''&lt;/font&gt;

== Things that can't be overclocked ==
Although it is possible to overclock many of the components of a computer (such as the CPU, FSB frequency and video card), it is not possible to overclock all components. For example, it is not possible to overclock a hard disk drive nor an optical drive such as a CD-ROM drive. For such devices other solutions exist, i.a. use a quicker file system and/or faster components in the first place; also in some special cases of hard disks drives, update the driver (which contains optimized code); remap blocks with high latencies to low latency blocks (using a tool such as mhdd), and in event a RAID is present, change the configuration, driver and/or software and/or settings. However such techniques and procedures are beyond the scope of this document.

== Components ==

=== CPU ===

==== Choosing the CPU ====

While the CPU is usually the best component to overclock , most CPU's these days are locked , which means that the multiplier cannot be changed from its default clocks. While previously(until Sandy Bridge) , users used to work around this limitation by adjusting the base clock of the CPU , on Sandy Bridge till Broadwell(2nd to 5th) , attempting to do so over a few megahertz would usually cause the system to crash , even if the CPU itself is stable. This is because increasing the base clock would also affect other system components. &lt;br /&gt;

This means that , at a best case scenario of a 5 MHz increase over the usual 100 MHz base clock , an i3-4370(3.8 GHz) can only be overclocked by 38*5 = 190 MHz , which would increase the clock speed to only 3.99 GHz.

This limits your CPU choice to the following , if you want to overclock.

# CPU's labelled with a K at the end of their model number(eg:- i5-4690K)
# Extreme Edition processors (X series). An example would be the octa-core i7-5960X.
# Pentium G3258(more on that later)
# C(high end graphics) line.

This also means that you would usually have to pay not only to the tune of an i5(since you can't overclock an i3) , these overclockable chips usually come at a 5-15% premium over the non overclockable but otherwise identical CPU.(There are some exceptions though).

Now about the Pentium G3258. This chip caused a lot of hype when it was first released. This is because it was the cheapest and lowest-end Pentium chip released by Intel in honour of its 20th year anniversary. However , the main steal in this is the fact that this CPU is highly overclockable , which made all the difference. Still though , it won't reach the level of a stock i5 with overclocking , and its dual-core no hyperthreading design can hurt it badly. If you really need to build an ultra-budget PC , then this would most likely be your best choice.

The integrated graphics on the chip can usually be overclocked even on otherwise non-overclockable CPU's.

==== How to overclock ====
For older computers , one changes the clock speed of the CPU in the BIOS. This holds true for newer computers , but you can usually use Intel's [https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU- Extreme Tuning Utility](XTU) if you want to do it in Windows itself. This method , while probably safer , is not the best method to overclock.

Assuming that you have a multiplier-unlocked CPU , head on to the BIOS , look for a CPU-modifying option within the BIOS(it depends between manufacturers) , and raise the All-Core multiplier by a notch(For example , if you have a 3.5 GHz chip with a multiplier of 35x , raise it to 36x).

Then boot back into Windows and then run a stress tool like [http://www.mersenne.org/ Prime95]. It is a good idea to run it for some time(like an hour) but not for too long as you may end up damaging your CPU instead. Keep a watchful eye at the CPU temperatures , you should not go over 85C. If you do , you may need a better CPU cooler. Do NOT use the stock cooler if you are overclocking!

If it passes , go back into the BIOS and increase the multiplier again by a notch. If it fails , return back to the BIOS and then raise the CPU voltage slightly. Then repeat the stress test.

Continue this process till 

# The stress test has failed and you've applied enough voltage , or
# The CPU is running too hot.
# The CPU is throttling(reducing speeds)

It is important that you do not apply too lunch CPU voltage as you may end up increasing the voltage too far and damage it. Also remember to keep any adaptive voltage settings on , as they reduce the voltage and prolong the life of your CPU when it is in idle.


==== For older PC's ====
Assuming that you have selected a quality motherboard, high-quality RAM , thermal solution and power supply; you may wonder why your processor won't exceed a certain speed limit. Lets assume that you have a memory chip that is capable of taking the maximum frequency the motherboard can throw at it and yet, when you exceed a certain speed limit you realize that your system becomes unstable. 

A PCI bus generally runs at 33 Mhz. When you exceed 35-36 Mhz, the hard disk and other IDE devices become unstable, because the IDE controller is controlled through the PCI bus. Oftentimes, you may encounter texture corruption, when your AGP bus exceeds a certain speed limit. This was often observed on older motherboards that wouldn't allow you to lock the AGP and the PCI bus at stock speeds.
 
The good news: regardless of the FSB speed, most motherboards nowadays automatically ensure that the frequency of the PCI, AGP and other buses always remain constant (in other words; their speeds are locked unless you deliberately change them). This implies that the other components connected to the motherboard don't undergo stress when the FSB speed is raised. You have the fastest RAM you could find and the obscenely fast speed ratings on your ensure that you can extract the most performance by bumping up your FSB  speed to the limits. 

The main culprit that plays the spoilsport is your CPU. Even if you have an exceptionally good thermal solution, your CPU won't exceed a certain limit.

Example: I had experimented with a Pentium III 700E Mhz processor and a Pentium III 800E MHz processor  on an Asus CUBX-E motherboard using Kingston PC-133 SD-RAM. The reason I chose these 2 processors for experimentation was because they both used a FSB speed of 100MHz. This motherboard was really flexible, I was able to increment the FSB to 150Mhz. I was able to extract 1050 MHz from the stock 700Mhz. This is because the multiplier is 7, which unfortunately cannot be changed. So I bumped up the FSB from 100Mhz to 150 Mhz; which gave me the resultant speed of:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot; 
| 7&lt;br&gt;(Multiplier) || &amp;times; || 150&lt;br&gt;(Front Side Bus) || = || 1050 MHz&lt;br&gt;(resultant frequency)
|}
                                               
Simple arithmetic? Yes. Now, logically speaking, if I can extract 1050Mhz from a 700Mhz processor; I should be able to extract 1200Mhz from an 800 MHz processor. This is not true. I tried doing exactly the same with the 800 MHz processor and the Computer crashed. However, it was stable when I set the FSB speed to 133 MHz. When I set the FSB at 133 MHz ; this was the result:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot; 
| 8&lt;br&gt;(Multiplier) || &amp;times; || 133&lt;br&gt;(Front Side Bus) || = || 1064 MHz&lt;br&gt;(resultant frequency)
|}

This simple experiment shows that a CPU gets saturated after a certain clock speed. Typical symptoms of an erratic CPU include instability and at times, you may not be able to boot up at all.

This particular CPU die was manufactured using a 0.18u process. When Intel launched a similar CPU using a 0.13u process; they shipped those CPUs with the stock speed of up to 1.4Ghz. This CPU core was based on the P6 Architecture and it used a 10 stage pipeline. Presently, Intel manufactures the Pentium-M CPU which is based on the P-6 architecture; the difference being that they manufacture it using a 0.09u process and they have increased the depth of the pipeline. 

These terms may seem cryptic and this concept may be difficult for some to grasp. It's really very simple: To be a successful overclocker; you need to purchase the best CPU possible; not necessarily the fastest. Always go for a processor that uses the latest manufacturing process. A CPU rated at 3Ghz which is manufactured by using a 0.13u process won't overclock as well as a CPU that is rated at 2.6Ghz using a 0.09u process.

Deeper pipelines ensure that the CPU has the capability to scale higher in terms of speed. The disadvantage is that a CPU with a deeper pipeline is slower than a CPU that uses a smaller pipeline assuming that they are running at the same speed. AMD Athlon CPUs are famous for their relatively short pipelines. Thats why they perform better than the Pentium 4 CPUs at the same clock speed. Before purchasing the fastest processor, always keep this in mind. Choosing a processor smartly helps you extract the maximum speed out of your machine. You don't need to know what a pipeline exactly does. Refer to the processor spec sheet, find out these basic details of the CPU core and its architecture and choose accordingly.

To increase the computer's stability, you may also disable the spread spectrum; set the PCI speed to 100MHz; set the voltage to the middle range, not too high; and disable any smart fan settings. and those settings work for all recommended boards.

=== Video card ===
Two different parts of a video card may be overclocked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Coles | first = Olin | title = Overclocking the NVIDIA GeForce Video Card | url=http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=205&amp;Itemid=38 | accessdate = 2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and the RAM. In addition, disabled pipelines on a video card may also be enabled through third-party drivers, third-party software, or direct hardware modifications depending on your video card type. Overclocking a video card is usually done through third-party or proprietary software. 

Recent ATI proprietary Catalyst drivers feature an interface called Overdrive that allows for dynamic GPU frequency scaling based on its temperature and load. Increase the load, the clock rate increases for performance, but it's balanced against the increasing temperature. Sufficient for simple increases in overall performance, this doesn't allow for the best performance increase which requires overclocking the memory. For that you'll need third-party applications or drivers. 

An application example is ATITool. This program has many options, including GPU and memory overclocking, temperature monitoring, and fan control, allowing for a much more complete solution to overclocking ATI based video cards. There are many third party drivers, omegadrivers.net, for example hosts ATI and nVidia drivers as well. Both of which include integrated overclocking and many unlocked features, including enhanced image quality for nVidia-based cards. 

nVidia video cards can also be OCed through a hidden feature in the driver called coolbits. Coolbits is a feature that can be unlocked by creating a DWORD in regedit for windows operating system. To use the coolbits feature, for windows just simply open the regedit then open the directory HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt;Software&gt;NVIDIA Corporation&gt;NVTweak and create a new DWORD value in the NVTweak folder named coolbits then right-click it&gt;modify type 3 for single card or 1A for SLI in the value name .It is a good a overclocking tool as it has a fairly conservative &quot;optimal clock&quot; once you have thus increased the core clock (not the memory clock!!)  run a gpu intensive task like 3dmark, repeat until you have a sudden drop in the benchmark score. This is the thermal throttling kicking in; do not push it any harder as it will result in permanent damage to your gpu. Back off the clockspeed by about 20-30mhz

The most important thing to remember about overclocking a video card is cooling. This can't be stressed enough. Just as a CPU can be damaged or have a shortened lifespan by overclocking or excessive and prolonged heat, so can a video card. In the past year many inexpensive and easy to install options have surfaced for cooling a video card, from adhesive ram heatsinks which attach to un-cooled ram chips, to rather expensive water-cooling solutions. A good midpoint (both in cost and effectiveness) solution is to purchase and install a direct exhaust, &quot;sandwich&quot; cooling solution. Direct exhaust means all air from the cooling fan is blown across the video card and directly out of the computer case, usually using the open PCI slot below the AGP (or PCIe) slot. This allows for substantially lower GPU temperatures.

A sandwich cooler is two aluminum or copper heatsinks, shape formed for a particular video card, that &quot;sandwiches&quot; the video card in between the two and are usually connected by some kind of copper heat pipe which allows for the hotter side to convey heat to the cooler side for dissipation. The GPU should never surpass 60 degrees Celsius for optimal performance and to avoid damaging the card. Most of the latest video cards are rated to go up to 90c, but this is NOT recommended by anyone. The optimal temperature for a video card is 40-55c for the card itself (the GPU's temperature differs depending on which you have,) but the lower you can get it, the better.

It is also possible to use software to change the fan speed on certain cards. Changing the fan to run at full speed can cool the card better, dependening on your card and the speed of the fan in the first place. Software such as [[Rivatuner]] can be used for Nvidia based cards.

One important thing to note.  Many think that the option which says &quot;AGP voltage&quot; in their BIOS can be used to &quot;voltmod&quot; a video card to get a bit more power out of it.  In fact, it's used for something else, and raising the AGP voltage can and probably will cause damage to a video card.

== Getting the few extra MHz out of a chip ==

=== Cooling ===

When increasing the speed of any computer components you are making the components work harder and by doing so they output more heat. Heat can cause system instability so cooling is necessary to help keep your components stable at higher speeds. Without good cooling you could harm or shorten the life of your system. CPU temperature can usually be checked from within the BIOS. However, these are inaccurate as your CPU is under almost no load in the bios. SiSoftware Sandra may be used within Windows to check temperature. This should be done when your CPU has been under a heavy load for a while for optimum results.

There are three types of cooling that are generally accepted for overclocking: Air, water, and peltier.

With both air cooling and water cooling some type of transfer material is needed to move the energy away from the sensitive electronics. The device used for this purpose is a heatsink. The two most popular heatsink materials are Aluminum and Copper. The heatsink that is stock on factory computers by major manufacturers (Dell, Gateway, IBM) is usually made of aluminum, which has satisfactory heat transfer characteristics. However when overclocking more heat is being produced from the increase in power consumption. In order to obtain lower temperatures a material with better heat transfer properties is important and copper is the material that offers the best ratio of price/performance.

=== Power ===

Chips at higher speeds may need more power. Raising the vcore voltage on a CPU might enable it to go at slightly faster speeds but by doing so you add a lot more heat output from the CPU. The vcore of a processor is the voltage at which a chip is set to run at with the stock speed. This voltage may need to be changed when the multiplier is raised because otherwise the transistors in the chip won't switch fast enough - transistors switch faster the higher the supply voltage. If there is not enough voltage then the chip will begin to make mistakes and give bad data results. Good cooling is needed to keep the system stable at higher speeds. Raising the vcore too much may harm or shorten the life of your system. Raising the vcore can also greatly affect the stability of the system. This is where a high quality PSU will come into play. While many cheap, no-name brand PSU's will crash and die with more vcore, a good quality one will live to serve you for a long time.

Note: increasing the speed (multiplier or fsb) without changing the voltage will also increase heat output, but not as much as when also increasing voltage. Having said that, increasing the multiplier or FSB without adjusting the voltage may make your system unstable (undervolt).

==Epidemiology==
*About 14% of lymphomas; 1% of all cancers.  
*Adult HD has bimodal age distribution: peaks at age 20-29 and again in the 50+ range
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Pediatric_Hodgkin%27s|Pediatric HD]] typically occurs 4-14 years old; marked male predominance 4:1
*90% have disease in contiguous nodes (assuming para-aortics are contiguous to SCV via thoracic duct)
*Visceral involvement may be local extension or hematogenous; rare to GI lymphatics (Waldayer's ring or Peyer's patch)

==Work-Up==
*History: look for B symptoms. Also fatigue, alcohol-induced pain, pruritus.
*PE: Palpable nodes, palpable viscera
*Labs: CBC, blood chemistry, albumin, ESR
*Radiology: CXR, CT, PET
*Biopsy: LN excision; bone marrow Bx if B-symptoms, subdiaphragmatic disease or Stage III-IV disease
*Staging laparotomy no longer used

==Classification==
*Rye classification (1966)
**By Lukes and Butler. Presented at a conference in Rye, New York.
**Found that different subtypes have different prognoses:
***Lymphocyte predominant (most favorable)
***Nodular sclerosis (favorable)
***Mixed cellularity (guarded)
***Lymphocyte depleted (least favorable)
*World Health Organization (WHO) classification
**'''Classic Hodgkin lymphoma:'''  CD 15+, CD 30+
**'''Nodular lymphocyte predominant'''  CD 15-, CD 30-, CD 20+

==Pathology==
*Classic HL
**Presence of classic Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells
***Do not exhibit phenotypes typical of any normal cell
***CD15+; marker is expressed on granulocytes
***Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, with VDJ rearrangement. This is typically seen only in germinal B cells and post-germinal B cells
***Study of patients with both HL and NHL shows they are clonally related, suggesting that initial transformation occurred in a germinal B cell. Subsequently, there are two distinct sets of molecular lesions, which lead to divergent phenotypes of HL and NHL
***HRS cells appear to lose their germinal B cell characteristics, and become unable to transcribe RNA for immunoglobulin due to impaired activation of Ig promoters
***There is also activation of NF-kB pathway, which leads to c-REL increase and promotion of lymphocyte transformation and prevention of apoptotic deletion
***There is a widespread genomic instability, which contributes to the strange nuclear appearance
*Nodular lymphocyte predominant HL
**Prevalent tumor cell is &quot;lymphocytic and histiocytic&quot; (L&amp;H) subtype of HRS cells
***Pathologically looks like popped corn
***Express B-cell markers
***Have multiple features that resemble normal germinal B-cells
**Classic HRS rare or absent; appears with multiple nuclear lobes and large nucleoli

'''''Other definitions of bulky disease:'''''
Many studies use 5cm or 6cm. (e.g., SWOG)

==Chemotherapy regimens==
*ABVD - Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine 
*COPP - Cyclophosphamide, vincristine (Oncovin), procarbazine, and prednisone
*EBVP - Epirubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and prednisone. Used in EORTC H7.
*MOPP - Mechlorethamine, vincristine (Oncovin), procarbazine, prednisone
*Stanford V (1989-) - essentially MOP/ABV + etoposide - uses mechlorethamine, doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, and prednisone (uses decreased doxo, bleo, and mustard cumulative doses and is a shorter course over 12 wks. Originally used RT). PMID 7537796.

Standard of care is ABVD, which is superior or equivalent to MOPP, MOPP/ABVD, or MOPP-ABV

*PMID 2408897 - ABVD vs MOPP. Complete recovery of sperm count in all male pts with ABVD.

==Radiation fields==
*'''Mantle field''' - suggestions per Fletcher's textbook, 3rd edition.
**Place isocenter midway between superior and inferior edges. Usually is near or slightly below the suprasternal notch.
**Borders: ''Superior'' - Midpoint of chin, along mandible, 2-3 cm above tip of mastoid. ''Inferior'' - near diaphragm, ~4 cm above xiphoid. ''Inferior axillary'' - 4th costochondral junction. Include ~1 cm of lung in lower axilla and 2-4 cm of lung in upper axilla. ''Lateral axillary'' - junction of lateral margin of pectoralis with deltoid. Exclude humeral heads.  ''Mediastinum / hilum'' - 
**Shield: ''larynx'' - thyroid notch to cricoid. 
**Superior border of the PA field can be lowered to avoid irradiation of the oral cavity and cerebellum. Place border at thyroid notch. 

*'''Modified mantle / mini-mantle''' - includes mediastinum, bilateral hila, supraclavicular. Excluded axilla and neck/occipital unless bulky disease present. From larynx to T10-12
** used in Stanford V protocol - PMID 7537796

*'''Waldeyer's ring''' (typically for NHL) - Lateral fields matched to lower neck field.
**Borders: ''Inferior'' - thyroid notch. ''Superior'' - 1 cm above zygomatic arch. ''Posterior'' - tragus, then posterior to sternocleidomastoid muscle. ''Anterior'' - orbital rim posteroinferiorly to 2nd molar and then forward along the mandible.
**Lower neck field: ''Superior'' - matches inferior border of lateral fields. Midline larynx shielding from thyroid notch to 1-2 cm below cricoid. Laterally to junction of trapezius with clavicles. Inferiorly 1-2 cm below clavicles.

*'''Para-aortic''' - top of T11 to bottom of L4

*'''Inverted Y''' - includes para-aortic + iliac + inguinal

*'''Total nodal irradiation (TNI)''' - Mantle followed by Inverted Y and spleen (usually after a break of 2-3 weeks between mantle and inverted Y).

*'''Sub-total nodal irradiation (STNI)''' - Mantle plus para-aortic + spleen. Excludes iliac + inguinal. Often used in females because of concern for fertility.

*'''Involved field:'''
**Involved field recommendations:
***Mediastinal disease - treat mediastinum + SCLV
***SCLV disease - treat ipsilateral neck

      <text xml:space="preserve">is this really GUI programming?
or is this something to show others what you have programmed?


It is not a GUI at all, it is a CLI, and a very feeble game.

What relevance does this have to perl GUIs?
Take a look at Section 6 - this is just a cut 'n' paste!

I think this should be a candidate for deletion - Repeats from Chap. 6, has no relevance to the topic. Any objections?
My bad - this should probably just be listed on modules needing heavy editing...

I'm going to edit this myself, make it a stub...
There. Slightly better - I intend to come back after I've learned a little more about the subject.

DakeDesu:

Well, it appears you have nice links to the CPAN pages... however, may I suggest a mirror of the associate perldoc entries for these?

Also, it appears I've found this page before whatever it is a redunancy of. Maybe post a link to the other page?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

my name is Michael. I'm interested in Wikiversity because I have the similar idea for a long time: a central repository on the Web where one can learn whatever subject s/he chooses. The nowday online courses are nothing but a one big mess and what I want is:
* today I decided to learn Japanese: I go to Wikiversity and I'm sure I'll find a well structured and professional Japanese course there;
* tomorrow I'll decide to learn Java programming language: I go to Wikiversity and I'm sure I'll find this course '''structured in the same''' familiar way;
* in a year I'll want to learn Calculus... you've got the idea.

Here is the presentation of my idea about the structured information storage using Wiki technology - code named [[User:Catpad/Odzilla|Odzilla]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Odzilla''' - is a name of the '''collaboratively created structured information storage'''.

'''Please note:''' the following description of the Odzilla project is not immediately applicable to  Wikiversity because it was developed as an independent project.
Then, as I found the Wikiversity project, I decided that my information structure ideas can be useful (in some way) to this project.



==The building blocks of Odzilla==

The main feature of Odzilla content-management system is that it is '''component-based'''. This term is borrowed from the software and defines a system that can be constructed from  independent blocks – pieces of software with autonomous behaviour. Equally, we define the most important concept of Odzilla – '''Piece of Knowledge (POK)''' as an independent piece of information (of whatever nature) that can be used as a building block to create larger POKs.

There are two main features of POK:
* It can be nested.
* It is evolving with time and keeps track of all the changes made to it.
(more about the features of POK in a moment)

&lt;pre&gt;
POK can be text, picture, footnote, diagram, dictionary entry, exam question etc. 
as well as it can be a lesson or a whole course.
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Why HTML documents are bad ?'''

Documents are scattered throughout the Web, they are constantly changing, moving and get lost. They are unreliable, unsorted, uncategorized and do not belong to anybody. The documents cannot keep the history of their own changes, they cannot be commented and, once translated, they cannot keep the various translations together. 
Thus, the notion of the Document – the central concept of the Information Age – is bad.

'''Why Information Components – Pieces of Knowledge (POK) are good ?'''

''Piece of Knowledge'' is a multilayered, multidimensional, self-contained document.
POK keeps its own history with it forever. It keeps all the translations that have been made to it, all the remarks, notes and comments made by its readers. It contains the copyright information and the categorization information within global classification directory. However, since the Web is a decentralized place and no central control and the unified directory is possible (and ever will be possible), the classification of the POK is just a system of facets and titles within facets that give hints of where in the global possible directory the POK can be found. These hints (facets and titles) are constantly connecting to form the semantic maps – the network of the categories – that can help to find for every POK its unique place within the Directory. This network itself is the Directory.

'''Here are the basic features of a POK:'''

* A POK grows both in space and in time and keeps track of its history forever (just like a Wiki page).
* A POK is multilayered; each layer represents an adjustment of its contents to another audience (I call it ''flavors''; it will be explained later).
* A POK is a nested structure: it can consist of other POKs and, in turn, can be a part of some other, larger, POK.
* A textual POK is representation-independent. It is marked up to give the rendering system the commands (or hints) of how to represent the text.


Now, more about POKs.

POK can be anything from the following list and more:

1. Program (consisting of courses)

2. Course (consisting of lessons and exams)

3. Lesson (consisting of everything that follows)

4. Text (paragraph, chapter, etc.)

5. Article

6. Picture

7. Diagram, chart

8. Side note, side bar

9. Footnote

10. Example (code example, text example, etc.)

11. Quotation

12. Table

13. Dictionary entry

14. Reference

15. Timeline

16. Multimedia (sound clip, video clip)

17. Interactivity (Java applet, Flash, etc.)

18. Exam or test question

19. Template


''Template'' is a special category. It is a POK that can be used to create other POKs. Thus, for example, there can be a ''Course Template'' with lessons, tests and exams but without real content in any of them. 

The following figure shows the buidling blocks of a POK.


[[Image:POKStructure.gif|The structure of the POK]]


There are several things here:

1. '''History''': this is the different versions of the POK that allow to compare and see the changes made to it. This is what keeps POK from getting messed up or accidentally deleted.

2. '''Categorization''': the line to Categorization is bold since it is the must-have for any POK. Categorization determines the coordinates of the POK in the semantic field. The categorization system is yet to be developed, but apparently it should be the '''faceted classification''' mentioned above: for exmaple, facet ''type'' or ''category'' with the title (or header) ''mathematics'', facet ''subtype'' with the title ''calculus'', facet ''complexity'' with the title ''higher mathematics'', facet ''time frame'' with the title ''XVIII century'', etc.

3. '''Translations''': if a POK is a textual one, it can exist in several languages, so a student can easily switch between either language.

4. '''Discussion''': every POK can become a subject for a discussion. Any student or teacher can start a discussion by saying, for example: “I think this is wrong. I have different information”. Anybody else can reply to this comment, say, by presenting a proof against it. The discussion can be short or long but, anyway, it becomes a part of this POK’s lifecycle.

5. '''Annotations''': this is close to discussion but slightly different. Usually, discussion has to say something about the whole topic and expects an answer. On the contrary, annotation can refer to a single word or phrase and exist as a note or memo made by somebody who doesn’t really expect any answer on it.

6. '''Flavors''': they can be useful together with POKs that are templates. For example, I can prepare a POK – template for the generic programming language course, say, OOP language. Then this POK can be changed to teach the concrete language: C++ flavor (using appropriate examples), Java flavor, Smalltalk flavor, etc. The same mechanism can be probably used for the similar natural language courses (e.g. Slavic languages or Roman languages). Another useful feature of flavors is to vary the same POK for different audiences. We will see this usage later.

7. '''References''': there references to and from the POK. References to are other POKs that use or point the current POK (e.g. a lesson that use this test question (current POK) as a component). References from can include hyperlinks to external sites, books in online shops, dictionary entries, other POKs, etc.

8. '''Presentations''': they are not exactly the part of a POK (that’s why the dashed line is used). The text POK can exist in many different visual forms (e.g., using various CSSs). These CSSs can be stored as a part of the POK.

Obviously, not every POK can have all mentioned components. Picture POK, for example, cannot have translations, flavors and presentations but can have discussion, annotations, history and references.


==Knowledge Pool==

'''Knowledge Pool''' is the main repository of POKs (Pieces of Knowledge) where creators of courses (Teachers) can draw their components from. Anyone can create a POK (using the Wiki technology) whether it is a small text that can be used as a part of a lesson or an article, exam question, picture, dictionary entry or a lesson. The POK is strongly categorized (using faceted classification), placed in the Knowledge Pool and begins its own life. POK creators (and other users) can always review their POKs, rewrite and recreate them. 
Knowledge Pool should be searchable using categorization of POKs.

==Examples==

To see how POKs are hierarchically organized within Odzilla let's look at an example.

&lt;pre&gt;
COURSE: America in Depression and War

	LESSON 1: Introduction: From Breadlines to Atom Bombs
COURSE PART 1: The Great Depression
	LESSON 2: The End of Prosperity
	LESSON 3: The Unemployed
COURSE PART 2: New Deal
	LESSON 4: Roosevelt’s 100 Days
	LESSON 5: Strikes and Struggles
	LESSON 6: New Deal Order
	LESSON 7: Paper One Due
COURSE PART 3: World War II at Home
	LESSON 8: From Isolationism to Pearl Harbor
	LESSON 9: Mobilizing for Victory
	LESSON 10: Gender and Race in Wartime
COURSE PART 4: World War II Abroad
	LESSON 11: D-Day
	LESSON 12: Paper Two Due
	LESSON 13: Hiroshima
	LESSON 14: Conclusion: Legacies for Postwar America
Final EXAM
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here the categories of POKs are all in capital letters (LESSON, COURSE, COURSE PART, EXAM). To have a better idea about the hierarchy, look at the following figure:


[[Image:LessonIntoPOKs.gif|The Lesson broken down into POKs]]


The more the number of POKs in the '''Odzilla Knowledge Pool''' (i.e. in the set of all POKs) and the finer they are tuned, the easier it is for other users to find them and to use them in their own courses or texts. For example, the image POK on the next figure can be used in various courses related to the history of America, the general history, photography courses, etc.

==Constructing a larger POK (a course) from smaller POKs==

Having a searchable Knowledge Pool at hand one can easily construct a course by using the existing material  - POKs - and writing new ones. Let's take as an example a schematic lesson on programming language LISP as in the figure:


[[Image:LISPCourse.gif|The schematic course on LISP programming language]]


This lesson can be constructed from several building blocks (POKs):
* TEXT POK with the introductory text;
* TEXT POK with the history text;
* CODE EXAMPLE POK with an example of the function written in Lisp;
* FOOTNOTE POK with an external link in it;
* SIDENOTE POK with the short biography;  
This breakdown is shown in the following figure. Note that the lesson itself is also a POK of type LESSON.


[[Image:LISPCourseIntoPOKs.gif|The Image POK]]


Now, it's clear that these POKs can also be used in other courses and lessons. For instance, the CODE EXAMPLE POK can be used in a course about functional programming, or in a lesson about recursion in various programming languages, or in a general computer science course for beginners.

 
Let's take the first TEXT POK of this example to understand the nature of '''flavors'''.
In the next figure there are two variants (''flavors'') of the same text. The first one is an introductory text for the very beginners, the second one is an equally introductory text but for the more advanced auditory. Thus, in the second case, the Lisp is called a family of languages (i.e. dialects) of the original version – the fact that can be of no interest for the novice students. It uses such terms as abstract notation for recursive functions – the words that should not be used for the courses where the notion of recursive function is not studied yet.
Note, that these two flavors are still '''the same POK'''. The flavor feature allows the fine tuning of the existing POK for different kinds of audience.

Besides, it can be very useful and even entertaining to be able to see various flavors of the same POK while learning your subject of interest.


==Roles and responsibilities==

The following roles can be distributed between the participants of the Odzilla project:

* '''Teachers''': the people who create courses and lessons. They are not necessarily following the breakdown rules, that is they can leave their texts as they are, without dividing them into POKs. The Teachers are the experts in their subjects.
* '''POK creators''': these people are the experts who don’t want to prepare complete courses or even lessons, but just want to contribute to the Knowledge Pool by adding useful pieces of information. Another type of POK creators are the experts who add various flavors for the existing POKs in such a way that these POKs will become useful in other courses.
* '''POK managers''': these people are not necessarily experts in the various subjects. They are looking for POKs that can be divided into smaller pieces and can be used in other courses in this smaller form. They are responsible for categorization of these newely created POKs. 
* '''Template makers''': the people who make generic templates (skeletons) of courses, programs and lessons without going into the material. They can also prepare the templates for the specific subject without filling in the materials (course outlines like in an example in Figure 3). These people should understand the methodology and the patterns of education; in the second case they should be the experts as well.
* '''Presentation designers''': they are working on various (pleasant, convenient, user friendly) presentations of the material: layouts of the lessons, colors, fonts, text alignments, etc.
* '''Editors''': These are the super-experts in various fields who can monitor the POKs being created, edit the information in them or delete useless POKs at all.
* '''Translators''': translate text POKs into different languages.
* '''Students''': they are playing an equally important role in Odzilla as Teachers are. Students create the second part of Odzilla – commentaries, notes, personal diaries, annotations, homeworks; they participate in discussions and communicate with one another and with their teachers.

==The (possible) process of creating the Wikiversity==

So, how one can start to create such a mega-structure as Wikiversity without just putting together lots of old-fashioned scanned dull textbooks ?
The answer is: by creating the larger, more complex structures such as courses, lessons and exercises from smaller parts: concepts, sidebars, footnotes, images, examples, etc. - the POKs.
The creation of a concept is relatively simple - it's just like creating an article in Wikipedia. This is an exellent example (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Forms:Circle) of a basic concept (&quot;Circle&quot;) made of many various ''flavors''. Imagine, that we have tons of concepts defined like this in such a way that we can turn off and on some of their flavors. We can combine them into lessons putting an appropriate stress on those flavors that serve our purposes best. For example, having a mathematical lesson for young children we can leave such characteristics of &quot;Circle&quot; as ''Mathematical definition'' and ''Similar Forms''. Writing an article about the history of mathematics we can use ''History'' and ''Qualitative description'', for example. Then, we turn on the same flavors for all the concepts we use in the lesson and now that's easy - we can construct many interdisciplinary texts from the same basic set of concepts.
These lessons can in turn be combined into courses, books, etc.

So, the Wikiversity can use the bottom-up approach: create the basic concepts bearing many flavors (characteristics) and combine them into larger structures using those flavors that are mostly appropriate for the current purpose.

==The conclusion==

The difference between the semantic net (web) and Odzilla is that Odzilla is supposed to be '''self-organized organism''' – a living swamp, where individual genes (POKs) evolve, interconnet and gather into hierarchical structures.
We are witnessing that the Wikipedia project is working. It is self-organizing, self-adjusting and growing very fast. That proves the idea.

Odzilla adds to the idea of Wikipedia three new elements: 
* component-based organization of knowledge with evolving components (which should lead to the creation of the semantic net);
* hierarchical organization of information (which allows to make it the University and not just the Encyclopedia);
* extensive review, commentary, discussion and annotation possibilities by the recipients of information (students) who can share their thoughts and opinions, so, that their teachers can refine the information and their fellow students can rely on the experience of their predecessors. 

HTML documents proved ineffective in terms of search, versioning, classification, annotation and copyright. The time has come for the component-based, structured information storage.

==About the name – &quot;Odzilla&quot;==

''Odzihozo'' in the native American Abenaki mythology is '''&quot;The Man Who Made Himself&quot;'''. The story goes like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Before he had legs, Odzihozo dragged himself around, gouging valleys in the land's surface 
and piling up dirt with his hands to build mountains. Finally, he made Lake Champlain and,
satisfied with his work decided to stay there forever.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Anyway, the name ''Odzilla'' (after Odzihozo) has two meanings:
* '''The Man Who Can Make Himself''' – the one who can teach yourself everything he wants and wait until he’ll be smart enough to have his legs growing;
* '''The Compendium of Knowledge That Makes Itself''' – the collaborative, &quot;intercreative&quot; (the term coined by Tim Berners-Lee) project that is constantly evolves and expands – &quot;creating valleys, river beds and mountains&quot; along the way.

It is also impossible to escape the resemblance between the sound of the name &quot;Odzilla&quot; and ''Godzilla''. Well, as encyclopedia has it, Godzilla (or Gojira, ゴジラ in Japanese) is a ''daikaiju'' (strange beast or giant monster) in a series of films made in Japan in 1954.
Okay, Odzilla is intended to be a ''daikaiju'' after all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just as a question, does anyone think that this is completely relevant to the actual building process?  I have nothing against overclocking, but I wonder whether it's suited to the target audience... --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 07:08, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, because it's something you do with your new computer. And a lot of over clockers are doing so with computers they built. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 07:36, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::It's not a very good thing to do with your new computer. The speed increase could be had by waiting a few months instead. That's all you get, just a few months worth of advantage. Overclocking an obsolete computer makes more sense, because it's already out of warranty and you'd be buying a new system anyway if the old one won't go faster. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:43, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

::Overclocking has little to do with building a new computer. Cooling is related, but that should '''not''' go here because all computers need some form of cooling. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:43, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I take it that you don't spend much time around computer hardware forums, where they like to overclock anything they can get their hands on. It's relevent because I belive that most overclocking takes place on self built computers. OEM computers usually can't be overclocked. And many computer enthusests (people who build comps) also overclock. Besides, OCing a Radeon X850XT PE (new hardware) is the only way to get the fastest video card available. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 06:35, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

I agree with [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]]. Building a computer always involves cooling, but overclocking is optional. If there is no objection, I'm going to move stuff about making computers quieter (is there a name for that ?), making a CPU go faster (overclocking), RAID, putting pretty lights on the case, etc. into an appendix, to emphasize that they are optional. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 17:14, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

== No heat increase with speed increase? ==

A voltage increase will definitely cause more heat, but with current CMOS technology speed will also affect heat output. Think about it for a moment: during HLT (i.e. in idle CPU cycles) the CPU is effectively stopped, but running at a voltage. But, the idler the CPU, the cooler it is. This is because CMOS technology only consumes significant amounts of power during switching. With CPUs some is added to this due to leakage and tunneling, but an important part of the power consumed is still due to switching. Thus, AFAIK a speed increase can and will increase heat output, although less noticeably than a voltage increase. [[User:Marcan|Marcan]] 02:12, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:Interesting. Some people (including myself, who knows a little about AC circuits) thought it would either reduce the heat output or keep it the same). In theory, increasing the frequency prevents the circuit Vmax reaching its peak and sink values, which would seem to reduce power consumption and heat output. However, this measure does not include the current, and switching would increase it assuming that the idle state is 'off'. Is this right?

Websites are typically quite ambigious on this subject. In particular, it is hardly ever made clear if overclocking or the temperature itself causes malfunctions. I think this one should make it clear.--[[User:ChrisJMoor|ChrisJMoor]] 02:09, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:CPUs are CMOS circuits, usually, iirc.  I was under the impression that higher frequency = higher current in this case, and since i*v=p, more power. --[[User:Anaraug|Anaraug]] 09:59, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

I agree with ChrisJMoor -- this book should make things clear.
The [[w:CMOS#Power:_switching_and_leakage]] article mentions that the biggest source of power consumption in digital CMOS devices is
: ''&quot;... the characteristic switching power dissipated by a CMOS device: &lt;math&gt; P = C V^2 f &lt;/math&gt;.&quot;''

Can we explain this in a way that is not too complicated? But also not oversimplified?

My understanding is that *both* overclocking *and* too-high temperature cause different sorts of malfunctions.
Here are 2 kinds (are there others I am forgetting?)
* overclocking error: the combinatorial logic from one latch to the next latch takes a certain amount of time to settle. If the destination latch is clocked too soon after the source latch was clocked, there is not enough time for the logic to settle, and the &quot;wrong&quot; values get fed into the destination latch. That's the whole point of long pipelines -- they split up the logic into many thin layers, and insert latches between each layer, improving the worst-case settling-time (through the thickest layer). Clocking a device faster than this worst-case settling time causes occasional &quot;wrong&quot; values to be latched.
* temperature damage: In a CMOS device, electrical energy is converted to thermal energy almost entirely in the transistors. If the transistors get too hot, the carefully placed patterns of diffusion can blur and melt, permanently damaging the chip. If they blur into a short-circuit, then the chip rapidly self-destructs.

My understanding is that older microcoded processors showed obvious settling-time errors at clock rates well below the temperature-damage clock rate, even without heat sinks.
But now that most chip designers have figured out better ways to avoid such settling-time errors (pipelines, transistor sizing, buffering long lines, low-skew clock-tree networks, etc.), well-designed chips simply don't have settling-time errors at clock rates from DC all the way up to the clock rate that causes thermal self-destruction.

== Things that can't be overclocked ==

&quot;(But you wouldn't be reading this guide if you're using an OEM computer, would you?)&quot;
I think this is a completely unnecessary thing to say, and looks like a bad attempt at humor.  It should be removed.</text>

==A==
*&lt;b&gt;Absolute Advantage&lt;/b&gt; - the advantage conferred on an individual in an activity if he or she can do it better than other people.
*&lt;b&gt;Absolute Value&lt;/b&gt; - the value of a number without regard to a plus or minus sign.
*&lt;b&gt;Accelerator Principle&lt;/b&gt; - the proposition that a higher rate of growth in &lt;i&gt;real GDP&lt;/i&gt; results in a higher level of &lt;i&gt;investment spending&lt;/i&gt;, and a lower growth rate in real GDP leads to lower planned investment spending.
*&lt;b&gt;Actual Investment Spending&lt;/b&gt; - the sum of &lt;i&gt;planned investment spending&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;unplanned investment spending&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;AD-AS model&lt;/b&gt; - the basic model used to understand fluctuation in &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt;. It uses the &lt;i&gt;aggregate supply curve&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;aggregate demand curve&lt;/i&gt; together to analyze the behavior of the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; in response to shocks of government policy.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Consumption Function&lt;/b&gt; - the relationship for the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; as a whole between aggregate current &lt;i&gt;disposable income&lt;/i&gt; and aggregate &lt;i&gt;consumer spending&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Demand Curve&lt;/b&gt; - a graphical representation that shows the relationship between the &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt; and the quantity of &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; demanded by &lt;i&gt;households, firms,&lt;/i&gt; the government and the rest of the world. The aggregate demand curve has a negative slope due to the &lt;i&gt;wealth effect of a change in the aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;interest rate effect of a change in the aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Output&lt;/b&gt; - the total quantity of &lt;i&gt;final goods and services&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; produces for a given time period, usually a year. &lt;i&gt;Real GDP&lt;/i&gt; is the numerical measure of aggregate output typically used by economists.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Price Level&lt;/b&gt; - a single number that represents the overall price level for &lt;i&gt;final goods and services&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Production Function&lt;/b&gt; - a hypothetical function that shows how productivity (&lt;i&gt;real GDP&lt;/i&gt; per worker) depends on the quantities of &lt;i&gt;physical capital&lt;/i&gt; per worker and &lt;i&gt;human capital&lt;/i&gt; per worker as well as the state of technology.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Spending&lt;/b&gt; - the total flow of funds into markets for domestically produced &lt;i&gt;final goods and services&lt;/i&gt;; the sum of &lt;i&gt;consumer spending, investment spending, government purchases of goods and services&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;exports&lt;/i&gt; minus &lt;i&gt;imports&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Aggregate Supply Curve&lt;/b&gt; - a graphical representation that shows the relationship between the &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt; and the total quantity of &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; supplied.
*&lt;b&gt;Appreciation&lt;/b&gt; - a rise in the value of one currency in terms of other currencies.
*&lt;b&gt;Autarky&lt;/b&gt; - a situation in which a country does not trade with other countries.
*&lt;b&gt;Automatic Stabilizers&lt;/b&gt; - government spending and taxation rules that cause &lt;i&gt;fiscal policy&lt;/i&gt; to be automatically expansionary when the &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; contracts and automatically contractionary when the economy expands without requiring any deliberate actions by policy makers. Taxes that depend on &lt;i&gt;disposable income&lt;/i&gt; are the most important example of automatic stabilizers.
*&lt;b&gt;Autonomous Change in Aggregate Spending&lt;/b&gt; - an initial rise or fall in &lt;i&gt;aggregate spending&lt;/i&gt; at a given level of &lt;i&gt;real GDP&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Average Rate of Tax (ART)&lt;/b&gt; - an individual or company’s taxes divided by its taxable income.

==B==
*&lt;b&gt;Balance of Payments Accounts&lt;/b&gt; - a summary of a country's transactions with other countries, including two main elements: the &lt;i&gt;balance of payments on current account&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;balance of payments on financial account&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Balance of Payments on Current Account&lt;/b&gt; - transactions that don't create liabilities; a country's &lt;i&gt;balance of payments on goods and services&lt;/i&gt; plus net international transfer payments and factor income.
*&lt;b&gt;Balance of Payments on Financial Account&lt;/b&gt; - international transactions that involve the sale or purchase of assets, and therefore create future liabilities.
*&lt;b&gt;Balance of Payments on Goods and Services&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between the value of &lt;i&gt;exports&lt;/i&gt; and the value of &lt;i&gt;imports&lt;/i&gt; during a given period.
*&lt;b&gt;Balance Sheet Effects&lt;/b&gt; - the reduction in a firm's net worth from falling asset prices.
*&lt;b&gt;Bank&lt;/b&gt; - a &lt;i&gt;financial intermediary&lt;/i&gt; that provides &lt;i&gt;liquid&lt;/i&gt; assets in the form of &lt;i&gt;bank deposits&lt;/i&gt; to lenders and uses those funds to finance the &lt;i&gt;illiquid&lt;/i&gt; investments or &lt;i&gt;investment spending&lt;/i&gt; needs of borrowers.
*&lt;b&gt;Bank Deposit&lt;/b&gt; - a claim on a &lt;i&gt;bank&lt;/i&gt; that obliges the bank to give the depositor his or her cash when demanded.
*&lt;b&gt;Bank Reserves&lt;/b&gt; - currency held by &lt;i&gt;banks&lt;/i&gt; in their vaults plus their deposits at the Federal Reserve.
*&lt;b&gt;Bank Run&lt;/b&gt; - a phenomenon in which many of a &lt;i&gt;bank's&lt;/b&gt; depositors try to withdraw their funds due to fears of a bank failure.
*&lt;b&gt;Bar Graph&lt;/b&gt; - a graph that uses bars of varying height of length to show the comparative sizes of different observations of a &lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Barter&lt;/b&gt; - a transaction in which people directly exchange goods or services that they have for goods and services that they want.
*&lt;b&gt;Black Market&lt;/b&gt; - a market in which goods or services are bought and sold illegally, either because it is illegal to sell them at all or because the prices charged are legally prohibited by a &lt;i&gt;price ceiling&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Bond&lt;/b&gt; - a legal document based on borrowing in the form of an IOU that pays interest.
*&lt;b&gt;Budget Balance&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between tax revenue and government spending. A positive budget balance is referred to as a &lt;i&gt;budget surplus&lt;/i&gt;; a negative budget is referred to as a &lt;i&gt;budget deficit&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Budget Deficit&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between tax revenue and government spending when government spending exceeds tax revenue; dissaving by the government in the form of a budget deficit is a negative contribution to &lt;i&gt;national savings&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Budget Surplus&lt;/b&gt; - the difference between tax revenue and government spending when tax revenue exceeds government spending; saving by the government in the form of a budget surplus is a positive contribution to &lt;i&gt;national savings&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Business Cycle&lt;/b&gt; - the short-run alternative between economic downturns, known as &lt;i&gt;recessions&lt;/i&gt;, and economic upturns, known as &lt;i&gt;expansions&lt;/i&gt;.

==C==
*&lt;b&gt;Capital Inflow&lt;/b&gt; - the net inflow of funds into a country; the difference between the total inflow of foreign funds to the home country and the total outflow of domestic funds to other countries. A positive net captial inflow represents funds borrowed from foreigners to finance domestic investment; a negative net capital inflow represents funds lent to foreigners to finance foreign investment.
*&lt;b&gt;Causal Relationship&lt;/b&gt; - the relationship between two &lt;i&gt;variables&lt;/i&gt; in which the value taken by one variable directly influences or determines the value taken by the other variable.
*&lt;b&gt;Central Bank&lt;/b&gt; - an institution that oversees and regualtes the banking system and controls the &lt;i&gt;monetary base&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Circular-Flow Diagram&lt;/b&gt; - a diagram that represents the transactions in an &lt;i&gt;economy&lt;/i&gt; by two kinds of flows around a circle: flows of physical things such as goods or labor in one direction and flows of money to pay for these physical things in the opposite direction.
*&lt;b&gt;Classical Model of the Price Level&lt;/b&gt; - a simplified financial model of the price level in which the real quantity of money, &lt;i&gt;M/P&lt;/i&gt;, is always at its long-run &lt;i&gt;equilibrium&lt;/i&gt; level. This model ignores the distinction between the short run and the long run but is useful for analyzing the case of high &lt;i&gt;inflation&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Commercial Bank&lt;/b&gt; - a &lt;i&gt;bank&lt;/i&gt; that acccepts deposits and is covered by &lt;i&gt;deposit insurance&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Commodity Money&lt;/b&gt; - a &lt;i&gt;medium of exchange&lt;/i&gt; that is a good, normally gold or silver, that has intrinsic value in other uses.
*&lt;b&gt;Commodity-Backed Money&lt;/b&gt; - a &lt;i&gt;medium of exchange&lt;/i&gt; that has no intrinsic value whose ultimate value is guaranteed by a promise that it can be converted into valuable goods on demand.
*&lt;b&gt;Comparative Advantage&lt;/b&gt; - the advantage conferred on an individual or nation in producing a good or service if the &lt;i&gt;opportunity cost&lt;/i&gt; of producing the good or service is lower for that individual or nation than other producers.
*&lt;b&gt;Competitive Market&lt;/b&gt; - a market in which there are many buyers and sellers of the same good or service, none of whom can influence the price at which the good or service is sold.
*&lt;b&gt;Complements&lt;/b&gt; - pairs of goods for which a rise in the price on one good leads to a decrease in the demand for the other good.
*&lt;b&gt;Consumer Price Index (CPI)&lt;/b&gt; - a measure of prices; calculated by surveying market prices for a &lt;i&gt;market basket&lt;/i&gt; intended to represent the consumption of a typical urban American family of four.

*&lt;b&gt;Contractionary Monetary Policy&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;i&gt;monetary policy&lt;/i&gt; that, through the raising of the &lt;i&gt;interest rate&lt;/i&gt;, reduces aggregate demand and therefore output.
*&lt;b&gt;Convergence Hypothesis&lt;/b&gt; - a principle of economic growth that holds that international differences in &lt;i&gt;real GDP&lt;/i&gt; per capita tend to narrow over time because countries that start with lower real GDP per capita tend to have highet growth rates.
*&lt;b&gt;Cost&lt;/b&gt; - (of potential seller) the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a good.
*&lt;b&gt;Crowding Out&lt;/b&gt; - the negative effect of &lt;i&gt;budget deficits&lt;/i&gt; on private investment, which occurs because government borrowing drives up &lt;i&gt;interest rates&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Efficient Market Hypothesis&lt;/b&gt; - a principle of asset price determination that holds that asset prices emobdy all publicly available information. The hypothesis implies that &lt;i&gt;stock&lt;/i&gt; prices should be unpredictable, or follow a &lt;i&gt;random walk&lt;/i&gt;, since changes should occur only in response to new information about fundamentals.

*&lt;b&gt;Exports&lt;/b&gt; - goods and services sold to other countries.

==F==
*&lt;b&gt;Factor Intensity&lt;/b&gt; - the difference in the ratio of factors used to produce a good in various industries. For example, oil refining is capital-intensive compared to clothing manufacture because oil refiners use a higher ratio of capital to labor than do clothing producers.

A rise (fall) in the aggregate price level decreases (increases) the purchasing power of consumers' money holdings. In response, consumers try to increase (decrease) their money holdings, which drives up (down) interest rates, thereby decreasing (increasing) consumption and investment.
*&lt;b&gt;Intermediate Goods and Services&lt;/b&gt; - goods and services, bough from one &lt;i&gt;firm&lt;/i&gt; by another firm, that are inputs for production of &lt;i&gt;final goods and services&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Investment Bank&lt;/b&gt; - a &lt;i&gt;bank&lt;/i&gt; that trades in &lt;i&gt;financial assets&lt;/i&gt; and is not covered by &lt;i&gt;deposit insurance&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Investment Spending&lt;/b&gt; - spending on productive &lt;i&gt;physical capital&lt;/i&gt;, such as machinery and construction of structures, and on changes to &lt;i&gt;inventories&lt;/i&gt;.

==L==
*&lt;b&gt;Labor Force&lt;/b&gt; - the sum of &lt;i&gt;employment&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;unemployment&lt;/i&gt;; that is, the number of people who are currently working plus the number of people who are currently looking for work.

*&lt;b&gt;Linear Relationship&lt;/b&gt; - the relationship between two &lt;i&gt;variables&lt;/i&gt; in which the &lt;i&gt;slope&lt;/i&gt; is constant and therefore is depicted on a graph by a &lt;i&gt;curve&lt;/i&gt; that is a straight line.
*&lt;b&gt;Liquid&lt;/b&gt; - describes an asset that can be quickly converted into cash without much loss of value.
*&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Preference Model of the Interest Rate&lt;/b&gt; - a model of the market for money in which the &lt;i&gt;interest rate&lt;/i&gt; is determined by the supply and demand for money.
*&lt;b&gt;Liquidity Trap&lt;/b&gt; a situation in which &lt;i&gt;monetary policy&lt;/i&gt; is ineffective because &lt;i&gt;nominal interest rates&lt;/i&gt; are up against the &lt;i&gt;zero bound&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Loan&lt;/b&gt; - a lending agreement between an individual lender and an individual borrower. Loans are usually tailored to the individual borrower's needs and ability to pay but carry relatively high &lt;i&gt;transactions costs&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Loan-Backed Securities&lt;/b&gt; - assets created by pooling individual &lt;i&gt;loans&lt;/i&gt; and selling shares in that pool.

*&lt;b&gt;Short-run Aggregate Supply Curve&lt;/b&gt; - a graphical representation that shows the positive relationship between the &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt; and the quantity of &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; supplied that exists in the short run, the time perioud when many production costs, particularly &lt;i&gt;nominal wages&lt;/i&gt;, can be taken as fixed. The short-run aggregate supply curve has a positive slope because a rise in the aggregate price levels leads to a rise in profits, and therefore output, when production costs are fixed.
*&lt;b&gt;Short-Run Equilibrium Aggregate Output&lt;/b&gt; - the quantity of &lt;i&gt;aggregate output&lt;/i&gt; produced in &lt;i&gt;short-run macroeconomic equilibrium&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Short-Term Interest Rate&lt;/b&gt; - the &lt;i&gt;interest rate&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;financial assets&lt;/i&gt; that mature within less than a year.
*&lt;b&gt;Slope&lt;/b&gt; - the ratio of the &quot;rise&quot; (the change between two points on the y-axis) to the &quot;run&quot; (the difference between the same two points on the x-axis); a measure of the steepness of a &lt;i&gt;curve&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Social Insurance&lt;/b&gt; - government programs - like Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance. and food stamps - intended to protect families against economic hardship.
*&lt;b&gt;Specialization&lt;/b&gt; - a situation in which different people each engage in the different task that he or she is good at performing.
*&lt;b&gt;Stabilization Policy&lt;/b&gt; - the use of government policy to reduce the severity of &lt;i&gt;recessions&lt;/i&gt; and to rein in excessively strong &lt;i&gt;expansions&lt;/i&gt;. There are two main tools of stabilization policy: &lt;i&gt;monetary policy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fiscal policy&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Stagflation&lt;/b&gt; - the combination of &lt;i&gt;inflation&lt;/i&gt; and falling &lt;i&gt;aggregate policy&lt;/i&gt;.

*&lt;b&gt;Stock&lt;/b&gt; - a share in the ownership of a company held by a shareholder.
*&lt;b&gt;Store of Value&lt;/b&gt; - an asset that is a means of holding purchasing power over time.
*&lt;b&gt;Structural Unemployment&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;i&gt;unemployment&lt;/i&gt; that results when there are more people seeking jobs in a labor market than there are jobs available at the current wage rate.
*&lt;b&gt;Subprime Lending&lt;/b&gt; - lending to home buyers who don't meet the usual criteria for borrowing.
*&lt;b&gt;Substitutes&lt;/b&gt; - pairs of goods for which a rise in the price of one of the goods leads to an increase in the demand for the other good.

*&lt;b&gt;Supply Schedule&lt;/b&gt; - the price of a given quantity at which producers will supply at different prices.
*&lt;b&gt;Supply Shock&lt;/b&gt; - an event that shifts the &lt;i&gt;short-run aggregate supply curve&lt;/i&gt;. A negative supply shock raises production costs and reduces the &lt;i&gt;quantity supplied&lt;/i&gt; at any &lt;i&gt;aggregate price level&lt;/i&gt;, shifting the curve leftward. A positive supply shock decreases production costs and increases the quantity supplied at any aggregate price level, shifting the curve rightward.
*&lt;b&gt;Surplus&lt;/b&gt; - the excess of a good or service that occurs when the &lt;i&gt;quantity supplied&lt;/i&gt; exceeds the &lt;i&gt;quantity demanded&lt;/i&gt;; surpluses occur when the price is above the &lt;i&gt;equilibrium price&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Sustainable&lt;/b&gt; - describes continued &lt;i&gt;long-run economic growth&lt;/i&gt; in the face of the limited supply of natural resources and the impact of growth on the environment.

*&lt;b&gt;Taylor Rule for Monetary Policy&lt;/b&gt; - a rule for setting the &lt;i&gt;federal funds rate&lt;/i&gt; that takes into account both the &lt;i&gt;inflation rate&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;output gap&lt;/i&gt;.
*&lt;b&gt;Technology&lt;/b&gt; - the technical means for the production of goods and services.
*&lt;b&gt;Theory of Liquidity Preference&lt;/b&gt; - Keynes theory to explain why the economy will not self correct or be sensitive to use monetary policy because of the three main reasons people hold money: Ordinary Actions, Precautionary measure, and Speculative purposes. In a recession, people will get less returns for their money so they hold onto it, and interest rates continue to drop and no one buys bonds. People demand money in liquid form.
*&lt;b&gt;Time-Series Graph&lt;/b&gt; - a two-&lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt; graph that has dates on the &lt;i&gt;horizontal axis&lt;/i&gt; and values of a variable that occurred on those dates on the &lt;i&gt;vertical axis&lt;/i&gt;.

'''Wensleydale''' is a white, crumbly-textured cows milk cheese, originally from Wensleydale in Yorkshire, England. Very pleasant as a dessert cheese, it has a fresh, slightly sweet taste.

Blue Wensleydale is a rarer variety; some ewes milk is added to encourage the development of blue veins.

== Elecromagnetic Four-Potential ==

This page will introduce the '''Four-Potential''', and the '''Four-Current''' notations, as well as the '''d'Alembertian''', which is used when studying these topics under the theoretical framework of [[Special relativity]]. These constructs, while a little confusing for some people, are fundamental to the way in which modern physicists study electric and magnetic fields, and therefore are worth learning. These topics may be introduced a little early here, although this chapter will not be rigorous. Instead, we will provide some common results here, and explain them thoughtout the next few chapters.

=== Potentials, As They Stand ===

Electric Potential (V), and Magnetic Vector Potential ('''A''') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {E} = -\nabla V &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf B = \nabla \times \mathbf A &lt;/math&gt;

Using Gauss's Law for Electricity:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} = \frac {\rho}{\epsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt;

and then substituting E with the Gradient of V. We see that:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \nabla V = -\frac {\rho}{\epsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 V = -\frac {\rho}{\epsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt;

And from Coulomb's Law we see that:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho}{\tau}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

Using a similar technique in Magnetostatics gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; and 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{\mathbf{J}}{\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

==Four Potentials and Four Currents==

We define a vector called the '''Four Potential''' as:

:&lt;math&gt;A^\mu = \left (\frac{V}{c}, \mathbf{A}\right) = (V, A_x, A_y, A_z)&lt;/math&gt;

And another called the Four Current, which instead of V has &amp;rho;, the charge density, and instead of '''A''', has '''J''' the current density:

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu = (c\rho, \mathbf{J}) = (\rho, J_x, J_y, J_z)&lt;/math&gt;

Where in each case c is the speed of light.

Both the Four-Potential and the Four-Current are vectors with four scalar values. What each of these values represents will be made clear at a later point.

== Bringing it Together ==

You may have noticed that the equations for '''A''' with '''J''' and V with &amp;rho; are pretty much the same, and that the Four Potential and Current contains only these. We can combine these into a single equation as such:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 A^\mu = -\mu_0 J^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

and:

:&lt;math&gt; A^\mu = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{J^\mu}{\tau}d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

== Relativity ==

The rules of relativity state that a current now cannot produce a magnetic field at a distance instantaneously. The effects of the current may travel at the speed of light at the fastest, and the field may not change any faster then that. If you've never looked at [[Special relativity]] before, this may be a good time to do so.

=== The d'Alembertian ===

We obviously need some term which compensates for the fact that nothing travels faster than light. So far our Laplacian operator looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} +  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

But now we need to bring it into '''Minkowski Space''' (A way of describing Relativistic Space). We can notice that the Laplacian cannot be applied to a four vector, and that the Laplacian is not invariant under Lorentz Transformations. To correct this we use the '''d'Alembertian'''. We define the d'Alembertian as such:

:&lt;math&gt; \Box = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} 
= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} +  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}- \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

The d'Alembertian reduces to the Laplacian (&amp;nabla;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) if we aren't worried about time dependence, or relativity. There are a number of different ways to denote the d'Alembertian, depending on what text you read. Here are a number of different methods that are used in common texts:

:&lt;math&gt; \Box = \Box^2 = \nabla_\mathbf{M} = \partial_i \partial^i = \partial^2 = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} &lt;/math&gt;

;Note:This wikibook will use the &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; notation for the d'Alembertian, for simplicity and ease of authoring.

We end up with our equation in terms of the d'Alembertian, as such:

:&lt;math&gt; \Box A^\mu = -\mu_0 J^\mu &lt;/math&gt;

We also have to bring in a time term into the integral form of the equation. It becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; A^\mu = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{J^\mu(r',t')}{|r - r'|} d^3 r'&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gender and ending==
Sanskrit nouns come in the three standard genders: masculine, neuter, and feminine.  A noun's declension class depends on its gender and ending.  Most nouns end in vowels, with some ending in consonants.  

===Feminine noun endings===
Feminine nouns may end in आ, इ, ई, उ, ऊ, or ऋ.
===Neuter noun endings===
Neuter nouns may end in अ, इ, उ, or ऋ.


==Number and Case==

In dictionaries, Sanskrit nouns are often listed in root-form (मूलरुप). Sanskrit nouns are highly inflected, and change form depending on the number (singular (ऐक वचन), dual (द्वि वचन), and plural (बहु वचन)) and the case (nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, or locative).

===Masculine noun endings===
Masculine nouns may end in अ, इ, उ, or ऋ.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Croatian alphabet==
Croatian is an easy language to spell and pronounce. Each letter is pronounced separately and clearly in any position and each word is spelt as it is pronounced.

The Croatian alphabet is a &quot;subset&quot; of the Latin alphabet and consists of 30 letters.

The following table lists all of the letters, together with pronunciations and &quot;as in...&quot; notes for easier pronunciation. 

Note: Because of their similarity in pronucation, most Croatian children don't learn to differ Č and Ć, Đ and DŽ or &quot;je&quot; and &quot;ije&quot; before fifth grade.

To oversimplify, remember six rules:

1. For the &quot;c&quot; without a hat, remember &quot;cats.&quot; In English we pronounce the cat's head (&quot;c&quot;) but in Croatian the tail is pronounced (&quot;ts&quot;).

2. A hat on a &quot;c,&quot; &quot;s,&quot; or &quot;z&quot; becomes an English &quot;ch,&quot; &quot;sh,&quot; or &quot;zh.&quot; Pronounce &quot;ć&quot; like &quot;č&quot; if you think no one expects Americans to speak foreign languages correctly.

3. DŽ is an English &quot;j,&quot; as in &quot;John.&quot; If you pronounce &quot;Đ&quot; and &quot;đ&quot; the same way, note rule #2.

4. For &quot;h&quot; pretend you're Scottish and saying &quot;loch&quot; or German saying &quot;Bach.&quot;

5. The &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; vowels are always long, never short.

6. The &quot;j&quot; is pronounced like &quot;y&quot; in English.

= PGCE Comments =
* Explain what is meant by `physical quantity'. -- clark: In the Introduction section, I replaced 'physical quantity' with 'measurement of a physical phenomenon'. Don't know if that's much clearer, really.
* Chapter is too full of tables and words  need figures to make it more interesting.
* Make researching history of SI units a small project.
* Multiply by one technique: not positive! Suggest using exponents instead (i.e. use the table of prefixes). This also works better for changing complicated units (km·h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; etc....). Opinion that this technique is limited in its application.
* Edit NASA story.
* The Temperature section should be cut-down. SW: I have edited the original section but perhaps a more aggressive edit is justified with the details deferred until the section on gases.</text>

= Introduction =
Science focuses on studying how things happen in the real world -- things you can see, touch, hear, smell,feel, or imagine such as time. 

=== Fractions and decimals===
Early society had primitive ideas (s h I t) such as '''one, two or many''', then more sophisticated means of counting emerged, mainly relating to trade. Units of weight, volume and money were at first '''integer''' whole units, often recorded by notches in a tally stick or marks in clay tablets. About 6000 years ago, with the advent of writing came '''units''' such as the length of the king's arm, together with the idea of '''multiples''' such as dozens and scores, together with '''vulgar fractions''' based on halves, quarters and so on., In order to describe these things, it is necessary to carefully '''measure''' what is observed. 

In 1791, following the French Revolution, the decimal system was published based on tens and multiples or fractions of ten. The idea of ten months per year and ten days in a week were quickly dropped, but for most purposes it was revolutionary, with integrated standard weights and measures, such as fixing the second to the length of a pendulum of one metre, and the weight of a kilo of water the same as a litre volume.  Since the 1960s the International System of Units (&quot;Système International d'Unités&quot; in French, hence &quot;SI&quot;) has been almost universal outside the United States of America, which still prefers a version of the Imperial Roman measuring system which emerged more than 2000 years go and which is complicated and illogical. 

Measurements must always be reported with appropriate '''units''', which specify what '''type of quantity''' is being discussed - weight, length or whatever. For science and engineering, the SI system is universal and is not 'owned' by anyone, so it remains constant and free of political manipulation. As recently as 1897 the Indiana State Legislature,attempted (unsuccessfully) to set the value of Pi to 3.2, and during 1940, in Britain, the weight of a pound (lb) loaf of bread was legislated at a lower weight to concerve supplies during food rationing, giving rise to the expression 'baker's dozen' because you needed thirteen new loaves or buns for the same quantity of bread as 12 of the correct weight!

=== The Measurement and the Decimal Metric System ===
As a simple example of the importance of units, imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy material. The shop assistant would need to know how much material was
required. Telling her you need material 2 wide and 6  long would be insufficient-- you have to specify the '''unit'''
(i.e. 2 ''metres'' wide and 6 ''metres'' long). Without the unit, the information is
incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were making curtains for a doll's house the dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide and 6 centimetres long!

It is not just lengths that have units. Any measurement of any physical phenomenon--time, temperature, force, or voltage, just to name a few--has units.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''Tip''': Many physics problems ask you to determine a specific numeric quantity. When you solve the problem, '''do not forget''' to specify the '''units''' of your answer: even if you have the right number, your answer is not correct unless you include the correct units.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== SI Units ===
In the remainder of this class we will be using '''SI''' units, which are defined in the table below. These seven units are used to measure fundamental quantities, and are the basis of everything we will do, as will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

== SI Units (Syst&amp;egrave;me International d'Unit&amp;eacute;s) ==
These units are internationally agreed upon and form the system we will use. Historically these units are based on the metric
system which was developed in France at the time of the French Revolution.

All physical quantities have units which can be built from the 7 base units listed in Table 1.1 (incidentally the choice of
these seven was arbitrary). They are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations of
the other six. This is similar to breaking a language down into a set of sounds from which all words are made. Another way of viewing the
base units is like the three primary colours. All other colours can be made from the primary colours but no primary colour can be made by combining the other two primaries.
 
Unit names are always written with lowercase initials (e.g. the metre). The symbols (or abbreviations) of units are also written with lowercase initials except if they are named after scientists (e.g. the kelvin (K) and the ampere (A)). An exception to this rule is the ''litre'', which is abbreviated as either L or l.

To make life convenient, particular combinations of the base units are given special names. This makes working with them easier, but it is always correct to reduce everything to the base units. Table 1.2 lists some examples of combinations of SI base units assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the formulae look unfamiliar at this stage&amp;mdash;we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as well as many others)!

It is very important that you are able to say the units correctly. For instance, the '''newton''' is another name for the '''kilogram metre per second squared''' (kg·m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while the '''kilogram metre squared per second squared''' (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is called the '''joule'''.

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | V (volt)
|}

Another important aspect of dealing with units is the prefixes that they sometimes have (prefixes are words or letters written in front that change the meaning).
The kilogram (kg) is a simple  example: 1 kg is 1000 g or 
&lt;math&gt;1\times { 10^3\mbox{ g}} &lt;/math&gt;.
Grouping the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the g together we can replace the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the prefix k (kilo). Therefore the k takes the place of the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Incidentally the kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing a prefix.

There are prefixes for many powers of 10 (Table 1.3 lists a large set of these prefixes). This is a larger set than you will need but it serves as a good
reference. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where a letter features twice in the table, it is written in uppercase for exponents
bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents less than one. ''' Those prefixes listed in boldface should be learned.'''

As another example of the use of prefixes, 

&lt;math&gt;1\times10^{-3} \mbox{ g} &lt;/math&gt; can be written as 1 mg (1 milligram).

==The Other Systems of Units== 
The remaining sets of units, although not used by us, are also internationally recognised and still in use by others. We will mention them briefly for interest only.  

=== CGS and MKS Units=== 
In this system the basic measure of length is the centimetre, weight is in grams and time is in seconds. Later the metre is replaced the centimetre and the kilogram replaced  the gram. The Second has remained the basic unit of time throughout. This is a simple change but it means that all units derived from these two are changed. For example, the units of force and work are different. These units are used most often in astrophysics and atomic physics.

When electromagnetism comes into play, there are three CGS systems, adapted to the fundamental equations each theory views as basic: The electric CGS, the magnetic CGS, and the combined Gaussian. The latter has the advantage that corresponding electric and magnetic phenomena have the same units and related equations.

It has the additional advantage that there is only one natural constant in the equations, the ''speed of light'', where the SI system has two. And experience, i.e. measurements, has shown that there is only one constant. So the Gaussion system is a bit more 'right'.

These unit systems also show that the choice of base units is arbitrary. In SI, there is a base unit for the current, the ampere [A], derived from it the unit of charge, coulomb [C]. The Gaussian system does without a dedicated unit for electricity. It simply defines the factor in the law of force between two charged particles as one - and lo, the unit C disappears; the esu (electrostatic unit) can be derived from g, cm, s - the C cannot, it is As, and A is basic.

[The same could be done with mass, leading to kg vanishing, just by setting the gravitational constant in Newton's law to one. kg would then be replaced by a combination of m and s.

===Imperial Units===
These units (as their name suggests) stem from the days when the Roman Empire decided measures. Some of these were later altered by local rulers. As a result, different countries used different base units for each  quantity (except for time). The British abandoned the Roman measurement and money system in 1972. There were 12 pennies or denaries in a shilling or solidus, and 20 shillings in a pound or libra ergo there were 240 'old pennies' and are now 100 new pennies in the pound sterling or GBP - which large unit was unchanged. The British also used both avoirdupois and troy weight and other capricious local measures, but following its integration in the EU, Britain now officially use decimal SI units for all measurements.
 
Although the British once used an imperial metric system similar to that in use in the US, it is important to know that there are some differences, because the colonists made certain incorrect assumptions, such as that because there were 16 ounces in a pound weight, there were also 16 fluid ounces in a pint of liquid, when the Romans and British defined 20 fl oz. This matters, because during World War II, for example,  great fraud was perpetrated by the British selling the smaller American gallons (8 pints) at the price for the larger British measure! 

The decimal metric system was invented in France in 1791, following the French revolution. This later became the MKS (Meter/Kilogram/Second) system and is now the System International (SI) system, which is still close that early French system.  Using different units in different places would make effective scientific communication very difficult. That is why the scientific community has adopted SI units as its internationally agreed upon standard. Therefore the SI is overwhelmingly predominant for nearly all international scientific and technical use.

===Natural Units=== 
This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most fundamental discovered quantities (such as the speed of light) are set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This system of units is used in high energy physics and quantum mechanics.</text>

= The Importance of Units =
Without units much of our work as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the
numbers we calculate. Depending on which units we use, the numbers are different (e.g. 3.8 m and 3800 mm actually represent the same length). Units are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be
specified when expressing physical quantities. In the case of the curtain example at the beginning of the chapter, 
the result of a misunderstanding would simply have been an incorrect amount of material cut. However, sometimes such misunderstandings have
catastrophic results. Here is an extract from a story on CNN's website: 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''NASA: Human error caused loss of Mars orbiter November 10, 1999'''
&lt;br/&gt;
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Failure to convert English measures to metric values caused the loss
of the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that smashed into the planet instead of
reaching a safe orbit, a NASA investigation concluded Wednesday.
The Mars Climate Orbiter, a key craft in the space agency's exploration of the red planet,
vanished after a rocket firing September 23 that was supposed to put the spacecraft on orbit around Mars.
An investigation board concluded that NASA engineers failed to convert English measures
of rocket thrusts to newton, a metric system measuring rocket force. One English pound of
force equals 4.45 newtons. A small difference between the two values caused the spacecraft
to approach Mars at too low an altitude and the craft is thought to have smashed into the
planet's atmosphere and was destroyed.
The spacecraft was to be a key part of the exploration of the planet. From its station about
the red planet, the Mars Climate Orbiter was to relay signals from the Mars Polar Lander,
which is scheduled to touch down on Mars next month.
``The root cause of the loss of the spacecraft was a failed translation of English units
into metric units and a segment of ground-based, navigation-related mission software,&quot;
said Arthus Stephenson, chairman of the investigation board. Reported by CNN at http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9911/10/orbiter.02/
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story illustrates the importance of being aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore, we must be able to convert
between systems of units!</text>

= Choice of Units =
There are no wrong units to use, but a clever choice of units can make a problem look simpler. The vast range of problems makes it impossible
to use a single set of units for everything without making some problems look much more complicated than they should. We can't
easily compare the mass of the sun and the mass of an electron, for instance. This is why astrophysicists and atomic physicists use
different systems of units.  

We won't ask you to choose between different unit systems. For your present purposes the SI system is
perfectly sufficient. In some cases you may come across quantities expressed in units other than the standard SI units. You will then
need to convert these quantities into the correct SI units. This is explained in the next section.</text>

= How to Change Units-- the &quot;Multiply by 1&quot; Technique =

Also known as fractional dimensional analysis, the technique involves multiplying a labeled quantity by a conversion ratio, or knowledge of conversion factors.  First, a relationship between the two units that you wish to convert between must be found. Here's a simple example: converting millimetres (mm) to metres (m)-- the SI unit of length. We know that there are 1000 mm in 1 m which we can write as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000 \mbox{ mm} = 1 \mbox{ m}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now multiplying both sides by 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we get 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{1000 mm}1000 mm=\frac{1}{1000 mm}1m,\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


which simply gives us

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1=\frac{1m}{1000 mm}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is the conversion ratio from millimetres to metres.  You can derive any conversion ratio in this way from a known relationship
between two units. Let's use the conversion ratio we have just derived in an example:


'''Question''': Express 3800 ''mm'' in metres.


'''Answer''':


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3800 mm &amp; = &amp; 3800 mm \times 1\\&amp; = &amp; 3800 mm \times \frac{1m}{1000 mm}\\&amp; = &amp; 3.8 m\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Note that we wrote every unit in each step of the calculation. By writing them in and cancelling 
them properly, we can check that we have the right units when we are finished. We started with ''mm'' and multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{mm}&lt;/math&gt;

This cancelled the ''mm'' leaving us with just ''m'', which is the SI unit we wanted! If we wished to do the reverse and convert metres to
millimetres, then we would need a conversion ratio with millimetres on the top and metres on the bottom.


It is helpful to understand that units cancel when one is in the numerator and the other is in the denominator. If the unit you are trying to cancel is on the top, then the conversion factor that you multiply it with must be on the bottom.

This same technique can be used to not just to convert units, but can also be used as a way to solve for an unknown quantity. For example:  If I was driving at 65 miles per hour, then I could find how far I would go in 5 hours by using &lt;math&gt;\frac{65\mbox{ miles}}{1\mbox{ hour}}&lt;/math&gt; as a conversion factor.

This would look like &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\mbox{ hours}}{1}\frac{65\mbox{ miles}}{1\mbox{ hour}}&lt;/math&gt;

This would yield a result of 325 miles because the hours would cancel leaving miles as the only unit.
==Practice Problem==

'''Problem''': Convert 3 millennia into seconds.  

Most people don't know how many seconds are in a millennium, but they do know enough to solve this problem.  Since we know 1000 years = 1 millennium, 1 year = about 365.2425 days, 1 day = 24 hours, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds we can solve this problem by multiplying by one many times.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3\mbox{ millennia}}{1}\frac{1000\mbox{ years}}{1\mbox{ millennium}}\frac{365.2425\mbox{ days}}{1\mbox{ year}}\frac{24\mbox{ hours}}{1\mbox{ day}}\frac{3600\mbox{ seconds}}{1\mbox{ hour}}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

= How Units Can Help You =

We conclude each section of this book with a discussion of the units most relevant to that particular section. It is important to try to understand what the units mean. That is why thinking about the examples and explanations of the units is essential.

If we are careful with our units then the numbers we get in our calculations can be checked in a 'sanity test'.

== What is a 'sanity test'? ==

This isn't a special or secret test. All we do is stop, take a deep breath, and look at our answer. Sure we always look at our answers-- or do we? This time we mean stop and really look-- does our answer make sense?

Imagine you were calculating the number of people in a classroom. If the answer you got was 1 000 000 people you  would know it was wrong&amp;mdash;that's just an insane number of people to have in a classroom. That's all a sanity check is&amp;mdash;is your answer insane or not? But what units were we using? We
were using people as our unit. This helped us to make sense of the answer. If we had used some other unit (or no unit) the number would have
lacked meaning and a sanity test would have been much harder (or even impossible).

It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example, let's consider masses. An average person has mass 70 kg,
while the heaviest person in medical history had a mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate a person's mass and you get 7000 kg, this should fail your sanity check&amp;mdash;your answer is insane and you must have made a mistake somewhere. In the same way an answer of 0.00001 kg should fail your sanity test.

The only problem with a sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are.
In the example of people in a classroom you need to know that there are usually 20-50 people in a classroom. Only then do you know that
your answer of 1 000 000 must be wrong. Here is a table of typical values of various things (big and small, fast and slow, light and heavy&amp;mdash;you get the idea):

= Temperature =
In everyday life, many people measure temperatures in Celsius. But in physics, we prefer to use the Kelvin scale which starts at '''absolute zero'''(−273.15 &amp;deg;C).

As we all know, Celsius temperatures can be negative. This might suggest that
any number is a valid temperature. In fact, the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic
energy of the particles that make up the gas. As we lower the temperature so the motion of the particles is reduced until a point is
reached where all motion ceases. The temperature at which this occurs is called absolute zero. There is no physically possible temperature
colder than this. In Celsius, absolute zero is at -273.15 &amp;deg;C. In Kelvin, the ordinary freezing point of water 0&amp;deg;C is therefore 273.15 K

Physicists have defined a new temperature scale called the '''Kelvin scale'''. According to this scale absolute zero is at 0 K and negative temperatures are not allowed. The size of one unit kelvin is exactly the same as that of one unit degree Celsius. This means that a change in temperature of 1 kelvin is equal to a change in temperature of 1 degree Celsius&amp;mdash;the scales just start in different places. Think of two ladders with steps that are the same size but the bottom most step on the Celsius ladder is labelled -273, while the first step on the Kelvin ladder is labelled 0. There are still 100 'steps' or degrees (Celsius or Kelvin) between the points where water freezes and boils when it is at at 1.0 atmosphere of pressure (water boils at lower temperatures if the air pressure is lowerO. 

&lt;!--
MBR Wrote - Don't you need to define what pressure the water is at?. i.e. I can change the boiling point of water by changing its pressure! For me it is important to note that water does not always boil at 100Deg C. I know you are interested in units but your example also needs to be clearly defined.

                          |----|  -269 degrees Celsius    |----|  4 kelvin
                          |----|  -270 degrees Celsius    |----|  3 kelvin
                          |----|  -271 degrees Celsius    |----|  2 kelvin
                          |----|  -272 degrees Celsius    |----|  1 kelvin
  absolute zero ---&gt;      |----|  -273 degrees Celsius    |----|  0 kelvin
  

(NOTE TO SELF: Come up with a decent picture of two ladders with the labels --water boiling and freezing--in the same place but with different labelling on the steps!)

This makes the conversion from kelvin to degree Celsius and back very easy. To convert from degrees Celsius to kelvins add 273. To convert from kelvins to degrees Celsius subtract 273. Representing the Kelvin temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; and the Celsius temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;deg;C&lt;/sub&gt;,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T_K &amp;=&amp; T_{oC} + 273\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;or&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T_{oC} &amp;=&amp; T_K - 273\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Converting between kelvin and Celsius is additive -- so a difference in temperature of 1 degree Celsius is equal to a difference of 1 kelvin. The majority of conversions between units are multiplicative. For example, to convert from metres to millimetres we '''multiply''' by 1000. Therefore a change of 1 m is equal to a change of 1000 mm.

Although it seems as though there is not much reason for the scientific community to use the Kelvin scale over the Celsius scale, there is actually a very remarkable difference in using the Kelvin scale other than the reminding effect stated above. It happens that the idealised form of some materials varies proportionately according to the Kelvin scale, such that some required values can be simply found by multiplication and division. In such calculations, it is just a chore to use the Celsius scale.


===Fahrenheit Scale ===
Fahrenheit is a temperature scale previously used in meteorology until about 1970, and which is still widely used in the USA. It was devised by a German physicist in 1724. He needed a scale that went below the freezing point of water, and used a mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride which freezes at a much lower temperature. 

In this scale, the freezing point of water (0&amp;deg;C) is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (32°F) and the boiling point (100&amp;deg;C) is 212 °F, placing the boiling and freezing points of water exactly 180 degrees apart. A temperature interval of one degree Fahrenheit is an interval of 5⁄9 of a degree Celsius. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales coincide at −40 degrees (i.e. −40 °F and −40 °C describe the same temperature).

To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:

1) Take your number in Celsius and multiply by 9.

2) Divide the result of step 1 by 5.

3) Add 32 to the result of step 2.



Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius:

1) Take your number in Fahrenheit and subtract 32

2) Multiply the result of step 1 by 5.

3) Divide the result of step 2 by 9.

===Rankine Scale ===
Absolute zero is −459.67 °F. The Rankine temperature scale was created to use degrees the same size as those of the Fahrenheit scale, such that a temperature difference of one degree Rankine (1 °R) is the same as a temperature difference of 1 °F, but with absolute zero being 0 °R.</text>

= Scientific Notation, Significant Figures and Rounding =

If you are only sure of say, both digits of a two-digit number, and put it in a formula and get a long series of numbers to the right of the decimal place, then those digits are probably not very accurate. This is the idea of significant figures.

Take 10 and divide by 3. If you are not sure that the number 10 is perfectly accurate, then you do not need to write down 3.333... and can get away with  something like 3.3 or 3.33

(NOTE TO SELF: still to be written)

The accuracy of a measurement using significant figures is represented by the number of digits that it contains. A number is said to have the number of significant figures equal to the number of digits in the number not including leading 0s or trailing 0s unless there is a decimal point. The table below contains a list of numbers and how many significant digits each contains.

{| 
|-

Significant Digits
|-

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 1
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 1000.
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 4

|-
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | &lt;math&gt;1.00\times { 10^3} &lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 3
|}

As you may have noted, some numbers cannot be shown in proper significant figure notation without the use of scientific notation. For example, the number 1000 can only be shown to have 1 or 4 or more significant digits by the inclusion of a decimal point. However, by rewriting 1000 as &lt;math&gt;1.\times {10^3} &lt;/math&gt; any number of significant digits may be added by simply add additional 0s after the decimal point.

Sometimes you may be asked to determine the number of significant figures in a given number. There are three rules to determine what numerals are significant.

# '''Leading zeros''' are never significant. Leading zeros are zeros that appear on the left end of the number.
# '''All non-zero digits''' are significant. '''Trapped zeros''' (zeros between non-zero digits) are also significant.
# '''Trailing zeros''' are never significant ''unless'' there is a decimal point. Trailing zeros are zeros that appear on the right end of the number.

=== '''E''' notation ===

Very large numbers such as the speed of light (the C part of Einstein's famous  &lt;math&gt;E=MC^2 &lt;/math&gt;) are difficult to write accurately.

We could write 300,000,000 m/sec, &lt;math&gt;3x10^8&lt;/math&gt;, 300 million meters per second or some such. There is a much better way! 

We simply separate the number (coefficient)  part '''3''' from its multiplier '''00000000''' base!

But be careful, there is an '''E'''lephant trap here, and it is that in scientific notation the number is always expressed as a '''decimal fraction  with a maximum value of 1.0''', (in this case =0.3) so the multiplier part is one bigger than you might expect!  &lt;math&gt; 3x10^8&lt;/math&gt; is the same as 0.3E9. (Because there are a total of nine digits after the decimal point)

A tiny dust particle might weigh as little as 0.000 000 000 678 kg.! This time we shift the decimal point 9 places to the right so the number (678) has a '''negative''' base so our weight is written as 0.678E'''-'''9 kg. 

Now is that not a whole lot easier to write and understand? That is why many scientific calculators and most spread-sheets allow input and display in '''E notation''' format.

=== Commas and points ===
Most English speaking people use the comma [''' , '''] to separate thousands and the dot (ful-stop, or point) [''' . '''] for the decimal indicator. Europeans often use these the other way around. Many spread-sheets allow both, but it is just one more complexity you need to know about!</text>

= Conclusion =
In this chapter we have discussed the importance of units. We have discovered that there are many 
different units to describe the same thing, although you should stick to SI units in your
calculations. We have also discussed how to convert between different units. This is a skill you must acquire.</text>

== Waves and Wavelike Motion ==
Waves occur frequently in nature. The most obvious examples are waves in water on a dam, in the ocean, or in a bucket, but sound waves and electromagnetic waves are other, less visible examples. We are
most interested in the properties that waves have. All waves have the same basic properties, so by studying waves in water we can transfer our knowledge and predict how other types of waves will behave.

Waves are associated with energy. As the waves move, they carry energy from one point to another in space. It is true for water waves as well. You can see the wave energy working while a ship drifts along the wave in rough sea. The most spectacular example is the enormous amount of energy we receive from the sun in the form of light and heat, which are transmitted as electromagnetic waves - not even requiring a medium to propagate.

== Simple Harmonic Motion ==
Simple Harmonic motion is a wavelike motion.  It is considered wavelike because the graph of time vs. displacement from the equilibrium position is a sine curve.

An example of simple harmonic motion is a mass oscillating on a spring.  It will be hard to understand  the forces involved this early in the course that cause the motion to simple harmonic, but it is still possible to look at a mass oscillating on a spring and understand that it is indeed simple harmonic. When a mass is oscillating on a spring, the further the string stretches, the slower the mass will be moving.  Then the mass reaches a point where the string won't stretch any further, so it quits moving and then it reverses direction.  As it moves closer to the equilibrium position is moves faster.</text>

= What are waves? =
Waves are phenomena that everyone experiences constantly; water waves, sound waves, light waves, human waves when the home team scores... the list goes on.  When asked what makes a wave a wave, the most common responses would probably be that a wave is something that moves, or propagates, or perhaps that it is something that repeats over and over again.  These properties do capture the essential qualities of waves.  Now we must determine these properties quantitatively, and discover what governs their behavior.

Generally, a wave is defined as any phenomenon which can be modeled by a function of the form &lt;math&gt;f(\overline{k} \overline{r} - \omega t)&lt;/math&gt; where the r-vector represents a position in space, and t represents a time, and the k-vector and omega are both constants.  Don't be intimidated by the vectors in the argument - most of our time at first will be spent on one-dimensional waves.  If the wave is in only one spatial dimension 'x', for instance a wave travelling on a taut string, it can be written simply as  &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(k x - w t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.

Any function of this form &quot;propagates&quot; along the &lt;math&gt;\overline{k}&lt;/math&gt; direction over time.  As time increases, the argument of the function increases; over time the form of the function effectively advances through space.  Try coming up with functions of this form, and plot them at time t = 0, then plot them again at a later time.  This progressive property will become obvious.  Try to figure out the velocity with which your function advances!  (we will study this later)  The negative sign in front of the time term causes the wave to propagate in the direction defined as positive (if that seems confusing, try plotting more functions over time, and examine the results).  If you replace the negative with a positive (or instead consider a negative value of omega), the wave will propagate in the negative direction.

A very special and important case of a wave is the mathematical function &lt;math&gt;f(\overline{k} \overline{r} - \omega t) = sin(\overline{k} \overline{r} - \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;, or in one dimension, &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(k x - \omega t) = sin(k x - \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.  This is a sinusoidal wave - it oscillates up and down infinitely in both directions, and moves as time progresses.  I mentioned that waves have the quality of repeating over and over, the quality of '''periodicity'''.  However, many functions of the form mentioned above do not seem to repeat.  However, you will find that ALL waves can be decomposed into a sum of many of these simple, infinitely repeating waves when you learn about Fourier transformations.

More than any other concept, physicists are finding that '''waves''' characterize the structure of the universe at every scale imaginable.  As you learn about the physics of waves in everyday life, keep an open mind towards finding waves and wave behavior everywhere you turn.

Let's consider a very well-known case of a wave phenomenon: water waves. Waves in water consist of moving peaks and troughs. A peak is a place where the
water rises higher than when the water is still and a trough is a place where the water sinks lower than when the water is still.

So waves have peaks and troughs. This could be our first property for waves. The following diagram shows the peaks and troughs on a wave.

[[Image:fhsst_waves1.png|472px]]

In physics we try to be as quantitative as possible. If we look very carefully we notice that the height of the peaks above the
level of the still water is the same as the depth of the troughs below the level of the still water.

Waves are repetitions of physical quantity in a periodic manner, carrying energy in the process. The water waves, for example, can be visualized to repeat any of the physical quantities like &quot;peaks&quot;, &quot;troughs&quot;, &quot;potential energy&quot; or &quot;kinetic energy&quot;. Even, we can visualize water waves as the motion of disturbance (energy). It is the energy aspect of waves that is central to the understanding of different types of waves, many of which are not visible.

Looking closely at the water wave, we can recognize that crests and troughs basically  represent of extreme potential and kinetic energies in addition to representing rise and fall of water from the still level. At the peak, energy is only potential, whereas energy is only kinetic at the trough. Similarly, propagation of electromagnetic wave is associated with repetitions of magnetic and electric field in space with certain periodicity. As existence of electrical or magnetic fields does not require any medium, electromagnetic waves can move even in the absence of any medium.    

== Characteristics of Waves : Amplitude ==

We use symbols agreed upon by convention to label the characteristic quantities of the waves. The characteristic height
of a peak and depth of a trough is called the amplitude of the wave. The vertical distance between the bottom of the trough and
the top of the peak is twice the amplitude. To put it simply, the amplitude is the distance of the wave from the medium, to the crest or trough 

[[Image:fhsst_waves2.png|463px|]]

Worked Example 1

'''Question:''' (NOTE TO SELF: Make this a more exciting question)
The height of the wave from the medium is 2m. What is the distance from the peak to the trough. What

'''Answer:'''

The amplitude is 2m. (Read above paragraph to know why). The distance from the peak to trough is 4m.

== Characteristics of Waves : Wavelength ==
Look a little closer at the peaks and the troughs. The distance between two adjacent (next to each other) peaks is the same
no matter which two adjacent peaks you choose. So there is a fixed distance between the peaks.

Similarly, you'll notice that the distance between two adjacent troughs is the same no matter which two troughs you look
at. But, more importantly, its is the same as the distance between the peaks. This distance which is a characteristic of the
wave is called the wavelength. 

Waves have a characteristic wavelength. The symbol for the wavelength
is the Greek letter lambda, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:fhsst_waves3.png|472px|]]

The wavelength is the distance between any two adjacent points which are in phase. Two points in phase are separate by an
integer (0,1,2,3,...) number of complete wave cycles. They don't have to be peaks or trough but they must be separated by a
complete number of waves.

== Characteristics of Waves : Period ==
Now imagine you are sitting next to a pond and you watch the waves going past you. First one peak, then a trough and then another
peak. If you measure the time between two adjacent peaks you'll find that it is the same. Now if you measure the time between two
adjacent troughs you'll find that its always the same, no matter which two adjacent troughs you pick. The time you have been
measuring is the time for one wavelength to pass by. We call this time the period and it is a characteristic of the wave.

The period of the wave is denoted with the symbol &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

== Characteristics of Waves : Frequency ==
There is another way of characterising the time interval of a wave. We timed how long it takes for one wavelength to go past. We could also 
turn this around and say how many waves go by in 1 second. 

We can easily determine this number, which we call the frequency and denote f. To determine the frequency, how many waves go by in
1s, we work out what fraction of a waves goes by in 1 second by dividing 1 second by the time it takes T. If a wave takes 1/2 a
second to go by then in 1 second two waves must go by. &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} =2&lt;/math&gt;. The unit of frequency is the ''Hz'' or ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Waves have a characteristic frequency.

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
|  colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
{| 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : frequency (''Hz'' or ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''T''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : period (''s'')
|}

generally, the frequency of a wave is the number of crests that pass by per unit time.

== Characteristics of Waves : Speed ==

Now if you are watching a wave go by you will notice that they move at a constant velocity. Thinking back to rectilinear motion
you will be able to remember that we know how to work out how fast something moves. The speed is the distance you travel divided by
the time you take to travel that distance. This is excellent because we know that the waves travel a distance &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in a 
time T. This means that we can determine the speed. 


{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\lambda}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
{| 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''v''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : speed (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : wavelength (''m'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''T''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : period (''s'')
|}

There are a number of relationships involving the various characteristic quantities of waves. A simple example of how this
would be useful is how to determine the velocity when you have the frequency and the wavelength. We can take the above equation and
substitute the relationship between frequency and period to produce an equation for speed of the form

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;v = f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
{| 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''v''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : speed (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : wavelength (''m'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : frequency (''Hz'' or ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|}

Is this correct? Remember a simple first check is to check the units! On the right hand side we have speed which has units
''ms''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. On the left hand side we have frequency which is measured in ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; multiplied by wavelength which is measure in
''m''. On the left hand side we have ''ms''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; which is exactly what we want.

=== Speed of a wave through strings ===
The speed of a wave traveling along a vibrating string (v) is directly proportional to the square root of the tension (''T'') over the linear density (μ):

:&lt;math&gt;
v=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

μ is equal to the mass of the string divided by the length of the string.

&lt;math&gt;
\mu={\frac{M}{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;</text>

= Two Types of Waves = 

We agreed that a wave was a moving set of peaks and troughs and we used water as an example. Moving peaks and troughs, with all the
characteristics we described, in any medium constitute a wave. It is possible to have waves where the peaks and troughs are
perpendicular to the direction of motion, like in the case of water waves. These waves are called transverse waves.

There are two additional types of waves. The first is called longitudinal waves and have the peaks and troughs in the same direction as the
wave is moving. The question is how do we construct such a wave?

An example of a longitudinal wave is pressure waves moving through a gas. The peaks in this wave are places where the pressure
reaches a peak and the troughs are places where the pressure is a minimum.


In the picture below we show the random placement of the gas molecules in a tube. The piston at the end moves into the tube
with a repetitive motion. Before the first piston stroke the pressure is the same throughout the tube.

[[Image:fhsst_waves4.png|236px|]]

When the piston moves in it compresses the gas molecules together at the end of the tube. If the piston stopped moving the gas
molecules would all bang into each other and the pressure would increase in the tube.

[[Image:fhsst_waves5.png|236px|]]

When the piston moves out again before the molecules have time to bang around then the increase in pressure moves down the tube like
a pulse (single peak and trough, a single wave cycle).

[[Image:fhsst_waves6.png|236px|]]

As this repeats we get waves of increased and decreased pressure moving down the tubes. We can describe these pulses of increased
pressure (peaks in the pressure) and decreased pressure (troughs of pressure) by a sine or cosine graph.

[[Image:fhsst_waves7.png|236px|]]


[[Image:fhsst_waves8.png|236px|]]

The second additional type of wave is the torsional wave. The peaks and troughs rotate around the direction of motion. In simpler terms, a &quot;twisting motion&quot; is transmitted through the medium. Of the two wave types, this is the hardest one to describe and visualize.

There are a number of examples of each type of wave. Not all can be seen with the naked eye but all can be detected.</text>

= Properties of Waves =

We have discussed some of the simple properties of waves that we need
to know. These have just been describing the characteristics that
waves have. Now we can progress onto some more interesting and,
perhaps, less intuitive properties of waves.

== Properties of Waves : Reflection ==

When waves strike a barrier they are reflected. This means that waves
bounce off things. Sound waves bounce off walls, light waves bounce
off mirrors, radar waves bounce off planes and how bats can fly at
night and avoid things as small as telephone wires. etc. The property
of reflection is a very important and useful one.

(NOTE TO SELF: Get an essay by an air traffic controller on radar)
(NOTE TO SELF: Get an essay by on sonar usage for fishing or for submarines)

When waves are reflected, the process of reflection has certain
properties. If a wave hits an obstacle at a right angle to the surface
(NOTE TO SELF: diagrams needed) then the wave is reflected directly
backwards.

[[Image:fhsst waves9.png|372px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves10.png|372px|]]

If the wave strikes the obstacle at some other angle then it is
not reflected directly backwards. The angle that the waves arrives
at is the same as the angle that the reflected waves leaves at.
The angle that waves arrives at or is incident at equals the angle
the waves leaves at or is reflected at. Angle of incidence equals
angle of reflection

| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : angle of reflection
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:fhsst waves11.png|372px|]]

In the optics chapter you will learn that light is a wave. This means
that all the properties we have just learnt apply to light as well. Its
very easy to demonstrate reflection of light with a mirror. You can also
easily show that angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.

If you look directly into you see yourself ....

'''Need to mention that the incident wave, normal to the surface and the reflected wave all lie in the same plane. The same also holds for refraction at a surface.'''

=== Phase shift of reflected wave ===

When a wave is reflected from a more dense medium, it undergoes a phase
shift. That means that the peaks and troughs are swapped around.

The easiest way to demonstrate this is to tie a piece of string to
something. Stretch the string out flat and then flick the string
once so a pulse moves down the string. When the pulse (a single peak
in a wave) hits the barrier that the string is tied to, it will be
reflected. The reflected wave will look like a trough instead of a
peak. This is because the pulse had undergone a phase change. The
fixed end is like reflection off a more dense medium.

If the end of the string was not fixed, i.e. it could move up and
down then the wave would still be reflected but it would 
not undergo a phase shift.

== Properties of Waves : Refraction ==

Sometimes waves move from one medium to another. The medium is the
substance that is carrying the waves. In our first example this was
the water. When the medium properties change it can affect the wave.

Let us start with the simple case of a water wave moving from one
depth to another.
The speed of the wave depends on the depth. If the wave moves directly
from the one medium to the other than we should look closely at the
boundary. When a peak arrives at the boundary and moves across it must
remain a peak on the other side of the boundary. This means that the
peaks pass by at the same time intervals on either side of the
boundary. The period and frequency remain the same! But we said the
speed of the wave changes, which means that the distance it travels in
one time interval is different i.e. the wavelength has changed.

Going from one medium to another the period or frequency does not
change only the wavelength can change.

Now if we consider a water wave moving at an angle of incidence not 90
degrees towards a change in medium then we immediately know that not
the whole wave will arrive at once. So if a part of the wave arrives
and slows down while the rest is still moving faster before it arrives
the angle of the wavefront is going to change. This is known as
refraction. When a wave bends or changes its direction when it goes
from one medium to the next.

If it slows down it turns towards the perpendicular.

[[Image:fhsst waves18.png|372px|]]

If the wave speeds up in the new medium it turns away from the
perpendicular to the medium surface.

When you look at a stick that emerges from water it looks like it
is bent. This is because the light from below the surface of the
water bends when it leaves the water. Your eyes project the light
back in a straight line and so the object looks like it is a
different place.

[[Image:fhsst waves19.png|372px|]]

== Properties of Waves : Interference ==

If two waves meet interesting things can happen. Waves are basically
collective motion of particles. So when two waves meet they both try
to impose their collective motion on the particles. This can have
quite different results.

If two identical (same wavelength, amplitude and frequency) waves are
both trying to form a peak then they are able to achieve the sum of
their efforts. The resulting motion will be a peak which has a height
which is the sum of the heights of the two waves. If two waves are
both trying to form a trough in the same place then a deeper trough is
formed, the depth of which is the sum of the depths of the two
waves. Now in this case the two waves have been trying to do the same
thing and so add together constructively. This is called
constructive interference.

[[Image:fhsst waves20.png|761px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves21.png|761px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves22.png|761px|]]

If one wave is trying to form a peak and the other is trying to
form a trough then they are competing to do different things. In
this case they can cancel out. The height of the peak less the
depth of the trough will be the resulting effect. If the depth of
the trough is the same as the height of the peak nothing will
happen. If the height of the peak is bigger than the depth of the
trough a smaller peak will appear and if the trough is deeper then
a less deep trough will appear. This is destructive
interference.

[[Image:fhsst waves25.png|761px|]]

== Properties of Waves : Standing Waves ==

When two waves move in opposite directions, through each other,
constructive interference happens. If the two waves have the same
frequency and wavelength then a specific type of constructive
interference can occur: standing waves can form.

Standing waves are disturbances which don't appear to move, they
stand in the same place. Lets demonstrate exactly how this comes
about. Imagine a long string with waves being sent down it from
either end. The waves from both ends have the same amplitude,
wavelength and frequency as you can see in the picture below:

[[Image:fhsst waves26.png|460px|]]

To stop from getting confused between the two waves we'll draw the
wave from the left with a dashed line and the one from the right
with a solid line. As the waves move closer together when they touch
both waves have an amplitude of zero:

[[Image:fhsst waves27.png|460px|]]

If we wait for a short time the ends of the two waves move past each
other and the waves overlap. Now we know what happens when two waves
overlap, we add them together to get the resulting wave.

[[Image:fhsst waves28.png|460px|]]

Now we know what happens when two waves overlap, we add them
together to get the resulting wave. In this picture we show the two
waves as dotted lines and the sum of the two in the overlap region
is shown as a solid line:

[[Image:fhsst waves29.png|460px|]]

The important thing to note in this case is that there are some
points where the two waves always destructively interfere to zero.
If we let the two waves move a little further we get the picture
below:

[[Image:fhsst waves30.png|460px|]]

Again we have to add the two waves together in the overlap region to
see what the sum of the waves looks like.

[[Image:fhsst waves31.png|460px|]]

In this case the two waves have moved half a cycle past each other
but because they are out of phase they cancel out completely. The
point at 0 will always be zero as the two waves move past each
other.

When the waves have moved past each other so that they are
overlapping for a large region the situation looks like a wave
oscillating in place. If we focus on the range -4, 4 once the waves
have moved over the whole region. To make it clearer the arrows at
the top of the picture show peaks where maximum positive
constructive interference is taking place. The arrows at the bottom
of the picture show places where maximum negative interference is
taking place.

[[Image:fhsst waves32.png|369px|]]

As time goes by the peaks become smaller and the troughs become
shallower but they do not move.

[[Image:fhsst waves33.png|369px|]]

For an instant the entire region will look completely flat.

[[Image:fhsst waves34.png|369px|]]

The various points continue their motion in the same manner.

[[Image:fhsst waves35.png|369px|]]

Eventually the picture looks like the complete reflection through
the x-axis of what we started with:

[[Image:fhsst waves36.png|369px|]]

Then all the points begin to move back. Each point on the line is
oscillating up and down with a different amplitude.

[[Image:fhsst waves37.png|369px|]]

If we superimpose the two cases where the peaks where at a maximum
and the case where the same waves where at a minimum we can see the
lines that the points oscillate between. We call this the envelope
of the standing wave as it contains all the oscillations of the
individual points. A node is a place where the two waves cancel out
completely as two waves destructively interfere in the same place.
An anti-node is a place where the two waves constructively
interfere.

[[Image:fhsst waves38.png|453px|]]

To make the concept of the envelope clearer let us draw arrows
describing the motion of points along the line.

[[Image:fhsst waves39.png|453px|]]

Every point in the medium containing a standing wave oscillates up
and down and the amplitude of the oscillations depends on the
location of the point. It is convenient to draw the envelope for the
oscillations to describe the motion. We cannot draw the up and down
arrows for every single point!

=== Reflection from a fixed end ===

If waves are reflected from a fixed end, for example tying the end
of a rope to a pole and then sending waves down it. The fixed end
will always be a node. Remember: Waves reflected from a
fixed end undergo a phase shift.

The wavelength, amplitude and speed of the wave cannot affect this,
the fixed end is always a node.

=== Reflection from an open end ===

If waves are reflected from end, which is free to move, it is an
anti-node. For example tying the end of a rope to a ring, which can
move up and down, around the pole. Remember: The waves sent
down the string are reflected but do not suffer a phase shift.

=== Wavelengths of standing waves with fixed and open ends ===

[[Image:fhsst waves40.png|392px|]]

[[Image:fhsst waves41.png|392px|]]

== Beats ==

If the waves that are interfering are not identical then the waves
form a modulated pattern with a changing amplitude. The peaks in
amplitude are called beats. If you consider two sound waves
interfering then you hear sudden beats in loudness or intensity of
the sound.

The simplest illustration is to draw two different waves and then
add them together. You can do this mathematically and draw them
yourself to see the pattern that occurs.

Here is wave 1:

[[Image:fhsst waves42.png|761px|]]

Now we add this to another wave, wave 2:

[[Image:fhsst waves43.png|761px|]]

When the two waves are added (drawn in coloured dashed lines) you
can see the resulting wave pattern:

[[Image:fhsst waves44.png|761px|]]

To make things clearer the resulting wave without the dashed lines
is drawn below. Notice that the peaks are the same distance apart
but the amplitude changes. If you look at the peaks they are
modulated i.e. the peak amplitudes seem to oscillate with another
wave pattern. This is what we mean by modulation.

[[Image:fhsst waves45.png|761px|]]

The maximum amplitude that the new wave gets to is the sum of the
two waves just like for constructive interference. Where the waves
reach a maximum it is constructive interference.

The smallest amplitude is just the difference between the
amplitudes of the two waves, exactly like in destructive
interference.

The beats have a frequency which is the difference between the
frequency of the two waves that were added. This means that the
beat frequency is given by

{| 
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f_B=|f_1-f_2|&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(2.2)
|}

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f_B=|f_1-f_2|&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &amp;nbsp; 
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | &amp;nbsp; 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : beat frequency (Hz or s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : frequency of wave 1 (Hz or s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : frequency of wave 2 (Hz or s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Properties of Waves : Diffraction ==

One of the most interesting, and also very useful, properties of
waves is diffraction. When a wave strikes a barrier with a
hole, only part of the wave can move through the hole. If the hole
is similar in size to the wavelength of the wave diffractions
occurs. The waves that comes through the hole no longer looks like
a straight wave front. It bends around the edges of the hole. If
the hole is small enough it acts like a point source of circular
waves.

This bending around the edges of the hole is called diffraction.
To illustrate this behaviour we start with Huygen's principle.

=== Huygen's Principle ===

Huygen's principle states that each point on a wavefront acts like
a point source or circular waves. The waves emitted from each
point interfere to form another wavefront on which each point
forms a point source. A long straight line of points emitting
waves of the same frequency leads to a straight wave front moving
away.

To understand what this means lets think about a whole lot of
peaks moving in the same direction. Each line represents a peak of
a wave.

[[Image:fhsst waves46.png|734px|]]

If we choose three points on the next wave front in the direction of
motion and make each of them emit waves isotropically (i.e. the same in all
directions) we will get the sketch below:

[[Image:fhsst waves47.png|734px|]]

What we have drawn is the situation if those three points on the
wave front were to emit waves of the same frequency as the moving
wave fronts. Huygens principle says that every point on the wave
front emits waves isotropically and that these waves interfere to
form the next wave front.

To see if this is possible we make more points emit waves
isotropically to get the sketch below:

[[Image:fhsst waves48.png|734px|]]

You can see that the lines from the circles (the peaks) start to
overlap in straight lines. To make this clear we redraw the sketch
with dashed lines showing the wavefronts which would form. Our
wavefronts are not perfectly straight lines because we didn't draw
circles from every point. If we had it would be hard to see clearly
what is going on.

[[Image:fhsst waves49.png|734px|]]

Huygen's principle is a method of analysis applied to problems of
wave propagation. It recognizes that each point of an advancing
wave front is in fact the center of a fresh disturbance and the
source of a new train of waves  and that the advancing wave as a
whole may be regarded as the sum of all the secondary waves
arising from points in the medium already traversed. This view of
wave propagation helps better understand a variety of wave
phenomena, such as diffraction.

=== Wavefronts Moving Through an Opening ===

Now if we allow the wavefront to impinge on a barrier with a hole in
it, then only the points on the wavefront that move into the hole
can continue emitting forward moving waves - but because a lot of
the wavefront have been removed the points on the edges of the
hole emit waves that bend round the edges.

[[Image:fhsst waves50.png|736px|]]

The wave front that impinges (strikes) the wall cannot continue
moving forward. Only the points moving into the gap can. If you
employ Huygens' principle you can see the effect is that the
wavefronts are no longer straight lines.

[[Image:fhsst waves51.png|736px|]]

'''Riaan Note: still cant find this image, have to get it from the pdf'''

For example, if two rooms are connected by an open doorway and a
sound is produced in a remote corner of one of them, a person in
the other room will hear the sound as if it originated at the
doorway. As far as the second room is concerned, the vibrating air
in the doorway is the source of the sound. The same is true of
light passing the edge of an obstacle, but this is not as easily
observed because of the short wavelength of visible light.

This means that when waves move through small holes they appear to
bend around the sides because there aren't enough points on the
wavefront to form another straight wavefront. This is bending
round the sides we call diffraction.

== Properties of Waves : Dispersion ==

Dispersion is a property of waves where the speed of the
wave through a medium depends on the wavelength. So if two waves
enter the same dispersive medium and have different wavelengths
they will have different speeds in that medium even if they both
entered with the same speed.</text>

== Doppler Effect ==
The '''Doppler Effect''' is an interesting phenomenon that occurs when an object producing sound is moved relatively to the listener.

Consider the following: When a car blaring its horn is behind you, the pitch is higher as it is approaching, and becomes lower as it is moving away.  This is only noticeable if the object is moving at a fairly high speed, although it is still theoretically present at any speed.

When an object is moving '''away''' from the listener, the sound waves are stretched over a further distance meaning they happen less often.  The wavelength ends up being greater so the frequency is less and the pitch is lower.  When an object is moving '''towards''' the listener, the waves are compressed over a small distance making a very small wavelength and therefore a large frequency and high pitch.  Since the pitch of the sound depends on the ''frequency'' of the waves, the pitch increases when the object is moving towards the listener.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #00000; border: solid 2px #7B68EE; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;  &lt;math&gt;f' = f( \frac{v \pm v_0}{v \mp v_s} )&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;f' is the observed frequency, f is the actual frequency, v is the speed of sound (&lt;math&gt; v=336+0.6T &lt;/math&gt;) T is temperature in degrees Celsius,  &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the observer, and &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the source. If the observer is approaching the source, use the top operator (the +) in the numerator, and if the source is approaching the observer, use the top operator (the -) in the denominator. If the observer is moving away from the source, use the bottom operator (the -) in the numerator, and if the source is moving away from the observer, use the bottom operator (the +) in the denominator.

===Example problems===
A. An ambulance, which is emitting a 40 Hz siren, is moving at a speed of 30 m/s towards a stationary observer. The speed of sound in this case is 339 m/s.

&lt;math&gt;f' = 40( \frac{339 + 0}{339 - 30} )&lt;/math&gt;

B. An M551 Sheridan, moving at 10 m/s is following a Renault FT-17 which is moving in the same direction at 5 m/s and emitting a 30 Hz tone. The speed of sound in this case is 342 m/s.


&lt;math&gt;f' = 30( \frac{342 + 10}{342 + 5} )&lt;/math&gt;

== Ultra-Sound ==
still to be completed

Ultrasound is sound that has too high a frequency for humans to hear. Some other animals can hear ultrasound though.  Dog whistles are an example of ultrasound. We can't hear the sound, but dogs can. Audible sound is in the frequency range between 20 Hz and 20000 Hz. Anything above that is ultrasound, and anything below that is called infrasonic.

Ultrasound also has medical applications.  It can be used to generate images with a sonogram. Ultrasound is commonly used to look at fetuses in the womb.

= Practical Applications of Waves: Electromagnetic Waves =

In physics, wave-particle duality holds that light and matter
simultaneously exhibit properties of waves and of particles. This
concept is a consequence of quantum mechanics.

In 1905, Einstein reconciled Huygens' view with that of Newton.  He
explained the photoelectric effect (an effect in which light did
not seem to act as a wave) by postulating the existence of
photons, quanta of energy with particulate qualities. Einstein
postulated that the frequency of light, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the energy, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, of its photons:


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E = hf\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(2.3)
|}

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is Planck's constant (&lt;math&gt;6.626\times10^{-34}Js&lt;/math&gt;).

In 1924, De Broglie claimed that all matter has a wave-like
nature.  He related wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and momentum p:


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\lambda=\frac{h}{p}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(2.4)
|}

This is a generalization of Einstein's equation above, since the
momentum of a photon is given by


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p = \frac{E}{c},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(2.5)
|}

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in vacuum, and &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{c}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;.

De Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later by guiding a
beam of electrons (which have rest mass) through a crystalline
grid and observing the predicted interference patterns. Similar
experiments have since been conducted with neutrons and protons.
Authors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules
claim that these larger particles also act like waves. This is
still a controversial subject because these experimenters have
assumed arguments of wave-particle duality and have assumed the
validity of de Broglie's equation in their argument.

The Planck constant h is extremely small and that explains why we
don't perceive a wave-like quality of everyday objects: their
wavelengths are exceedingly small. The fact that matter can have
very short wavelengths is exploited in electron microscopy.

In quantum mechanics, the wave-particle duality is explained as
follows: every system and particle is described by state functions
which encode the probability distributions of all measurable
variables. The position of the particle is one such variable.
Before an observation is made the position of the particle is
described in terms of probability waves which can interfere with
each other.</text>

=Vectors=
NOTE TO SELF: SW: initially this chapter had a very mathematical approach. I have toned this down and tried to present in a logical way the
techniques of vector manipulation after first exploring the mathematical properties of vectors. Most of the PGCE comments revolved around
the omission of the graphical techniques of vector addition (i.e. scale diagrams), incline questions and equilibrium of
forces. I have addressed the first two  equilibrium of forces and the triangle law of three forces in equilibrium I think would be
better off in the Forces Chapter. Also the Forces chapter should include some examples of incline planes. Inclines are introduced here merely
as an example of components in action!</text>

* Please mention that although a rotation about an axis '''can''' be represented as a vector which statisfies your definition, the addition (composition) of two successive rotations about distinct axes is not obtained by simply adding the corresponding vectors. A better definition is: something which has direction and magnitude '''and''' adds by the parallelogram rule. (Alex)
* Mention that the direction of a vector is measured from its tail.
* Also include explanations of the ways in which to specify direction (e.g. bearing, compass points, angle from vertical, etc.)
* Include exam-type questions involving flowing rivers or aeroplanes in wind. These questions link displacement, velocity and time and also test the learners understanding of vectors combining to give a combined result (i.e. resultant).
* Mention that displacement at a point is the directed line from the start to that point.
* Rewrite section on velocity to make clear the distinction between average and instantaneous rates of change (velocity and speed). The &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;'s in the equations imply we are calculating average quantities. Mention that we take the limit of a small time interval to give instantaneous quantities. Perhaps the example of a parabola with average gradient and gradient of tangent can be used as an illustration. Else defer until chapter on Graphs and Equations of Motion. Instantaneous velocity: reading on the speedometer in a direction tangent to the path. Instantaneous speed is magnitude of instantaneous velocity but average speed is not equal to magnitude of average velocity. Average speed and average velocity are the total distance and resultant displacement over the time interval related to that part of the path. The example of the circular track uses these definitions and is an important illustration of the differences. Instantaneous calculated at a certain instant in time while average is calculated over an interval.
* Include relative velocity.
* Address PGCE comments above and comments in the text.</text>

==Introduction==
``A vector is `something' that has both magnitude and direction.'' ```Thing'? What sorts of `thing'?&quot; Any piece of information which contains a magnitude and a related direction can be a vector. A vector should tell you how much and which way.

Consider a man driving his car east along a highway at 100 ''km''/''h''. What we have given here is a vector &amp;mdash; the car's velocity. The car is moving at 100 ''km''/''h'' (this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going &amp;mdash; east (this is the direction). Thus, we know the speed and direction of the car. These two quantities, a magnitude and a direction, form a vector we call velocity.

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' A ''vector'' is a measurement which has both magnitude and direction.}}

In physics, magnitudes often have directions associated with them. If you push something it is not very useful knowing just how hard you pushed. A direction is needed too. Directions are extremely important, especially when dealing with situations more complicated than simple pushes and pulls.

Different people like to write vectors in different ways. Any way of writing a vector so that it has both magnitude and direction is valid.

Are vectors physics? No, vectors themselves are not physics. Physics is just a description of the world around us. To describe something we need to use a language. The most common language used to describe physics is mathematics. Vectors form a very important part of the mathematical description of physics, so much so that it is absolutely essential to master the use of vectors.

==Mathematical representation==

Numerous notations are commonly used to denote vectors. In this text, vectors will be denoted by symbols capped with an arrow. As an example,  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt;are all vectors (they have both magnitude and  direction). Sometimes just the magnitude of a vector is required. In this case, the arrow is omitted. In other words, ''F'' denotes the magnitude of vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;|\overrightarrow{F}|&lt;/math&gt; is another way of representing the size of a vector.

==Graphical representation==

Graphically vectors are drawn as arrows. An arrow has both a magnitude (how long it is) and a direction (the direction in which it points). For this reason, arrows are vectors. 

In order to draw a vector accurately we must specify a scale and include a reference direction in the diagram. A scale allows us to translate the length of the arrow into the vector's magnitude. For instance if one chose a scale of 1''cm'' = 2''N'' (1''cm'' represents 2''N''), a force of magnitude 20''N'' would be represented as an arrow 10''cm'' long. A reference direction may be a line representing a horizontal surface or the points of a compass.

==Worked Example 2: Drawing vectors==

'''Question:''' Using a scale of  &lt;math&gt;1cm=2m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; represent the following velocities:

a) &lt;math&gt;6m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; north

b) &lt;math&gt;16m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; east

Archaeology :  archaeology is the study of past human life by examining buildings and objects found in the ground.
Geology : the science that deals with the dynamics and physical history of the earth
Anthropology : the science that deals with the origins, physical and cultural development, biological characteristics, and social customs and beliefs of humankind
Paleontology : the science of the forms of life existing in former geologic periods, as represented by their fossils
History :  the branch of knowledge dealing with past events

== '''Requirement 2''' ==




Site location : First, the archaeologists try to locate sites. There are many ways to find sites.
1) Archaeologists can locate sites by looking for places where  there is a possibility that ancient cultures might have survived. A likely idea is near a river, but not close enough for houses to be affected by floods. An unlikely idea is in the center of a desert, far way from a source of water.

2) Some sites are found before a construction. Before a building construction, archaeologists are informed of the building. If they find artifacts, construction plans might have to be changed. Constrution might also be delayed.


Site excavation : 2nd, before the excavation the archaeologists separate the field into several areas. After that, they begin to protect the site. They forbid access to other people. At the end, they begin to excavate.

Artifact identification and examination : The assistance of specialists and the recourse to laboratories often are essential to date to determine materials or organizations, to study the human remainders.

Interpretation : After the study of the new data, the researcher proposes several assumptions on the object find.  This aspect determining of research often calls upon a gathering of specialized knowledge joined together in data bases.

Preservation : the preservation is of course out of question of preserving all the sites concealing of the vestiges.  It’s imperative to preserve the sites major and necessary to study the others before any destruction.  It is also advisable to ensure the conservation of the vestiges put at the day:  they are intended to enter public collections (museums), where they are then accessible to the researchers

Information sharing : The diffusion of the results of the excavations and the archaeological
studies constitutes an essential stage of the work of the archaeologist.  The ministry for the Culture and the Communication took this route by the means of a policy of edition and exposures in order to sensitize the public with archaeological research.

1) The dating with carbon-14 is a method of measurement of the age of an organic subtance (time passed since the death).  The absolute age limits which can be measured is approximately 50 000 years.  The dating with the carbon-14 is a powerful tool thanks to which them archaeologists dates from the events before indatable, in particular those which are old of more than 6000 years (prehistoric).

2)the archeologists can date object with the style. For exemple in Greece,

It is important to protect archaeological sites. The archaeological sites are unique. Many of the sites are broken. They need protection. The sites have been made by our ancestors. It’s important to protect these sites.

What people should do if they think they have found an artifact: 
When a person finds old objects, he must call to the cityhall. The cityhall can call to an archaeologist. Many sites are found during a construction of a road, building…. All states have laws to protect sites.

Ways in which you can be a protector of the past:
To protect archaeological sites, you must obey the law of protection of archaeological objects. don’t do escavation alone

''Egyptologist''
Egyptologist is the study of old Egypt.
A archaeologist need to work Latin and Greek. He does a archeologist’s school and to choose option Egyptologist.

[[Archaeologist under water]]

Subaqueous archaeology is research and the study of the vestiges in order to know the human activities of last and is practised in interior water:·
 artificial often closed:  wells, cisterns, underground conduits drowned,·
natural:  lakes, rivers, ponds, peat bogs, marshes, karst, and ground water

The aquatic environment is very favorable to archaeology:
water protects from the destructive human actions,
the organic and mineral elements safe from oxygen, the light and the biological organizations are preserved often perfectly.
A archaeologist under water need do a  school of archaeology an to practise swimming under water.

[[Restorer]] 
They need to do history of art and after to work in “conservation and restoration of the object”
they restore especially object into ceramic and sometimes out of glass exits of the archeologic excavation

= Some Examples of Vectors =


== Displacement ==

Imagine you walked from your house to the shops along a winding path through the veld. Your route is shown in blue in Figure 3.1. Your sister also walked from the house to the shops, but she decided to walk along the pavements. Her path is shown in red and consisted of two straight stretches, one after the other.

{| 
|-

|Figure 3.1: Illustration of Displacement
|}


Although you took very different routes, both you and your sister walked from the house to the shops. The overall effect was the same! Clearly the shortest path from your house to the shops is along the straight line between these two points. The length of this line and the direction from the start point (the house) to the end point (the shops) forms a very special vector known as ''' displacement'''. Displacement is assigned the symbol &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}&lt;/math&gt;

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Displacement'' is defined as the magnitude and direction of the straight line joining one's starting point to one's final point.}}

'''OR'''

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Displacement'' is a vector with direction pointing from some initial (starting) point to some final (end) point and whose magnitude is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the end point.}}

'''(NOTE TO SELF: choose one of the above)'''

In this example both you and your sister had the same displacement. This is shown as the black arrow in Figure 3.1. Remember displacement is not concerned with the actual path taken. It is only
concerned with your start and end points. It tells you the length of the straight-line path between  your start and end points and the direction from start to finish. The distance travelled is the length of the path followed and is a scalar (just a number). Note that the magnitude of the displacement need not be the same as the distance travelled. In this case the magnitude of your displacement would be considerably less than the actual length of the path you followed through the veld!

==Velocity==

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Velocity'' is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.}}

The terms ''rate of change'' and ''with respect to'' are ones we will use often and it is important that you understand what they mean. Velocity describes how much displacement changes for a certain change in time.

We usually denote a change in something with the symbol &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; (the Greek letter Delta). You have probably seen this before in maths &amp;mdash; the gradient of a straight line is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;. The gradient is just how much ''y'' changes for a certain change in ''x''. In other words it is just the rate of change of ''y'' with respect to ''x''. This means that velocity must be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v}=\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{s}}{\Delta t} =\frac{\overrightarrow{s}_{final}-\overrightarrow{s}_{initial}}{t_{final}-t_{initial}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''(NOTE TO SELF: This is actually average velocity. For instantaneous''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;'s 
'''change to differentials. Explain that if''' &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; '''is large then we have average velocity else for infinitesimal time interval instantaneous!)'''

What then is speed? Speed is how quickly something is moving. How is it different from velocity? Speed is not a vector. It does not tell you which direction something is moving, only how fast. Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector '''(NOTE TO SELF: instantaneous speed is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity.... not true of averages!)'''.

Consider the following example to test your understanding of the differences between velocity and speed.

===Worked Example 3: Speed and Velocity===

'''Question:''' A man runs around a circular track of radius 100''m''. It takes him 120''s'' to complete a revolution of the track. If he runs at constant speed, calculate:

#his speed,
#his instantaneous velocity at point A,
#his instantaneous velocity at point B,
#his average velocity between points A and B,
#his average velocity during a revolution.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors3.png|197px|]]

'''Answer:'''&lt;br&gt;
:1. To determine the man's speed, we need to know the distance he travels and how long it takes. We know it takes &lt;math&gt;120 s&lt;/math&gt; to complete one revolution of  the track.   What distance is one revolution of the track? We know the track is a circle and we know its radius, so we can determine the perimeter or distance around the circle. We start with the equation for the circumference of a circle:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}C &amp; =&amp; 2\pi r \\ &amp; = &amp; 2\pi (100m) \\&amp; = &amp; 628.3\;m.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:2. Now that we have distance and time, we can determine speed. We know that speed is distance covered per unit time. If we divide the distance covered by the time it took, we will know how much distance was covered for every unit of time.
 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} v &amp; = &amp;\frac{Distance\ travelled}{time\ taken} \\ &amp; = &amp; \frac{628.3m}{120s} \\ &amp; = &amp; 5.23\ m.s^{-1} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:3. Consider point A in the diagram:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors4.png|192px|]] 

We know which way the man is running around the track, and we know his speed. His velocity at point A will be his speed (the magnitude of the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the direction of his velocity). He is moving at the instant that he arrives at A, as indicated in the diagram below.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors5.png|195px|]]

His velocity vector will be &lt;math&gt;5.23\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; West.

:4. Consider point B in the diagram:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors6.png|197px|]]

:We know which way the man is running around the track, and we know his speed. His velocity at point B will be his speed (the magnitude of the velocity) plus his direction of motion (the direction of his velocity). He is moving at the instant that he arrives at B, as indicated in the diagram below.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors7.png|195px|]]

:His velocity vector will be &lt;math&gt;5.23\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; South.

&lt;!-- :'''(NOTE TO SELF: add this here to further stress the difference between average and instantaneous velocities, as well as the difference between magnitude of average velocity and average speed!)''' [Student suggestion to principle editor: --&gt;

:4. So, now, what is the man's average velocity between Point A and Point B?
As he runs around the circle, he changes direction constantly. (Imagine a series of vector arrows pointing out from the circle, one for each step he takes.) If you add up all these directions and find the average it turns out to be ...Right. South west. And, notice that if you just looked for the average between his velocity at Point A and at Point B, that comes out south west, too. So his average velocity between Point A and Point B is &lt;math&gt;5.23\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; south west.

&lt;!-- :''']''' --&gt;

:5. Now we need to calculate his average velocity over a complete revolution. The definition of average velocity is given earlier and requires that you know the total displacement and the total time. The total displacement for a revolution is given by the vector from the initial point to the final point. If the man runs in a circle, then he ends where he started. This means the vector from his initial point to his final point has zero length. A calculation of his average velocity follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \overrightarrow{v}&amp;=&amp;\frac{\Delta\overrightarrow{s}}{\Delta t} \\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{0m}{120s} \\ &amp;=&amp; 0\ m.s^{-1} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Remember:''' Displacement can be zero even when distance is not!}}

==Acceleration==
{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' ''Acceleration'' is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.}}

Acceleration is also a vector. Remember that velocity was the rate of change of displacement with respect to time so we expect
the velocity and acceleration equations to look very similar. In fact:

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{a}=\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{v}}{\Delta t} =\frac{\overrightarrow{v}_{final}-\overrightarrow{v}_{initial}}{t_{final}-t_{initial}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(3.2)
|}

'''(NOTE TO SELF: average and instantaneous distinction again! expand further &amp;mdash; what does it mean?)'''

Acceleration will become very important later when we consider forces.

== Force ==

Imagine that you and your friend are pushing a cardboard box kept on a smooth floor. Both of you are equally strong. Can you tell me in which direction the box will move ? Probably not. Because I have not told you in which direction each of you are pushing the box. If both of you push it towards north, the box would move northwards. If you push it towards north and you friend pushes it towards east, it would move north-eastwards. If you two push it in opposite directions, it wouldn't move at all !

Thus in dealing with force applied on any object, it is equally important to take into account the direction of the force, as the magnitude. This is the case with all vectors.</text>

= Mathematical Properties of Vectors =

Vectors are mathematical objects and we will use them to describe physics in the language of mathematics. However, first we need to
understand the mathematical properties of vectors (e.g. how they add and subtract).

We will now use arrows representing displacements to illustrate the properties of vectors. Remember that displacement is just one example
of a vector. We could just as well have decided to use forces to illustrate the properties of vectors.

== Addition of Vectors ==

If we define a displacement vector as 2 steps in the forward direction and another as 3 steps in the forward direction then adding them together would mean moving a total of 5 steps in the forward direction. Graphically, this can be seen by first following the first vector two steps forward, and then following the second one three steps forward: 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors8.png|598px|]]

We add the second vector at the end of the first vector, since this is where we now are after the first vector has acted. The vector from the tail of the first vector (the starting point) to the head of the last (the end point) is then the sum of the vectors. This is the tail-to-head method of vector addition.

The order in which you add vectors does not matter. In the example above, if you decided to first go 3 steps forward and then another 2 steps forward, the end result would still be 5 steps forward.

The final answer when adding vectors is called the resultant.

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' The ''resultant'' of a number of vectors is the single vector whose effect is the same as the individual vectors acting together.}}

In other words, the individual vectors can be replaced by the resultant &amp;mdash; the overall effect is the same. If vectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt; have a resultant &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{R}&lt;/math&gt;, this can be represented mathematically as,  &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{R} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider some more examples of vector addition using displacements. The arrows tell you how far to move and in what direction. Arrows to the right correspond to steps forward, while arrows to the left correspond to steps backward. Look at all of the examples below and check them. 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors9.png|395px|]]

[[Image:fhsst_vectors10.png|395px|]]

Let us test the first one. It says one step forward and then another step forward is the same as an arrow twice as long &amp;mdash; two steps forward.

It is possible that you end up back where you started. In this case the net result of what you have done is that you have gone nowhere
(your start and end points are at the same place). In this case, your resultant displacement is a vector with length zero units. We use the symbol &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{0}&lt;/math&gt; to denote such a vector: 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors11.png|395px|]]


[[Image:fhsst_vectors12.png|395px|]]

Check the following examples in the same way. Arrows up the page can be seen as steps left and arrows down the page as steps right.

Try a couple to convince yourself!

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors13.png|137px|]]

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors16.png|137px|]]
|}

It is important to realise that the directions aren't special &amp;mdash; ''forward and backwards'' or ''left and right'' are treated in the same way. The same is true of any set of parallel directions: 

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors17.png|241px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors18.png|241px|]]

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors19.png|173px|]]
|}

In the above examples the separate displacements were parallel to one another. However the same ''tail-to-head'' technique of vector addition can be applied to vectors in any direction. 

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors20.png|214px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors21.png|214px|]]
|}


[[Image:fhsst_vectors22.png|214px|]]

Now you have discovered one use for vectors; describing resultant displacement &amp;mdash; how far and in what direction you have travelled after a series of movements.

Although vector addition here has been demonstrated with displacements, all vectors behave in exactly the same way. Thus, if given a number of forces are acting on a body, you can use the same method to determine the resultant force acting on the body. We will return to vector addition in more detail later.

== Subtraction of Vectors ==

What does it mean to subtract a vector? Well this is really simple: if we have 5 apples and we subtract 3 apples, we have only 2 apples left. Now lets work in steps &amp;mdash; if we take 5 steps forward, and then subtract 3 steps forward, we are left with only two steps forward:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors23.png|598px|]]

What have we done? You originally took 5 steps forward but then you took 3 steps back. That backward displacement would be represented by an arrow pointing to the left (backwards) with length 3. The net result of adding these two vectors is 2 steps forward:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors24.png|598px|]]

'''Thus, subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite direction''' (i.e. subtracting 3 steps forwards is the same as adding 3 steps backwards).

This suggests that in this problem, arrows to the right are positive, and arrows to the left are negative. More generally, vectors in  opposite directions differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as positive, then vectors acting down are negative). Thus, changing the sign of a vector simply reverses its direction:

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors25.png|168px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors26.png|168px|]]
|}


{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors27.png|146px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors28.png|146px]]
|}

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors29.png|105px|]]
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | [[Image:fhsst_vectors30.png|105px|]]
|}

In mathematical form, subtracting &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt; from  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt; gives a new vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{c}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{c} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{b} - \overrightarrow{a}\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{b} + (-\overrightarrow{a})\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


This clearly shows that subtracting vector &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as adding &lt;math&gt;(-\overrightarrow{a})&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{b}&lt;/math&gt;. Look at the following examples of vector subtraction.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors31.png|275px]]

== Scalar Multiplication ==

What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar (an ordinary number)?

Going back to normal multiplication we know that &lt;math&gt;2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt; is just 2 groups of 2 added together to give 4. We can adopt a similar approach
to understand how vector multiplication works.

= Techniques of Vector Addition =

Now that you have been acquainted with the mathematical properties of
vectors, we return to vector addition in more detail. There are a number of
techniques of vector addition. These techniques
fall into two main categories- graphical and algebraic techniques.

== Graphical Techniques ==

Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote
individual vectors and their resultants. We next discuss the two primary
graphical techniques, the tail-to-head technique and the parallelogram
method.

===The Tail-to-head Method===

In describing the mathematical properties of vectors we used
displacements and the tail-to-head graphical method of vector addition
as an illustration. In the tail-to-head method of vector addition the
following strategy is followed:

* Choose a scale and include a reference direction.
* Choose any of the vectors to be summed and draw it as an arrow in the correct direction and of the correct length- remember to put an arrowhead on the end to denote its direction.
* Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the arrowhead of the first vector in the correct direction and of the correct length.
* Continue until you have drawn each vector- each time starting from the head of the previous vector. In this way, the vectors to be added are drawn one after the other tail-to-head.
* The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last. Its magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 4 Tail-to-Head Graphical Addition I ====

'''Question:''' A ship leaves harbour H and sails 6''km'' north to port A. From here the ship travels 12''km'' east to port B, before sailing 5.5''km''
south-west to port C. Determine the ship's resultant displacement using the tail-to-head technique of vector addition.


'''Answer:'''

Now, we are faced with a practical issue: in this problem the displacements are too large to draw them their actual length! Drawing
a 2''km'' long arrow would require a very big book. Just like cartographers (people who draw maps), we have to choose a scale. The
choice of scale depends on the actual question- you should choose a scale such that your vector diagram fits the page. Before choosing a
scale one should always draw a rough sketch of the problem. In a rough sketch one is interested in the approximate shape of the vector diagram.

Step 1 : 

Let us draw a rough sketch of the situation

In a rough sketch one should include all of the information given in the problem. All of the magnitudes of the displacements are shown and
a compass has been included as a reference direction.

Step 2 : 

Next we choose a scale for our vector diagram. It is clear from the rough sketch that choosing a
scale where 1''cm'' represents 1''km'' (scale: 1''cm'' = 1''km'') would be a good choice in this
problem )- the diagram will then take up a good fraction of an A4 page. We now start the accurate construction.

Step 3 : 

'''Construction Step 1''': Starting at the harbour H we draw the first vector 6''cm'' long in the direction north (remember in the 
diagram 1''cm'' represents 1''km''): 


'''Construction Step 2''': Since the ship is now at port A we draw the second vector 12''cm'' long starting from this point in the direction east:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors33.png|644px|]]

'''Construction Step 3''': Since the ship is now at port B we draw the third vector 5.5''cm'' long starting from this point in the direction
south-west. A protractor is required to measure the angle of 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors34.png|644px|]]

'''Construction Step 4''': As a final step we draw the resultant displacement from the starting point (the harbour H) to the end point (port C). 
We use a ruler to measure the length of this arrow and a protractor to determine its direction

[[Image:fhsst_vectors35.png|644px|]]

Step 4 : 

We now use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to the actual displacement in the problem. Since we have
chosen a scale of 1''cm'' = 1''km'' in this problem the resultant has a magnitude of 8.38 &amp;nbsp; ''km''. The direction can be specified in terms of the
angle measured either as 75.4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; east of north or on a bearing of 75.4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

Step 5 : 

Now we can quote the final answer: The resultant displacement of the ship is 8.38 &amp;nbsp; ''km'' on a bearing of 75.4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;!

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 5 Tail-to-Head Graphical Addition II====

'''Question:''' A man walks 40 &amp;nbsp; ''m'' East, then 30 &amp;nbsp; ''m'' North.

a) What was the total distance he walked?

b) What is his resultant displacement?


'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

What distance did the man travel? In the first part of his journey he traveled 40 &amp;nbsp; ''m'' and in the second part he traveled 30 &amp;nbsp; ''m''. This
gives us a total distance traveled of &lt;math&gt;40+30=70\ m&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2 : 

What is his resultant displacement? The man's resultant displacement is the '''vector'''
from where he started to where he ended. It is the sum of his two separate displacements. We will use the tail-to-head method of
accurate construction to find this vector. Firstly, we draw a rough sketch:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors36.png|327px|]]

Step 3 : 

Next we choose a scale suitable for the problem. A scale of 1''cm'' represents 5''m'' (1''cm'' = 5''m'') is a good choice here. Now we can
begin the process of construction. 

Step 4 : 

We draw the first displacement as an arrow 8''cm'' long (according to the scale &lt;math&gt;8cm = 8\times5m = 40m&lt;/math&gt;) in the direction east:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors37.png|468px|]]

Step 5 : 

Starting from the head of the first vector we draw the second displacement as an arrow 6''cm'' long (according to the scale &lt;math&gt;6cm = 6\times5m = 30m&lt;/math&gt;) in the direction north:&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:fhsst_vectors38.png|468px|]]

Step 6 : 

Now we connect the starting point to the end point and
measure the length and direction of this arrow (the resultant)

Step 7 : 

Finally we use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to the actual magnitude of the resultant
displacement. According to the chosen scale 1''cm'' = 5''m''. Therefore 10''cm'' represents 50''m''. The resultant
displacement is then 50''m'' 36.9&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; north of east.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===The Parallelogram Method===

When needing to find the resultant of two vectors another graphical technique can be applied- the parallelogram method. The following
strategy is employed:

* Choose a scale and a reference direction.
* Choose either of the vectors to be added and draw it as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction.
* Draw the second vector as an arrow of the correct length in the correct direction '''from the &lt;font id=&quot;txt3991&quot;&gt;tail of the first vector'''.
* Complete the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.
* The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. Its magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 6====
Parallelogram Method of Graphical Addition I

'''Question:''' A force of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 N is applied to a block in a horizontal direction. A second force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 N is applied to the object
at an angle of 30&amp;deg; above the horizontal.


[[Image:fhsst_vectors39.png|191px|]]

Determine the resultant force acting on the block using the parallelogram method of accurate construction.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Firstly we make a rough sketch of the vector diagram:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors40.png|304px|]]

Step 2 : 

Now we choose a suitable scale. In this problem a scale of 1 cm = 0.5 N would be appropriate, since then the vector diagram would take up a reasonable fraction of the page. We can now begin the accurate scale diagram.

Step 3 : 

Let us draw ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; first. According to the scale it has length 10 cm:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors41.png|626px|]]

Step 4 : 

Next we draw ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. According to the scale it has length 8 cm. We make use of a protractor to draw this vector at 30° to the horizontal:


[[Image:fhsst_vectors42.png|630px|]]

Step 5 : 

Next we complete the parallelogram and draw the diagonal:

''' RIAAN NOTE: Image missing img155.png PDF page 51'''
[[Image:fhsst_vectors43.png|630px|]]

Step 6 : 

Finally we use the scale to convert the measured length into the actual magnitude. Since 1 cm = 0.5  N, 17.4 cm represents 8.7 N. Therefore the resultant force is 8.7 N at 13.3° above the horizontal.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

The parallelogram method is restricted to the addition of just two vectors. However, it is arguably the most intuitive way of adding two forces acting at a point.

== Algebraic Addition and Subtraction of Vectors ==

===Vectors in a Straight Line===

Whenever you are faced with adding vectors acting in a straight line (i.e. some directed left and some right, or some acting
up and others down) you can use a very simple algebraic technique:

* Choose a positive direction. As an example, for situations involving displacements in the directions west and east, you might choose west as your positive direction. In that case, displacements east are negative.
* Next simply add (or subtract) the vectors with the appropriate signs.
* As a final step the direction of the resultant should be included in words (positive answers are in the positive direction, while negative resultants are in the negative direction).

Let us consider a couple of examples.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 7====
Adding vectors algebraically I

'''Question:''' A tennis ball is rolled towards a wall which is 10''m'' away to the right. If after striking the wall the ball rolls
a further 2.5''m'' along the ground to the left, calculate algebraically the ball's resultant displacement.

(NOTE TO SELF: PGCE suggest a `more real looking' diagram, followed by a diagram one would draw to solve the problem (like our existing one
with the positive direction shown as an arrow))

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Let us draw a picture of the situation:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors44.png|349px|]]

Step 2 : 

We know that the resultant displacement of the ball ( &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant}&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the sum of the ball's separate 
displacements (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_2&lt;/math&gt; ):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{s}_{1} + \overrightarrow{s}_{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since the motion of the ball is in a straight line (i.e. the ball moves left and right), we can use the method of algebraic addition
just explained.

Step 3 : 

First we choose a positive direction. Let's make to the right the positive direction. This means that to the left becomes the
negative direction.

Step 4 : 

With right positive:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{1} &amp; = &amp; +10.0m \\&amp; and &amp; \\\overrightarrow{s}_{2} &amp; = &amp; -2.5m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Next we simply add the two displacements to give the resultant:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant} &amp; = &amp; (+10m) + (-2.5m) \\&amp; = &amp; (+7.5)m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Finally, in this case &lt;u&gt;right&lt;/u&gt; means positive so:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}_{resultant} &amp; = &amp; 7.5m \rm {\ to \ the \ right}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Let us consider an example of vector subtraction.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 8====
Subtracting vectors algebraically I

'''Question:''' Suppose that a tennis ball is thrown horizontally towards a wall at 3''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to the right. After striking the wall,
the ball returns to the thrower at 2''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Determine the change in velocity of the ball.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Remember that velocity is a vector. The change in the velocity of the ball is equal to the difference between the ball's initial and final velocities:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{v} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{v}_{final} -\overrightarrow{v}_{initial}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since the ball moves along a straight line (i.e. left and right), we can use the algebraic technique of vector subtraction just discussed.

Step 2 : 

Let's make to the right the positive direction. This means that to the left becomes the negative direction.

Step 3 : 

With right positive:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v}_{initial} &amp; = &amp; +3m.s^{-1} \\&amp; and &amp; \\\overrightarrow{v}_{final} &amp; = &amp; -2m.s^{-1}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Thus, the change in velocity of the ball is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{v} &amp; = &amp; (-2m.s^{-1}) - (+3m.s^{-1}) \\&amp; = &amp; (-5)m.s^{-1}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Remember that in this case ''right'' means positive so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{v} &amp; = &amp; 5m.s^{-1} \rm \textbf{\ to \ the \ \emph{left}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

Remember that the technique of addition and subtraction just discussed can only be applied to vectors acting along a straight line.

===A More General Algebraic technique===

In worked example 3 the tail to head method of accurate construction was used to determine the
resultant displacement of a man who travelled first east and then north. However, the man's resultant can be calculated without drawing an
accurate scale diagram. Let us revisit this example. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 9====
An Algebraic solution to Worked Example 3

'''Question:''' A man walks 40  ''m'' East, then 30 &amp;nbsp;''m'' North.

# Calculate the man's resultant displacement.


'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

As before, the rough sketch looks as follows:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors45.png|328px|]]

Step 2 : 

Note that the triangle formed by his separate displacement vectors and his resultant displacement vector is a right-angle
triangle. We can thus use Pythogoras' theorem to determine the length of the resultant. If the length of the resultant vector is called
''s'' then:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s^2&amp;=&amp;(40m)^2 + (30m)^2\\s^2&amp;=&amp;2500m^2\\s&amp;=&amp;50m\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 
Now we have the length of the resultant displacement vector but not yet its direction. To determine its direction we calculate the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between the resultant displacement vector and East. 

We can do this using simple trigonometry:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\tan \alpha &amp;=&amp; \frac{opposite}{adjacent}\\\tan \alpha &amp;=&amp; \frac{30}{40}\\\alpha&amp; =&amp; \arctan (0.75) \\\alpha &amp;=&amp; 36.9^o\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Our final answer is then:

* Resultant Displacement: 50 m at 36.9&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; North of East

This is exactly the same answer we arrived at after drawing a scale diagram!

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

In the previous example we were able to use simple trigonometry to calculate a man's resultant displacement. This was possible since the
man's directions of motion were perpendicular (north and east). Algebraic techniques, however, are not limited to cases where the vectors to be
combined are along the same straight line or at right angles to one another. The following example illustrates this.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 10====
Further example of vector addition by calculation

'''Question:''' A man walks from point A to point B which is 12''km'' away on a bearing of 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. From point B the man walks a
further 8''km'' east to point C. Calculate the man's resultant displacement.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 
Let us begin by drawing a rough sketch of the situation

'''RIAAN NOTE: Image on page 56 is missing'''
[[Image:fhsst_vectors46.png|630px|]]

&lt;math&gt;B\hat{A}F = 45^o&lt;/math&gt; since the man walks initially on a bearing of 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.Then, &lt;math&gt;A\hat{B}G = B\hat{A}F = 45^o&lt;/math&gt; (alternate angles parallel lines). Both of these angles are included in the rough sketch.

Step 2 : 

Now let us calculate the length of the resultant (AC). Since we know both the lengths of &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; and the included angle &lt;math&gt;A\hat{{B}}C&lt;/math&gt;, we can use
the cosine rule:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}AC^2 &amp;=&amp; AB^2 +BC^2 -2\cdot AB\cdot BC\cos(A\hat{B}C)\\&amp;=&amp; (12)^2 + (8)^2 -2\cdot (12)(8)\cos(135^o)\\&amp;=&amp; 343.8\\AC &amp;=&amp; 18.5\ km\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Next we use the sine rule to determine the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{\sin\theta}{8}&amp;=&amp;\frac{\sin 135^0}{18.5}\\\sin\theta &amp;=&amp; \frac{8\times\sin 135^o}{18.5}\\\theta &amp;=&amp; \arcsin(0.3058)\\\theta &amp;=&amp; 17.8^o\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;F\hat{A}C=62.8^o&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4 : 

Our final answer is then:

* Resultant Displacement: 18.5''km'' on a bearing of 62.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

= Components of Vectors =

In the discussion of vector addition we saw that a number of vectors acting together can be combined to give a single vector (the resultant). In
much the same way a single vector can be broken down into a number of vectors which when added give that original vector. These
vectors which sum to the original are called '''components''' of the original vector. The process of breaking a vector into its components
is called '''resolving into components'''.

While summing a given set of vectors gives just one answer (the resultant), a single vector can be resolved into infinitely many sets
of components. In the diagrams below the same black vector is resolved into different pairs of components. These components are shown in red.
When added together the red vectors give the original black vector (i.e. the original vector is the resultant of its components).

[[Image:fhsst_vectors47.png|241px|]]

In practice it is most useful to resolve a vector into components which are at right angles to one another.

==Worked Example 11==
Resolving a vector into components

'''Question:''' A motorist undergoes a displacement of 250''km'' in a direction 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; north of east. Resolve this displacement into
components in the directions north (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_N&lt;/math&gt; and east (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{s}_E&lt;/math&gt;). 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Firstly let us draw a rough sketch of the original vector

[[Image:fhsst_vectors48.png|286px|]]

Step 2 : 

Next we resolve the displacement into its components north and east. Since these directions are orthogonal to one another, the
components form a right-angled triangle with the original displacement as its hypotenuse:

[[Image:fhsst_vectors49.png|289px|]]

Notice how the two components acting together give the original vector as their resultant.

Step 3 : 

Now we can use trigonometry to calculate the magnitudes of the components of the original displacement:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s_N &amp;=&amp; 250\sin30^o\\&amp;=&amp; 125\ km\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s_E &amp;=&amp; 250\cos30^o\\&amp;=&amp; 216.5\ km\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Remember ''s''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; are the magnitudes of the components- they are in the directions north and east respectively.

== Block on an incline ==

As a further example of components let us consider a block of mass ''m'' placed on a frictionless surface inclined at some angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to 
the horizontal. The block will obviously slide down the incline, but what causes this motion?

The forces acting on the block are its weight ''mg'' and the normal force ''N'' exerted by the surface on the object. These two forces are
shown in the diagram below.

[[Image:fhsst_vectors50.png|444px|]]

Now the object's weight can be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the inclined surface. These components are shown as
red arrows in the diagram above and are at right angles to each other. The components have been drawn acting from the same
point. Applying the parallelogram method, the two components of the block's weight sum to the weight vector.

To find the components in terms of the weight we can use trigonometry:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W_{\|} &amp;=&amp; mg\sin\theta\\W_{\perp} &amp;=&amp; mg\cos\theta\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The component of the weight perpendicular to the slope ''W''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; exactly balances the normal force ''N'' exerted by the surface. The parallel component, however, &lt;math&gt;W_{\|}&lt;/math&gt; is unbalanced and causes the block to slide down the slope.

== Vector addition using components ==

In Figure 3.3 two vectors are added in a slightly different way to the methods discussed so far. It might look
a little like we are making more work for ourselves, but in the long run things will be easier and we
will be less likely to go wrong. 

In Figure 3.3 the primary vectors we are adding are represented by solid lines and are the same vectors as those added in Figure 3.2 using the less complicated looking method. 

{| 
|- 
| [[Image:fhsst_vectors51.png|363px|]]
|+ '''Figure 3.2:''' An example of two vectors being added to give a resultant
|}

Each vector can be broken down into a component in the ''x''-direction and one in the ''y''-direction. These components are two
vectors which when added give you the original vector as the resultant. Look at the red vector in figure 3.3. If you add up the two red dotted ones in the ''x''-direction and ''y''-direction
you get the same vector. For all three vectors we have shown their respective components as dotted lines in the same colour.

But if we look carefully, addition of the ''x'' components of the two original vectors gives the ''x'' component of the resultant. The same applies to
the ''y'' components. So if we just added all the components together we would get the same answer! This is another important property of vectors.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 12===
Adding Vectors Using Components

'''Question:''' Lets work through the example shown in Figure 3.3 to determine the resultant.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

The first thing we must realise is that the order that we add the vectors does not matter. Therefore, we can work through the vectors to be added in any order.

Step 2 : 

Let us start with the bottom vector. If you are told that this vector has a length of 5.385 units and an angle of 21.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to the
horizontal then we can find its components. We do this by using known trigonometric ratios. First we find the vertical or ''y'' component:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sin \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{y}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\sin (21.8) &amp; = &amp;\frac{y}{5.385}\\y &amp; = &amp; 5.385 \sin (21.8)\\y &amp; = &amp; 2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:fhsst_vectors53.png|331px|]]

Secondly we find the horizontal or ''x'' component:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\cos \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{x}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\cos (21.8) &amp; = &amp;\frac{x}{5.385}\\x &amp; = &amp; 5.385 \cos (21.8)\\x &amp; = &amp; 5\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We now know the lengths of the sides of the triangle for which our vector is the hypotenuse. If you look at these sides we can assign
them directions given by the dotted arrows. Then our original red vector is just the sum of the two dotted vectors (its components). When we try to
find the final answer we can just add all the dotted vectors because they would add up to the two vectors we want to add.

Step 3 : 

Now we move on to considering the second vector. The green vector has a length of 5 units and a direction of 53.13 degrees to the
horizontal so we can find its components.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sin \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{y}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\sin (53.13) &amp; = &amp;\frac{y}{5}\\y &amp; = &amp; 5 \sin (53.13)\\y &amp; = &amp; 4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:fhsst_vectors54.png|210px|]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\cos \theta &amp; = &amp; \frac{x}{\mbox{hypotenuse}} \\\cos (53.13) &amp; = &amp;\frac{x}{5}\\x &amp; = &amp; 5 \cos (53.13)\\x &amp; = &amp; 3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we have all the components. If we add all the ''x''-components then we will have the ''x''-component of the resultant vector. Similarly if
we add all the ''y''-components then we will have the ''y''-component of the resultant vector.

The ''x''-components of the two vectors are 5 units right and then 3 units right. This gives us a final ''x''-component of 8 units right.

The ''y''-components of the two vectors are 2 units up and then 4 units up. This gives us a final ''y''-component of 6 units up.

Step 5 : 

Now that we have the components of the resultant, we can use Pythagoras' theorem to determine the length of the resultant. Let us call the length of the hypotenuse ''l'' and we can calculate its
value 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}l^2&amp;=&amp;(6)^2 + (8)^2\\l^2&amp;=&amp;100\\l&amp;=&amp;10.\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[[Image:fhsst_vectors55.png|512px|]]

The resultant has length of 10 units so all we have to do is calculate its direction. We can specify the direction as
the angle the vectors makes with a known direction. To do this you only need to visualize the vector as starting at the origin of
a coordinate system. We have drawn this explicitly below and the angle we will calculate is labeled &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Image:fhsst_vectors56.png|467px|]]

Using our known trigonometric ratios we can calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\tan \alpha &amp; = &amp; \frac{6}{8} \\\alpha &amp; = &amp; \arctan \frac{6}{8}\\\alpha &amp; = &amp; 36.8^o.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Our final answer is a resultant of 10 units at 36.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to the positive ''x''-axis.</text>

= What is a force? =
{{wikipedia|Force}}
The simplest way to describe force is to say that it is a `push' or a `pull'. The push or pull on an object may cause either deformation or may change the state of motion of the object under consideration. The harder you 'push' or 'pull', the more force you are applying.

If we leave aside the deformation aspects, then force can be considered to produce change in the state of the motion of the object i.e. velocity. We have, though, experienced in real life that a 'push' or 'pull' does not always manifest in the change of motion. The reason is simple. A change in the state of motion requires a net force. For example, if the force is great enough to overcome friction
the object being pushed or pulled will move. So long as the forces on an object are balanced (i.e. net force is zero), the state of motion described by &quot;velocity&quot; will remain same.  


In fact, the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the ''net'' force acting on it. The word ''net'' is important- forces are vectors and
what matters in any situation is the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object.

The unit of force is the newton (symbol N)


|Force was first described by Archimedes. Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC - 212 BC), was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, physicist and engineer. He was killed by a Roman soldier during the sack of the city, despite orders from the Roman general, Marcellus, that he was not to be harmed.

= Force diagrams =

The resultant force acting on an object is the vector sum of the set of forces acting on that
one object. It is very important to remember that we consider all the forces that act on the object under consideration - not the forces that the object might, in turn, apply on other objects.

The easiest way to determine this resultant force is to construct what we call a force diagram. In a force diagram we represent the object by a point and draw all the force vectors connected to that point as arrows. Remember from the  [[FHSST_Physics_Vectors:Vectors|Vectors]] chapter that we use the length of the arrow to indicate the vector's magnitude and the direction of the arrow to show which direction it acts in.

The second step is to rearrange the force vectors so that it is easy to add them together and find the resultant force.

Let us consider an example to get started:

Two people push on a box from opposite sides with a force of 5 N.

[[Image:Fhsst_forces2.png|236px|]]

When we draw the force diagram we represent the box by a dot. The two forces are represented by arrows, with their tails on the dot.

[[Image:Fhsst_forces3.png|151px|]]

See how the arrows point in opposite directions and have the same magnitude (length). This
means that they cancel out and there is no ''net'' force acting on the object.

This result can be obtained algebraically too, since the two forces act along the same line. Firstly we choose a positive direction and then add the two vectors taking their directions into account.

&lt;u&gt;Considering direction towards right as the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{res} &amp;=&amp; (+5\mbox{ N})+(-5\mbox{ N})\\&amp;=&amp; 0N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As you work with more complex force diagrams, in which the forces do not exactly balance, you may notice that sometimes you get a negative answer (e.g. -2 N). What does this mean? Does it mean that we have something which is opposite of the force? No, all it means is that the force acts in the opposite direction to the one that you chose to be positive. You can choose the positive direction to be any way you want, but once you have chosen it you must stick with it.

Once a force diagram has been drawn the techniques of vector addition introduced in the previous chapter can be implemented. Depending on
the situation you might choose to use a graphical technique such as the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method, or else an
algebraic approach to determine the resultant. Since force is a vector, all of these methods apply!

'''Always remember to check your signs'''

==Worked Example 13 Single Force on a block ==

'''Question:''' A block on a frictionless flat surface weighs 100 N. A 75 N force is applied to the block towards the right. What is the net force (or resultant force) on the block?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 
Firstly let us draw a force diagram for the block:

[[Image:Fhsst_forces4.png|151px|]]

'''RIAAN Note image on page 68 is missing'''

Be careful not to forget the two forces perpendicular to the surface. Every object with mass is attracted to the centre of the
earth with a force (the object's weight). However, if this were the only force acting on the block in the vertical direction then the
block would fall through the table to the ground. This does not happen because the table exerts an upward force (the normal force) which
exactly balances the object's weight.

Step 2 : 

Thus, the only unbalanced force is the applied force. This applied force is then the resultant force
acting on the block.</text>

= Equilibrium of Forces =

At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant forces cause objects to accelerate. If an object is stationary or
moving at constant velocity then either:


* no forces are acting on the object, or
* the forces acting on that object are exactly balanced.

A resultant force would cause a stationary object to start moving or an object moving with a given velocity to speed up or
slow down or change direction such that the velocity of the object changes.


In other words, for stationary objects or objects moving with constant velocity, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. The object is said to be
in '''equilibrium'''.

If a resultant force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional force that exactly balances
this resultant. Such a force is called the ''equilibrant'' and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the original resultant
force acting on the object.


 '''Definition:''' The ''equilibrant'' of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium.


As an example of an object in equilibrium, consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below:




Let us draw a force diagram for the object. In the force diagram the object is drawn as a dot and all forces acting on the object are drawn
in the correct directions starting from that dot. In this case, three forces are acting on the object.

Each rope exerts a force on the object in the direction of the rope away from
the object. 

Since the object has mass, it is attracted towards the centre of the earth. This weight is represented
in the force diagram as &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{W}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Since the object is stationary, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. In other words the three force vectors drawn tail-to-head form a
closed triangle:

[In general, when drawn tail-to-head the forces acting on an object in equilibrium form a closed figure with the head of the last vector
joining up with the tail of the first vector. When only three forces act on an object this closed figure is a triangle. This leads to the
'''triangle law for three forces in equilibrium''':

'''Triangle Law for Three Forces in Equilibrium:''' 
Three forces in equilibrium can be represented in magnitude and direction by the three sides of a triangle taken in order.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mreult. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mreult~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

= Newton's Laws of Motion =

Our current laws of motion were discovered by Sir Isaac Newton. It is said that Sir Isaac Newton started to think about the nature of
motion and gravitation after being struck on the head by a falling apple.

Newton discovered 3 laws describing motion:

== First Law ==

Newton's first law basically says that a force has to be applied to an object to make it move or to make it stop. The first part of that statement definitely makes sense.  The only way I can make something move is to have something give it a push.  The second part of that statement might not be quite as easy to just take as fact.  We've all witnessed objects slow down when nobody is pushing them. How then can we say that the only way to stop an object's motion is with a force?  The answer is that there are forces that we don't always see. Most of the time, the force that we don't see is the force of friction.

Friction is the force that resists motion when two things are sliding past one another. To understand what friction is, think about sandpaper. If you try to rub 2 pieces of sandpaper together, it will be hard to get them to slide. This same phenomenon happens between all objects to some degree. This frictional force is what slows objects down or stops their motion. 

== Second Law ==

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' The time rate of change in momentum is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the force. }}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The law is represented in the following basic form (the system of measurement is chosen such that constant of proportionality is 1) :

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = {d(m \mathbf{v}) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The product of mass and velocity i.e. ''m'''''v''' is called the momentum.  The net force on a particle is, thus, equal to rate change of momentum of the particle with time. Generally mass of the object under consideration is constant and thus can be taken out of the derivative :

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m {d(\mathbf{v}) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

{{FHSST Physics/Box|For constant mass, 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Force''' is equal to '''mass''' times '''acceleration'''.  This version of Newton's Second Law of Motion assumes that the mass of the body does not change with time, and as such, does not represent a general mathematical form of the Law.  Consequently, this equation cannot, for example, be applied to the motion of a rocket, which loses its mass (the lost mass is ejected at the rear of the rocket) with the passage of time.

It makes sense that the direction of the  acceleration is in the direction of the resultant force. If you push something
away from you it doesn't move toward you unless of course there is another force acting on the object towards you!

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 16 Newton's Second Law ===

'''Question:''' A block of mass 10&amp;nbsp;kg is accelerating at 2 m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the
magnitude of the net force acting on the block?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given

* the block's mass
* the block's acceleration

all in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

We are asked to find the magnitude of the force applied to the block. Newton's Second Law tells us the relationship between acceleration and force for an object. Since we are only asked for the magnitude we do not need to worry about the directions of the vectors:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Net} &amp;=&amp; ma \\&amp;=&amp; 10\ \mbox{kg} \times 2 \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \\&amp;=&amp; 20\ \mbox{N}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, there must be a net force of 20 N acting on the box.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 17 Newton's Second Law 2===

'''Question:''' A 12 N force is applied in the positive ''x''-direction to a block of mass 100&amp;nbsp;mg resting on a frictionless flat surface. What is the resulting acceleration of the block? 

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given

* the block's mass
* the applied force

but the mass is not in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

Let us begin by converting the mass:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}100 \mbox{ mg} &amp;=&amp; 100 \times 10^{-3} \mbox{ g} = 0.1 \mbox{ g} \\1000 \mbox{ g} &amp;=&amp; 1 \ \mbox{kg} \\1 &amp;=&amp; 1kg\times \frac{1}{1000g} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1kg}{1000g} \\0.1g &amp;=&amp; 0.1g \times 1 \\&amp;=&amp; 0.1g \times \frac{1kg}{1000g} \\&amp;=&amp; 0.0001\ kg \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

We know that net force results in acceleration. Since there is no friction the applied force is the resultant or net force on the
block (refer to the earlier example of the block pushed on the surface of the table). The block will then accelerate in the direction of
this force according to Newton's Second Law.

Step 4 : 

To determine the magnitude of the acceleration:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Res} &amp;=&amp; ma \\12 \mbox{ N} &amp;=&amp; (0.0001 \mbox{ kg})a\\a &amp;=&amp; \frac{12 \mbox{ N}}{0.0001 \mbox{kg}}\\&amp;=&amp; 120000\frac{\mbox{N}}{\mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 120000\frac{\mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2 \cdot \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 120000\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 1.2\times 10^{5}\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From Newton's Second Law the direction of the acceleration is the same as that of the resultant force. The final result is then that the
block accelerates at &lt;math&gt;1.2\times10^{5}\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive x-direction.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

=== Weight and Mass ===

You must have heard people saying ``My weight is'' 60 kg. This is actually correct, though physicists often have difficulty understanding it because it is mass that is measured in kilograms.  This is a different meaning of the word weight from the one used in mechanics, where weight is the force of gravity exerted by the earth on an object with mass:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{weight} = mg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As such, weight is measured in newtons.

If you compare this equation to Newton's Second Law you will see that it looks exactly the same with the ''a'' replaced by ''g''. Thus, when weight is the
only force acting on an object (i.e. when &lt;math&gt;F_{weight}&lt;/math&gt;

''F''&lt;sub&gt;weight&lt;/sub&gt; is the resultant force acting on the object) the object has an acceleration ''g''. Such an object is said to be in free fall. The value for ''g'' is the same for all 
objects (i.e. it is independent of the objects mass):

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}g=9.8 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \approx 10 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}g=9.8 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \approx 10 \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(4.3)
|}

You will learn how to calculate this value from the mass and radius of the earth in Chapter ???. Actually the value of
''g'' varies slightly from place to place on the Earth's surface.

The reason that we often get confused between weight and mass, is that scales measure your weight (in newtons) and then display your mass using the
equation above.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 18 Calculating the resultant and then the acceleration===

'''Question:''' A block (mass 20&amp;nbsp;kg) on a frictionless flat surface has a 45 N force applied to it in the positive x-direction.
In addition a 25 N force is applied in the negative ''x''-direction. What is the resultant force acting on the block and the acceleration of the block? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

We are given

* the block's mass
* Force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 45 N in the positive ''x''-direction
* Force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 25 N in the negative ''x''-direction

all in the correct units.

Step 2 : 

We are asked to determine what happens to the block. We know that net force results in an acceleration. We need to determine the net force acting on the block.

Step 3 : 

Since ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; act along the same straight line, we can apply the algebraic technique of vector addition discussed in the Vectors chapter to determine the resultant force. Choosing the positive ''x''-direction as our positive direction:

&lt;u&gt;Positive x-direction is the positive direction:&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Res}&amp;=&amp; (+45 \ \mbox{N}) + (-25 \mbox{ N}) \\&amp; = &amp; +20 \ \mbox{N} \\&amp;=&amp; 20 \mbox{N}\ in\ the\ positive\ x-direction\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the last step to include the direction of the resultant force in words.
By Newton's Second Law the block will accelerate in the direction of this resultant force.

Step 4 : 

Next we determine the magnitude of the acceleration:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{Res} &amp; =&amp; ma \\20 \mbox{N} &amp;=&amp; (20 \mbox{kg})a\\a &amp;=&amp; \frac{20 \mbox{N}}{20 \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 1\frac{ \mbox{N}}{ \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 1\frac{ \mbox{kg} \cdot  \mbox{m}}{ \mbox{s}^2 \cdot  \mbox{kg}} \\&amp;=&amp; 1\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The final result is then that the block accelerates at &lt;math&gt;1\ \mbox{ m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive x-direction (the same direction as the resultant force).

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 19 Block on incline===

'''Question:''' A block (mass 10&amp;nbsp;kg) is released on an inclined plane.  What is the resulting rate of acceleration of the block if the angle theta is 25 degrees and the coefficient of friction between the block and the plane is 0.25?

[[Image:Fhsst forces11.png|444px|]]

'''Solution:'''

'''Step 1''':
The acceleration of the block will be parallel to the plane, so we break the problem into two parts - forces perpendicular to the plane (which must cancel out since there is no acceleration perpendicular to the plane) and parallel to the plane.

'''Step 2''':
We know that there is no acceleration in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane, or in other words &lt;math&gt;a_{\perp}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore we know that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \\ \sum{F_{\perp}} &amp;=&amp; 0 
\\  N - W_{\perp} &amp;=&amp; 0
\\  N - m \   g \  {\cos \theta} &amp;=&amp; 0
\\ N &amp;=&amp; m \  g \  {\cos \theta} 
\\ &amp;=&amp; (10 \  kg)(9.8 \  {m \over {s^2}}) \  {\cos 25^\circ} 
\\ &amp;=&amp; 88.82 \  N \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 3''':
Summing forces parallel to the plane yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \\ \sum{F_{\|}} &amp;=&amp; m \  g \  {\sin \theta} - \mu \  N 
\\  m a_{\|} &amp;=&amp; m \  g \  {\sin \theta} - \mu \  N 
\\  (10 kg) a_{\|} &amp;=&amp; (10 kg) (9.8 \  {m \over s^2}) \sin 25^\circ - (0.25) \  (88.82 \  N) 
\\ a_{\|} &amp;=&amp; (9.8 \  {m \over s^2}) \  \sin 25^\circ - (0.25) \  {{88.82 \ N} \over {10 \ kg}}
\\ &amp;=&amp; 5.5 \ {m \over {s^2}} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The final result is that the block accelerates down the inclined plane with an acceleration of &lt;math&gt;5.5 \ m \cdot s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Third Law ==

{{FHSST Physics/Box|'''Definition:''' For every force one body applies to another (action) there is always an equal but opposite in direction force another body applies back to the first one (reaction.)}} 

This law is a direct consequence of the [[FHSST Physics Momentum:What properties does momentum have|Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum]].

Newton's Third Law is easy to understand but it can get quite difficult to apply it. An important thing to realise is that the
action and reaction forces can never act on the same object and hence cannot contribute to the same resultant. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 20 Identifying action-reaction Pairs===

'''Question:''' Consider pushing a box on the surface of a rough table.

# Draw a force diagram indicating all of the forces acting ''' on the box'''.
# Identify the reaction force for each of the forces acting on the box.

'''Answer:'''

# The following force diagram shows all of the forces acting on the box

[[Image:Fhsst forces12.png|281px|]]

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

There is an important thing to realise which is related to Newton's Third Law. Think about dropping a stone off a cliff. It falls because the earth exerts a force on it (see Chapter ???) and it doesn't seem like there are any other forces acting. So is Newton's Third Law wrong? No, the reactionary force to the weight of the stone is the force exerted by the stone on the earth. This is illustrated in detail in the next worked example.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 21 Newton's Third Law===

'''Question:''' A stone of mass 0.5&amp;nbsp;kg is accelerating at 10 m·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; towards the earth.

# What is the force exerted by the earth on the stone?
# What is the force exerted by the stone on the earth?
# What is the acceleration of the earth, given that its mass is 5.97 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; kg?

'''Answer:'''

# Step 1 :  We are given

** the stone's mass
** the stone's acceleration (''g'')

# By Newton's Third Law the stone must exert an equal but opposite force on the earth. Hence the stone exerts a force of 5 N towards the stone on the earth.
# We have

** the force acting on the earth
** the Earth's mass

The next two worked examples are quite long and involved but it is very important that you understand the discussion as they illustrate
the importance of Newton's Laws.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 22 Rockets===
'''Question:''' How do rockets accelerate in space? 

'''Answer:'''

* Gas explodes inside the rocket.
* This exploding gas exerts a force on each side of the rocket (as shown in the picture below of the explosion chamber inside the rocket).

[[Image:Fhsst forces17.png|236px|]]

''Note that the forces shown in this picture are representative. With an explosion there will be forces in all directions.''

* Due to the symmetry of the situation, all the forces exerted on the rocket are balanced by forces on the opposite side, except for the force opposite the open side. This force on the upper surface is unbalanced.
* This is therefore the resultant force acting on the rocket and it makes the rocket accelerate forwards.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

==== Systems and External Forces ====

The concepts of a system and an external forces are very important in physics. A system is any collection of objects. If one draws an
imaginary box around such a system then an external force is one that is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example
a car pulling a trailer.

[[Image:Fhsst forces16.png|372px|]]

Concept of system is extremely important. Consider an example of a person holding a load (box) on his head and standing on a platform. 

Now count the forces : 

(i) Box presses the person down 
(ii) The person pushes the box up (reaction to box's weight) 
(iii) Box is pulled down by the earth 
(iv) Earth is pulled up by the box 
(v) Person presses the floor 
(vi) Floor pushes the person up 
(vii) Person is pulled down by earth and (viii) Earth is pulled up by the person. 

Quite a mess. Which ones are internal forces and which ones are external forces? Identification of system comes handy here. We can select the box or the person as a system for analyzing forces or we may even consider box and person together as a single system. Only condition to watch while selecting a system is that all parts of the system should have same acceleration. If two parts are at different accelerations then each of them should be treated as a separate system.</text>

= Examples of Forces Studied Later =

Most of physics revolves around forces. Although there are many different forces we deal with them all in the same way. The methods to find resultants and
acceleration do not depend on the type of force we are considering. 

At first glance, the number of different forces may seem overwhelming - gravity, drag, electrical forces, friction and many others. However, physicists have found that all these forces can be classified into four groups. These are gravitational forces, electromagnetic forces, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. Even better, all the forces that you will come across at school are either gravitational or electromagnetic. Doesn't that make life easy?

== Newtonian Gravity ==

Gravity is the attractive force between two objects due to the mass of the objects. When you throw a ball in the air, its mass and the Earth's mass attract each other, which leads to a force between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth, and the Earth accelerates towards the ball. The movement of the Earth toward the ball is, however, so small that you couldn't possibly measure it.

== Electromagnetic Forces ==

Almost all of the forces that we experience in everyday life are electromagnetic in origin. They have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric forces and magnetic forces were different things. After much work and experimentation, it has been realised that they are actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory.

=== The Electric Force ===

If we have objects carrying electrical charge, which are not moving, then we are dealing with electrostatic forces (Coulomb's Law). This force is actually much stronger than gravity. This may seem strange, since gravity is obviously very powerful, and holding a balloon to the wall seems to be the most impressive thing electrostatic forces have done, but think about it: for gravity to be detectable, we need to have a very large mass nearby. But a balloon rubbed in someone's hair can stick to a wall with a force so strong that it overcomes the force of gravity - with just the charges in the balloon and the wall!

=== Magnetic force ===

The magnetic force is a different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the interaction between moving charges as opposed to the fixed charges involved in Coulomb's Law. 

Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets, compasses, car engines, computer data storage and your hair standing on end. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them around sites.

=== Friction ==

Newton's First Law states that an object moving without a force acting on it will keep moving. Then why does a box sliding on a table stop? The answer is friction. Friction arises from the interaction between the molecules on the bottom of a box with the molecules on a table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin, hence friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. The great part about school physics is that most of the time we are told to neglect friction but it is good to be aware that there is friction in the real world.

Friction is also useful . If there was no friction and you tried to prop a ladder up against a wall, it would simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use friction to maintain their grip on cliffs.

Friction is a force that impedes motion. It is in parallel to the contact surface and acts against the motion of the body.

=== Drag Force ===

This is the force an object experiences while travelling through a medium. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and because of this the air exerts a force on the object. This becomes an important force when you move fast and a lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force a sports car experiences.

The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from high altitudes and if there was no drag force, then they would continue accelerating all the way to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you show, the greater the drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground.</text>

'''Equilibrium''': Objects at rest or moving with constant velocity are in ''equilibrium'' and have a ''zero'' ''resultant force''.

'''Equilibrant''': The ''equilibrant'' of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium.

'''Triangle Law for Forces in Equilibrium''': Three forces in equilibrium can be represented in magnitude and direction by the three sides of a triangle taken in order.

'''Newton's First Law''': Every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless it is made to change its state by the action of an external force.

'''Newton's Second Law''': The resultant force acting on a body results in an acceleration which is in the same direction as the resultant force and is directly proportional to the magnitude of
this force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. 

'''Newton's Third Law''': For every force or action there is an equal but opposite force or reaction.</text>

= What is rectilinear motion? =

Rectilinear motion means motion along a straight line. This is a useful topic to study for learning how to describe the movement of cars along a straight road or of trains along straight railway tracks. In this section you have only two directions to worry about: (1) along the direction of motion, and (2) opposite to the direction of motion.

To illustrate this imagine a train heading east.

If it is accelerating away from the station platform (P), the direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the train's velocity &amp;mdash; east. If it is braking the direction of acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion, i.e. west.</text>

= Speed and Velocity =

Let's take a moment to review our definitions of velocity and speed by looking at the worked example below:

==Worked Example 23 Speed and Velocity==

[[Image:fhsst_rectmot2.png|263px|]]

'''Question:''' A cyclist moves from A through B to C in 10 seconds. Calculate both his speed and his velocity.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the distance between A and B
* the distance between B and C
* the total time for the cyclist to go from A through B to C

all in the correct units! 

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the average speed and the average velocity of the cyclist.

His speed - a scalar - will be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{30m+40m}{10s}\\&amp;=&amp;7\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since velocity is a vector we will first need to find the resultant displacement of the cyclist. His velocity will be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v}=\frac{\overrightarrow{s}}{t}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



The total displacement is the vector from A to C, and this is just the resultant of the two displacement vectors, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s} = \overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using the [[Wikipedia:Pythagorean theorem|rule of Pythagoras]]:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s} &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{{(30m)}^2+{(40m)}^2}\\&amp;=&amp; 50m \ in \ the \ direction \ from \ A \ to \ C\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;font size=+1&gt;&amp;#x2234;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v} &amp;=&amp;\frac{50\ \mbox{m}}{10\ \mbox{s}}\\&amp;=&amp; 5\ \frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}} \ in\ the \ direction \ from \ A \ to \ C\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

For this cyclist, his velocity is not the same as his speed because there has been a change in the direction of his motion. If the cyclist traveled directly from A to C ''without'' passing through B his speed would be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v &amp;=&amp; \frac{50m}{10s}\\&amp;=&amp; 5 \frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and his velocity would be

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v} &amp;=&amp; \frac{50m}{10s}\\&amp;=&amp; 5 \frac{m}{s} \ in \ the\ direction \ from \ A \ to \ C\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In this case where the cyclist is not undergoing any change of direction (i.e. he is traveling in a straight line) the magnitudes of the speed and the velocity are the same. This is the defining principle of rectilinear motion.

= Graphs =

In physics we often use graphs as important tools for picturing certain concepts. Below are some graphs that help us picture the concepts of displacement, velocity and acceleration.

== Displacement-Time Graphs ==

Below is a graph showing the displacement of the cyclist from A to C:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot3.png|146px|]]

This graphs shows us how, in 10 seconds time, the cyclist has moved from A to C. We know the gradient (slope) of a graph is defined as the change in y divided by the change in x, i.e. 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;. In this graph the gradient of the graph is just &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{s}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; - and this is just the expression for velocity.

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Important:'''
|-
|align=&quot;CENTER&quot; |The area between a velocity-time graph and the `time' axis gives the displacement of the object.
|}

The slope is the same all the way from A to C, so the cyclist's velocity is constant over the entire displacement he travels.
In figure 5.1 are examples of the displacement-time graphs you will encounter.

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot4.png|531px|]]

a) shows the graph for an object stationary over a period of time. The gradient is zero, so the object has zero velocity.

b) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant velocity. You can see that the displacement is increasing as time goes on. The gradient, however, stays constant (remember: its the slope of a straight line), so the velocity is constant. Here the gradient is positive, so the object is moving in the direction we have defined as positive.

c) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant acceleration. You can see that both the displacement and the velocity (gradient of the graph) increase with time. The gradient is increasing with time, thus the velocity is increasing with time and the object is accelerating.

== Velocity-Time Graphs ==
===Uniform acceleration and gradient (slope)===
Look at the velocity-time graph below:

[[File:Fhsst rectmot unif acc.png|219px|]]

This is the velocity-time graph of a cyclist traveling from A to B at a constant acceleration, i.e. with steadily increasing velocity. The gradient (slope) of this graph is just &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{v}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; - and this is just the expression for acceleration. Because the slope is the same at all points on this graph, the acceleration of the cyclist is constant. And the constant acceleration is &lt;math&gt;2 / m/s^2&lt;/math&gt;, or ''2 meters per second per second'' (or ''2 meters per second squared'')

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{slope \ of \ line} &amp;=&amp; \Delta v / \Delta t \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{10 m/s}{5 s} \\&amp;=&amp; 2 \frac{m}{s^2} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Important:'''
|-
|align=&quot;CENTER&quot; |The gradient (slope) on a velocity-time graph equals the acceleration.
|}

===Distance travelled===
Not only can we get the acceleration of an object from its velocity-time graph, but we can also get some idea of the displacement traveled. Look at the graph below:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot5.png|219px|]]

This graph shows an object moving at a constant velocity of 10''m''/''s'' for a duration of 5''s''. The area between the graph and the time
axis (the shaded area) of the above plot will give us the displacement of the object during this time. In this case we just
need to calculate the area of a rectangle with width 5s and height 10m/s

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{area \ of \ rectangle} &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{height} \times \mathrm{width}\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{v} \times t\\&amp;=&amp; 10 \frac{m}{s} \times 5 s\\&amp;=&amp; 50 m\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{s}= \mathrm{displacement}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, here we've shown that an object traveling at 10m/s for 5s has undergone a displacement of 50m.

Here are a couple more velocity-time graphs to get used to:

|Figure 5.2: Some common velocity-time graphs:
|}

In figure 5.2 are examples of the displacement-time graphs you may encounter.

a) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant velocity over a period of time. The gradient is zero, so the object is not accelerating. 

b) shows the graph for an object which is decelerating. You can see that the velocity is decreasing with time. The gradient, however, stays constant (remember: its the slope of a straight line), so the acceleration is constant. Here the gradient is negative, so the object is accelerating in the opposite direction to its motion, hence it is decelerating.

== Acceleration-Time Graphs ==

In this chapter on rectilinear motion we will only deal with objects moving at a constant acceleration, thus all acceleration-time graphs will look like these two:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot7.png|374px|]]

Here is a description of the graphs below:

a) shows the graph for an object which is either stationary or traveling at a constant velocity. Either way, the acceleration is zero over time.

b) shows the graph for an object moving at a constant acceleration. In this case the acceleration is positive - remember that it can also be negative.

We can obtain the velocity of a particle at some given time from an acceleration time graph - it is just given by the area between the
graph and the time-axis. In the graph below, showing an object at a constant positive acceleration, the increase in velocity of the
object after 2 seconds corresponds to the shaded portion. 

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot8.png|214px|]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{area \ of \ rectangle} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{a} \times t \\&amp;=&amp; 5 \frac{m}{s^2} \times 2s\\&amp;=&amp; 10 \frac{m}{s}\\&amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{v}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Its useful to remember the set of graphs below when working on problems. Figure 5.3 shows how displacement, velocity and time relate to each other. Given a displacement-time graph like the one on the left, we can plot the corresponding velocity-time graph by remembering that the slope of a displacement-time graph gives the velocity. Similarly, we can plot an acceleration-time graph from the gradient of the velocity-time graph.

== Worked Examples ==

===Worked Example 24 Relating displacement-, velocity-, and acceleration-time graphs===

'''Question:''' Given the displacement-time graph below, draw the corresponding velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs, and then describe the motion of the object.

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot10.png|377px|]]

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives a displacement-time graph.

Step 2 : What is asked? 

3 things:

# Draw a velocity-time graph
# Draw an acceleration-time graph
# Describe the behaviour of the object


For the first 2 seconds we can see that the displacement remains constant - so the object is not moving, thus it has zero velocity during this time. We can reach this conclusion by another path too: remember that the gradient of a displacement-time graph is the velocity. For the first 2 seconds we can see that the displacement-time graph is a horizontal line, i.e. it has a gradient of zero. Thus the velocity during this time is zero and the object is stationary.

For the next 2 seconds, displacement is increasing with time so the object is moving. Looking at the gradient of the displacement graph we can see that it is not constant. In fact, the slope is getting steeper (the gradient is increasing) as time goes on. Thus, remembering that the gradient of a displacement-time graph is the velocity, the velocity must be increasing with time during this phase.

For the final 2 seconds we see that displacement is still increasing with time, but this time the gradient is constant, so we know that the object is now travelling at a constant velocity, thus the velocity-time graph will be a horizontal line during this stage.

So our velocity-time graph looks like this one below. Because we haven't been given any values on the vertical axis of the displacement-time graph, we cannot figure out what the exact gradients are and hence what the values of the velocity are. In this type of question it is just important to show whether velocities are positive or negative, increasing, decreasing or constant.

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot11.png|377px|]]

Once we have the velocity-time graph its much easier to get the acceleration-time graph as we know that the gradient of a velocity-time graph is the just the acceleration.

For the first 2 seconds the velocity-time graph is horizontal at zero, thus it has a gradient of zero and there is no acceleration during this time. (This makes sense because we know from the displacement time graph that the object is stationary during this time, so it can't be accelerating).

For the next 2 seconds the velocity-time graph has a positive gradient. This gradient is not changing (i.e. its constant) throughout these 2 seconds so there must be a constant positive acceleration.

For the final 2 seconds the object is traveling with a constant velocity. During this time the gradient of the velocity-time graph is once again zero, and thus the object is not accelerating.

The acceleration-time graph looks like this:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot12.png|377px|]]

A brief description of the motion of the object could read something like this: At ''t'' = 0''s'' and object is stationary at some position and remains stationary until ''t'' = 2''s'' when it begins accelerating. It accelerates in a positive direction for 2 seconds until ''t'' = 4''s'' and then travels at a constant velocity for a further 2 seconds.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 25 Calculating distance from a velocity-time graph===

'''Question:''' The velocity-time graph of a car is plotted below. Calculate the displacement of the car has after 15 seconds.

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot13.png|377px|]]

'''Answer:''' 
We are asked to calculate the displacement of the car. All we need to remember here is that the area between the velocity-time graph and the time axis gives us the displacement.

For ''t'' = 0''s'' to ''t'' = 5''s'' this is the triangle on the left:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}5s\times 4m/s\\&amp;=&amp;10m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For ''t'' = 5''s'' to ''t'' = 12''s'' the displacement is equal to the area of the rectangle

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \Box &amp;=&amp; w \times h\\&amp;=&amp;7s \times 4m/s\\&amp;=&amp;28m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For ''t'' = 12''s'' to ''t'' = 14''s'' the displacement is equal to the area of the triangle above the time axis on the right

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}2s \times 4m/s\\&amp;=&amp;4m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

For ''t'' = 14''s'' to ''t'' = 15''s'' the displacement is equal to the area of the triangle below the time axis

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}1s \times 2m/s\\&amp;=&amp;1m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now the total displacement of the car is just the sum of all of these areas. HOWEVER, because in the last second (from ''t'' = 14''s'' to ''t'' = 15''s'') the velocity of the car is negative, it means that the car was going in the opposite direction, i.e. back where it came from! So, to get the total displacement, we have to add the first 3 areas (those with positive displacements) and subtract the last one (because it signifies a displacement in the opposite direction).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{s}&amp;=&amp;10 +28 +4 -1\\&amp;=&amp;41m\ in\ the\ positive\ direction\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 26 Velocity from a displacement-time graph===

'''Question:''' Given the diplacement-time graph below,

# what is the velocity of the object during the first 4 seconds?
# what is the velocity of the object from ''t'' = 4''s'' to ''t'' = 7''s''?

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot14.png|468px|]]

'''Answer:''' 
# for the first 4sec velocity is slope of the curve i.e. 2/4=0.5m/s

# For the last 3 seconds we can see that the displacement stays constant, and that the gradient is zero. Thus &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}=0m/s&lt;/math&gt;.  

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 27 From an acceleration- to a velocity-time graph===

'''Question:''' Given the acceleration-time graph below, assume that the object starts from rest and draw its velocity-time graph.

= Equations of Motion =

This section is about solving problems relating to uniformly accelerated motion. We'll first introduce the variables and the equations, then we'll show you how to derive them, and after that we'll do a couple of examples.

:''u'' = starting velocity (m/s) at ''t'' = 0
:''v'' = final velocity (m/s) at time ''t''
:''s'' = displacement (m)
:''t'' = time (s)
:''a'' = acceleration (m/s²}

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1/2*a*(\Delta t)^2 + u(\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;


Make sure you can rhyme these off, they are very important!
There are so many different types of questions for these equations. Basically when you are answering a question like this:

# Find out what values you have and write them down.
# Figure out which equation you need.
# Write it down!!!
# Fill in all the values you have and get the answer.

[[Image:fhsst_magnify.png|110px|]]
|Galileo Galilei of Pisa, Italy, was the first to determine the correct mathematical law for acceleration: the total distance covered, starting from rest, is proportional to the square of the time. He also concluded that
objects retain their velocity unless a force - often friction - acts upon them, refuting the accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that
objects &quot;naturally&quot; slow down and stop unless a force acts upon them. This principle was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (1st law).
|}

==Equation 5.1==
By the definition of acceleration &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{\Delta v}{t}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''v'' is the change in velocity, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v - u&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a &amp;=&amp; \frac{v-u}{t} \\v &amp;=&amp; u +at\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


==Equation 5.2==
In the previous section we saw that displacement can be calculated from the area between a velocity-time graph and the time-axis. For uniformly accelerated motion the most complicated velocity-time graph we can have is a straight line. Look at the graph below&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; it represents an object with a starting velocity of ''u'', accelerating to a final velocity ''v'' over a total time ''t''.

To calculate the final displacement we must calculate the area under the graph&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; this is just the area of the rectangle added to the area of the triangle.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \triangle &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}b \times h\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}t \times (v-u)\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}vt - \frac{1}{2}ut\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Area \Box &amp;=&amp; w \times h\\&amp;=&amp; t \times u\\&amp;=&amp; ut\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}Displacement &amp;=&amp; Area \Box + Area \triangle\\s &amp;=&amp; ut + \frac{1}{2}vt -\frac{1}{2}ut\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{(u+v)}{2}t\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Equation 5.3==
This equation is simply derived by eliminating the final velocity ''v'' in equation 5.2. Remembering from equation 5.1 that

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v=u+at&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

then equation 5.2 becomes

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s &amp;=&amp; \frac{u+u+at}{2}t\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{2ut+at^2}{2}\\&amp;=&amp;ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Equation 5.4== 
This equation is just derived by eliminating the time variable in the above equation. From Equation 5.1 we know

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v-u}{a}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting this into Equation 5.3 gives


{| 
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s &amp;=&amp; u(\frac{v-u}{a})+\frac{1}{2}a(\frac{v-u}{a})^2 \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{uv}{a}-\frac{u^2}{a}+\frac{1}{2}a(\frac{v^2-2uv+u^2}{a^2}) \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{uv}{a}-\frac{u^2}{a}+\frac{v^2}{2a}-\frac{uv}{a}+\frac{u^2}{2a}\\2as &amp;=&amp; -2u^2+v^2+u^2 \\v^2&amp; =&amp;u^2+2as\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (5.5)
|}


This gives us the final velocity in terms of the initial velocity, acceleration and displacement and is independent of the time variable.

==Worked Example 28==

'''Question:''' 
A racing car has an initial velocity of 100 m/s and it covers a displacement of 725 m in 10 s. Find its acceleration.

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 

We are given the quantities ''u'', ''s'' and ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; all in the correct units. We need to find ''a''.

Step 2 : 

We can use equation 5.3 &lt;math&gt;s=ut +\frac{1}{2}at^2&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3 : 

Rearranging equation 5.3 we have &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{2(s-ut)}{t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the values of the known quantities this becomes

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a &amp;=&amp; \frac{2(725 \mbox{ m}-100\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}}\cdot10\mbox{ s})}{10^2 \mbox{ s}^2}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{2(-275 \mbox{ m})}{100 \mbox{ s}^2}\\&amp;=&amp;-5.5\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The racing car is accelerating at -5.5 m/s², or we could say it is decelerating at 5.5 m/s².
this ans is wrong

its better to use 
a=v-u/t
then a=(725-100)/10s
you will get a=625/10 which will be equal to 62.5m/s2

==Worked Example 29==

'''Question:''' An object starts from rest, moves in a straight line with a constant acceleration and covers a distance of 64 m in 4 s. Calculate

* its acceleration
* its final velocity
* at what time the object had covered half the total distance
* what distance the object had covered in half the total time.

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
We are given the quantities ''u'', ''s'' and ''t'' in the correct units.

Step 2 : 
To calculate the acceleration we can use equation [#eq:eq3 5.3]. Rearranging it we have:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;a=\frac{2(s-ut)}{t^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting in the values of the known quantities this becomes

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}a &amp;=&amp; \frac{2(64m-0\frac{m}{s}4s}{4^2s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{128m}{16s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;8\frac{m}{s^2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 
To calculate its final velocity we can use equation 5.1 - remember we now also know the acceleration of the object.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v&amp;=&amp;u+at\\&amp;=&amp;0\frac{m}{s}+(8\frac{m}{s^2})(4s)\\&amp;=&amp;32\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 
The time at which the object had covered half the total distance. Half the distance is 32''m''. Here we have the quantities ''s'', ''u'' and ''a'' so we first use equation 5.4 to calculate the velocity at this distance:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v^2&amp;=&amp;u^2+2as\\&amp;=&amp;(0m)^2+2(8m/s^2)(32m)\\&amp;=&amp;512m^2/s^2\\v&amp;=&amp;22.6m/s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now we can use equation 5.2 to calculate the time:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}t&amp;=&amp;\frac{2s}{u+v}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{(2)(32m)}{0m/s+22.6m/s}\\&amp;=&amp;2.8s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 
The distance the object had covered in half the time. Half the time is 2''s''. Thus we have ''u'', ''a'' and ''t'' - all in the correct units. We can use equation 5.3 to get the distance:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}s&amp;=&amp;ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\\&amp;=&amp;(0m/s)(2s)+\frac{1}{2}(8\frac{m}{s^2})(2s)^2\\&amp;=&amp;16m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 30==
'''Question:'''
A ball is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 10 m/s from the balcony of a tall building. The balcony is 15 m above the ground and gravitational accleration is 10 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Find a) the time required for the ball to hit the ground, and b) the velocity with which it hits the ground.
==='''Answer:1''' ===


Step 1 : 
In this case it often helps to make the problem easier to understand if we draw ourselves a picture like the one below:

[[Image:Fhsst_rectmot16.png|282px|]]

First the ball goes upwards with gravitational acceleration slowing it until it reaches its highest point &amp;mdash; here its speed is 0 m/s &amp;mdash; then it begins descending with gravitational acceleration causing it to increase its speed on the way down. We can separate the motion into 2 stages:

Stage 1 - the upward motion of the ball

Stage 2 - the downward motion of the ball.

We'll choose the upward direction as positive - this means that gravitation acceleraton is negative - and we'll begin by solving for all the variables of Stage 1. So far we have these quantities:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}u_1&amp;=&amp;10m/s\\v_1&amp;=&amp;0m/s\\a_1&amp;=&amp;-10m/s^2\\t_1&amp;=&amp;?\\s_1&amp;=&amp;?\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using equation 5.1 to find ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_1&amp;=&amp;u_1+a_1t_1\\t_1&amp;=&amp;\frac{v_1-u_1}{a_1}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{0m/s-10m/s}{-10m/s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;1s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can find ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by using equation 5.4

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_1^2&amp;=&amp;u_1^2+2a_1s_1\\s_1&amp;=&amp;\frac{v_1^2-u_1^2}{2a}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{(0m/s)^2-(10m/s)^2}{2(-10m/s^2)}\\&amp;=&amp;5m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


For Stage 2 we have the following quantities:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}u_2&amp;=&amp;0m/s\\v_2&amp;=&amp;?\\a_2&amp;=&amp;-10m/s^2\\t_2&amp;=&amp;?\\s_2&amp;=&amp;-15m-5m=20m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can determine the final velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using equation 5.4:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_2^2&amp;=&amp;u_2^2+2a_2s_2\\&amp;=&amp;(0m/s)^2+2(-10m/s^2)(-20m)\\&amp;=&amp;400(m/s)^2\\v_2&amp;=&amp;20m/s \mbox{ downwards}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now we can determine the time for Stage 2, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, from equation 5.1:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_2&amp;=&amp;u_2+a_2t_2\\t_2&amp;=&amp;\frac{v_2-u_2}{a_2}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{-20m/s-0m/s}{-10m/s^2}\\&amp;=&amp;2s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Finally,

a) the time required for the stone to hit the ground is 

&lt;math&gt;t=t_1+t_2=1 \mbox{ s}+2 \mbox{ s}=3 \mbox{ s}&lt;/math&gt;

b) the velocity with which it hits the ground is just 

&lt;math&gt;v_2=-20 \ \mbox{m}/\mbox{s}&lt;/math&gt;

==='''Answer:2''' ===
applying &lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\vec s(t) = \vec S_i + \vec U_i \ (t- T_i) + \frac {\vec A}{2} (t - T_i)^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; 0 = 15 \hat j + 10 \hat j (T_{total} - 0 ) + \frac {-10 \hat j}{2} (T_{total} - 0)^2  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; T_{total}^2 - 2 \ T_{total} - 3 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
solving we will get &lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; T_{total} = 3 , -1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
so time to reach is 3 second , now applying &lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec U_i + \vec A (t- T_i)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \vec v (3) = 10 \hat j + (-10 \hat j) (3- 0)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \vec v (3) = -20 \hat j &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br\&gt;

= What is Momentum? =

Momentum is a physical quantity which is closely related to forces. We will learn about this connection a little later. Remarkably momentum is a conserved quantity. This makes momentum extremely useful in solving a great variety of real-world problems. Firstly we must consider the definition of momentum. 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | The ''momentum'' of an object is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mathematically,

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p} =  m\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : momentum (&lt;math&gt;kg.m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; + direction)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''m''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : mass (''kg'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : velocity (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; + direction)
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, momentum is a property of a moving object and is determined by its velocity and mass. A large truck travelling slowly can have the same momentum as a much smaller car travelling relatively fast.

Note the arrows in the equation defining momentum- momentum is a vector with the same direction as the velocity of the object.

Since the direction of an object's momentum is given by the direction of its motion, one can calculate an object's momentum in two steps:

* include in the final answer the direction of the object's motion

==Worked Example 31 Calculating Momentum 1==

'''Question:'''
A ball of mass 3''kg'' moves at 2''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to the right. Calculate the ball's momentum.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass, and
* the ball's velocity

in the correct units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the ball's momentum. From the definition of momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} = m\overrightarrow{v},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we see that we need the mass and velocity of the ball, which we are given.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we calculate the magnitude of the ball's momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p &amp;=&amp; mv \\&amp;=&amp; (3kg)(2m.s^{-1}) = 6\ kg.m.s^{-1}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Finally we quote the answer with the direction of the ball's motion included,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} = 6\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ to\ the\ right}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 32 Calculating Momentum 2==

'''Question:''' A ball of mass 500''g'' is thrown at 2''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Calculate the ball's momentum.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass, and
* the magnitude of the ball's velocity

but with the ball's mass in the incorrect units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the momentum which is defined as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} = m\overrightarrow{v}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, we need the mass and velocity of the ball but we have only its mass and the magnitude of its velocity. 

Step 3 : 

In order to determine the velocity of the ball we need the direction of the ball's motion. If the problem does not give an explicit direction we are forced to be general. In a case like this we could say that the direction of the velocity is in the direction of motion of the ball. This might sound silly but the lack of information in the question has forced us to be, and we are certainly not wrong! The ball's velocity is then  ''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the direction of motion.

Step 4 : 

Next we convert the mass to the correct units,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000g&amp;=&amp;1kg \\1 &amp; = &amp; \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\500g \times 1 &amp;=&amp; 500g \times \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\&amp; = &amp; 0.500kg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Now, let us find the magnitude of the ball's momentum, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p &amp;=&amp; mv\\&amp;=&amp; (0.500kg)(2m.s^{-1}) = 1\ kg.m.s^{-1}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Finally, we quote the answer with the direction of the momentum included,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp; 1\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ in\ the\ direction\ of\ motion\ of\ the\ ball} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 33 Calculating the Momentum of the Moon==

'''Question:''' The moon is &lt;math&gt;384\ 400km&lt;/math&gt; away from the earth and orbits the earth in 27.3 days. If the moon has a mass of &lt;math&gt;7.35\times10^{22}kg&lt;/math&gt; [footnode.html#foot11743 &lt;sup&gt;6.1&lt;/sup&gt;] what is the magnitude of its momentum if we assume a circular orbit?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the moon's mass,
* the distance to the moon, and
* the time for one orbit of the moon

with mass in the correct units but all other quantities in the incorrect units.

The units we require are

* seconds (''s'') for time, and
* metres (''m'') for distance pesteng physics→→→→→→

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate only the magnitude of the moon's momentum (i.e. we do not need to specify a direction). In order to do this we require the moon's mass and the magnitude of its velocity, since &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p = mv.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3 : 

How do we find the speed or magnitude of the moon's velocity? 
Speed is defined as, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}speed &amp;=&amp; \frac{Distance}{time}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We are given the time the moon takes for one orbit but not how far it travels in that time. However, we can work this out from the distance to the moon and the fact that the moon's orbit is circular.
Firstly let us convert the distance to the moon to the correct units,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1km &amp;=&amp; 1000m\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1000m}{1km}\\384\ 400km \times 1 &amp;=&amp; 384\ 400km\times\frac{1000m}{1km}\\&amp;=&amp; 384\ 400\ 000 m\\&amp;=&amp; 3.844\times10^8\ m\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using the equation for the circumference, ''C'', of a circle in terms of its radius, we can determine the distance travelled by the moon in one orbit: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}C&amp;=&amp;2\pi r\\&amp;=&amp;2\pi (3.844\times10^8\ m)\\&amp;=&amp; 2.42\times10^{9}\ m.\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Next we must convert the orbit time, ''T'', into the correct units. Using the fact that a day contains 24 hours, an hour consists of 60 minutes, and a minute is 60 seconds long,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1 day&amp;=&amp;(24)(60)(60) seconds \\1 &amp;=&amp;\frac{(24)(60)(60)s}{1 day}\\27.3days\times 1 &amp;=&amp; 27.3 days \frac{(24)(60)(60)s}{1day}\\&amp; = &amp; 2.36\times10^{6}s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T = 2.36\times10^{6}s. \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the distance travelled by the moon in an orbit and the time taken by the moon to complete one orbit, we can determine the magnitude of the moon's velocity or speed,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v &amp;=&amp; \frac{Distance}{time}\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{C}{T}\\&amp;=&amp; 1.02\times10^{3}\ m.s^{-1}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Finally we can calculate the magnitude of the moon's momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}p &amp;=&amp; mv\\&amp;=&amp; (7.35\times10^{22}kg)(1.02\times10^{3}\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; 7.50 \times10^{25}\ kg.m.s^{-1}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

= The Momentum of a System =

In Chapter 4 [[FHSST_Physics_Forces:Forces|Forces]] the concept of a system was introduced. The bodies that make up a system can have different masses and can be
moving with different velocities. In other words they can have different momenta.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:'''
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | The ''total momentum of a system'' is the sum of the momenta of each of the objects in the system.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since momentum is a vector, the techniques of vector addition discussed in [[FHSST_Physics_Vectors:Techniques_of_Vector_Addition|This chapter]] must be
used to calculate the total momentum of a system. Let us consider an example. 

==Worked Example 34 Calculating the Total Momentum of a System==

'''Question:''' Two billiard balls roll towards each other. They each have a mass of 0.3''kg''. Ball 1 is moving at &lt;math&gt;v_1=1\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the right, while ball 2 is moving at &lt;math&gt;v_2=0.8\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the left. 

Calculate the total momentum of the system.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the mass of each ball,
* the velocity of ball 1, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;  and
* the velocity of ball 2, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;,  
all in the correct units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the '''total momentum of the system'''. In this example our system consists of two balls. To find the total momentum we must sum the momenta of the balls,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_1}+\overrightarrow{p_2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since ball 1 is moving to the right, its momentum is in this direction, while the second ball's momentum is directed towards the left.

[[Image:Fhsst_mom1.png|281px|]]

Thus, we are required to find the sum of two vectors acting along the same straight line. The algebraic method of vector addition introduced in [[FHSST_Physics_Vectors:Techniques_of_Vector_Addition|this chapter]] can thus be used.

Step 3 : 

Firstly we choose a positive direction. Let us choose right as the positive direction, then obviously left is negative.

Step 4 : 

The total momentum of the system is then the sum of the two momenta taking the directions of the velocities into account. Ball 1 is travelling at &lt;math&gt;1\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ right&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;+1\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Ball 2 is travelling at &lt;math&gt;0.8\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ left&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-0.8\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

&lt;u&gt;Right is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total} &amp;=&amp; m_1\overrightarrow{v_1} +m_2\overrightarrow{v_2}\\&amp;=&amp; (0.3kg)(+1\ m.s^{-1}) + (0.3kg)(-0.8\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; (+0.3\ kg.m.s^{-1}) + (-0.24\ kg.m.s^{-1}) \\&amp;=&amp; +0.06\ kg.m.s^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 0.06\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ to\ the\ right}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In the last step the direction was added in words. Since the result in the second last line is positive, the total momentum of the system is in the positive direction (i.e. to the right).</text>

= Change in Momentum =

If either an object's mass or velocity changes then its momentum too will change. If an object has an initial velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u}&lt;/math&gt; and a final velocity  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt;, then its change in momentum, &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;, is 

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | = &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Worked Example 35 Change in Momentum==

'''Question:''' A rubber ball of mass 0.8''kg'' is dropped and strikes the floor at a velocity of  &lt;math&gt;6\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. It bounces back with an initial velocity of &lt;math&gt;4\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Calculate the change in momentum of the rubber ball caused by the floor.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass,
* the ball's initial velocity, and
* the ball's final velocity

all in the correct units.

Do not be confused by the question referring to the ball bouncing back with an ``initial velocity
of &lt;math&gt;4\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The word ''initial'' is included here since the ball will obviously slow down with time and &lt;math&gt;4\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed immediately after bouncing from the floor.

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the change in momentum of the ball,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v} - m\overrightarrow{u}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We have everything we need to find &lt;math&gt;\Delta\overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the initial momentum is directed downwards and the final momentum is in the upward direction, we can use the algebraic method of subtraction discussed in the vectors chapter.

Step 3 : 
Firstly, we choose a positive direction. Let us choose down as the positive direction. Then substituting,

&lt;u&gt;Down is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v} -m\overrightarrow{u}\\&amp;=&amp; (0.8kg)(-4\ m.s^{-1})-(0.8kg)(+6\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; (0.8kg)(-10\ m.s^{-1})\\&amp;=&amp; -8\ kg.m.s^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 8\ kg.m.s^{-1}\textbf{\ up}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the last step to include the direction of the change in momentum in words.</text>

= What properties does momentum have? =

You may at this stage be wondering why there is a need for introducing momentum. Remarkably momentum is a conserved quantity. Within an isolated system the total momentum is constant. No matter what happens to the individual bodies within an isolated system, the total momentum of the system never changes! Since momentum is a vector, its conservation implies that both its magnitude and its direction remains the same.

Momentum is conserved in isolated systems!

This '''Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum''' is one of the most fundamental principles of physics and it alone justifies the definition of momentum. Since momentum is related to the motion of objects, we can use its conservation to make predictions about what happens in collisions and explosions. If we bang two objects together, by conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the objects before the collision is equal to their total momentum after the collision.

|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let us consider a simple collision of two pool or billiard balls. Consider the first ball (mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to have an initial velocity (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_1}&lt;/math&gt;). The second ball (mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) moves towards the first ball with an initial velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_2}&lt;/math&gt;. This situation is shown in Figure 6.1. If we add the momenta of each ball we get a total momentum for the system. This total momentum is then 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total\ before}=m_1\overrightarrow{u_1}+m_2\overrightarrow{u_2},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|Figure 6.2: After the collision.

After the two balls collide and move away they each have a different momentum. If we call the final velocity of ball 1 &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_1}&lt;/math&gt; and the final velocity of ball 2  &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_2}&lt;/math&gt; (see Figure 6.2), then the total momentum of the system after the collision is 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_{total\ after}=m_1\overrightarrow{v_1}+m_2\overrightarrow{v_2},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external forces acting on the balls. Therefore, by the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This gives the equation for the conservation of momentum in a collision of two objects,

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This equation is always true - momentum is always conserved in collisions.

At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that momentum is closely related to force. We will now explain the nature of this
connection.

Consider an object of mass ''m'' moving with constant acceleration &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt;. During a time &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''t'' the object's velocity changes from an initial velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u}&lt;/math&gt; to a final velocity &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}&lt;/math&gt; (refer to Figure 6.3). We know from Newton's First Law that there must be a resultant force &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt; acting on the object. 

{| 
|- 
|[[Image:Fhsst_mom4.png|272px|]]
|-
|Figure 6.3: An object under the action of a resultant force.
|}

Starting from Newton's Second Law, 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&amp;=&amp;m\overrightarrow{a}\\&amp;=&amp;m(\frac{\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u}}{\Delta t})\qquad\qquad\rm {since}\qquad\overrightarrow{a}=\frac{\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u}}{\Delta t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}}{\Delta t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}}{\Delta t}\\&amp;=&amp;\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{p}}{\Delta t}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This alternative form of Newton's Second Law is called the '''Law of Momentum'''.

Mathematically,

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res} =\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{p}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; 
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : resultant force (''N'' + direction)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : change in momentum (&lt;math&gt;kg.m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; + direction)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''t''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : time over which &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt; acts (''s'')
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rearranging the Law of Momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \Delta \overrightarrow{p}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The product &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is called impulse, 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Impulse} \equiv \overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t = \Delta\overrightarrow{p}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this equation we see, that for a given change in momentum,&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is fixed. Thus, if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;Res&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; must be increased (i.e. the resultant force must be applied for longer). Alternatively if &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is reduced (i.e. the resultant force is applied for a shorter period) then the resultant force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum.

==Worked Example 36 Impulse and Change in momentum==

'''Question:''' A 150 &amp;nbsp; ''N'' resultant force acts on a 300 &amp;nbsp; ''kg'' object. Calculate how long it takes this force to change the object's velocity from &lt;math&gt;2\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ right&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;6\ m.s^{-1}\ to\ the\ right&lt;/math&gt;

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the object's mass,
* the object's initial velocity,
* the object's final velocity, and
* the resultant force acting on the object

all in the correct units!

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the time taken &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; to accelerate the object from the given initial velocity to  final velocity. From the Law of Momentum,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \Delta \overrightarrow{p} \\&amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}\\&amp;=&amp; m(\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u}).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus we have everything we need to find &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;! 

Step 3 : 

First we choose a positive direction. Although not explicitly stated, the resultant force acts to the right. This follows from the fact that the object's velocity increases in this direction. Let us
then choose right as the positive direction.

Step 4 : 

Substituting,

&lt;u&gt;Right is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; m(\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u})\\(+150N)\Delta t &amp;=&amp; (300kg)((+6\frac{m}{s})-(+2\frac{m}{s}))\\(+150N)\Delta t &amp;=&amp; (300kg)(+4\frac{m}{s})\\\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \frac{(300kg)(+4\frac{m}{s})}{+150N}\\\Delta t &amp;=&amp; 8s\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 37 Calculating Impulse==

'''Question:''' A cricket ball weighing 156 g is moving at 54 km/h towards a batsman. It is hit by the batsman back towards the bowler at 36\ km/h. Calculate i) the ball's impulse, and ii) the average force exerted by the bat if the ball is in contact with the bat for 0.13 s. 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what is given. The question explicitly gives

* the ball's mass,
* the ball's initial velocity,
* the ball's final velocity, and
* the time of contact between bat and ball

all except the time in the wrong units!

Answer to (i):

Step 2 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the impulse

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Impulse} = \Delta\overrightarrow{p} =\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t. \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since we do not have the force exerted by the bat on the ball (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt;), we have to calculate the impulse from the change in momentum of the ball. Now, since 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}\\&amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v} - m\overrightarrow{u},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we need the ball's mass, initial velocity and final velocity, which we are given.

Step 3 : 
Firstly let us change units for the mass

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000g &amp;=&amp; 1kg\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\156g \times 1 &amp;=&amp; 156g \times \frac{1kg}{1000g}\\&amp;=&amp; 0.156kg\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Next we change units for the velocity

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1km &amp;=&amp; 1000 m\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1000m}{1km}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3600s &amp;=&amp; 1hr\\1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1hr}{3600 s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}54\frac{km}{hr}\times 1\times1 &amp;=&amp;54\frac{km}{hr}\times\frac{1000m}{1km}\times\frac{1hr}{3600 s}\\&amp;=&amp; 15\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}36\frac{km}{hr}\times 1\times1 &amp;=&amp;36\frac{km}{hr}\times\frac{1000m}{1km}\times\frac{1hr}{3600 s}\\&amp;=&amp; 10\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Next we must choose a positive direction. Let us choose the direction from the batsman to the bowler as the positive direction. Then the initial velocity of the ball is &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u}=-15\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, while the final velocity of the ball is &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v}=+10\ m.s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;  

Step 6 : 

Now we calculate the change in momentum,

&lt;u&gt;Direction from batsman to bowler is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta\overrightarrow{p} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_{final}-\overrightarrow{p}_{initial}\\&amp;=&amp; m\overrightarrow{v}-m\overrightarrow{u}\\&amp;=&amp; m(\overrightarrow{v}-\overrightarrow{u})\\&amp;=&amp;(0.156kg)((+10\ m.s^{-1})-(-15\ m.s^{-1}))\\&amp;=&amp; +3.9\ kg.m.s^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 3.9\ kg.m.s^{-1}\ \textbf{ in\ the\ direction\ from\ batsman\ to\ bowler}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the last step to include the direction of the change in momentum in words.

Step 7 : 

Finally since impulse is just the change in momentum of the ball,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Impulse} &amp;=&amp; \Delta\overrightarrow{p}\\&amp;=&amp; 3.9\ \mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-1}\\&amp;=&amp; 3.9\ \mbox{N} \cdot \mbox{s} \ \textbf{ in\ the\ direction\ from\ batsman\ to\ bowler}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Answer to (ii):

Step 8 : 

What is being asked? We are asked to calculate the average force exerted by the bat on the ball, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{Impulse} = \overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t = \Delta\overrightarrow{p}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We are given &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and we have calculated the change in momentum or impulse of the ball in part (i)!

Step 9 : 

Next we choose a positive direction. Let us choose the direction from the batsman to the bowler as the positive direction. Then substituting,

&lt;u&gt;Direction from batsman to bowler is the positive direction&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}\Delta t &amp;=&amp; \mathrm{Impulse}\\\overrightarrow{F}_{Res}(0.13s) &amp;=&amp; +3.9\frac{kg.m}{s}\\\overrightarrow{F}_{Res} &amp;=&amp; \frac{+3.9\frac{\mbox{kg} \cdot \mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}}}{0.13 \mbox{ s}}\\&amp;=&amp; 30 \mbox{ N} \ \textbf{ in\ the\ direction\ from\ batsman\ to\ bowler}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where we remembered in the final step to include the direction of the force in words.</text>

'''Momentum''': The ''momentum'' of an object is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity.

'''Momentum of a System''': The ''total momentum of a system'' is the sum of the momenta of each of the objects in the system.

'''Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:''': `The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant' or `In an isolated
system the total momentum before a collision (or explosion) is equal to the total momentum after the collision (or explosion)'.

'''Law of Momentum:''': The applied resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of the object's momentum and
this force is in the direction of the change in momentum.</text>

= What are Work and Energy? =

 '''The energy is the ability to do a work.'''

Energy is measured by the result of applied force/power over a period of time to make changes/work.

Work is defined by a force applied to an object to change this object’s physical properties.   

'''Power = Energy / Time''' 
No force used no change and none work was done. 

Power and energy are closely related, although, they are not the same.  

Power is the rate at which energy is delivered, not an amount of energy itself.  

Electrical unit of power is Watt (named after the scientist James Watt): 

1 Watt = 1 Joule / Second.

'''Energy = Power × Time'''.
 

Energy exist in various forms: '''kinetic''' ['''Ek = ½ m, v2''' ], '''potential''' ['''Ep = m g h'''], '''thermal''' (heat), '''chemical''', '''electrical''', '''electrochemical''', '''magnetic''', '''sound''', '''light''', and '''nuclear'''. 
  

'''Energy can be converted from one form into another in many ways:'''

'''''Through the gravitation forces'''''
When gravity accelerates a falling object, it converts its potential energy to kinetic energy, or when an object is lifted, the gravitational field stores the energy exerted by the lifter as potential energy in the earth-object system. 

'''''Through the electric and magnetic fields forces'''''
Electrically charged particles in the presence of an electric field possess potential energy.  The fields’ forces can accelerate particles and convert this particle's potential energy into kinetic energy.  Charged particles can interact via electric and magnetic fields to transfer energy between them, i.e.: an electrical current in a conductor transforms electrical energy into heat.  

'''''Frictional Forces''''' 
A mass object with its potential and kinetic energy associated with the position, orientation, and the object’s motion can be converted into thermal energy (heat), whenever the object slides against another object.  The sliding causes the molecules on the surfaces of contact to interact via electromagnetic fields with one another and start vibrating. 

'''''Through emitting or absorbing photons of light''''' 
When photons of lights fall on an object, a photon may pass through the object, be reflected by the object, or be absorbed by the atoms making up the object.  Depending on the smoothness of the surface, the scale of the photon's wavelength, the reflection may be either diffuse (rough surface) or coherent (smooth surface).  If the photon is absorbed, the photon's energy may also be split and converted in one of these ways:
•	''Photo-thermal effect'' 
The energy absorbed may simply produce thermal energy, or heat in the object.  In this case, the photon's energy is converted into vibrations of the molecules called phonons, which is actually heat energy.
•	''Photoelectric effect'' 
The energy absorbed may be converted into kinetic energy of conduction electrons, and hence electrical energy.
•	''Photochemical effect'' 
The energy may bring about chemical changes that effectively store the energy.  Nuclear reactions occur when the nuclei of particles combine [fusion reaction] or when nuclei split apart [fission reaction].  

In the International System of Units [SI system], the electrical energy unit is '''1 Joule''' (named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule).  

''A one Joule is the amount of energy we expend as work if we exert a force of a one Newton of force over a distance of one meter''.  

It takes a one Joule of energy  to lift 1 lb. about 9 inches.

The unit of force in the International System of Units is '''1 Newton''' (named after the English physicist Isaac Newton).  

''One Newton of force is the force that can accelerate a mass of 1 kilogram (about 2.205 lbs), such that it picks up 1 meter per second of velocity during each second that the force is exerted.'' 

Appliances rating is how much energy per unit time these appliances draw.  This quantity is called the &quot;power&quot;:  
 
''Energy = Power x Time = (100 Joules/Second) × (3600 Seconds) = 360,000 Joules''</text>

= Work =
To do work on an object, one must ''move'' the object by applying a ''force'' with at least a component in the direction of motion. The
work done is given by

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;W= F_{\|} s&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''W''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : work done (''N''.''m'' or ''J'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : component of applied force parallel to motion (''N'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''s''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : displacement of the object (''m'')
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


It is very important to note that for work to be done there must be a component of the applied force in the direction of motion. Forces perpendicular to the direction of motion do no work.

As with all physical quantities, work must have units. As follows from the definition, work is measured in ''N''.''m''. The name given to this combination of S.I. units is the joule (''J''). 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
1 joule is the work done when an object is moved 1''m'' under the application of a force of 1''N'' in the direction of motion.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


The work done by an object can be positive or negative. Since force (''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt;) and displacement (''s'') are both vectors, the result of the above equation depends on their directions:

* If ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt; acts in the same direction as the motion then positive work is being done. In this case the object on which the force is applied gains energy.
* If the direction of motion and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt; are opposite, then negative work is being done. This means that energy is transferred in the opposite direction. For example, if you try to push a car uphill by applying a force up the slope and instead the car rolls down the hill you are doing negative work on the car. Alternatively, the car is doing positive work on you!

==Worked Example 38 Calculating Work Done I==
'''Question:''' If you push a box 20''m'' forward by applying a force of 15''N'' in the forward direction, what is the work you have done on the box?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The force applied is ''F'' = 15''N''.
* The distance moved is ''s'' = 20''m''.
* The applied force and distance moved are in the same direction. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;F_{\|}=15N&lt;/math&gt;  
These quantities are all in the correct units, so no unit conversions are required.


Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the work done on the box. We know from the definition that work done is ''W'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt;''s''

Step 3 : Next we substitute the values and calculate the work done

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W&amp;=&amp;F_{\|} s\\&amp;=&amp; (15N)(20m)\\&amp;=&amp; 300\ N\cdot m\\&amp;=&amp; 300\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Remember that the answer must be ''positive'' as the applied force and the motion are in the same
direction (forwards). In this case, you (the pusher) lose energy, while the box gains energy.

==Worked Example 39 Calculating Work Done II==
'''Question:''' What is the work done by you on a car, if you try to push the car up a hill by applying a force of 40''N'' directed up the slope, but it slides downhill 30''cm''?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The force applied is ''F'' = 40''N''
* The applied force and distance moved are in opposite directions. Therefore, if we take ''s'' = 0.3''m'', then &lt;math&gt;F_{\|}=-40N&lt;/math&gt;.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the work done on the car by you. We know that work done is ''W'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt;''s''

Step 3 : Substitute the values and calculate the work done

Again we have the applied force and the distance moved so we can proceed with calculating the work done:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W&amp;=&amp;F_{\|} s\\&amp;=&amp; (- 40N)(0.3m)\\&amp;=&amp; -12N\cdot m\\&amp;=&amp; -12\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that the answer must be ''negative'' as the applied force and the motion are in opposite
directions. In this case the car does work on the person trying to push.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

What happens when the applied force and the motion are not parallel? If there is an angle between the direction of motion and the applied force then to determine the work done we have to calculate the ''component'' of the applied force ''parallel'' to the direction of motion. Note that this
means a force perpendicular to the direction of motion can do no work.

==Worked Example 40 Calculating Work Done III==
'''Question:''' Calculate the work done on a box, if it is pulled 5''m''
along the ground by applying a force of ''F'' = 10''N'' at an angle of 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to
the horizontal.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The force applied is ''F'' = 10''N''
* The distance moved is ''s'' = 5''m'' along the ground
* The angle between the applied force and the motion is 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

These quantities are in the correct units so we do not need to perform any unit conversions.

Step 2 : 
Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the work done on the box.

Step 3 : 
Calculate the component of the applied force in the direction of motion

Since the force and the motion are not in the same direction, we must first calculate the component of the force in the direction of the motion.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng1.png|71px|]]

From the force diagram we see that the component of the applied force parallel to the ground is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F_{||}&amp;=&amp;F\cdot \cos(60^o)\\&amp;=&amp; 10N\cdot \cos(60^o)\\&amp;=&amp; 5\ N\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 
Substitute and calculate the work done

Now we can calculate the work done on the box:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}W&amp;=&amp;F_{\|} s\\&amp;=&amp; (5N)(5m) \\&amp;=&amp; 25\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that the answer is positive as the component of the force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;|&lt;/sub&gt; is in the same direction as the motion.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

= Energy =

As we mentioned earlier, energy is the capacity to do work. When positive work is done on an object, the system doing the work loses
energy. In fact, '''the energy lost by a system is exactly equal to the work done by the system.'''

Like work (''W'') the unit of energy (''E'') is the joule (J). This follows as work is just the transfer of energy.

A very important property of our universe which was discovered around 1890 is that energy is conserved.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
Energy is never created nor destroyed, but merely
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
transformed from one form to another.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Energy conservation and the conservation of matter are the principles on which classical mechanics is built.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''IN THE ABSENCE OF FRICTION'''
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
When work is done on an object by a system:
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
-the object gains energy equal to the work done by the system
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Work Done = Energy Transferred'''
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thermal energy (heat) is the disorganized movement of microscopic particles. Once energy is converted to this form, it has limited usefulness for doing further work in the system. Friction is the general name for forces that converts energy to heat.
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''IN THE PRESENCE OF FRICTION'''
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | When work is done by a system:
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | -only some of the energy lost by the system is transferred into useful energy
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | -the rest of the energy transferred is lost to heat by friction
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Total Work Done = Useful Work Done + Work Done Against Friction'''
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Types of Energy ==

So what different types of energy exist? Kinetic, mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, radiant, and atomic energy are just some of the
types that exist. By the principle of conservation of energy, whenwork is done energy is merely transferred from one object to another
and from one type of energy to another.

=== Kinetic Energy ===

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion that an object has. Objects moving in straight lines possess ''translational kinetic energy'',
which we often abbreviate as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The translational kinetic energy of an object is given by

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;math&gt;E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : kinetic energy (''J'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''m''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : mass of object (''kg'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''v''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : speed of the object (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the dependence of the kinetic energy on the speed of the object- kinetic energy is related to motion. The faster an object is
moving the greater its kinetic energy. 

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 41 Calculation of Kinetic Energy====
'''Question:''' If a rock has a mass of 1''kg'' and is thrown at 5''m''/''s'', what is its kinetic energy?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the rock ''m'' = 1''kg''
* The speed of the rock ''v'' = 5''m''/''s''

These are both in the correct units so we do not have to worry about unit conversions.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the kinetic energy. From the definition we know that to work out ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, we need to know the mass and the velocity of the object and we are given both of these values.

Step 3 : Substitute and calculate the kinetic energy

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\&amp;= &amp; \frac{1}{2}(1kg)(5\frac{m}{s})^2 \\&amp;= &amp; 12.5\frac{kg\cdot m^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 12.5\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

To check that the units in the above example are in fact correct:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{kg\cdot m^2}{s^2}&amp;=&amp; \left(\frac{kg\cdot m}{s^2}\right)\cdot m =N\cdot m\\&amp;=&amp; J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The units are indeed correct! 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | Study hint: Checking units is an important cross-check
and
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | you should get into a habit of doing this. If you, for example,
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | finish an exam early then checking the units in your calculations is a very good idea.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 42 Mixing Units and Kinetic Energy Calculations 1====
'''Question:''' If a car has a mass of 900''kg'' and is driving at 60''km''/''hr'', what is its kinetic energy?

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : 
Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the car ''m'' = 900''kg''

Step 2 : 
Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the kinetic energy.

Step 3 : 
Substitute and calculate

We know we need the mass and the speed to work out ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and we are given both of these
quantities. We thus simply substitute them into the equation for ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\&amp;= &amp; \frac{1}{2}(900kg)(16.67\frac{m}{s})^2 \\&amp;= &amp; 125\ 000\frac{kgm^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 125\ 000\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Worked Example 43 Mixing Units and Kinetic Energy Calculations 2====
'''Question:''' If a bullet has a mass of 150''kg'' and is shot at a muzzle velocity of 960''m''/''s'', what is its kinetic energy?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 
Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* We are given the muzzle velocity which is just how fast the bullet leaves the barrel and it is ''v'' = 960''m''/''s''.

Step 2 : 
Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the kinetic energy.

Step 3 : 
Substitute and calculate

We just substitute the mass and velocity (which are known) into the equation for ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_k &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\&amp;= &amp; \frac{1}{2}(150kg)(960\frac{m}{s})^2 \\&amp;= &amp; 69\ 120 \frac{kgm^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 69\ 120\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Potential Energy ===
If you lift an object you have to do work on it. This means that energy is transferred to the object. But where is this energy? This
energy is stored in the object and is called ''potential energy''. The reason it is called potential energy is because if we
let go of the object it would move.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | 
Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As an object raised above the ground falls, its '' potential energy'' is released and transformed into kinetic energy. The further it falls the faster it moves as more of the stored potential energy
is transferred into kinetic energy. Remember, energy is never created nor destroyed, but merely transformed from one type to another. In this case potential energy is lost but an equal amount of
kinetic energy is gained.


In the example of a falling mass the potential energy is known as ''gravitational potential energy'' as it is the gravitational force exerted by the earth which causes the mass to accelerate towards the ground. The gravitational field of the earth is what does the work in this case.


Another example is a rubber-band. In order to stretch a rubber-band we have to do work on it. This means we transfer energy to the rubber-band and it gains potential energy. This potential energy is called '' elastic potential energy''. Once released, the rubber-band begins to move and elastic potential energy is transferred into kinetic energy.


=== Gravitational Potential Energy ===
As we have mentioned, when lifting an object it gains gravitational potential energy. One is free to define any level as corresponding to
zero gravitational potential energy. Objects above this level then possess positive potential energy, while those below it have negative
potential energy. To avoid negative numbers in a problem, always choose the lowest level as the zero potential mark. The change in gravitational
potential energy of an object is given by:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; |
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{P}&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : Change in gravitational potential energy (''J'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''m''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : mass of object (''kg'')
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | ''g''
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : acceleration due to gravity (''m''.''s''&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;)
|- 
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;LEFT&quot; | : change in height (''m'')
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When an object is lifted it gains gravitational potential energy, while it loses gravitational potential energy as it falls.

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

====Worked Example 44 Gravitational potential energy====
'''Question:''' How much potential energy does a brick with a mass of 1''kg'' gain if it is lifted 4''m''.

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the brick is ''m'' = 1''kg''
* The height lifted is &lt;math&gt;\Delta h=4m&lt;/math&gt;

These are in the correct units so we do not have to worry about unit conversions.

Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* We are asked to find the gain in potential energy of the object.

Step 3 : Identify the type of potential energy involved

Since the block is being lifted we are dealing with gravitational potential energy. To work out &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_P&lt;/math&gt;, we need to know the mass of the object and the height lifted. As both of these are given, we just substitute them into the equation for &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_P&lt;/math&gt;.

Step 4 : Substitute and calculate

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\Delta E_P &amp; = &amp; mg\Delta h \\&amp;= &amp; (1kg)\left(10\frac{m}{s^2}\right)(4m) \\&amp;= &amp; 40\frac{kg\cdot m^2}{s^2} \\&amp;=&amp; 40\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

= Mechanical Energy and Energy Conservation =

'''Kinetic energy and potential energy are together referred to as mechanical energy'''. The total mechanical energy (''U'') of an object is then the sum of
its kinetic and potential energies:

{| 
|- 
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U&amp;=&amp;E_P+E_K  \\U&amp;=&amp; mgh +\frac{1}{2}mv^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; |

Now,

| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv_{0}^{2}+mgh_{0}=\frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}+mgh_{f}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This principle of conservation of mechanical energy can be a very powerful tool for solving physics problems. However, in the presence of friction some of the
mechanical energy is lost: 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''IN THE PRESENCE OF FRICTION'''
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | Mechanical energy is '''not''' conserved
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | (The mechanical energy lost is equal to the work done against friction)
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\Delta U = U_{before} - U_{after} = \mathrm{Work\ Done\ Against\ Friction}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Worked Example 45 Using Mechanical Energy Conservation==
'''Question:''' A 2''kg'' metal ball is suspended from a rope. If it is released from point ''A'' and swings down to the point ''B'' (the
bottom of its arc) what is its velocity at point ''B''? 

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng2.png|164px|]]

'''Answer:''' 

Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided

* The mass of the metal ball is ''m'' = 2''kg''
* The change in height going from point ''A'' to point ''B'' is ''h'' = 0.5''m''
* The ball is released from point ''A'' so the velocity at point ''A'' is zero (''v''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''m''/''s'').

These are in the correct units so we do not have to worry about unit conversions.


Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked

* Find the velocity of the metal ball at point ''B''.

Step 3 : Determine the Mechanical Energy at ''A'' and ''B''

To solve this problem we use conservation of mechanical energy as there is no friction. Since mechanical energy is conserved,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_A=U_B\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore we need to know the mechanical energy of the ball at point ''A'' (''U''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and at point ''B'' (''U''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;).
The mechanical energy at point ''A'' is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_A = mgh_A + \frac{1}{2}m(v_A)^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We already know ''m'', ''g'' and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, but what is ''h''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;? Note that if we
let ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 then ''h''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5''m'' as ''A'' is 0.5''m'' above ''B''. In problems
you are always free to choose a line corresponding to ''h'' = 0. In this example the most obvious choice is to make point ''B'' correspond to
''h'' = 0.

Now we have,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_A &amp;=&amp; (2kg)\left(10\frac{m}{s^2}\right)(0.5m)+\frac{1}{2}(2kg)(0)^2\\&amp;=&amp; 10\ J\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As already stated ''U''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = ''U''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore ''U''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 10''J'', but using the definition of mechanical energy

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}U_B &amp;=&amp; mgh_B + \frac{1}{2}m(v_B)^2\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m(v_B)^2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

because ''h''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. This means that

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}10J&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{2}(2kg)(v_B)^2\\(v_B)^2 &amp;=&amp; 10\frac{J}{kg}\\v_B &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{10}\frac{m}{s}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

==Asogan Moodaly==

Asogan Moodaly received his Bachelor of Science degree (with honours) in Mechanical Engineering from the University
of Natal, Durban in South Africa. For his final year design project he worked on a 3-axis filament winding machine for composite (Glass
re-enforced plastic in this case) piping. He worked in Vereeniging, Gauteng at Mine Support Products (a subsidiary of Dorbyl Heavy
Engineering) as the design engineer once he graduated. He currently lives in the Vaal Triangle area and is working for Sasol Technology
Engineering as a mechanical engineer, ensuring the safety and integrity of equipment installed during projects.

==Energy and electricity. Why the fuss?==

Disclaimer: The details furnished below are very basic and for illustration purposes only.

Why do we need energy? Note that I use the word energy and not electricity. On a broad scale it stimulates economic growth, etc.,
etc. but on a personal level it allows us to lead a comfortable lifestyle.

e.g. Flick a switch and Heat for cooking Entertainment such as television and radio Heat for water and interior of house Ironing
Electronic and electrical devices such as alarms, garage doors, etc.

In a modern household this energy is provided in the form of electricity which is powered via fossil fuels or nuclear.

How is electricity made? In a nutshell: By moving a magnet through or near a set of conducting coils.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng3.png|364px|]]

Most power stations produce steam through heat (nuclear reaction or burning fossil fuels), the steam drives a turbine which moves a
magnet relative to a coil (the generator like the above but on a much larger scale i.e. bigger magnets, bigger coils, etc.), which
produces electricity that is transmitted via a power network to our homes. Gas fired plants burn gas directly in a gas turbine to
produce the same desired relative motion between permanent magnet and coil.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng4.png|364px|]]

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng5.png|364px|]]

Coal, oil and gas are fossil fuels. Fossil fuels were created by decomposing organic (plant and animal) matter a long, long time ago
and are typically found underground. Different temperatures and pressures resulted in the organic matter transforming into coal, oil
or gas.

Why the fuss about fossil fuels?

# Fossil fuel power is bad news in the long run. It pollutes and contributes to the greenhouse effect (global warming resulting in melting polar ice caps, floods, droughts, disease, etc.).
# It s not going to last forever.
# Nuclear power is  cleaner  in terms of emissions but there s no proven way of disposing of the nuclear waste. Oh, and it won t last forever either!

Renewable Energy As the name suggests renewable energy lasts  forever . Solar (sun), wind, geothermal, wave, hydro and biomass
(organic) are all sources of energy that will last until the sun eventually explodes many billions of years from now. Hopefully the
human race will have moved from the earth by then! Generally the principal of renewable electricity generation is similar to fossil
fuel electricity generation in that electricity is generated by moving a magnet relative to a conducting coil. What is different is
the way energy is supplied to cause that motion.

The below are a few different types of available renewable energy technologies.



==Wind ==

Wind turbines catch wind that spins the blades. The blades are connected to a shaft that spins because of the wind. This spinning
shaft spins another shaft that turns a permanent magnet relative to conducting coils.

Note that the gears are used to convert the slow spinning of the 1st shaft to a faster spin on the 2nd shaft. The generator shaft needs
to spin at the correct speed to produce the right amount and quality of electricity. Some generators are now being modified to run at
slower speeds. This saves money as gears are not needed.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng8.png|364px|]]

==Biomass ==
Biomass is anything organic i.e. plant or animal matter. It can be used in the place of coal as per a normal coal fired plant and is
renewable as long as the biomass e.g. wood  is handled in a sustainable manner. By sustainable I mean that suitable farming
practices are used so that the land is not over farmed which will result in the soil becoming barren and nothing growing there again.

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng9.png|364px|]]

Biomass can also be processed using  anaerobic digestion to produce a gas that can be burned for heat or electricity. This  biogas  is made up of a number of other gases that are similar to those found in fossil fuel natural gas   Except the amount of the gases are different. E.g. Natural gas has about 94
Anaerobic digestion: Anaerobic means &quot;No air&quot;. Therefore  anaerobic digestion  means to digest in the absence of air. Bacteria that naturally exist in organic matter will convert organic matter to biogas and fertilizer when all the air is removed.

Thousands of anaerobic digesters have been installed in rural India, Nepal and China in rural area s where cow dung, human waste and
chicken litter (faeces) are all processed using anaerobic digestion to produce gas that can be burned in the home for cooking and
heating. The leftover is used as fertilizer. 

== Geothermal Energy ==
In some places on earth, the Earth's crust is thinner than others. As a result the heat from the Earth's core escapes. The heat can be
captured by converting water to steam, and using the steam to drive a steam generator as discussed above.

Hydroelectric power Water from a river is diverted to turn a water turbine to create electricity similar to the principles of steam
generation. The water is returned to the river after driving the turbine.

==Wave Energy ==
Some wave energy generators work similarly to wind turbines except that underwater ocean currents turns the blades
instead of wind  and of course most of the structure is under water!

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng10.png|364px|]]

Another concept uses the rising and falling of the tides to suck air in using a one way valve. As a result air becomes compressed in a
chamber and the compressed air is let out to drive a turbine which in turn drives a generator

[[Image:Fhsst_wrkeng11.png|301px|]]

These are relatively new technologies. Liquid fuels are used mainly for transportation. Petrol and diesel are the most common liquid fuels and are obtained from
oil.

Sasol is the only company in the world that makes liquid fuels from coal and will be one of the leading companies in the world to make
liquid fuels from natural gas! The Sasol petro-chemical plants are based in Sasolburg on the border of the Free State and in Secunda in
Mpumalanga. 

However, as discussed above coal, gas and oil are fossil fuels and are not renewable. Petrol and diesel are obtained from fossil fuels
and therefore pollute and contribute to the green house effect (global warming).

==Alternatives ==
===Biodiesel ===
Oil can be extracted from plants such as the soya bean, sunflower and rapeseed by pressing it through a filter.
This oil if mixed correctly with either methanol or dry ethanol and sodium hydroxide will separate the plant oil into biodiesel,
glycerol and fertilizer.

The biodiesel can be used as produced in a conventional diesel engine with little or no modifications required.

The glycerol can be refined a bit further for pharmaceutical companies to use, or can be used to make soap.

This information is not enough.

===Ethanol ===

Corn, maize and sugar cane can be used to make ethanol as a fuel substitute for petrol. It's made by the same fermentation process
used to make alcohol. Enzymes are often used to speed up the process.

In ethanol from sugar cane production, the leftover bagasse (the fibre part of the sugar cane) can be burned in a biomass power station to produce electricity.

===Hydrogen ===

Through the process of  electrolysis electricity (hopefully clean, renewable electricity!) can split
water into hydrogen and oxygen. The stored hydrogen can be used in a  fuel cell to create electricity in a process that is opposite to
electrolysis  to drive electric motors in a car. The hydrogen can also be burned directly in a modified internal
combustion engine.

In both cases the  waste product is water.</text>

'''Essay 2: Tiny, Violent Collisions'''

Author: Thomas D. Gutierrez

Tom Gutierrez received his Bachelor of Science and Master degrees in physics from San Jose State University in his home town of San Jose, California. As
a Master's student he helped work on a laser spectrometer at NASA Ames Research Centre. The instrument measured the ratio of different isotopes of
carbon in ''CO''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas and could be used for such diverse applications as medical diagnostics and space exploration. Later, he received his Ph.D. in
physics from the University of California, Davis where he performed calculations for various reactions in high energy physics collisions. He
currently lives in Berkeley, California where he studies proton-proton collisions seen at the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory on
Long Island, New York.

=High Energy Collisions=
Take an orange and expanded it to the size of the earth. The atoms of the earth-sized orange would themselves be about the size of regular oranges and
would fill the entire ''earth-orange''. Now, take an atom and expand it to the size of a football field. The nucleus of that atom would be about the
size of a tiny seed in the middle of the field. From this analogy, you can see that atomic nuclei are very small objects by human standards. They are
roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; meters in diameter - one-hundred thousand times smaller than a typical atom. These nuclei cannot be seen or studied via any
conventional means such as the naked eye or microscopes. So how do scientists study the structure of very small objects like atomic nuclei?

The simplest nucleus, that of hydrogen, is called the proton. Faced with the inability to isolate a single proton, open it up, and directly examine
what is inside, scientists must resort to a brute-force and somewhat indirect means of exploration: high energy collisions. By colliding protons
with other particles (such as other protons or electrons) at very high energies, one hopes to learn about what they are made of and how they work.
The American physicist Richard Feynman once compared this process to slamming delicate watches together and figuring out how they work by only
examining the broken debris. While this analogy may seem pessimistic, with sufficient mathematical models and experimental precision, considerable
information can be extracted from the debris of such high energy subatomic collisions. One can learn about both the nature of the forces at work and
also about the sub-structure of such systems. 

The experiments are in the category of ''high energy physics'' (also known as ''subatomic'' physics). The primary tool of scientific exploration in
these experiments is an extremely violent collision between two very, very small subatomic objects such as nuclei. As a general rule, the higher the
energy of the collisions, the more detail of the original system you are able to resolve. These experiments are operated at laboratories such as
CERN, SLAC, BNL, and Fermilab, just to name a few. The giant machines that perform the collisions are roughly the size of towns. For example, the RHIC
collider at BNL is a ring about 1 km in diameter and can be seen from space. The newest machine currently being built, the LHC at CERN, is a ring 9 km in
diameter!

Let's examine the kinematics of such a collisions in some detail...</text>

=Collisions and Explosions =

In most physics courses questions about collisions and explosions occur and to solve these we must use the ideas of momentum and energy  with a bit of
mathematics of course! This section allows you to pull the momentum and energy ideas together easily with some specific problems.</text>

=Types of Collisions =

We will consider two types of collisions in this section

* Elastic collisions
* Inelastic collisions

In both types of collision, total energy and total momentum is always conserved. Kinetic energy is conserved for elastic collisions, but not for
inelastic collisions.

==Elastic Collisions ==

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | An elastic collision is a collision where total momentum and total kinetic energy are both conserved.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that the total momentum and the total kinetic energy before an elastic collision is the same as after the collision. For these kinds of
collisions, the kinetic energy is not changed into another type of energy.


===Before the Collision ===

In the following diagram,two balls are rolling toward each other, about to collide

[[Image:Fhsst_expl1.png|354px|]]

Before the balls collide, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. The ball on the left has a momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_1&lt;/math&gt; and the ball on the right has a momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_2&lt;/math&gt;, it means the total momentum before the collision is 

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before} = \overrightarrow{p}_1+\overrightarrow{p}_2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (8.1)
|}

We calculate the total kinetic energy of the system in the same way. The ball on the left has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the ball on the right has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it means that the total kinetic energy before the collision is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}K_\mathrm{Before} = K_1+K_2\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | (8.2)
|}

=== After the Collision ===

The following diagram shows the balls after they collide

[[Image:Fhsst_expl2.png|271px|]]

After the balls collide and bounce off each other, they have new momenta and new kinetic energies. Like before, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. The ball on the left now has a momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_3&lt;/math&gt; and the ball on the right now has a  momentum which we call &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_4&lt;/math&gt;, it means the total momentum after the collision is 


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After} = \overrightarrow{p}_3+\overrightarrow{p}_4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.3)
|}

The ball on the left now has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the ball on the right now has a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, it means that the total kinetic energy after the collision is

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}K_\mathrm{After} = K_3+K_4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.4)
|}

Since this is an ''elastic'' collision, the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision and the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total kinetic energy after the collision

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mbox{Before}&amp;&amp;\mbox{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_1+\overrightarrow{p}_2 &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3+\overrightarrow{p}_4 \\&amp;\rm {\textbf{and}}&amp;\\K_\mathrm{Before} &amp;=&amp; K_\mathrm{After} \\K_1+K_2 &amp;=&amp; K_3+K_4\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 46 An Elastic Collision===
We will have a look at the collision between two pool balls. Ball 1 is at rest and ball 2 is moving towards it with a speed of 2 m·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The mass of each ball is 0.3 kg. After the balls collide elastically, ball 2 comes to a stop and ball 1 moves off. What is the final velocity of ball 1?

Step 1 : Draw the ''before'' diagram

Before the collision, ball 2 is moving  we will call it's momentum ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and it's kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ball 1 is at rest, so it has zero kinetic energy and momentum.

[[Image:Fhsst_expl3.png|314px|]]

Step 2 : Draw the ''after'' diagram

After the collision, ball 2 is at rest but ball 1 has a momentum which we call ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a kinetic energy which we call ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''RIAAN Note: second image on page 145 is missing'''

[[Image:Fhsst_expl4.png|314px|]]

Because the collision is elastic, we can solve the problem using momentum conservation or kinetic energy conservation. We will do it both ways to show that the answer is the same, whichever method you use.

Step 3 : Show the conservation of momentum

We start by writing down that the momentum before the collision &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the momentum after the collision &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After}&lt;/math&gt;


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mbox{Before}&amp;&amp;\mbox{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{Before}&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_\mathrm{After}\\\overrightarrow{p}_1+\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3+\overrightarrow{p}_4\\0+\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3+0\\\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.7)
|}

We know that momentum is just ''P'' = ''mv'', and we know the masses of the balls, so we can rewrite the conservation of momentum in terms of the velocities of the balls

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p}_2&amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p}_3\\m_2v_2&amp;=&amp;m_3v_3\\0.3v_2&amp;=&amp;0.3v_3\\v_2&amp;=&amp;v_3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.8)
|}

So ball 1 exits with the velocity that ball 2 started with!


{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_3=2[\mathrm{m.s^{-1}}]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.9)
|}


Step 4 : Show the conservation of kinetic energy

We start by writing down that the kinetic energy before the collision &lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{Before}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the kinetic energy after the collision &lt;math&gt;K_\mathrm{After}&lt;/math&gt;

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mbox{Before}&amp;&amp;\mbox{After}\\K_\mathrm{Before}&amp;=&amp;K_\mathrm{After}\\K_1+K_2 &amp;=&amp; K_3+K_4\\0+K_2&amp;=&amp;K_3+0\\K_2&amp;=&amp;K_3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.10)
|}

We know that kinetic energy is just &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{mv^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and we know the masses of the balls, so we can rewrite the conservation of kinetic energy in terms of
the velocities of the balls

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}K_2&amp;=&amp;K_3\\\frac{m_2v_2^2}2&amp;=&amp;\frac{m_3v_3^2}2\\0.15v_2^2&amp;=&amp;0.15v_3^2\\v_2^2&amp;=&amp;v_3^2\\v_2&amp;=&amp;v_3\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.11)
|}

So ball 1 exits with the velocity that ball 2 started with, which agrees with the answer we got when we used the conservation of momentum.

{| 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}v_3=2[\mathrm{m.s^{-1}}]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| class=&quot;eqno&quot; align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; | 
(8.12)
|}

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 47 Elastic Collision 2===
'''Question:''' Now for a slightly more difficult example. We have 2 marbles. Marble 1 has mass 50 g and marble 2 has mass
100&amp;nbsp g. I roll marble 2 along the ground towards marble 1 in the positive ''x''-direction. Marble 1 is initially at rest and marble 2
has a velocity of 3 &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive ''x''-direction. After they collide elastically, both marbles are moving. What is
the final velocity of each marble?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Firstly, put all the quantities into S.I. units. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{1} = 0.05 \rm {kg} &amp;\rm {and} &amp; m_{2} = 0.1\rm {kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 2 : 

Draw the picture:

&lt;u&gt;Before the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl5.png|372px|]]


&lt;u&gt;After the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl6.png|372px|]]

Step 3 : 

Since the collision is elastic, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved in the collision. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp;=&amp; E_{kAfter} \\&amp;\rm {and}&amp; \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

There are two unknowns (&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;) so we will need two equations to solve for them. We need to use both kinetic energy
conservation and momentum conservation in this problem.

Step 4 : 
Let's start with energy conservation. Then:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp;=&amp; E_{kAfter} \\\frac{1}{2}m_{1}{\overrightarrow{u_{1}}}^2 +\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\overrightarrow{u_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{2}m_{1}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2+ \frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 \\m_{1}{\overrightarrow{u_{1}}}^2 + m_{2}{\overrightarrow{u_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp;m_{1}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2+ m_{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;, and solving for &lt;math&gt;{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp;{\overrightarrow{u_{2}}}^2-\frac{m1}{m2}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; (3)^2 - \frac{(0.05)}{(0.10)}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9-\frac{1}{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\rm {\ \ \ \ (\textbf{A})}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 
Now we have simplified as far as we can, we move onto momentum conservation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\m_{1}\overrightarrow{u_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} &amp;=&amp;m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}+m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;=0, and solving for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}+m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} - m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} -\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; 2(3) - 2\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; 6 - 2\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\ \ \ \ (\textbf{B})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 6 : 

Now we can substitute (B) into (A) to solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9-\frac{1}{2}{\overrightarrow{v_{1}}}^2\\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9 - \frac{1}{2}(6-2\overrightarrow{v_{2}})^2 \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9 - \frac{1}{2}(36-24\overrightarrow{v_{2}}+4{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2) \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 9 - 18 + 12\overrightarrow{v_{2}}-2{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 \\3{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; -9 + 12\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 &amp;=&amp; 4\overrightarrow{v_{2}} -3 \\{\overrightarrow{v_{2}}}^2 -4\overrightarrow{v_{2}} +3 &amp;=&amp; 0 \\(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}-3)(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}-1)&amp;=&amp; 0 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}}=3 &amp;\rm {\textbf{or}}&amp; \overrightarrow{v_{2}}=1\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We were lucky in this question because we could factorise. If you can't factorise, then you can always solve using the formula for solving quadratic equations. Remember:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, just to check:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)} \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{2} \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2} \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 2 \pm 1 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}}=3 &amp;\rm {\textbf{or}}&amp; \overrightarrow{v_{2}}=1\rm {\ \ same \ as \ before}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 7 : 

So finally, substituting into equation (B) to get &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}=6-2\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}= 3 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; then

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}=6-2(3) = 0 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


But, according to the question, marble 1 is moving after the collision. So &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{1}} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \neq 3&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; \underline{1 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ \ \ in \ the \ positive \ x-direction}}\\&amp;\rm {and}&amp; \\\overrightarrow{v_{1}} &amp;=&amp; \underline{4 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ \ \ in \ the \ positive \ x-direction}}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Inelastic Collisions ==
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | '''Definition:''' 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | An inelastic collision is a collision in which total momentum is conserved but total kinetic energy is not conserved 
|- 
| align=&quot;CENTER&quot; | the kinetic energy is transformed into other kinds of energy.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So the total momentum before an inelastic collisions is the same as after the collision. But the total kinetic energy before and after the
inelastic collision is different. Of course this does not mean that total energy has not been conserved, rather the energy has been transformed into another type of energy.

As a rule of thumb, inelastic collisions happen when the colliding objects are distorted in some way. Usually they change their shape. To modify
the shape of an object requires energy and this is where the ''missing'' kinetic energy goes. A classic example of an inelastic collision is a car crash. The cars change shape and there is a noticeable change in the kinetic energy of the cars before and after the collision. This energy was
used to bend the metal and deform the cars. Another example of an inelastic collision is shown in the following picture. 

Here an asteroid (the small circle) is moving through space towards the moon (big circle).
&lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the moon and the asteroid collide, the total momentum of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} = \overrightarrow{p_{m}}+\overrightarrow{p_{a}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{m}}&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{moon}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{a}}&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_{asteroid}}&lt;/math&gt; and the total kinetic energy of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{Before} = E_{km} + E_{ka}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl7.png|381px|]]

When the asteroid collides '''inelastically''' with the moon, its kinetic energy is transformed mostly into heat energy. If this heat energy is large enough, it can cause the asteroid and the area of the moon's surface that it hit, to melt into liquid rock! From the force of impact of the asteroid, the molten rock flows outwards to form a moon crater. 

[[Image:Fhsst_expl8.png|381px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision, the total momentum of the system will be the same as before. But since this collision is inelastic, (and you can see that a change in the shape of objects has taken
place!), total kinetic energy is not the same as before the collision. 

[[Image:Fhsst_expl9.png|363px|]]

So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{m}}+\overrightarrow{p_{a}} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\&amp;\rm {\textbf{but}}&amp; \\E_{kBefore} &amp;\neq&amp; E_{kAfter} \\E_{km} + E_{ka} &amp;\neq&amp; E_{kAfter}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;background-color:red&quot; /&gt;

===Worked Example 48 Inelastic Collision===

'''Question:''' Let's consider the collision of two cars. Car 1 is at rest and Car 2 is moving at a speed of &lt;math&gt;2\mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; in the negative ''x''-direction. Both cars each have a mass of 500kg. The cars collide inelastically and stick together. What is the resulting velocity of the resulting mass of metal?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture:
&lt;u&gt;Before the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl10.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After the collision:&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Fhsst_expl11.png|372px|]]

Step 2 : 

We know the collision is inelastic and there was a definite change in shape of the objects involved in the collision - there were two objects to start and after the collision there was one big mass of
metal! Therefore, we know that kinetic energy is not conserved in the collision but total momentum is conserved. 

So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp; \neq &amp; E_{kAfter} \\&amp; \rm {\textbf{but}} &amp; \\\overrightarrow{p_{TBefore}} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

So we must use conservation of momentum to solve this problem. Take the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{TBefore}} &amp; = &amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}} &amp;=&amp;\overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\m_{1}\overrightarrow{u_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{u_{2}} &amp;=&amp; (m_{1} +m_{2})\overrightarrow{v} \\0 + 500(-2) &amp;=&amp; (500+500)\overrightarrow{v} \\-1000 &amp;=&amp; 1000\overrightarrow{v} \\\overrightarrow{v} &amp;=&amp; -1 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v} = \underline{1 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ in \ the \ negative \ x-direction} }\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

= Explosions =

When an object explodes, it breaks up into more than one piece and it therefore changes its shape. Explosions occur when energy is transformed from one kind ''e.g. chemical potential energy'' to another ''e.g. heat energy'' or kinetic energy extremely quickly. 

So, like in inelastic collisions, total kinetic energy is not conserved in explosions. But total momentum is always conserved. Thus if the momenta of some of the parts of the exploding object are measured, we can use momentum conservation to solve the problem!

The Tunguska event was an aerial explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya (Stony) Tunguska River in what is now Evenkia, Siberia, at 7:17 AM on June 30, 1908. The size of the blast was
later estimated to be equivalent to between 10 and 15 million tons of regular explosive. It felled an estimated 60 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers.

At around 7:15 AM, Tungus natives and Russian settlers in the hills northwest of Lake Baikal observed a huge fireball moving across the sky, nearly as bright as the Sun. A few minutes later, there was a flash that lit up half of the sky, followed by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows up to 650 km away (the same as the distance from Bloemfontein to Durban!). The explosion registered on seismic stations across Europe and Asia, and produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in Britain. Over the next few weeks, night skies over Europe and western Russia glowed brightly enough for people to read
by.

Had the object responsible for the explosion hit the Earth a few hours later, it would have exploded over Europe instead of the sparsely-populated Tunguska region, producing massive loss of human
life.

In the following picture, a closed can of baked beans is put on a
stove or fire:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl13.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the can heats up and explodes, the total momentum
of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{can}} \\&amp;=&amp; 0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and the total kinetic energy of the system is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kBefore} &amp;=&amp; E_{kcan} \\&amp;=&amp; 0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

since the can isn't moving.Once the mixture of beans, juice and air inside the can reach a certain temperature, the pressure inside the can becomes so great that the can explodes! Beans and sharp pieces of metal can fly out in all directions. Energy in the system has been transformed from heat energy into kinetic energy. 

[[Image:Fhsst_expl14.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the explosion, the c an is completely destroyed. But momentum is always conserved, so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} +\overrightarrow{p_{2}} +\overrightarrow{p_{3}} + \overrightarrow{p_{4}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} +\overrightarrow{p_{2}} +\overrightarrow{p_{3}} + \overrightarrow{p_{4}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

However, the kinetic energy of the system is not conserved. The can's shape was changed in the explosion. Before the explosion the can was not moving, but after the explosion, the pieces
of metal and baked beans were moving when they were flying out in all directions! So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kB} \neq E_{kA}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Worked Example 49 Explosions 1==

'''Question:''' An object with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kg is sitting at rest. Suddenly it explodes into two pieces. One piece has a mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 kg and moves off in the
negative x-direction at &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_1}=3{m}{s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. What is the velocity of the other piece? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the explosion, the object is at rest:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl15.png|372px|]]


&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the explosion, the two pieces move off:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl16.png|372px|]]

Step 2 : 

Now we know that in an explosion, total kinetic energy is not conserved. There is a definite change in shape of the exploding object! But we can always use momentum conservation to solve the problem. 

So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But the object was initially at rest so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Now we know that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 5 kg but we do not know what the mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is. However, we do know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{Tot} &amp;=&amp; m_1+m_2 \\m_2 &amp; =&amp; m_{Tot} -m_1 \\&amp;=&amp;10 \rm {\ kg}-5 \rm {\ kg} \\&amp;=&amp;5 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we can substitute all the values we know into equation (A) and solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Let's choose the positive ''x''-direction to have a postive sign and the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})} \\0 &amp;=&amp; 5(-3) + 5\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\0 &amp;=&amp; -15 + 5\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \\5\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 15 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; +3 \rm {\ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} = \underline{3 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ in \ the \ positive \ x-direction.} }\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 50 Explosions 2==

'''Question:''' An object with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Tot&lt;/sub&gt; =15 kg is sitting at rest. Suddenly it explodes into two pieces. One piece has a mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5000 g and moves off in the
positive x-direction at &lt;math&gt;v_1=7{m}{s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. What is the final velocity of the other piece? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl17.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

'''Riaan Note: image on page 156 is missing'''

[[Image:Fhsst_expl18.png|372px|]]

Step 2 : 

Convert all units into S.I. units:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{1} &amp;=&amp; 5000 \rm {\ g} \\m_{1} &amp;=&amp; 5 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Now we know that in an explosion, total kinetic energy is not conserved. There is a definite change in shape of the exploding object! But we can always use momentum conservation to solve the problem. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But the object was initially at rest so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we know that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 5 kg but we do not know what the mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is. However, we do know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{Tot} &amp;=&amp; m_1+m_2 \\m_2 &amp; =&amp; m_{Tot} -m_1 \\&amp;=&amp;15 \rm {\ kg}-5 \rm {\ kg} \\&amp;=&amp;10 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 5 : 

Now we can substitute all the values we know into equation (A) and solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Let's choose the positive ''x''-direction to have a postive sign and the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})} \\0 &amp;=&amp; 5(7) + 10(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}) \\0 &amp;=&amp; 35 + 10(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}) \\10(\overrightarrow{v_{2}}) &amp;=&amp; -35 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; -3.5 \rm {\ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} = \underline{3.5 \ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}\rm {\ in \ the \ negative \ x-direction.} }\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

= Explosions: Energy and Heat =

In explosions, you have seen that kinetic energy is not conserved. But remember that total energy is always conserved. Let's
look at what happens to the energy in some more detail. If a given amount of energy is released in an explosion it is not
necessarily all transformed into kinetic energy. Due to the deformation of the exploding object, often
a large amount of the energy is used to break chemical bonds and heat up the pieces.

Energy is conserved but some of it is transferred through non-conservative processes like heating. This just means that we
cannot get the energy back. It will be radiated into the environment as heat energy but it is all still accounted for.

Now we can start to mix the ideas of momentum conservation with energy transfer to make longer problems. These problems are
not more complicated just longer. We will start off short and then combine the different ideas later on.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Long problems should be treated like a number of smaller problems. Focus on them one at a time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Worked Example 51 Energy Accounting 1==

'''Question:''' An object with a mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 17 kg explodes into two pieces of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 7 kg and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kg; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a velocity of 9 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the negative ''x''-direction and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a velocity of 
6.3 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the positive ''x''-direction. If the explosion released a total energy of 2000 J, how much was used in a non-conservative way? 

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

'''Riaan Note: first image on page 157 is missing '''

[[Image:Fhsst_expl19.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl20.png|372px|]]


Step 2 : 

We are asked how much energy was used in a non-conservative fashion. This is the difference between how much energy was used in a conservative fashion and how much was used in total. We are lucky because we have everything we need to determine the kinetic energy of both pieces. The kinetic energy of the pieces is energy that was used in a conservative way.

Step 3 : 

The sum of the kinetic energy for the two blocks is the total kinetic energy of the pieces. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; E_{k1} + E_{k2} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}^{2} +\frac{1}{2}m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}^{2} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(7)(9)^{2} + \frac{1}{2}(10)(6.3)^{2} \\&amp;=&amp; 283.5 + 198.45 \\E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 481.95 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

The total energy that was transformed into kinetic energy is 481.95 J. We know that 2000 J of energy were released in total. the
question makes no statements about other types of energy so we can assume that the difference was lost in a non-conservative
way. Thus the total energy lost in non-conservative work is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E - E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 2000 - 481.95 \\&amp;=&amp; 1518.05 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Worked Example 52 Energy Accounting 2==

'''Question:''' An object at rest, with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 kg, explodes into two pieces (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.3 kg. ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a
velocity of 17 m·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the negative ''x''-direction. If the explosion released a total energy of 800 J, 

# What is the velocity of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?
# How much energy does it carry?
# And how much energy was used in a non-conservative way?

'''Answer:'''

Step 1 : 

Draw the picture. &lt;u&gt;Before&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl21.png|372px|]]

&lt;u&gt;After&lt;/u&gt; the collision:

[[Image:Fhsst_expl22.png|372px|]]

Step 2 : 

Now we know that in an explosion, total kinetic energy is not conserved. There is a definite change in shape of the exploding
object! But we can always use momentum conservation to solve the problem. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{After}} \\\overrightarrow{p_{Before}} &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But the object was initially at rest so:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; \overrightarrow{p_{1}} + \overrightarrow{p_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad (\textbf{A})}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 3 : 

Now we know that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 2.3 kg but we do not know what the mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is. However, we do know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}m_{Tot} &amp;=&amp; m_1+m_2 \\m_2 &amp; =&amp; m_{Tot} -m_1 \\&amp;=&amp;4 \rm {\ kg}-2.3 \rm {\ kg} \\&amp;=&amp;1.7 \rm {\ kg}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 4 : 

Now we can substitute all the values we know into equation (A) and solve for &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. Let's 
choose the positive ''x''-direction to have a postive sign and the negative ''x''-direction to have a negative sign:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}0 &amp;=&amp; m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}} + m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}} \rm {\qquad  (\textbf{A})} \\0 &amp;=&amp; (2.3)(-17) + 1.7\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\0 &amp;=&amp; -39.1 + 1.7\overrightarrow{v_{2}}\\1.7\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 39.1 \\\overrightarrow{v_{2}} &amp;=&amp; 23 \rm {\ \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


* &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{v_{2}} = 23 \mathrm{m.s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; in the positive x-direction
Step 5 : 

Now we need to calculate the energy that the second piece carries:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{k2} &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m_{2}\overrightarrow{v_{2}}^{2}\\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(1.7)(23)^2 \\&amp;=&amp; 449.65 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* The kinetic energy of the second piece is &lt;math&gt;E_{k2}=449.65 J&lt;/math&gt;  

Step 6 : 

Now the amount of energy used in a non-conservative way in the explosion, is the difference between the amount of energy released in
the explosion and the total kinetic energy of the exploded pieces:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E - E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 800 - E_{kTot} \\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We know that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; E_{k1} + E_{k2} \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}m_{1}\overrightarrow{v_{1}}^{2} + 449.65 \\&amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(2.3)(17)^{2} + 449.65 \\&amp;=&amp; 332.35 + 449.65 \\&amp;=&amp; 782 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Step 7 : 

So going back to:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}E - E_{kTot} &amp;=&amp; 800 - E_{kTot} \\&amp;=&amp; 800 - 782 \\&amp;=&amp; 18 \rm {\ J}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* &lt;u&gt;18 J of energy was used in a non-conservative way in the explosion&lt;/u&gt;</text>
