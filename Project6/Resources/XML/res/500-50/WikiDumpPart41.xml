'''Offline and Online Learning'''
One of the most distinguishable characteristics of blending learning is its ability to combine two different forms/setting of learning and instruction. (Singh, 2001) In blended learning, instruction takes place in an offline and online setting. In the offline setting, the instruction takes place in a traditional, face-to-face classroom. The online setting usually takes place using the Internet. Although there are distance courses solely designed to have all of its instruction take place online through the use of the Web, blended learning utilizes the atmosphere of both offline and online settings.

The ''dual settings'' of online and offline learning are optimally combined to administer the responsibilities of sharing content, establishing and continuing communication, and stimulating interaction. Ideally, the online and offline components of a blended learning class are more or less symbiotic, where the interactions and successes of each setting feed off each other.

In blended learning the web enhancements of the online portion also contribute to not only aiding in the pragmatic goals of the classroom, but to augmenting the pedagogical goals as well. (Wingard, 2004) The percentage of time and activity spent by students either on the online or offline classroom is usually dependent on the nature of the course and the preference of the instructor.

Early results of studies show an increase in student-instructor interaction and student preparation in use of course material. (Wingard, 2005)

'''Structured and Unstructured Learning'''
Structured or formal learning occurs when content is organized like chapters in a text book. Unstructured learning takes place informally online through synchronous and asynchronous discussions as well as e-mail correspondence. In a blended learning environment instructors can develop a program that incorporates both types of learning together. (Singh, 2001) Although traditionally used in higher education, blended learning is making its way into elementary, middle, junior high, and high schools around the country.

A structured learning program must encourage students to be actively engaged. More importantly, it must allow the instructor to track student use of the program, manage access to the next stage on the basis of completion or assessment, and follow up with another form of communication to students who are not completing work. (Hoyle, 2003) Finally, it should have specific learning objectives and expected outcomes. A blended learning environment with a structured program can benefit those students who learn better on their own rather than in the traditional classroom setting. (Zenger and Uehlein, 2001) This can be especially helpful in the k-12 classroom as individual student needs must be met. One common pitfall of structured online learning is merely the repackaging of current class curriculum and placing it in an online environment. (Hoyle, 2003)

In an unstructured online environment, students actually have some control of their learning experiences. Some students prefer the discovery method of learning while others prefer more straightforward content. (Zenger and Uehlein, 2001) The freedom to interact and collaborate with peers without the teacher looming overhead can be highly motivating for some students. This would be beneficial for younger students with learning disabilities in that they may recognize their individual strengths in this new environment. In an unstructured learning environment, assessment is especially important to ensure objectives have been met. (Hoyle, 2003)

Best practices in blended learning contain structured and unstructured components.
* Create a structured core curriculum of learning activities that are taught using a variety of instructional methods.
* Support an environment in which students can learn smaller parts and work their way up to more complex ideas.
* Create a classroom in which students can learn informally.
* Provide technological support and for students.
* Provide an easy to use environment. (Oakes and Casewit, 2003)


Personal Experiences – Lisa Abate (2004) developed an unstructured asynchronous component to her classroom while on maternity leave. An online classroom was created using a common educational website where Lisa communicated with her students. She integrated the concepts her substitute teacher discussed in the classroom and included online extensions for her students. Not only did these teachers “team teach”, but they did it from different places within the blended learning environment.


'''Off-the-Shelf Content vs. Custom Content'''
One of the greatest advantages of Blended learning is that it gives students and instructors the opportunity to utilize a wide range of resource materials. Although there does not seem to be much research about the types of materials used, students and instructors are not limited to those resources which can be exploited in a traditional face-to-face setting. Rather, the instructor can combine all of the traditional resources, which include lectures and assigned readings, with interactive, self-paced materials.

Traditional textbooks increasingly offer multi-media components as part of their ancillary materials. These might include opportunities for extra skill practice, online assessments, and links to resources that would not realistically fit into a traditional bound book. The instructor may include these extra resources as part of the learning modules in a blended course. Theoretically, the instructor could create a blended course entirely from these ancillary materials for a completely off-the-shelf learning experience.

Alternatively, the instructor could choose to create a course without utilizing a traditional textbook at all. Using the wealth of material that is available online, the instructor can synthesize materials to create a unique learning context, combining recorded lectures, online articles, and material up-loaded by the instructor. While this has always been possible in traditional face-to-face courses, particularly at the post-High-School level, it has not always been feasible for the K-12 instructor.

An additional possibility, which would not be possible in a traditional setting, is the creation of the forum as a learning resource. (NSW, 2005) Although discussion has been a part of face-to-face instruction, the learning forum provides a virtual space in which discussion can occur, as well as a mechanism for recording the discussion that ensues. Students not only construct their own knowledge in this space, but can return to it at a later time for clarification. The instructor can also use this permanent record to assess student participation, and include new viewpoints as resources for subsequent learning modules or courses.


'''Implications for K-12 Education'''

'''Restructuring the Class'''
One of the most difficult challenges of transforming a traditional K-12 class into a blended learning classroom requires a shift in an educator’s teaching paradigm.  Instead of preparing the necessary materials for the off-line setting of a traditional classroom, the blended learning K-12 teacher now must also organize and maintain the on-line, virtual classroom. The time, planning, and organization needed to restructure a K-12 blended classroom requires the educator to, in essence, plan and organize a class in two settings, which complement each other in terms of scheduling, content, lesson flow, and organization.

A blended learning classroom requires the K-12 instructor to develop teaching materials prior to the start of class.  Other K-12 classroom models have also used other characteristics of blended learning for instructing students through the Web and other electronic tools.  Web-enhanced campus courses, Web-centric courses, Web-courses using distance learning and campus settings, and traditional distance courses have implemented web use to certain degrees.  Each category of web integration requires a varied percentage of packaged developed material, ranging from fifty to one hundred percent.  (Boettcher and Conrad 1999)  However, the percentage of prepared material web material in blended K-12 course ultimately depends on teacher preference, student/school technological capabilities, and other lesson dependent factors.

Like the other models of Web integration in the K-12 classroom, blended learning courses need to successfully address and incorporate four of the following components:

* Administration – organization of the syllabus, increase teacher productivity/efficiency, distributing/collecting material, and scheduling duties
* Assessment – providing feedback, tracking student progress, and testing opportunities
* Content Delivery – communicating content through different learning styles, using multimedia, incorporating learning activities, using the Internet for the acquisition of knowledge
* Community – building the classroom community through synchronous/threaded chats, providing office/help hours to communicate online (Schmidt 2002)

'''Benefits of Blended Learning'''
One of the more potentially impacting benefits of blended learning is in the area of student accessibility.  According to Jeffrey, the ability to use the Web for the classroom has the potential to serve any student, at any time, in any place.  (Jeffrey 2003)  Likewise, the characteristics of blended learning also allow its K-12 students the same advantages in terms of accessibility.  A blended learning’s online course components could possibly minimize the accessibility concerns for the following K-12 students who cannot meet in the traditional classroom:

* students in rural or small school districts where the proximity of the classroom is the main challenge to content/material accessibility
* home-schooled students with instruction in subjects their parents feel unable to teach
* handicapped or hospitalized students who cannot travel to the traditional classroom
* expelled students who are required not to attend the traditional classroom as a consequence but still can have access to material to prevent falling behind academically (Jeffrey 2003)

In addition to accessibility issues, blended learning also possesses the ability to collect and organize digital content material can also eliminate the use of physical textbooks in the classroom.  Electronic content and resources can substitute for the information found in textbooks, or the electronic copies of textbooks can be downloaded onto computers and laptops, thus eliminating the high cost of purchasing textbooks and the physical and problematic concerns some educators have with students carrying heavy textbooks.  The delivery of textbook information in an electronic format seems ideal for blended learning classrooms.  According to one article, allowing teachers to use digital media instead of prescribed textbooks can open up all kinds of creativity and empowering tools of instruction.  (Colin 2005)</text>

==Studies==
'''''Risk-related therapy:'''''
*'''POG 8743''' - PMID 9060959 &amp;mdash; &quot;Genetic staging of unresectable or metastatic neuroblastoma in infants: a Pediatric Oncology Group study.&quot; Bowman LC et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Mar 5;89(5):373-80.
*:Infants. Treated with standard chemotherapy. Showed that pts who were hyperdiploid had more favorable responses compared to diploid pts. NYMC gene amplification and elevated LDH were predictive for worse outcome.
*'''POG 9243''' - 
*'''POG 8742''' and '''POG 9244''' - PMID 9516866 &amp;mdash; &quot;Event-free survival of children with biologically favorable neuroblastoma based on the degree of initial tumor resection: results from the Pediatric Oncology Group.&quot; Strother D et al. Eur J Cancer. 1997 Oct;33(12):2121-5.
*:Pts &gt; 1 yr old, INSS Stages 2B and 3. 

===Low-risk===
*'''POG 9641''' NCT00003119
**Purpose: supportive-care only for low risk disease
**Pts with biologically-defined low-risk disease. Treatment with surgery followed by observation. Chemotherapy reserved for recurrence.
**Awaiting publication


*'''GPOH NB95-S and NB97''' (Germany)(1995-2004)
**Prospective. 340 infants, age &lt;1 year, with Stage 1-3, and MYCN-. Surgery if risk of operation was low (56%); chemotherapy only if threatening symptoms (17%). 93 patients (27%) observed with U/S q6 weeks and MRI q3 months. 
**'''2008''' PMID 18349403 -- &quot;Localized infant neuroblastomas often show spontaneous regression: results of the prospective trials NB95-S and NB97.&quot; (Hero B, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 20;26(9):1504-10.)
***Subset analysis of 93 patients who were observed only.
***Outcome: spontaneous regression 47%, no change 11%, local progression/stage 4S progression 38%, stage 4 progression 4%. Time-to-regression variable, 1-18 months after diagnosis, in 34% patients &gt;1 year. Median OS, 3-year OS and MDFS not different from patients treated with surgery or chemotherapy
***Conclusion: Spontaneous regression seen regularly in infants with localized neuroblastoma, and not limited to first year of life. Wait-and-see strategy justified

===Stage 1-2===
'''''Surgery alone:'''''
*'''POG 8104 / POG 8441''' (1981-86)
**Prospective. 101 pts with POG / St Jude Stage A (same as INSS 1 but allows for lymph nodes adherent to tumor but removed in resection). Protocol allowed all stages, but this report focuses on Stage A.
***Treatment: Surgical excision alone.
**PMID 3411339, 1988 &amp;mdash; &quot;Localized neuroblastoma treated by surgery: a Pediatric Oncology Group Study.&quot; Nitschke R et al. J Clin Oncol. 1988 Aug;6(8):1271-9.
***2-yr DFS 89%
**Conclusion: surgery is sufficient treatment for Stage A (equivalent to Stage 1).

===Stage 3-4===
'''''High risk:'''''
*'''CCG 3891''' (1991-96)
**Randomized. 539 pts. High-risk, Evans Stage IV, or Stage III with MYCN amplification, elevated ferritin, or unfavorable histology. 
***''Initial chemotherapy:'' 5 cycles of cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. ''Surgery and RT:'' given between cycles 4+5 for gross residual disease. 
***Randomized to: 1) Myeloablative therapy and ABMT with TBI vs. 2) intensive nonmyeloablative chemo (cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide x 3 cycles)
***2nd randomization: +/- 6 cycles of 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin)
**PMID 10519894, 1999 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma with intensive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, autologous bone marrow transplantation, and 13-cis-retinoic acid. Children's Cancer Group.&quot; Matthay KK et al. N Engl J Med. 1999 Oct 14;341(16):1165-73. 
***3-yr EFS 34% (ABMT) vs 22%, 46% (retinoic acid) vs 29%. 
**Conclusion: survival benefit for ABMT and 13-cis-retinoic acid in high risk pts.

===Stage 4S===
*'''CCG 3881''' (1989-95)
**Prospective. 80 pts. Evans Stage IV-S (concordant with INSS 4S). Surgical staging in 49. Trial enrolled good, intermediate, and selected poor-risk neuroblastoma, but report focuses on Stage IV-S pts only. 
***Treatment: supportive care only.  31 pts had resection. Chemo +/- RT was given for rapid tumor growth and compromise of vital organs. 
**PMID 10653863, 2000 &amp;mdash; &quot;Favorable biology and outcome of stage IV-S neuroblastoma with supportive care or minimal therapy: a Children's Cancer Group study.&quot; Nickerson HJ et al. J Clin Oncol. 2000 Feb;18(3):477-86.
***Median f/u 43 mos. 5-yr EFS was 86%, OS 92%. Supportive care alone was possible in 57% of pts.  EFS worse for infants &lt; 2 months age. Favorable histology in 96%, no pts had MYCN amplification. 
**Conclusion: many pts with Stage 4S have excellent survival with no therapy. 

===Abdominal neuroblastoma===
*'''Emory; 2005''' PMID 16302219 -- &quot;Comparison of conventional to intensity modulated radiation therapy for abdominal neuroblastoma.&quot; (Paulino AC, Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Nov 21; [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 6 children, 3 different RT techniques compared
***Technique A: parallel-opposed AP/PA fields to midline
***Technique B: IMRT, CTV = tumor after chemo + 1.5 cm margin; PTV = CTV + 0.5 cm margin
***Technique C: as B + vertebral bodies included in PTV
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Dose to the PTV and CTV were not significantly different using the three techniques. Although Technique C was the best method of RT delivery in ''midline tumors'' with respect to kidney doses, this was at a cost of a higher mean dose to the liver, stomach, and spleen. This, together with the theoretical increase in secondary malignancies, should be considered when treating a child with IMRT techniques. IMRT was not found to be better than the conventional AP/PA field for ''lateralized tumors''.&quot;

==Treatment Overview==
*'''Low-risk:''' 
**Surgery alone
**Chemotherapy for persistence or recurrence (carbo/etoposide or carbo/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin)
**RT for recurrence salvage
*'''Intermediate-risk:''' 
**Surgery followed by chemotherapy
**Chemotherapy: Short course of chemotherapy (4 courses) if favorable histology. Longer course (8 courses) if unfavorable histology. 
**RT (18 to 30 Gy) for local persistence or recurrence of disease
*'''High-risk:''' 
**Initial resection or biopsy
**Aggressive induction chemotherapy
**Maximal surgical resection to achieve a complete response or debulk tumor
**Myeloablative therapy and ABMT (may use total body irradiation)
**Consolidative RT to post-induction primary and metastatic sites with persistent MIBG avidity on pretransplant scans
*'''4S:'''
**If acute respiratory or abdominal compartment syndrome due to massive liver enlargement

==Radiation technique==
*Fields (per Perez 8th edition)
**Primary tumor + 2cm margin to block edge
**Regional lymph nodes if they were ragiographically or pathologically involved at any time during disease course
**Elective mediastinal irradiation is typically not recommended due to significant morbidity
*Dose
**Children &lt; 18 months: 15 Gy + 5-10 Gy boost
**Older children: 15-20 Gy + 5-10 Gy boost
**Stage 4S: 4.5 Gy in 3 fractions (1.5 Gy/fx) for liver.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikibooks help}}

Wiki pages can be exported in a special XML format to import into another MediaWiki installation or use it elsewise for instance for analysing the content.

== How to export ==
There are at least four ways to export pages:

* Paste the name of the articles in the box in [[Special:Export]] or use the URL &lt;tt&gt;{{SERVER}}/wiki/Special:Export/article's_name&lt;/tt&gt;. You can get a list of all page names (in a specified namespace) at [[Special:Allpages]].
* The backup script &lt;tt&gt;[http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/wikipedia/phase3/maintenance/dumpBackup.php dumpBackup.php]&lt;/tt&gt; dumps all the wiki pages into an XML file. &lt;tt&gt;dumpBackup.php&lt;/tt&gt; only works on MediaWiki 1.5 or newer. You need to have direct access to the server to run this script. Dumps of mediawiki projects are (more or less) regularly made available at http://download.wikipedia.org. 
* There is a [[en:OAI-PMH|OAI-PMH]]-interface to regularly fetch pages that have been modified since a specific time. For Wikimedia projects this interface is not publically available. OAI-PMH contains a wrapper format around the actual exported articles.
* Use the [http://pywikipediabot.sourceforge.net/ Python Wikipedia Robot Framework]. This won't be explained here.

By default only the current version of a page is included. Optionally you can get all versions with date, time, user name and edit summary.

Additionally you can copy the SQL database. This is how dumps of the database were made available before MediaWiki 1.5 and it won't be explained here further.

===Using 'Special:Export'===
First you need to know the names of pages you wish to export. To export '''all pages of a namespace''':
* Use [[Special:Allpages]] and choose the desired namespace. 
* Copy the list of page names to a text editor
* Put all names on separate lines
* In the case that the selected namespace is not the main namespace: insert the namespace prefix before the page names e.g. 'Help:Contents'
Now you are ready to '''perform the export'''.
* Go to [[Special:Export]] and paste all your page names into the textbox, making sure there are no empty lines.
* Click 'Submit query'
* Save the resulting XML to a file using your browser's save facility.
and finally...
* Open the XML file in a text editor. Scroll to the bottom to '''check for error messages'''.
Now you can use this XML file to [[Help:Importing|perform an import]].

== Export format ==

The format of the XML file you receive is the same in all ways. It is codified in [[w:XML Schema|XML Schema]] at http://www.mediawiki.org/xml/export-0.3.xsd This format is not intended for viewing in a web browser. Some browsers show you pretty-printed XML with &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; links to view or hide selected parts. Alternatively the XML-source can be viewed using the &quot;view source&quot; feature of the browser, or after saving the XML file locally, with a program of choice. It you directly read the XML source it won't be difficult to find the actual wikitext. If you don't use a special XML editor &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; appear as &amp;amp;lt; and &amp;amp;gt;, to avoid a conflict with XML tags; to avoid ambiguity, &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; is coded as &quot;&amp;amp;amp;&quot;.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In the current version the export format does not contain an XML replacement of wiki markup (see [[Wikipedia DTD]] for an older proposal). You only get the wikitext as you get when editing the article.

=== Example ===

&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;mediawiki xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    &lt;page&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;restrictions&gt;sysop&lt;/restrictions&gt;
      &lt;revision&gt;
        &lt;timestamp&gt;2001-01-15T13:15:00Z&lt;/timestamp&gt;
        &lt;contributor&gt;&lt;username&gt;Foobar&lt;/username&gt;&lt;/contributor&gt;
        &lt;comment&gt;I have just one thing to say!&lt;/comment&gt;
        &lt;text&gt;A bunch of [[text]] here.&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;minor /&gt;
      &lt;/revision&gt;
      &lt;revision&gt;
        &lt;timestamp&gt;2001-01-15T13:10:27Z&lt;/timestamp&gt;
        &lt;contributor&gt;&lt;ip&gt;10.0.0.2&lt;/ip&gt;&lt;/contributor&gt;
        &lt;comment&gt;new!&lt;/comment&gt;
        &lt;text&gt;An earlier [[revision]].&lt;/text&gt;
      &lt;/revision&gt;
    &lt;/page&gt;
    
    &lt;page&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Talk:Page title&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;revision&gt;
        &lt;timestamp&gt;2001-01-15T14:03:00Z&lt;/timestamp&gt;
        &lt;contributor&gt;&lt;ip&gt;10.0.0.2&lt;/ip&gt;&lt;/contributor&gt;
        &lt;comment&gt;hey&lt;/comment&gt;
        &lt;text&gt;WHYD YOU LOCK PAGE??!!! i was editing that jerk&lt;/text&gt;
      &lt;/revision&gt;
    &lt;/page&gt;
  &lt;/mediawiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Processing XML export ===

There are undoubtedly many tools which can process the exported XML. If you process a large number of pages (for instance a whole dump) you probably won't be able to get the document in main memory so you will need a parser based on [[w:SAX|SAX]] or other event-driven methods.

You can also just use regular expressions to directly process parts of the XML code. This may be faster than other methods but not recommended because it's difficult to maintain.

Please list methods and tools for processing XML export here:

* [[w:Wikipedia:Computer help desk/ParseMediaWikiDump|Parse::MediaWikiDump]] is a perl module for processing the XML dump file. 
* [[m:Processing MediaWiki XML with STX]] - Stream based XML transformation
*  The [[m:IBM History flow project]] can read it after applying a small [[w:Python programming language|Python]] program, [http://dunck.us/anabasis/archives/2005/10/13/getting-started-with-history-flow/ export-historyflow-expand.py].

=== Details and practical advice ===
* To determine the namespace of a page you have to match its title to the prefixed defined in
&lt;tt&gt;/mediawiki/siteinfo/namespaces/namespace&lt;/tt&gt;
* Possible restrictions are

= Goals =

[[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic | Sentential logic]] treated whole sentences and truth functional relations among them.  '''Predicate logic''' treats more fine-grained logical features.  This page will informally  describe of the logic features of English captured by predicate logic.

== Predicate logic goals ==

=== Predicates and terms ===

We distinguish between ''predicates'' and ''terms''.  The simplest terms are simple names such as 'one', 'Socrates', or 'Pegasus'.  Simple predicates attribute properties to the object named.  In

: Socrates is bald.

'Socrates' is a name and 'is bald' is the predicate.  We can informally exhibit its logical structure with

: Bald(socrates)


There are also more complex terms such as '3 minus 2', 'the father of Socrates', and '3 divided by 0'.  The logical structure of these can be exhibited informally by

: minus(3, 2)
: father(socrates)
: quotient(3, 0)

These more complex terms can be used to construct sentences such as

: 3 minus 2 is even.
: The father of Socrates is bald.
: 3 divided by zero is odd.

Their logical structure can be informally exhibited by
: Even( minus(3, 2) )
: Bald( father(Socrates) )
: Odd( quotient(3, 0) )


There are also complex predicates, often called ''relations''.  Sentences using such predicates include

: 3 is greater than 2
: Socrates is a child of the father of Socrates and the mother of Socrates.
: Pegasus kicked Beaucephalus.

Their logical structures can be informally exhibited as

: Greater_than(3, 2)
: Child(socrates, father(socrates), mother(socrates))
: Kicked(pegasus, beaucephalus)

=== General statements ===

Names and other terms refer to specific objects.  We can also speak generally of all objects or of some (at least one) objects.  Some examples are:

: All numbers are prime.
: Some numbers are prime.
: Some numbers are not prime.
: No numbers are prime.

The logical structures of the first three can be informally exhibited as

: All ''x'' (if Number(''x''), then Prime(''x'')).
: Some ''x'' (Number(''x'') and Prime(''x'')).
: Some ''x'' (Number(''x'') and not( Prime(''x''))).

The fourth can have its logical structure exhibited either as

: All ''x'' (if Number(''x''), then not Prime(''x'').

or, equivalently, as

: Not (some ''x'' (Number(''x'') and Prime(''x''))).


Note that we count

: All unicorns have a horn

as trivially true because there are no unicorns.  In addition, we take 'some' to mean ''at least one'' (not, as might be expected, ''at least two'').  Thus we take

: Some prime numbers are even

to be true even though two is the only even prime.

=== More complexity ===
Variables such as &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; help us to keep the following straight.

* All ''x'' all ''y'' (if Person(''x'') and Person(''y''), then Loves(''x'', ''y''))
* All ''x'' all ''y'' (if Person(''y'') and Person(''x''), then Loves(''y'', ''x''))
:: These are equivalent and both say that everybody loves everybody.

* Some ''x'' some ''y'' (Person(''x'') and Person(''y'') and Loves(''x'', ''y''))
* Some ''x'' Some ''y'' (Person(''y'') and Person(''x'') and Loves(''y'', ''x''))
:: These are equivalent and both say that somebody loves someone.

* All ''x'' (if Person(''x''), then some ''y'' (Person(''y'') and Loves(''x'', ''y'')))
* Some ''y'' (Person(''y'') and all ''x'' (if Person(''x''), then Loves(''x'', ''y'')))
:: The first says that everybody loves somebody (or other&amp;mdash;they do not necessarily all love the same person).  The second says that somebody is loved by everybody.  Thus the second, but not the first, requires a universally loved person.

* All ''x'' (if Person(''x''), then some ''y'' (Person(''y'') and Loves(''y'', ''x'')))
* Some ''y'' (Person(''y'') and all ''x'' (if Person(''x''), then Loves(''y'', ''x'')))
:: The first says that that everybody is loved by somebody (or other&amp;mdash;not necessarily all loved by the same person).  The second says that the somebody loves everybody.  Thus the second, but not the first, requires a universal lover.

=== Domains ===

By convention, we can temporarily limit the range of the objects being considered.  For example, a policy of speaking only about people might be conventionally adopted. Such a convention would allow us to hope optimistically that 

: All ''x'' some ''y'' Loves(''y'', ''x'')

without hoping that cups and saucers are thereby loved.  The truth or falsity of a sentence can be evaluated within the context of such a convention or policy.  In a different context, a different convention might prove more convenient.  For example, the policy of only speaking about people would prevent us from saying

: Loves( alexander_the_great, beaucephalus)

However, widening the domain to include both horses and people does allow us to say this.


We call the range of objects under discussion the ''domain'', or sometimes the ''domain of discourse''.  A sentence that is true in the context of one domain may be false in the context of another.

== Limits ==

There are two limits on predicate logic as conventionally developed and indeed as will be developed here.

* First, predicate logic assumes that at least one thing exists.  We cannot, for example, limit the domain of discourse to unicorns.

* Second names and complex terms must refer to objects in the domain.  Thus we cannot use such terms as

: Pegasus
: 3 divided by 0

In addition, if we limit the domain to natural numbers, we cannot use a term such as

: 2 minus 3

The loss of '3 divided by  0' in turn requires predicate logic to avoid forming any term with 'divided by'.  The loss of '2 minus 3' requires predicate logic to avoid forming any term with 'minus' except in the context of domains including negative numbers.


The significance of these limits is controversial.  [[w:Free logic|Free Logic]] attempts to avoid such limits.  It appears that there is a [http://plato.stanford.edu/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] entry on free logic in preparation.</text>

        &lt;movieSynopsis&gt;
          Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a European-owned hotel in Rwanda, created a secret refugee camp 
          for the Tutsi people during the brutal genocide committed against them by the Hutu people in 1994. His 
          efforts helped to save 1200 lives out of close to a million who were killed.

        &lt;movieSynopsis&gt;
          The story's protagonist, Peter LaFleur, is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called
          Average Joe's. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman, the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, 
          egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and 
          Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. The only way Peter can save Average Joe's 
          is a showdown dodgeball competition against Globo Gym.

Are you saying that the titles of established publications are not valid just because Wikimedia says so? For your information, it is standard for US Military Publications to be titled with capitals, and I maintained the titling conventions of the US Army.

BTW, I took a look at the naming conventions, and there is nothing there that forbids me from using all caps.

== General Information ==

=== What is a SIM? ===

:See [[w:Subscriber Identity Module|Subscriber Identity Module]]

== Phones ==

=== Do GSM Phones Need to be Activated? ===

:No.  Only the [[w:SIM|SIM]] needs to be activated, and a GSM phone will work as long as:
:* An active SIM is installed in the phone. (A SIM can be moved from phone to phone by the user.)
:* The phone isn't &quot;locked&quot; to some other carrier. (See [[#What is locking?|What is locking?]])
:* The phone supports the correct [[w:Band (radio)|band(s)]] for the network (850 and 1900 in the case of AT&amp;T).

=== What is Locking? ===

: See [[w:Subsidy lock (cellular)|Subsidy lock (cellular)]].

=== When am I Eligible for a Phone Upgrade? ===

:See [http://www.cingular.com/customer_service/common_phone_upgrade Upgrade Your Phone]

:Note: &quot;TDMA&quot; ([[w:Digital AMPS|Digital AMPS]]) customers may only upgrade by switching to [[w:Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]], which entails a new rate plan that may not be as good as the old rate plan.

=== Do I have to buy a phone from AT&amp;T? ===

'''No.''' The real advantages to buying a phone from AT&amp;T are:
# ''Support'' from AT&amp;T
# Subsidized ''lower price'' in return for contract term extension ($50 off retail for each year of commitment before other possible promotional discounts)
Otherwise, any [[w:Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] phone can be used on AT&amp;T that:
# Has support for the correct [[w:GSM frequency ranges|bands]]: 850 MHz and 1900 MHz
# Has either:
## Unbranded (generic) firmware
## AT&amp;T-branded (customized) firmware
# Is either:
## Locked to AT&amp;T 
## Unlocked
'''Simple rule of thumb''' is to either get:
# ''Current AT&amp;T-branded GSM phone''; or
# ''Unbranded unlocked GSM phone with 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands''
''Notes:''
# An unbranded phone will need to be configured for advanced services. See [[#Mobile Device (e.g., Cell Phone) Configuration|Mobile Device (e.g., Cell Phone) Configuration]].
# See also other questions in this section.

=== Where can I Get Help for my AT&amp;T Phone? ===

* [http://tutorials.cingular.com/ Tutorials for many different AT&amp;T phones]
* [http://forums.cingular.com/cng/ Support Forums]

=== Can I make my phone ring only for certain numbers? ===
Yes, if your phone supports (a) downloadable ringtones and (b) phonebook number-specific ringtones:
# Install a silent ringtone.
# Set that as your default ringtone.
# Configure certain phonebook numbers to use an audible ringtone.

=== How can I transfer contacts from old phone to new phone? ===
* '''SIM''': Most phones can save contacts to SIM or transfer contacts from phone to SIM. Move the SIM to a new phone, and either use contacts from the SIM or copy them to the phone.
* '''PC software''': Software can be used to sync old phone contacts with a PC over IrDA, cable, or Bluetooth. The process is then reversed with a new phone.
* '''SyncML'''

=== Rollover ===

==== What is Rollover? ====
:Rollover is a promotional tool which works under the advertising slogan, &quot;They're your minutes, keep'em&quot;. At the end of each billing cycle, all unused anytime(daytime) minutes roll over to your next billing cycle. For example, if you are on the Nation 450 plan and you use 300 of your 450 anytime minutes, then at the start of the next billing cycle you will have 450 anytime minutes, and 150 rollover minutes, totaling at 600 usable anytime minutes. Rollover is only available on plans that are $39.99 and up.

==== How does Rollover Expire? ====
:Rollover minutes expire after 12 billing periods(months); ''i.e.,'' any unused rollover minutes from month 1 expire at month 13, any unused rollover minutes from month 2 expire at month 14, ''etc.''

==== Do The Minutes Come Off The First Or Last Month? ====
: Rollover minutes are deducted from the oldest minutes first. Once you use up your current month's minutes, you begin drawing from your twelve month old minutes, then your eleven month old minutes, and so on.

==== Tower Locations ====

:'''[http://www.cellreception.com/ Cell Phone Reception and Tower Search]'''





=== Why does one phone get better signal than another? ===

:While there are differences in ability to handle weak signal conditions between different phones, such differences are usually modest absent a defect in one of the phones. Substantial performance differences in a given location are thus much more likely to be due to different network programming of the [[w:Subscriber Identity Module|SIMs]] than to differences in the phones.

:For example, one phone might have a SIM &quot;homed&quot; on the old ATTWS (blue) network and the other phone might have a SIM homed on the old Cingular (orange) network.  If both blue and orange signals are present in a given location, and if (say) the blue signal is good while the orange signal is poor, then the phone homed on blue might well exhibit better performance than the phone homed on orange. This is because a [[w:Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] phone will always prefer its home network to a non-home network even if the non-home network has a much better signal -- it will only [[w:Roaming|roam]] on the non-home network if there isn't a &quot;usable&quot; home network signal.

:Such a difference can even happen when both phones have orange SIMs because ENS (64K) SIMs can be homed by AT&amp;T OTA (over the air) to either the orange network or the blue network. (See [[#Does ENS make for better coverage and/or connections?|Does ENS make for better coverage and/or connections?]]) Thus to meaningfully compare two phones in a given location, the '''same SIM''' should be used to test each phone.

:Another possible cause of performance differences is [[w:Band (radio)|band]] support. AT&amp;T uses both the 850 band and the 1900 band (depending on location), so a phone with support for both 850 and 1900 bands may well perform better in a given location than a phone with support for only the 1900 band.

=== What's the Difference Between 800 and 850 bands? ===

:There is ''no'' difference between 800 and 850 [[w:Band (radio)|bands]] -- they are the ''same'' frequencies between 800 and 900 [[w:Mhz|Mhz]].  Since the term 800 had become associated with &quot;[[w:Digital AMPS|TDMA]]&quot;, 850 was coined to distinguish [[w:GSM|GSM]].

=== What Can I Do About Poor Coverage in My Area? ===

:* Call Customer Care (611) and ask to be transferred to '''Tech Support'''.
:* Click on http://support.cingular.com/, enter, and then click on '''report network issue''' in the ''contact us'' section. (Even though the site is only &quot;intended for former AT&amp;T Wireless customers&quot;, other Cingular customers can use the site by going through a 2nd login screen.)

=== Is the 800/850 Band Better Than 1900? ===

:You may have heard that 800 or 850 [[w:Band (radio)|band]] is &quot;better&quot; than the 1900 band because:
:*''It travels farther.'' That's ''not'' true. What is true is that there can be a difference in range due to power:
::* Maximum power in the 800 band is 3 watts.
::* Maximum power in the 1900 band is 2 watts.

::It may not be intuitively obvious, but that's only about 18% less range for 1900, or a maximum of about 20% more towers along a flat rural highway strip, or a maximum of 50% more towers in area coverage, and then only when range is limited only by maximum power, which is rarely the case in metro areas.  Tower spacing is usually only near maximum in flat rural areas (and current small handsets don't come close to maximum power levels).

:*''It penetrates buildings better.'' It's not that simple:  While 1900 penetrates walls less well than 800/850, it does a better job of penetrating small openings (''e.g.,'' windows).  In general the penetration difference tends to be relatively small.
:For a detailed technical assessment, see [http://www.sss-mag.com/pdf/1propagation.pdf CS 294-7: Radio Propagation] [Randy H. Katz, CS Division, University of California, Berkeley]

=== How Can I Improve My Signal Quality? ===

*; Change of Home Network : A [[w:GSM|GSM]] mobile device (''e.g.,'' phone) is &quot;homed&quot; to a particular network, and will only [[w:Roaming|roam]] on a different network when there is no &quot;usable&quot; network signal, even when the roaming network signal is much better than the home network signal. Until AT&amp;T completes the integration of the old Cingular (orange) network and the old AT&amp;T Wireless Service (blue) network (expected in mid-to-late 2006), a given mobile device will be homed on one network or the other, and will thus prefer that network over the other network even when the other network has a better signal. In such cases, and given an [[#Does ENS make for better coverage and/or connections?|ENS]]-capable mobile device and (64K orange) SIM, it may be possible to improve signal quality by:
::* Call AT&amp;T ''Customer Care'' (611).
::* Ask to be transferred to ''Technical Support'' because you have poor signal quality.
::* Ask ''Technical Support'' to switch your home network (orange to blue, or blue to orange).
:: Notes:
::* ENS won't work with AT&amp;T Wireless Service (blue) mobile devices (or SIMs).
::* Even with ENS, a mobile device still ''isn't'' able to automatically select the better network signal -- GSM roaming rules still apply.
::* AT&amp;T started selling ENS-capable devices in late 2004.
::* It may take up to 24 hours for a home network switch to take place.
::* It may help to turn the phone off and back on.
::* While a switch in home network may improve signal quality in one area, it may ''degrade'' signal quality in a different area.

*; Better Phone : Phones differ in how well they perform with weaker signals (as in other things), and thus a different (better) phone might help in poor signal areas. In general, more expensive phones tend to have better signal handling than less expensive phones. Of the various brands, [[w:Nokia|Nokia]] devices are generally well-regarded, although other major brands (''e.g.,'' [[w:Sony Ericsson|Sony Ericsson]], [[w:Motorola|Motorola]]) also have better devices.

*; External Antenna : The small antenna in most mobile devices compromises performance for smaller size, and significantly-to-substantially better performance is generally possible with an external antenna (connected to the mobile device with a special cable). External antenna options include:
::* Vehicle antennas
::* Outdoor building antennas
::* Indoor antennas (''e.g.,'' [http://www.antennas.com/ ARC Freedom Antenna])

*; Active Repeater : Where there is a usable outdoor signal, an active [[w:Repeater|repeater]] may provide improved indoor signal. An active repeater consists of (1) an outdoor antenna, connected by cable to (2) a two-way signal amplifier (usually located indoors), connected by cable to (3) an indoor antenna. Care must be taken to ensure that: (a) the system is properly designed for the correct technology ([[w:GSM|GSM]]) and [[w:Band (radio)|bands]] (850 and/or 1900); (b) the indoor signal is sufficiently isolated from the outdoor signal; and (c) no interference otherwise results. The advantages over external antennas are no antenna connections needed to mobile devices and potentially greater performance; the disadvantages are complexity and cost of at least several hundred dollars. Sources include:

*; Signal Boosters : Stick-on &quot;signal boosters&quot; change the antenna performance of the phone in random ways depending on the model of phone and where exactly you stick it.  Dozens of RF engineers at the phone manufacturer spend their careers optimizing antenna performance, so the change will generally be for the worse.  Since RF optimization involves hundreds of complex tradeoffs, it is possible that a stick-on booster will improve reception in one or two cases, while degrading it in many more cases.  Overall, signal boosters generally make your signal '''''worse'''''.

=== What are messages from 36245? ===

: 36245 (which spells &quot;email&quot; on a phone keypad) is the number of the AT&amp;T Mobility '''''GSM-standard'' email-to-SMS gateway'''.  When email is addressed to ''NUMBER''@Mobile.MyCingular.com, the gateway forwards to that ''NUMBER'' as SMS message(s).  The sender's email address is the first item in the message, followed by the subject (if any) in parentheses.  To Reply to the sender, you may have to change the message addressing (depending on your phone).  Use of the AT&amp;T MEdia email-to-SMS gateway is preferred -- see [[#What are messages from numbers like 1010100004?|What are messages from numbers like 1010100004?]].

: If the '''email-to-''MMS'' gateway''' is used instead of the email-to-SMS gateway (by addressing email to ''NUMBER''@'''mms'''.att.net), addressing (including replies from a phone) will be cleaner, and messages can be much longer, but MMS messages are more expensive than SMS messages.

=== What are messages from numbers like 1010100004? ===

: This is a '''special gateway number''' generated by the AT&amp;T '''''MEdia'' email-to-SMS gateway'''.  When email is addressed to ''NUMBER''@CingularME.com or ''MEdia_ID''@CingularME.com, the incoming gateway forwards to that ''NUMBER'' (or the ''NUMBER'' for that ''MEdia_ID'') as SMS message(s), and that special gateway number is used to track the email address of the sender.  Reply to the sender is easy, because the phone will automatically reply to that special gateway number, which will cause the outgoing AT&amp;T gateway to forward to the email address of the original sender. ''This is thus the '''preferred method''' of AT&amp;T email-to-SMS messaging.''

=== How Can I Send E-mail From Any AT&amp;T Mobility Phone? ===

; Phone [[w:E-mail|E-mail]] client : Your cell phone may have an e-mail client that (properly configured) can send email directly. (See [[#What's the Outgoing SMTP (E-mail) Server?|What's the Outgoing SMTP (E-mail) Server?]]) ''Wireless data charges apply.''

== Push To Talk ==

=== What is Push To Talk? ===
* Also known as:
** PTT
** PoC (Push to talk over Cellular)
* For information, see:
** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_to_talk Push to talk] (Wikipedia)
** [http://www.cingular.com/pushtotalk Push To Talk] (AT&amp;T)
* The current market leader in PTT is the Nextel part of [[w:Sprint Nextel|Sprint Nextel Corp]].
* To use AT&amp;T PTT, both you and those you contact must have phones that support PTT.
* Initial AT&amp;T PTT phone selection is very limited.

== Data Service ==

=== Can I use my Phone as a Modem? ===

: Most [[w:GSM|GSM]] phones can be used as &quot;dial-up&quot; ([[w:Circuit Switched Data|CSD]]) [[w:Modem|modems]], and many can also be used as [[w:GPRS|GPRS]] (packet data) modems.  For this to work, your phone must be &quot;[[w:Tethering (cellular wireless)|tethered]]&quot; (connected) to your computer by:
:* [[w:Bluetooth|Bluetooth]]
:* Cable ([[w:RS-232|serial]] or [[w:USB|USB]])
:* [[w:IrDA|IrDA]]

=== What is the Difference Between CSD, GPRS/EGPRS(EDGE) and HSDPA? ===

:; [[w:Circuit Switched Data|CSD]] : Makes a dedicated data connection like a conventional wired [[w:modem|modem]]. Speed (on AT&amp;T) limited to 9600 bps. Charged like voice minutes (and is not ''Mobile to Mobile''). ''Must be enabled by AT&amp;T to work'' (which may require a $4/month data feature), and is only available to &quot;orange&quot; accounts (Cingular, not AT&amp;T Wireless) and on the &quot;orange&quot; network.

::* A [[w:GSM|GSM]] phone has no real dialup modem, just a sort of virtual modem which makes a connection to a carrier's IWU (Inter Working Unit), located in some service center. The IWU has the actual modem that can make analog data calls over the [[w:PSTN|PSTN]] (public switched telephone network). If the carrier doesn't provide an IWU, or if your account isn't provisioned for CSD (Circuit Switched Data), then a GSM phone cannot make data and/or fax calls. If your account is provisioned for CSD, then all you need is to install the phone as a modem with [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] Dial-Up Networking.

::* A regular [[w:Analog signal|analog]] dialup modem ''cannot'' be made to work over a GSM voice channel because of the [[w:digital|digital]] [[w:audio data compression|audio data compression]] used in the GSM channel.

:; [[w:GPRS|GPRS]]/[[w:EDGE|EGPRS(EDGE)]] : Makes a [[w:Packet switching|packet data]] connection, sharing channel(s) with packets to/from other users, connecting and disconnecting on demand. Much faster and more efficient than CSD. Charged by the amount of data transferred, as ''(expensive) Pay-As-You-Go'' if you don't have a ''data package'' ([http://www.cingular.com/media/media_net MEdia] or [http://www.cingular.com/sbusiness/data_connect Data Connect]).

:; [[w:HSDPA|HSDPA]] : See [[#What is BroadbandConnect?|What is BroadbandConnect?]]

: '''See also [[#What data speeds are possible with AT&amp;T (GSM)?|What data speeds are possible with AT&amp;T (GSM)?]]'''

=== What is the difference between MEdia and Data Connect? ===

:; [http://www.cingular.com/media/media_net MEdia] : Intended for use only on a cell phone. &quot;[[w:Tethering (cellular wireless)|Tethering]]&quot; ''works'', but is ''discouraged'', and AT&amp;T reserves the right to ''deny service'' based on usage. (See [http://www.cingular.com/media/media_legal MEdia Legal Notices]) Uses a [[w:Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] profile, but access to the entire [[w:Internet|Internet]] is available. [[wikipedia:Virtual private network|VPN]] may ''not'' work. No Data Acceleration.
:; [http://www.cingular.com/sbusiness/data_connect Data Connect] : Intended for use with [[w:Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or [[w:computer|computer]], depending on specific package. Uses an Internet profile. [[wikipedia:Virtual private network|VPN]] is supported. Data Acceleration is optional.

=== What is Data Acceleration? ===

: Data Acceleration, an optional feature available only on [[w:Circuit Switched Data|CSD]] and Data Connect (not MEdia Net) service, speeds [[w:Internet|Internet]] access primarily by compressing images. The tradeoff is lower image quality. See [http://web.archive.org/web/20040330072221/http://www.cingular.com/download/dc_tput_orange.pdf Wireless Data Throughput Orange Paper] ([[w:Portable Document Format|Adobe PDF]] format). Data Acceleration is easily controlled if you use [[#What is AT&amp;T Communication Manager?|AT&amp;T Communication Manager]]. If instead configuring manually, Data Acceleration is enabled or disabled with &quot;DA&quot; in login ''Userid'' as follows:

===== MEdia Setup =====

: See '''[[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ/MEdia Net Configuration|MEdia Net Configuration]].'''

===== Data Connect Setup =====

: See '''[[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ/Data Connect Configuration|Data Connect Configuration]].'''

=== What is AT&amp;T Communication Manager? ===

: An AT&amp;T software package that makes it easier to connect your computer to the Internet over AT&amp;T Mobility.  Available for [http://www.cingular.com/midtolarge/communicationmgr free download].  Although standard Dial-Up Networking is all that's actually needed, AT&amp;T Communication Manager '''includes drivers for mobile devices supported by Cingular''', which can make it useful when you don't otherwise have the necessary driver.

=== What data speeds are possible with AT&amp;T (GSM)? ===

:; [[w:Circuit Switched Data|CSD]] : Speed of '''9.6 [[w:Kbps|Kbps]]''' (9600 [[w:bits per second|bps]], or about 1K [[w:Byte|Bytes]]/sec). Available in most [[w:GSM|GSM]] areas, but being phased out.
:; [[w:GPRS|GPRS]] : With a [[w:General Packet Radio Service#GPRS Multislot Classes|Class]] 10 device and good signal, typical download speeds of about '''50 Kbps''' (about 6K Bytes/sec). Available in all GSM areas.
:; [[w:EDGE|EGPRS(EDGE)]] : With a Class 10 device and good signal, typical download speeds of about '''150 Kbps''' (about 18.5K Bytes/sec). Latency (as measured by [[w:ping|ping]]) of about 300 ms. Widely available. Backward compatible to GPRS.
:; [[w:UMTS|UMTS]] : Typical download speeds of '''200-320 Kbps''' (or about 2x EGPRS). Available in 6 markets as of 4Q 2005. Most (but not all; ''e.g.,'' [http://www.novatelwireless.com/products/merlin/merlin-u520.html Novatel U520]) devices are backward compatible to EGPRS and GPRS.
:; [[w:HSDPA|HSDPA]] (BroadbandConnect) : Typical speeds are expected to be '''400-700 Kbps''' (or about 4x EGPRS). Latency (as measured by [[w:ping|ping]]) expected to be about 150 ms (or about 1/2 EGPRS). Launched in 16 markets in December 2005. Backward compatible to UMTS, EGPRS and GPRS.

=== Why is my GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, or HSDPA so slow? ===

:; Poor Signal : Good signal (typically at least 3 bars) is needed for best performance.

:; Mobile Device Capabilities : Handsets (and PC Cards) do not all have the same data performance, which is determined in part by [[w:GPRS#GPRS Multislot Classes|GPRS/EGPRS(EDGE) Multislot Class]]. In general, as of this writing, all reasonably current GPRS/EGRPS(EDGE)-capable devices from [[w:Ericsson|Ericsson]] and [[w:Sony Ericsson|Sony Ericsson]] support Class 8 (4+1) and Class 10 (4+2, max of 5), whereas most [[w:Nokia|Nokia]] devices are limited to slower Class 2 (2+1), Class 4 (3+1), and Class 6 (3+2, max 4). [[w:Motorola|Motorola]] has both Class 4 and Class 8 devices. (The first number is the max downlink slots, and the number after the &quot;+&quot; is the max uplink slots.) This can translate into a substantial difference in throughput ''if'' supported by the carrier:
::; Class 4 &amp; 6 : 50% faster on downlink than Class 2.
::; Class 8 &amp; 10 : 100% faster on downlink than Class 2.&lt;br&gt;33% faster on downlink than Class 4 &amp; 6.
::; Class 10 : 100% faster on uplink than Class 2, 4 &amp; 8.

:; Serial Port Bottleneck : Connections between handsets and &quot;[[w:Tethering (cellular wireless)|tethered]]&quot; devices (''e.g.,'' notebook [[w:computer|computer]], [[w:Personal digital assistant|PDA]]) are typically implemented as a [[w:Serial port|serial port]], either real or virtual, and port speed usually defaults to 115 [[w:Kbps|Kbps]]. (A [[w:Bluetooth|Bluetooth]] stack implemented as a virtual serial port may go as fast as 921 Kbps, but will run at only 115 Kbps by default.) While 115 Kbps is generally fast enough for GPRS, it can be a bottleneck for [[w:EDGE | EGPRS(EDGE)]] and [[w:UMTS|UMTS]]/[[w:HSDPA|HSDPA]]. Recommended ''minimum'' port speeds:
::* GPRS: 230 Kbps
::* EGPRS(EDGE): 460 Kbps
::* UMTS/HSDPA: 920 Kbps

=== How To Set the Port Speed in Windows XP? ===
:Connections between handsets and &quot;[[w:Tethering (cellular wireless)|tethered]]&quot; devices (''e.g.,'' notebook [[w:computer|computer]], [[w:Personal digital assistant|PDA]]) are typically implemented as a [[w:Serial port|serial port]], either real or virtual. To set the port speed in [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] XP:
:* Open ''Control Panel'' &amp;rarr; ''Network Connections''
:* Right-click on the cellular connection, and choose ''Properties''

== Fax ==

=== How Can I Send a Fax From My Cell Phone? ===

:Since AT&amp;T has apparently phased out [[w:facsimile|facsimile]] (fax) service over  [[w:Circuit Switched Data|CSD]], the most straightforward way of '''sending''' a fax from a AT&amp;T phone is to use an '''[[w:E-mail|E-mail]] to Fax Service'''.
:* See [[#How Can I Send E-mail From Any AT&amp;T Mobility Phone?|How Can I Send E-mail From Any AT&amp;T Mobility Phone?]] by:
:** Phone E-mail client ''(Data charges apply.)''
:** MEdia Net e-mail ([[w:WAP|WAP]]) ''(Data charges apply.)''
:** SMS text messaging ''(Messaging charges apply.)''
:* E-Mail to Fax Services
:** [http://efax.com/ eFax] (free incoming fax)
:** [http://fax1.com/ Fax1] (low-cost outgoing fax)
:'''Receiving''' faxes is much harder than sending them, since most Internet fax services e-mail incoming faxes as [[w:E-mail attachment|attachments]] in formats that most current cellular phones can't display.  It's sometimes possible to view them on an e-mail website (''e.g.,'' [http://gmail.google.com/ Google Mail]) with a [[w:WAP|WAP]] or [[w:Web browser|Web browser]] (''e.g.,'' [http://mini.opera.com/ Opera Mini]), but that's very painful on a small screen.

== International Calling ==

=== What is the International Calling Format? ===

When called from a [[w:GSM|GSM]] cellular phone, an international phone number (''e.g.,'' ''+330142961202'' [the American Consulate in Paris]) consists of:
# International Access Code:  '''+'''  (''not'' ''00'' or ''011'' as with landline calls)
# [[w:List of country calling codes|Country Code]] (2 or 3 digits; ''e.g.,'' ''33'' for France)&lt;br&gt;Note: The Country Code for the USA is ''1'' the same as the area code prefix. Thus:
#* ''+18005551234'' is an international format number located in the USA that can be dialed from anywhere in the world (even within the USA, without incurring any extra cost).
#* ''18005551234'' is a USA format number with Area Code Prefix and Area Code that can only be dialed within the USA. Note that the Area Code Prefix is not needed when calling USA format numbers with AT&amp;T (''e.g.,'' ''8005551234'' works as well as ''18005551234'').
# Number (including any [[w:List of North American area codes|Area Code]]; ''e.g.,'' ''0142961202'' [the American Consulate in Paris])

=== What Are Country Codes? ===

: See [[w:List of country calling codes|List of country calling codes]].

=== How Do I Call Other Countries From the USA? ===

: '''International Calling''' is disabled on AT&amp;T accounts by default (presumably to protect against inadvertant charges).  To activate it, call Customer Care (611).

=== In Which Countries Can I Use My GSM phone? ===

:* [http://www.gsmworld.com/roaming/gsminfo/index.shtml GSM Coverage Maps and Roaming Information]

=== How Do I Use My AT&amp;T Mobility Phone in Other Countries? ===

:'''International Roaming''' is disabled on AT&amp;T accounts by default (presumably to protect against inadvertant charges).  To activate it, call Customer Care (611 inside the USA; +19168434685 outside the USA).

:For your AT&amp;T Mobility [[w:GSM|GSM]] phone to work in countries other than the USA you will need a multi-[[w:Band (radio)|band]] &quot;world&quot; phone:
:* GSM bands used in the USA are 850 and 1900.
:* GSM bands used outside of the USA are 900 and 1800.
:The best option for use in and out of the USA is a '''quad-band''' (850/900/1800/1900) phone.

:Be warned that the convenience of International Roaming comes at a price: International Roaming Calls are much more expensive than calls made on local carriers. For more than just an occasional call it's generally much less expensive to use a '''local prepaid [[w:SIM|SIM]]'''. To do that you need to have your phone &quot;unlocked&quot; -- see [[#What is locking?|What is locking?]]

:To be reached at your own AT&amp;T Mobility cellular number when using a local prepaid SIM overseas, change your AT&amp;T Mobility voicemail greeting to give out the phone number (including country code) of your overseas prepaid SIM, which can be used for low-cost [[w:Short message service|SMS text messaging]] as well as for voice

:When calling from '''outside''' of the USA, note that:
:* '''USA toll-free numbers''' ''cannot'' be reached from outside of the USA.
:* '''[http://www.cingular.com/customer_service/contact_us AT&amp;T Customer Service]''' ''cannot'' be dialed as ''611'' from outside of the USA. Instead, dial '''+1 916 843 4685'''.

==== International Data Roaming ====

:'''[http://cingular.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=1452 AT&amp;T GlobalConnect]''' offers two international wireless data usage plans, both of which include unlimited data usage on AT&amp;T' domestic data networks (pricing as of announcement date):
:* '''North American''' plan ($110/month for 100 MB) for Canada and Mexico
:* '''Overseas''' plan ($140/month for 100 MB)

Be very careful -- many travelers have experienced phantom data roaming charges totaling $3000 or more.

=== What's the Best Way to Call Back to the USA from Other Countries? ===

:Use an '''international callback or return-call service''' -- see &quot;International calling&quot; in [[w:Callback (telecommunications)|Callback (telecommunications)]]. Such services include:
:* [http://www.kallback.com/ Kallback]
:* [https://www.telestial.com/return_call_service.php Telestial Return Call Service]
:* [http://www.onesuite.com/access_international.asp OneSuite.com]

:Note that USA toll-free numbers ''cannot'' be called from outside of the USA

=== What's that Buzzing in my Speakers? ===

:GSM radio transmissions, particularly control signals (''e.g.,'' periodic mobile device registration, SMS message transmission), can induce audible interference (buzzing) in nearby speakers. (Hearing aids can also be affected.) The general issue of [[w:Radio frequency interference|radio frequency interference (RFI)]] is exacerbated by the short pulsing nature of these [[w:Time division multiplexing|time division multiplexed]] transmissions. The most straightforward solution is to separate the mobile device (''e.g.,'' cell phone) from the speakers; otherwise, shielded speakers and/or shielded speaker wiring may help. See the ''Ask Slashdot'' article [http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/07/2111217 How to Avoid Mobile Phone Interference w/ Speakers].

=== How Can a Billing or Contract Problem be Resolved? ===

; AT&amp;T : First do everything you can to resolve the matter with AT&amp;T:

:* '''Carefully document''' your position.  Be sure to have copies of your Service Agreement, any relevant bills, etc.
:* '''Be specific and be fair and reasonable''' in what you are asking for. Asking for more than that will tend to be counterproductive.
:* Be persistent, but always '''polite''' -- getting upset or even abusive will only be counterproductive.
:* If it's a '''network or coverage problem''', call Customer Care (611), and ask to be transferred to '''Technical Support'''.  (Standard Customer Care personnel can't really handle such problems.)  Be reasonable, and give AT&amp;T a reasonable period of time to correct any problem.
:* Call Customer Care (611), and ask to be transferred to '''Escalations'''.  (Standard Customer Care personnel have very little authority.)  Be persistent, calling back if necessary.
:* If that doesn't work, ask to be put in contact with the '''Office of the President''' (actually the highest level of dispute resolution).  ''Don't'' start there -- it's a ''last resort'', and you'll be taken more seriously if you've done everything you can to work it out through normal channels. Again, be persistent, calling back if necessary.  If you can't get through that way, try these reported contact points:
::* AT&amp;T Mobility Office Of The President&lt;Br&gt;5565 Glenridge Connector, Atlanta, GA 30349&lt;Br&gt;877-707-6220 (disconnected)
::* AT&amp;T Mobility Office Of The President&lt;br&gt;1910 Customer Care Way, Atwater, CA 95301&lt;br&gt;866-894-2464 (disconnected)
::* AT&amp;T Mobility Office of the President&lt;br&gt;2221 N. University, Lubbock, TX 79415
::* 800-947-5096 (disconnected)
::* 877-734-0766 (disconnected)
::* [mailto:resospecialist@yahoo.com Email resospecialist@yahoo.com]

; Complaints : If you fail to resolve the matter with AT&amp;T, complaints may be effective:

:* [http://www.hearusnow.org/phones/consumertips/wirelessphoneservices/howtocomplainaboutcellphoneservice/ How to Complain about Cell Phone Service] (Consumers Union)
:* [http://www.bbb.org/complaint.asp Better Business Bureau (BBB)]  May be effective.

=== How does AT&amp;T Mobility do E911 positioning? ===

:AT&amp;T is doing [[w:E911|E911]] location by means of [http://www.trueposition.com/TrueNorth-utdoa.php TruePosition U-TDOA], which works with any [[w:GSM|GSM]] mobile device.  Claimed accuracy is under 50 meters.  See:

All of this material, which was originally posted to alt.cingular.wireless, and copied from there to other places, was created by me. I started the page before I had created an account here. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 08:31, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

== Anon edits on Cingular FAQ ==

Hey

Probably wondering who this person doing anon edits on your FAQ for Cingular is; well it's me. Just some background, I work in the Cingular data support center, and work with both &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;orange&quot; customers.

Cheers

--[[User:24.19.197.36|24.19.197.36]] 00:13, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

== What data speeds are possible with Cingular (GSM)? ==

Re this area, where you state that HSDPA is backwards compatable to UMTS, EDGE and GPRS this is not true. The device drives this, not just the service. The Blue Novatel U520 UMTS card is NOT backwards compatable with EDGE, and GPRS, but from what I have seen all of our new HSDPA/UMTS devices will be backwards compatable. --[[User:Admrboltz|Admrboltz]] 22:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:You are correct -- the brain-damaged Novatel U520 isn't backwards compatible.  I'll correct the FAQ. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 07:46, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

== ISPDA@CINGULARGPRS.COM ==

For Cingular HSDPA data service, what's the username and password for dialing-up to the Internet? the same as GPRS/GSM services? Thank you! --Rae


This is the CSD user name, not the accelerated profile user name. Acceleration at hardware level is built into isp.cingular.  --[[User:Admrboltz|Admrboltz]] 05:02, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

:With all due respect, GPRS is, well, GPRS (not CSD), and as per documentation from Cingular devCentral -- &quot;Device and Software Settings Wireless Internet, Wireless Internet Express, &amp; Data Connect (WAP and ISP)&quot;, no longer available, and &quot;[http://www.cingular.com/download/dc_tput_orange.pdf Wireless Data Throughput Orange Paper]&quot; -- Data Acceleration is implemented in software, not hardware, and can be turned ON or OFF by the UserID, as explained in the FAQ. If you have (hard) evidence to the contrary, please provide it. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 07:46, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

::&quot;Cingular Wireless has added wireless data acceleration / compression servers to its core IP network to provice higher apparent throughput for its Data Connect subscribers.&quot; page 4 of the above PDF document. Per Cingular Wireless data base id KB42054 (which I can email you), shows ISPDA for CSD. ALL documentation for Data Connect via cell or aircard, states ISP@CINGULARGPRS.COM --[[User:Admrboltz|Admrboltz]] 22:46, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Hopefully the following information, drawn in part from Cingular &quot;Device and Software Settings, Wireless Internet, Wireless Internet Express, &amp; Data Connect (WAP and ISP)&quot; [REVISION 2.2, Solutions Engineering, Technology and Product Realization, 5/24/2004 11:37 AM] will clear things up:
:::# ''CSD'' (GSM dialup) and ''Data Connect'' (packet data; ''e.g.,'' GPRS) are two different things, as explained in the FAQ.
:::# ''Data Acceleration'' (''e.g.,'' additional image compression) is implemented in ''software'' running on Cingular servers. There is no acceleration in hardware alone.
:::# Data Acceleration is available for CSD as well as for Data Connect. I am adding this to the FAQ. It is not available for MEdia Net (packet data different from Data Connect).
:::# You are confusing the Userid for Data Connect (GPRS) with CSD. They are ''not'' the same.
:::# Data Acceleration is enabled or disabled with &quot;DA&quot; in login ''Userid'' as follows:
::::{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

== Speaker Interference ==

Please address the annoying noises that Cingular phones create on speakers when they are too close during time updates and right before ringing.  I would like to know more about ''why'' there is such interference, and if there is any simple way to dampen/shield it without weakening the phone-tower signal strength.  --[[w:User:Adam Katz|Adam Katz]] 18:42, 08 December 2005 (UTC)

:I will add this to the FAQ. Thanks for the suggestion. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 23:19, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
:: See also the ''Ask Slashdot'' article [http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/07/2111217 How to Avoid Mobile Phone Interference w/ Speakers] --[[User:Adam Katz|Adam Katz]] 00:06, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

== Firewall ==

Data point: I believe about six months ago Cingular started blocking at least some outgoing tcp/80 when using CSD.  tcp/22 still works though.  Haven't tested other ports, but I believe that on one occasion I successfully used a HTTP proxy in Blazer to get around the firewall.  I suppose it would also be possible to set up one's own VPN to get around it.  Also, I don't know if it works this way for everyone else, but on my $29.99/mo. plan, CSD use during peak hours is $0.40/min. ''in addition'' to using one's voice minutes.  Non-peak uses up only voice minutes.  —[[User:Fleminra|Fleminra]] 00:01, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
:Actually it looks like the issue is either intermittent poor performance, or possibly address-based filtering (not port-based).  Around 10:30pm (weekday) it appeared that google.com, yahoo.com, and wikipedia.org were blocked, but other, lower-profile sites were not blocked.  As of 2am (weekday), only google.com isn't working.  —[[User:67.188.126.213|67.188.126.213]] 10:02, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
::#I've seen no real evidence of port blocking or site blocking on CSD. I suspect these were just normal Internet problems.
::#If you check carefully, I think you'll find that you got/get charged $0.40/min for CSD &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; as &lt;b&gt;overtime&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;i&gt;i.e.,&lt;/i&gt; when you've exhausted your &lt;i&gt;Anytime&lt;/i&gt; minutes.

== Cingular Misinformation by John Navas ==

John, I always wondered who was steering people in wacky unconfirmed directions with Cingular.  First of all, if you have a tech problem with Cingular, a Customer Service Rep also known as Tier 1 can not send you through to Tech also known as Tier 2.  In most cases Tier 2 doesn't talk to customers.  Secondly Tier 1 has the outmost power to resolve most things without escalating.  In fact Tier 1 rep's have extensive training in how to resolve most all types of issues ie: billing &amp; technical.  What outdated source information have you obtained in the past that led you to believe that these statements are true?  4/4/2006

: Rebuttal by John Navas: This information in the FAQ is based on extensive personal experience as a customer, reports from other customers, and confidential reports from Cingular employees. I would nonetheless be happy to revise it given persuasive evidence to the contrary. With regard to your specifics:
:# I have been transferred to Tech Support by Tier 1 reps on several occasions, when particular technical problems couldn't be solved by Tier 1.
:# I have been told many times about the limits of financial authority at Tier 1.
:# Poor training of Tier 1 reps has been apparent on several (but by no means all) occasions.

: Finally, your complaints don't belong on my User page, which is why I moved them here. In the future, either post to my Talk (discussion) page, or to the Talk (discussion) page for the document at issue. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 04:41, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

== Tethering ==

Folks, hope someone can add something to the page about tethering, and the best options. 

I'm currently a Data connect subscriber, and just use the feature to download email and hit some FTP sites. If its true that the MEdia Net feature will also allow tethering, such as through Bluetooth -- then I and perhaps many more are paying for more than we need with Data Connect.

Using a new phone now - a Nokia 6682, which allegedly is a class 10 gprs/edge phone. Don't know about HSPD.

:&quot;Tethering&quot; '''''does''''' work on MEdia Net by means of any connection type supported by the mobile device (''e.g., ''cable, IrDA, Bluetooth). It also works with a SIM swapped into a PC Card. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 07:32, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

::OK - is there any performance difference between the two? Currently, Unlimited MEdia Net is priced lower than Data Connect, so it's hard to see what advantages there are for Data Connect. Or am I missing something? - Miratonyn

::: See ''[[Cingular Wireless FAQ#What is the difference between MEdia and Data Connect?|What is the difference between MEdia and Data Connect?]]'' --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 16:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

::::Interesting. Have you heard of any reports of Cingular actually kicking people off MEdia Net who routinely tether?

:::::In a word: '''no'''. Just conjecture. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 03:35, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

::::::Some FYI on this...  Yesterday I called Cingular, got a &quot;Tier 1&quot; and, as a new customer, got some help setting up simple POP mail retrieval on a Pocket PC.  She was very helpful, and when I asked about tethering options beyond what I had tried myself with the basic Windows Dial-up Wizard -- I have an unlimited PDA Connect account, but not Laptop Connect -- she said while it should work fine, I should watch my charges posted.  She said that the tech people were gearing up to start &quot;sniffing data packets&quot;, as according to her PC packets are differentiable from PDA packets... (really, even when via the tether?)  ...And, when they're ready, the general &quot;per KB&quot; charges or some such would apply.  I.e., not kick you off, but just silently stick it to you.  HTH...
::::::--[[User:Rdawes|Rich D]] 02:20, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

:::::::As I read the Terms and Conditions, you should be able to have any sudden switch to Pay As You Go data charges capped at the most favorable package for which you qualify, laptop connect (currently $60/month), although this might take serious persistence, escalation and/or complaint. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 05:32, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

== Data Plans ==
I am confused with the roaming charges on the North America and Global Data plans.  Do they even exist? In any case this should be covered in the book [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 18:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Anon edits on Cingular FAQ ==

Hey

Probably wondering who this person doing anon edits on your FAQ for Cingular is; well it's me. Just some background, I work in the Cingular data support center, and work with both &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;orange&quot; customers.

Cheers

== Cingular Misinformation by John Navas ==

John, I always wondered who was steering people in wacky unconfirmed directions with Cingular.  First of all, if you have a tech problem with Cingular, a Customer Service Rep also known as Tier 1 can not send you through to Tech also known as Tier 2.  In most cases Tier 2 doesn't talk to customers.  Secondly Tier 1 has the outmost power to resolve most things without escalating.  In fact Tier 1 rep's have extensive training in how to resolve most all types of issues ie: billing &amp; technical.  What outdated source information have you obtained in the past that led you to believe that these statements are true?  4/4/2006

: Rebuttal by John Navas: This information in the FAQ is based on extensive personal experience as a customer, reports from other customers, and confidential reports from Cingular employees. I would nonetheless be happy to revise it given persuasive evidence to the contrary. With regard to your specifics:
:# I have been transferred to Tech Support by Tier 1 reps on several occasions, when particular technical problems couldn't be solved by Tier 1.
:# I have been told many times about the limits of financial authority at Tier 1.
:# Poor training of Tier 1 reps has been apparent on several (but by no means all) occasions.

: Finally, your complaints don't belong on my User page, which is why I moved them here. In the future, either post to my Talk (discussion) page, or to the Talk (discussion) page for the document at issue. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 04:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

== Deletion of &quot;FAQ for alt.internet.wireless&quot; ==

I'm stunned to find that all pages of this book have been summarily deleted as &quot;not a textbook&quot; without discussion or warning! They represented a great deal of work which hadn't been saved in any other place. Please at least send me the last content. I'd also like an explanation of the reasoning behind this kind of summary execution. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 05:38, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

:As you may well be aware, recently at wikibooks we have been looking at what books we have and assessing whether they really meet our inclusion criterion of them being textbooks. The pages you refer to appear to me to fall foul of this and were therefore liable to be deleted summarily without further discussion. You do not indicate whether you disagree with my comment that this book is not a textbook or not.

:I am quite happy to email you the content of the book (if you provide an email address) or alternatively to temporarily undelete the content to give you an opportunity to copy it. I would also note that, whilst I think the content is not suitable for wikibooks, I do wish you all the best in finding a suitable home elsewhere in wikiworld, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:47, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

::I've posted my detailed objections to your action and rebuttal to your contentions in [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_undeletion#FAQ_for_alt.internet.wireless|Votes for undeletion]], and ask that any further discussion take place there. Thank you. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 20:41, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

#[[Cingular Wireless MEdia Configuration]]
#[[Cingular Wireless FAQ]]
#[[Cingular Wireless Data Connect Configuration]]

Since these pages all deal with Cingular wireless, I am proposing that we merge these 3 into a single [[Cingular Wireless]] book. This has the benefit of being easier to search for, and being a single destination for all information Cingular. Since you are the primary contributor to these books, I will leave the final decision up to you. However, if you do decide that this is alright, I will personally handle all the dirty work myself. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:03, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

: Thanks for your constructive suggestion, which makes sense, and for your kind and helpful offer. However:
:* Recent summary FAQ deletions without warning or even notice, notably [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_undeletion#FAQ_for_alt.internet.wireless|VfU#FAQ for alt.internet.wireless]] &amp; [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Various_FAQ_pages|VfD#Various FAQ pages]], have left a bad taste in my mouth, and made me wonder whether Wikibooks is a safe home for this material. Depending on how that issue comes out, I'll either follow your suggestion (doing the work myself), or move the material to a more hospitable environment, possibly [http://cell.wikia.com/wiki/Cingular_Wireless Wikia], or [http://www.wikifaq.com/Cingular_Wireless WikiFAQ].
:* The impending merger of &quot;the new at&amp;t&quot; (formerly SBC) and BellSouth may result in Cingular being rebranded as at&amp;t, and I'd rather avoid two successive name changes, so I think it might be a good idea to wait until that's concluded.

::Fair enough, I can't blame you. We mean well at wikibooks, even if it doesn't always appear so. Also, the impending merger is a good point, no sense renaming everything a million times. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:27, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

&lt;small&gt;[[Novial|Novial home]] - &lt;/small&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[Novial/Pronunciation_1|Pronunciation Guide]]&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;[[Novial/Hound_main|Contents]] - [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_1|Lesson 1]] - [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_2|Lesson 2]] - [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_3|Lesson 3]] - [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_4|Lesson 4]] - [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_5|Lesson 5]] - [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_6|Lesson 6]] - [[Novial/Hound_Lesson_7|Lesson 7]] &lt;/small&gt;

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Pronunciation Guide&lt;/font&gt;==

Otto Jespersen, who devised Novial, was a professional linguist. He carefully designed the spelling and pronunciation of Novial to be as easy as possible for people of different language backgrounds while using West European root words as the basis of the vocabulary.

Novial uses the standard 26 letters of the modern Latin alphabet. There are no accents which makes it easy to write on any Latin alphabet keyboard. The letter Z occurs only in foreign names (proper nouns). There are only five vowels: A, E, I, O and U which are generally pronounced with their  continental values, i.e. similar to Spanish and Italian. However, their very distinct sounds allow some leeway for speakers of different backgounds while still avoiding miscomprehension.

Three digraphs are used: CH, SH and QU. C occurs only in the combination  CH, and Q only in QU. As in English S is pronounced differently from SH but the use of a hyphen between S and H when they are two separate sounds prevents any  ambiguity. Every word is pronounced as spelled according to the pronunciation rules: Novial spelling is therefore phonemic (commonly called phonetic). 

The stress generally lies on the vowel before the last consonant. If there is no vowel preceding a consonant it is on the second from last vowel. One exception is words ending in ''-ee'' where the stress is on the second from last ''-e''. 

Examples with stressed syllable in bold:
aban'''do'''na, '''fa'''la, e'''gal''', '''vi'''e, mu'''se'''e
 
Note that where alternative pronunciations are given, '''''all''''' are correct allowing easier pronunciation for people of different language backgrounds.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
=Customizing the Toolbar=
Like many toolbars in Mac OS X, the Finder toolbar is customizable. To customize the toolbar, right click it and choose &quot;Customize Toolbar...&quot;.

A sheet appears, showing all of the buttons and controls you can add to the toolbar. You can add and remove buttons simply by dragging and dropping them on to and off of the toolbar.

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Space and Flexible Space appear as faint grey rectangles, and can be dragged in and out in the same fashion.}}

Buttons you can add to your toolbar are:

*Eject - Too lazy to reach over a few inches and press the eject key on your keyboard? This toolbar button does the same thing.
*Burn - A remnant of pre-Tiger CD Burning, this burns the files you've chosen to the CD or DVD. These days, a similar button is offered above the files themselves, so this button isn't useful anymore. For information on burning discs, please see the next chapter.
*Customize - This allows you to customize your Finder toolbar - just like you are doing now.
*Separator - This draws a faint dotted line between two sets of Finder buttons, keeping your toolbar nice and organized.
*Space - This puts a button-sized chunk of blank space between two icons.
*Flexible Space - Similar to &quot;Space&quot;, Flexible Space stretches to push the icons on one side to the left of the toolbar, and the icons on the other to the right side. Use it to align toolbar buttons to your liking.
*New Folder - This button creates a new folder nested inside the current one.
*Delete - This button moves the selected file into the Trash.
*Connect - Opens a &quot;Connect to Server&quot; dialog, which you'll learn about in Chapter 9.
*Get Info - This displays the same &quot;Info&quot; window you see when you right-click a file and choose &quot;Get Info&quot;.
*iDisk - Now mostly replaced by the sidebar, this button takes you to your iDisk. 

If you mess up your toolbar and wish to return it to its default, factory-fresh state, drag the entire default set into the bar, and it will replace what you currently have.

Below the buttons is a pop-up menu for choosing if you want your buttons labeled. In fact, you can dispense with buttons entirely and show ''only'' the labels. A checkbox next door specifies the label size. 

When you've finished customizing, click &quot;Done&quot;, and the sheet will roll back into the toolbar. Your customizations are applied to all Finder windows.

=Get Info=
The &quot;Get Info&quot; window is a very useful tool, allowing you to view metadata for the current file or folder. Metadata is data about the file's actual data: when it was last opened, how big it is, etc.

There are three ways to access the Get Info window:

*Choose File &gt; Get Info in the menu bar
*Select the file you want info about and press ⌘I 
*Right click on the file you want info about and select &quot;Get Info&quot; from the contextual menu
 
The Get Info window is partitioned into sections by headings with flippy triangles to their left. You can show or hide a section by clicking the flippy triangle next to the section's heading. The different sections are described below.


*'''Spotlight Comments''' - This field lets you type comments about the file. These comments are seen by Spotlight, so you can find files by the comments you made about them.
*'''General''' - This section lets you view information that applies to every file, such as where it is located, how big it is, and when it was created. If the object is a &quot;volume&quot; (disc), the General section will also display the disc's capacity, availible space, and used space. The General section also allows you adjust a couple of the file's settings:
**Color Label - You'll learn about color labels later on in this chapter.
**Stationery Pad - This checkbox turns a document into a virtual stationary pad - when you open it, the appropriate application creates a new blank document and fills it with the contents of the file, but leaves the actual file untouched. This is useful for letterheads and templates.
**Locked - Checking this box makes the file impossible to edit or modify in any way - until you ''uncheck'' this box, that is.
*'''More Info''' - This contains information specific to a certain type of file - who wrote a song file, or how many pixels are in an image file.
*'''Name and Extension''' - This section contains a text field that lets you change the file's name and &quot;extension&quot; (type). Extensions are appended to the end of a file's name, so that an HTML file called &quot;Sample&quot; is written as &quot;Sample.html&quot;. In general, it's best not to change a file's extension, since the data will usually be unrecognizable in its new form. Also note that some file types, like Adobe Photoshop files, use less obvious extensions such as &quot;psd&quot;. Make sure you know the correct extension for a file before you change it. Below this field is a checkbox that lets you hide the file's extension from view in the Finder. Some people like to keep this option on, since it makes Finder windows much less cluttered. Files named without a file extension may open on a Macintosh just fine, in an appropriate application. Accordingly, some users prefer to always have file extensions displayed, so as to be sure files will open correctly on other computer operating systems which rely on file extensions.
*The &quot;Open With&quot; pop-up menu below the name and extension field lets you choose the application the file opens in by default. A button below sets ''all files of the same type'' to open with this application.
*''Preview'' - The Preview section contains either the file's icon, a thumbnail of an image, a snippet of text, or a QuickTime Player that lets you sample a sound or video file.
*'''Ownership &amp; Permissions''' - This advanced section lets you modify file permissions. Steer clear of this section unless you're troubleshooting, which is covered in the appropriate appendix.

=Duplicates and Aliases=
A duplicate of a file can be made by ^-click (or right clicking if you have a mighty mouse) and selecting duplicate from the menu. This process will create an entirely new file near the original.

It is also possible, however, to make an alias. An alias is a linking file, similar to a shortcut for Windows users, which, when selected, will open the original file regardless to where the alias is placed. To make an alias follow the same steps as you would to make a duplicate but select 'Make Alias' in the menu. A second file will be created near the original with a small arrow in the lower left corner to show that it is an alias. This can now be moved to wherever it is required.

=Archives=
Archives are basically files containing other files. Think of it as a box which can hold items together. It is usually used as a means of transfering files to other people as sending one file is easier than sending several. To create an archive of a couple of files, select them using the mouse and right-click on any one of them. In the menu that pops up, choose &quot;Create archive of X items&quot; where X is the amount of files/folders you selected. The files you selected will be copied into an archive file.

Archives created in the Finder this way are .zip files and can be opened on Windows but archives can be of various other formats, some not supported by Finder (for example .rar).

=Packages=
=Automator=
=Slideshows=
'''Exporting your slideshow to iDVD:'''
You can transfer a slideshow, including its background music and transition effects, directly from iPhoto to iDVD to create a DVD slideshow. To export your slides to iDVD, select an Album or Slideshow, go to the Share menu and select Send to iDVD.

=Folder Actions=
=View Options=

=Burning Discs=
Burning Discs (CD-R/CD-RW and even DVD-/+ for superdrives) is simple in Mac OS X. Simply insert a blank disk and drag files to it.  Instead of ejecting the disk, click &quot;burn&quot; to complete the burn.

If you want to burn multiple copies of a disk, you can create a Burn Folder. Simply ^-click (or right click) on the destop and select 'New Burn Folder' from the menu. This will create a folder labled 'Burn Folder' on the destop. The next step is to drag the files/videos/pictures/documents etc that you wish to copy into the folder (The original files will remain in the positions as Mac OS only creates alias's within the burn folder). Now in the top right corner of the burn folder there is a button labled burn, click it. A message will come up telling you to insert a disc with at least ***mb of memory, when the disc is inserted and found to be in order another message will come up asking for the burn speed and a name for the disc, enter your preferences at click ok. Now sit back and relax for the disc to be burnt.

=Screenshots=
Mac OS X offers several means to take a [[w:screenshot|screenshot]]:

'''Using Mac OS keyboard shorcuts:'''
* '''shift-command-3''' will capture the full screen, and place screenshot files on the desktop. If you work in a multi-screen configuration, one file will be created for each screen.
* '''shift-command-4''' will allow you to capture part of the screen: after pressing those three keys, your cursor will become a small crosshair, and you will be able to select the region of the screen to capture. If you press the space bar, the cursor will become a camera, with which you may select a window to be captured (including the windows used for menus, the menubar, desktop icons etc). The item to capture will be highlighted as you pass your mouse over it.

If you hold the control key (ctrl) while taking the screenshot, the resulting image will be placed into the clipboard instead of saved to a file. You can then paste it into another application.

IThe files created using this method are [[w:PNG|PNG]] files by default. It is possible to change this setting using the command line: in the [[w:Terminal (application)|Terminal]], type:

&lt;code&gt;defaults write com.apple.screencapture type ''image_format''&lt;/code&gt;

where ''image_format'' could be [[w:BMP|BMP]] (Windows bitmap), [[w:GIF|GIF]], [[w:JPEG 2000|JPEG 2000]], [[w:JPEG|JPEG]], [[w:Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[w:PICT|PICT]], [[w:PNG|PNG]], [[w:PSD|PSD]], [[w:SGI|SGI]], [[w:Truevision TGA|TGA]] &amp; [[w:Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]].

'''Using other applications:'''
* The [[w:Grab (software)|Grab]] application shipped with Mac OS X supports one more option – to take timed screen captures – and permits – via the Preferences – to place a cursor in the picture. Note that it does not include the actual cursor, but draws the user's chosen cursor at the cursor co-ordinates. Prior to Mac OS X, the mouse cursor was automatically included in full-screen captures but not captures of screen areas or individual windows where the cursor is used to select the area or window to capture. Grab places the screen capture into a new window, and you may save the image to disc as TIFF (but not any other format).
* [[w:Preview (software)|Preview]] version 3 has an option to take window, selection and timed screen captures via File &gt; Grab. Preview simply activates the OS's existing screenshot system, but saves the captures as TIFF files instead of PNG and opens them as soon as they are saved.
Both Grab &amp; Preview automatically save the files as TIFF.
* Many commercial programs can be used instead, which adds functionality such as capturing a video of the screen.

Screenshots cannot be taken while protected [[w:DVD|DVDs]] are playing in [[w:DVD Player|DVD Player]]. You can also perform screenshots of [[w:Exposé (Mac OS X)|Exposé]] in operation, and take screenshots of the process of taking screenshots: press shift-command-4 and then space to enter window screenshot mode, hold the cursor over a window, and press shift-command-3 to capture the full screen. Because the camera cursor during window capture is not a real mouse cursor, it, too, is included in the screenshot. You will now wish to hit escape to cancel out of window capture mode.

=Finder Preferences=
==General==
==Labels==
==Sidebar==
==Advanced==
=Advanced Spotlight=

[[Category:Mac OS X Tiger]]
you can narrow down your search by preceding the search criteria with the '''kind''' keyword.

 i.e. kind:images mom
will only return images that have mom as a keyword, part of the name, etc...

different ''''kind'''' keywords are:
Folders, Documents, Presentations, images, Applications, Mail, Events, pdf, Contacts, Music, Bookmarks, movies, Fonts, system preferences (two words will work)

try kind:system preferences mouse</text>

[[Image:Menudo soup Ortegas La Jolla 20050220.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Menudo, with flour tortillas and horchata rice drink.]]

Menudo is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] dish; a spicy soup made with [[Cookbook:Hominy|hominy]] and [[Cookbook:Tripe|tripe]].

== Ingredients ==
*'''For the stew:'''
* 2 1/2 pounds Honeycomb tripe
* 2 tbsp. Mexican Oregano
* 1 clove garlic
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tbsp. salt
* '''For the Posole'''
* 2 pork country ribs
* 3 lbs pigs feet (&quot;patas&quot; Optional: cows foot vs pig)
* 2 16 oz. cans White Hominy, drained
* 3 or 4 Chilis de Arbol
* '''For the Chili'''
* 4 dried Ancho chiles
*'''For the Menudo Mix (spices)'''
* 2 tbsp. red pepper flakes (with the seeds)
* 2 tbsp. dried Mexican oregano 
*'''Optional'''
*Lime      
*Tortillas - corn
*Diced White or Green Onion
*Minced Cilantro

== Procedure ==
===Desayuno de los Reyes (Breakfast of Kings)===
* Menudo preparation in the northern state of Chihuahua as well as northern New Mexico requires the preparation of three separate items, all combined at the time of final preparation for the table:  Stew, Posole, and Chili.  This recipe is similar and is very simple,  using minimal ingredients.  Cooking the  menudo and chili the night before allows the cook to place the stew into the refrigerator to harden the saturated fat, allowing it to be skimmed off prior to serving the &quot;Breakfast of Kings&quot; the next morning.  We begin with preparing the Posole.
*
* Almost all (but not all) store-bought honeycomb tripe will smell strongly from the bleaching lime as possible. Let your nose be the judge as to whether or not it will require a soaking or boil as described in the steps below.
* To make the Posole:
# Rinse and drain the white Hominy.
# Place the patas (feet) and ribs into a pot.
# Place the Hominy in the pot with the patas (feet).
# Put 1 tbsp. salt in the pot.
# Take 3 or 4 dried Chilis de Arbol, discard the seeds and stems, and snip the chilis into ringlets and put into the pot.
# Cover with water to a height not exceeding 1 cm above the ingredients and bring to a boil.
# Cook the Posole uncovered until the ribs are finished.  Remove from the heat.  
# Remove the meat from the ribs and dice into small cubes,  place back into the pot with the Posole, discard the bones.
# Place the cooked patas (feet) into the pressure pot you will use to make the Menudo.
* To make the menudo stew:
# Place a small pot of water on the stove and set to boil.  This will be needed to prepare the chilies.
# Cut the fat from off of the tripe.  If fat clings to the non-honeycombed side of the tripe, use a stiff brush to remove it.
# Cut tripe into small pieces, about 3/4 to 1 inch. Strong scissors work well here!
# If the tripe smells overly rank (this is normal), you may want to soak it in clean water for an hour (or possibly boil it in water for five minutes) throwing away the soak (boiling) water.
# Place cut tripe into the pressure cooker on top of the patas (feet).
# Add the garlic, bay leaves, and Mexican oregano.
# Fill pressure cooker with water until about 1 cm. above the height of the stew ingredients.
# Cook at pressure 35 - 40 minutes.
* While the tripe is cooking, make the Chili:
# Wipe the dried Anchos off with a wet paper towel.
# Optional step -- toast dried chilies on each side 15 seconds on a hot griddle (this releases essential oils and enhances the flavor)
# Place the dried chilies into the small pot of boiling water and boil for 10 minutes, turning frequently in the boiling water to ensure all sides receive their fair share of punishment.
# Remove the chili pot from the stove and drain off the boiling water.  Fill with cold water; let it sit a few minutes to cool.
# Remove the stems from the chilies, cut chilies longitudinally from stem to tip on one side and open.  Flush gently with running cold water to remove the seeds.
# Place stemless and seedless reconstituted chilies into a blender and pure.
# Remove pure from the blender and place in the refrigerator overnight.
* After the stew has cooked in the pressure cooker at full pressure for 35 to 40 minutes, remove from the heat and let the pot cool off completely until pressure returns to ambient.
# Remove the pata (feet) from the pot and remove the bones.  Put deboned pata (feet) into pot with the tripe and discard the bones.
# Transfer the stew to a large bowl and add the Posole, ensure all savory pieces lie below the waterline, and set in the refrigerator overnight.
# In the morning, skim all hardened fat from the surface of the stew which has probably gelatinized overnight.
* Final Preparation
# Reheat a serving portion of the stew in the microwave or on stovetop.  When hot, place into a serving bowl.
# Add a tbsp. of chili to the stew and blend thoroughly.
* The Menudo is ready to serve with hot corn tortillas.  The spices (oregano and chili flakes) are traditionally combined before serving and placed at the side of the bowl of Menudo with a lime wedge for the diner to add just prior to eating.  Along with the spices, diced onion or Cilantro are also traditionally added to the stew just prior to enjoying.

== Notes ==
* This recipe makes 4 large servings.

== Track-To ==
[[Image:C_track.gif]]

The Track-To constraint lets you influence the Rotation of the constrained object by making it track a target with one of the constrained object's axis.

== The Constraint Panel ==
[[Image:C_track_panel.jpg]]

*You can enter the name of the target you want to track.
*You can select which axis is going to track the target.
*You can select which axis is going to stay up.

== Where To Use It ==
[[Image:Ie_track_cam.jpg]]

A good example of use is the make a camera track an object. The setting to use on a camera is track: -Z and up: Y. You can turn Axis drawing in objectbutton window to help you choose the good axis.

Another example with armature would be the eyes of a character:

Using the floor constraint will keep a bone from passing through an object from a given direction.
It is useful when making floors of course but also when making walls and other items which are obstacles for the armature.

There is also an offset value which is very useful when say for example you have a foot where the mesh stretches down below the actual tip of the armature you can then use the offset to make the bone stop before it actually reaches the obstacle object.

== Copy Rotation ==
[[Image:C_rot.gif]]

This constraint copies the rotation of the target. As simple as that. It can be an object or a bone. As you can see in the example, only the rotation gets copied.

== The Constraint Panel ==
[[Image:C_rot_panel.jpg]]

*You have 3 buttons to select which axis get copied over.

== Where To Use It ==
Can be used with Copy Location to fake parent relationship. As you can key the influence you can make a character pick something up and hold it in his hands. Check the .blend for the hand-glass scene.

You can also use this to align a plane with a 2D effect on it to the camera at all times. This works better than pointing it at the camera in some cases, such as a ring of atmospheric halo around a planet, where you don't want it disappear behind the planet.

== Stretch-To ==
 Description

Stretch To causes the affected object to scale the Y axis towards a target object. It also has volumetric features, so the affected object can squash down as the target moves closer, or thin out as the target moves farther away. Or you can choose not to make use of this volumetric squash-'n'-stretch feature, by pressing the NONE button. This constraint assumes that the Y axis will be the axis that does the stretching, and doesn't give you the option of using a different one because it would require too many buttons to do so.

This constraint affects object orientation in the same way that Track To does, except this constraint bases the orientation of its poles on the original orientation of the bone! See the page on Tracking for more info. Locked Track also works with this constraint.
Options

R
    Pressing the R button calculates the rest length as the distance from the centers of the constrained object and its target 
Rest Length
    Rest Length determines the size of the object in the rest position 
Volume Variation
    Volume Variation controls the magnitude of the effect 
Vol
    The Vol: buttons control along what axes the volume is preserved (if at all) 
Plane
    The Plane buttons define which local orientation should be maintained while tracking the target

== The IK solver ==

[[Image:C_ik.gif]]

The IK solver constraint is a wonderful tool for all animators. IK stands for &quot;Inverse Kinematic&quot; and is the opposite of FK (Forward Kinematic).
*FK: You have a dependency to the root of the chain. In Blender, a FK chain is a chain of bones connected together. You have to animate the bones rotation one by one to get it animated. It takes longer, but gives you entire control over the rig.
*IK: Both ends are roots. All bones in the chain are trying to rotate to keep both ends on targets. Now this Constraint got most of the attention during Animation refactoring, hopefully we have a lot of toys to play with now.

The IK solver has a special shortcut '''in Posemode''' to be added easily to a bone. If you select a bone and press ''''CTRL-IKEY'''', You get a little menu asking for more info on the new constraint, the target: to a new empty object or without target. It's now possible to work without target. Though you have less freedom (no rot feature, difficult parent relationship).

You can also select the target and then the IK constraint holder and press '''CTRL-IKEY'''. With this way of selecting ensure that your target is selected, but the bone you want to apply the constraint to is active (the last one selected). The menu will then let you add a constraint to the current bone with a target. If the target would itself be part of the IK chain, you get an error message - so make sure the target bone is not connected to the bone you want to add the constraint to.

It's also possible to remove all IK constraints from selected objects or bones with ''''ALT-IKEY''''.


Q: ''''CTRL-IKEY'''' doesn't seem to do anything

A: Either the 3D Window is out of focus (R-click in empty space to solve) or you're not in Pose Mode (''''CTRL-TAB'''', selected bone will be magenta in color)

A: In the 2.48 version of Blender, the shortcut is ''''SHIFT-I''''

== The Constraint Panel ==

[[Image:C_IK_panel.jpg]]

*You can rename the constraint.
*You can select which Object or bone will be the target. Don't forget Tab completion.
*The Rot button let you tell Blender to use the rotation of the target to influence the rest of the chain:

[[Image:Ie_IK_chain_rot.jpg]]

*The Tip button lets you tell Blender which part of the bone is the target, the Tip or the Root. It's interesting to use tip, because this way the Bone holding the IK constraint can be used to deform geometry.

[[Image:Ie_IK_chain_Tip.jpg]]

*Len lets you tell Blender the length of the chain the IK solver will try to rotate. If set to 0, the entire chain will enter in the constraint. If  for example the len is 4, only the 4 last bones of the chain will try to touch the target. 

[[Image:Ie_IK_chain_Len.jpg]]

*Also If you set len to 0 and your chain's root is a child of another bone, The IK solver will reach and rotate all the bones until it gets to the end of the parent relationship. If all the bones are linked up to a master root, then all other sub-branchs will be affected. If there is another IK target in other sub-branchs of the rig, Blender will try to mix them. This concept of multiple IK targets in a rig is called Tree IK and can be used to get completely automated animations. For example like a doll: if you pull one hand, all the body will follow. In the 3D-view you'll see a yellow line from the IK solver to the root of the chain it covers. This line appears when you select the bone containing the IK solver.

[[Image:C_ik_tree.gif]]

*PosW and RotW let you tell Blender if this IK solver will influence the final result more of less in the case of a Tree IK setup. With these options it's possible to use an IK solver just for location and an other one just for rotation.

*Tolerance and iterations are performance and precision options. IK solving is done in more than one pass, the more passes you calculate, the more accurate results you get. The tolerance is the distance from the IK solver to the target you can accept. If Blender manages to place the target near enough, it will stop doing iterations. The Iterations value is a hard limit you set to limit the time blender can reach on each IK solver per frame. Try to set it to a very low value to know why Blender needs more than one pass ;).

*You can set the general influence this constraint will have over bones, and it's animatable.

== Where To Use It ==

[[Image:Ie_IK_1.jpg]]

In any chain of bones you don't want to animate by hand but you want both ends to be at precise location. The best example is a leg: The leg is connected to the body and to the foot. You don't need to animate the 2 bones in the legs, just place the body and the foot, the leg will follow automagically.

== Degree Of Freedom ==

[[Image:Ie_IK_chain_limit.jpg]]

In DOF it is now possible to set it for bones in an IK chain. This way you can set what will block where. This is very useful when doing a mechanical rig as you can limit the move or better, lock completely an axis. 

[[Image:Ie_IK_limit_buttons.jpg]]

*There you can set a limit on each axis, or completely Lock it.
*No limit gives it complete freedom (which is the same as [min:0 max:360] or [min:0 max:0]).
*The stiffness lets you tell Blender if an axis is more difficult to rotate than the rest. If all bones have a stiffness of 1 on X and you try to curve that chain in a way that all bones need to turn on X to follow the target, the Solving will find really weird poses to find a way to touch the target without rotating on X.

Match moving is the technique of recreating the position of the camera used in recording live action footage. This information can then be used within Blender to merge 3D objects with live action film. For a more detailed discussion of the concept, take a look at the [[w:Match Moving|Wikipedia article on Match Moving]].

Blender cannot perform match moving itself, you must use a 3rd party tool to determine the camera position and the way it moves, then import this data into Blender. While there are many software tools to do this, this page references two free options: Voodoo and Icarus.

== Icarus ==

[http://aig.cs.man.ac.uk/research/reveal/icarus/ Icarus] is a discontinued University of Manchester project which can be used for non-commercial work. The download links from the official page no longer function, but Windows and MacOS X versions are available from this [http://peerlessproductions.com/tuts/pages/Icarus.html Icarus video tutorial] by Colin Levy.

== Voodoo ==

[http://www.digilab.uni-hannover.de/docs/manual.html Voodoo] is an actively developed free match mover available for Windows and Linux. Here is a tutorial on [http://fictionality.co.uk/doku.php?id=tutorials:matchmoving using Voodoo and Blender]

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already investigated that passing a current through a wire in a magnetic field causes a force to be exerted on it. The opposite is also true, and when a force is exerted on a wire a current is induced in the wire. This completely revolutionised the world because it meant that electricity could now be relatively cheaply produced.

==Inducing an EMF.==
When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, an EMF is generated.
===Faraday's Law===

Michael Faraday states in his law that: The magnitude of the emf generated is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.

Magnetic Flux density is a measure of the strength of a magnetic field and is essentially how dense the field lines of a magnetic field are within a given area.

===Reversing the motor effect===

===Magnetic flux===
===Direction of induced current===
==Calculating the induced EMF==
Faraday's law states: Induced EMF is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.&lt;br&gt;
Magnetic flux = Magnetic field strength x Area = BA.&lt;br&gt;
Rate of change implies we consider the variable with respect to time (in seconds)&lt;br&gt;
Therefore...Induced EMF = (change in Magnetic Flux Density x Area)/change in Time.&lt;br&gt;
OR EMF = BA/t&lt;br&gt;
If we are doing it with a coil, the area becomes the area of one coil multiplied by the number of coils, n = 2πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;n&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, Induced EMF = (B2πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;n)/t.&lt;br&gt;
If we want to increase the amount of EMF induced, we either...&lt;br&gt;
Increase the area 'swept'.&lt;br&gt;
Increase the Magnetic Flux Density.&lt;br&gt;
Decrease the amount of time taken.&lt;br&gt;
The EMF induced is also proportional to the speed of the object going through the Magnetic Flux.&lt;br&gt;
Because BA/t can be re-written as...EMF = Magnetic flux density x Width x Speed.&lt;br&gt;
This is because speed = distance / time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
REMEMBER! - EMF is measured in volts, magnetic flux density is measured in teslas and area is measured in meters&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, time is measured in seconds.&lt;br&gt;
So you will have to convert things from mm, cm, km, minutes, etc.
===Faraday's law===
   The magnitude of induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage:
   &lt;math&gt;E.M.F. \propto \frac{\Delta NBA}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

===Lenz's law===
Lenz's law states that the direction of the induced current is always so as to oppose the change which caused the current.
It is just a small addition to Faraday's law:

&lt;math&gt;E.M.F. = -\frac{\Delta NBA}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

(Notice the minus sign!)

==Transformers==
A transformer is made up of two or more coils of unmagnetised magnetic material. One coil is the primary coil and is connected to an alternating supply. The other is the secondary coil.

== Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCO) ==

{{Wikipedia|Voltage-controlled_oscillator}}

A '''voltage-controlled oscillator''' (VCO) is a device that outputs a sinusoid of a frequency that is a function of the input voltage. VCOs are ''not'' time-invariant, linear components. A complete study of how a VCO works will have to be relegated to a more detailed section based on feedback and oscillators. This page will, however, attempt to answer some of the basic questions about VCOs.

A basic VCO has input/output characteristics as such:

 v(t) ----|VCO|----&gt; sin(a[f + v(t)]t + O)

VCOs are often implemented using a special type of diode called a &quot;Varactor&quot;. Varactors, when reverse-biased, produce a small amount of capacitance that varies with the input voltage.

== Phase-Locked Loops ==

{{Wikipedia|Phase-locked_loop}}

If you are talking on your cellphone, and you are walking (or driving), the phase angle of your signal is going to change, as a function of your motion, at the receiver. This is a fact of nature, and is unavoidable. The solution to this then, is to create a device which can &quot;find&quot; a signal of a particular frequency, negate any phase changes in the signal, and output the clean wave, phase-change free. This device is called a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), and can be implemented using a VCO.

== Purpose of VCO and PLL ==

VCO and PLL circuits are highly useful in modulating and demodulating systems. We will discuss the specifics of how VCO and PLL circuits are used in this manner in future chapters.

== Varactors ==

As a matter of purely professional interest, we will discuss varactors here.

== Further reading ==

* [[Clock and data recovery]] has detailed information about designing and analyzing PLLs.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

== Big Cats ==

I encourage you to keep up the brilliant work over at the Wikijunior area. Participation has fallen a bit and some new blood is always welcome. You seem to have made some great edits over there. Just thought I'd say thanks from all of us. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:40, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

:Thank you for your kind words. However, I will disagree with you one one point. It is not just people like me that make this thing run... it is people like me, you, that guy down the street fixing a comma. People like me barely scratch the surface. There are too many people to thank if you really wanted to show appreciation for everyone who has made a difference to Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and the other Wikimedia projects. I guess, publishing can be a tough business at times, and I too love what this enitre project is trying to accomplish. I hope you stick around and continue to contribute. Thank ''you''. And if you ever have any questions, don't be afraid to ask. We won't bite. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:17, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

::I had seen your new work over there. It seems to be going very well. The removal of the stuff on the front page is fine. Just keep up the good work. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:26, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

== I hope you stick around ==

Thanks for all your work around this place. I hope you stick around either here or at Wikipedia. We can always use good editors like yourself. If you decide not to, thanks anyway. You have been a real asset to Wikijunior. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

== Work on Big Cats ==

I'll tell you what.  I'll take the Big Cats Wikijunior book and turn it into a PDF file on or about December 10th, for whatever state that it is in.  That way we are technically &quot;published&quot; and have something that is a little bit more up-to-date than the current PDF file (that seems buggy to me as well for some reason).  There is still much more to do in terms of proofreading, but we are well on our way.

BTW, thanks for all of the work that you have done.  This is a huge task and I completely understand why you feel some pressure to get this accomplished.  Relax, take a deep breath, and understand that there really isn't a huge deadline to get this accomplished.  If we lose the money from the Beck Foundation, that isn't really a problem either.  There is more... much more where that came from including some educational foundations that I'm familiar with.  &quot;If we write it... they will come&quot; (to paraphrase from an older movie) is more the mantra I'm pushing, and I have no doubt that Wikijunior is going to make some major inroads into the children's educational book market.  Let's do quality, not quantity, and try to make this one of the best books about Big Cats that you can find anywhere written for kids.  It certainly is quite nice compared to many others I've seen as it is.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:06, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

== Updated PDF File of Wikijunior Big Cats ==

As I promised, I did deliver.  You can now download [[:Image:Big Cats.pdf|the revised PDF file]] for [[Wikijunior Big Cats]].  This is as far as we can really get something published except going to an actual printing company and making it with paper and ink.  I'm even willing to do that if anybody is interested.  Read, enjoy, and share with whomever you think might be interested.  And thanks for your work on this project so far.  I hope that this is something that we can continue to work on and improve in the future.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:51, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

== Christmas Vacation ==

Am taking a Christmas break from working on Big Cats.  Put in several species today to round out the collection, but am through until Season's Greetings....  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 03:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)
:Thanks for your help... Have a Merry Christmas. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== Copyvio ==

Someone has flagged [[Image:Servalcat.jpg]] as a copyvio.  You flagged it as public domain, expired or ineligible.  Could you elaborate as to its status, and why they might hytink they have copyright.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 18:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

==Unspecified source for Image:Snowcub.jpg==

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Snowcub.jpg]]. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikibooks. If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page. If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. --[[User:KFP|KFP]] 13:35, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

This section contains a number of questions about details of implementation of OSX. Being a wiki, you are encouraged to add your problems to these questions and your insight to these answers...

==FAQ==


Q: What is the difference between a texture and a window and a screen? 

A: A screen corresponds to a physically connected display device. Screen 0 is the display with the Dock and menu bar. Screen 1 (on a dual-display system) is the 2nd display, and so on... The Screen('Screens') command returns a vector of all available screens - the available, connected and powered on display devices. If you have a dual-display setup whose displays are switched into mirror-mode (both displays show same content), then this will appear to PTB as a single screen. The screen-number just defines on which physical output device you want to open/show your stimulus window.

An onscreen-window is used to display your stimulus. Each screen can have exactly one full-screen onscreen window - or no PTB window at all. All drawing commands expect a handle to an onscreen window so they know where to draw to.

Onscreen windows are double-buffered: They consist of a backbuffer and a frontbuffer. The backbuffer is, where all drawing operations are performed -- where you build/prepare your
stimulus for presentation. The frontbuffer is scanned out and displayed by your display -
your beamer, flat-panel or CRT at the display refresh interval.

After you've finished drawing and your stimulus image is ready in the backbuffer, you issue the Screen('Flip',...) command. This command asks PTB to switch the role of the front- and back-
buffer at the next vertical retrace of your display device. This way, the former backbuffer
becomes the new frontbuffer and your new stimulus gets shown to the subject. The former
frontbuffer becomes the new backbuffer and is ready for drawing the next stim. As the
bufferswap is synchronized with vertical retrace and always happens in less than 1 microsecond,
you'll get perfect, flickerfree, tearfree stimulus presentation timing, regardless how long
drawing takes -- Unless obviously you try to draw something too complex in a too short period of time. The important point is that Flip decouples drawing (with its timing variabilities) and actual stimulus presentation - something not possible in the MacOS-9 and Win toolboxes.

Offscreen windows are the same as Textures in the Psychtoolboxes released since 2006. Internally they
are the same thing, so you can always use a Psychtoolbox texture where you would use an Offscreen window and an offscreen
window where you would use a texture. They only differ in creation and performance: Textures are created by Screen('MakeTexture')
from a Matlab image matrix or automatically by the Quicktime movie playback engine or the videocapture engine. Creating them
is very fast and efficient. They are also optimized for fastest possible drawing. Offscreen windows are created by the call
Screen('OpenOffscreenWindow'); - they are initialized with a selectable size, color depth and initial uniform color, not with
image content. They are optimized for fast drawing *into* them - Each Screen drawing command can not only draw to onscreen
windows, but also into offscreen windows. After creation, they are (nearly) synonymous.

E.g.:

Say you have a image matrix I in Matlab, e.g., created via I=imread('myimage.png'):

Then:

tex=Screen('MakeTexture', win, I);

is the same as:

tex=Screen('OpenOffscreenWindow', win);
Screen('PutImage', tex, I);

in, just that the former is much faster than the latter. The advantage is also that the Screen('DrawTexture') command allows to scale, zoom, filter and rotate textures while drawing, that texture drawing is extremely fast as it uses specialized hardware on your graphics card, and much more...

Q: How do you create a duplicate of an offscreen window?

A: You would first create an empty offscreen window of the same size and color depth as your
original offscreen window, then copy the original windows content into the new window:

Be origWin the offscreen window you want to duplicate, then:

duplicateWin = Screen('OpenOffscreenWindow', origWin);
Screen('CopyWindow', origWin, duplicateWin);

-&gt; duplicateWin is a copy of origWin.

Q: Is there any simpe way to set TextSize (or other such parameters) for all windows/screens?

A: No. You have to set it for each window via the Screen('TextSize', win, ...) command. But that's not much work, given that most people have at most two windows.

Q:Can 'OpenOffScreenWindow' windows have multiple buffers?

A: Nope. It wouldn't make sense to have multiple buffers.

[[File:BennyGoodmanStageDoorCanteen.jpg|thumb|Benny Goodman was an American swing bandleader and clarinettist]]

The Clarinet is a superb instrument with a unique sound quality to it. Anyone can play the clarinet. The Clarinet is an ideal instrument for beginners and after a small amount of study students can usually play simple melodies with ease. If you don't read music then don't let that deter you from trying the clarinet. Many melodies can be played by ear and it is one of the instrument's virtues that as soon as you can create a sound it is well within your abilties to improvise to recorded music.

If you are not sure if you would like to play this instrument, ask yourself,
*Would I be good at an instrument that requires air?
*Do I like the sound of the clarinet?
*Am I ready for a challenge?

If you feel that the clarinet is the right instrument for you, go ahead and read on. This book is intended to be a guideline for the beginner, advancer, and professional clarinetist. It is not intended to be a replacement for lessons. In fact, it is recommended that you find a music instructor who can teach you the clarinet, as well as use this book for a guideline to their teachings. A professional clarinet teacher will increase the speed at which you learn and introduce you to the clarinet's techniques and repertoire.

==Goals of this Book==
*To provide basic information on a clarinet
*To provide a fingering chart for reference
*To provide techniques of improving your playing
*To suggest methods of upgrading your clarinet experience
*To help understand the basics of reading music





Note from original author: This book is being written to help educate the beginner, advancer, and even the professional on good technique of the clarinet.  '''Please do not take this as a replacement for private lessons. Do not challenge your instructor with this material, everyone teaches differently, but they should mostly follow the guidelines of this book!'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The History of the Clarinet==
About 2700 B.C., the Egyptians created an instrument called the ''zummara'' (sometimes referred to as the ''memet'').  The zummara was a single-reed instrument, much like the modern day clarinet, but it had a double bore like the double-reeded Greek instrument ''aulos''.  The zummara’s two pipes were parallel so that with each finger the player covered two holes, one on each pipe.  The pipes were said to be out of tune with each other and produced a very dissonant beating sound.

Invented around 1690, the clarinet is a single-reed woodwind instrument with a cylindrical tube. The clarinet evolved from an earlier instrument called the chalumeau, the first true single reed instrument.
Johann Christoph Denner of Nuremberg with the help of his son Jacob improved the chalumeau, creating a new instrument called the clarinet. Denner added two keys to the chalumeau and increased that instruments range by over two octaves. He also created a better mouthpiece and improved the bell (end) of the instrument.
In India, there was an instrument people now call the ''double-clarinet'' but in India it was called the ''pungi'' or the ''magudi''.  The difference between this instrument and the zummara was that the reed was enclosed in a wooden chamber and the left-hand pipe was drone, and the right-hand pipe was melodic.  

Single reed instruments of this type have been found in many cultures throughout the world, as it is a simple way of producing sound. The reeds are called ''idioglot'' reeds and are cut out of part of the instrument that is placed inside the mouth to sound. A simple way of reconstructing one of these idioglot reeds is to cut a small triangular slit in a straw, when this is placed in the mouth it produces a buzzing sound. Instruments with these idioglot reeds are first mentioned in dictionaries in France in the Sixteenth century (for example Estienne (1511)) and are described in more detail in the Seventeenth Century treatises of Mersenne and Trichet. 

The man universally credited for actually inventing, or making, the clarinet was Johann Christoph Denner (1655-1707) with the help of his son, Jacob, of Nuremberg, Germany.  J.C. Denner was well-known and well-respected for the high quality woodwind instruments he made.  Denner was said to have a creative mind; he toyed with the instruments he so finely crafted and it would seem the clarinet was the result of such tinkering.  There is no documented proof that Denner alone developed the clarinet since two of his contemporaries, Klenig and Oberlender, also made clarinets. 
 

However, it must also be mentioned that (apart from a single instrument at Berkley whose attribution is much disputed) there are no extant clarinets by J.C.Denner, only chalumeaux.  

Scholars first believed the clarinet was developed around 1690, but further research has lead scholars and music historians to believe it was developed around 1701-1704.  It is also believed the clarinet was first called a ''mock trumpet''.  There is a music book discovered by a scholar, Thurston Dart, for mock trumpet which was published in 1698, and this was followed by three similar volumes throughout the next decade.  Doubt still remains about who made the clarinet and how.

The accepted hypothesis is that Denner crafted the clarinet, and he did so sometime around 1700.  J.G. Doppelmayr, a contemporary of Denner, wrote a ''Report on the Mathematicians and Artisans of Nuremberg'' in 1730, twenty-three years after Denner’s death.  The report indicates Denner developed the clarinet a little after 1700.  Before this historical text was discovered, historians and scholars only had a piece written in 1778 by C.G. Murr, &quot;Description of the Distinguished Features of Nuremberg,&quot; wherein Murr wrote that Denner created the clarinet in 1690.

What made the ''clarinet'' a clarinet was Denner's great improvement to the old chalumeau. The usual material used for early examples of both instruments is boxwood (a common material in instrument making) with a heteroglot reed (that is separate to the instrument)tied to the upper side of the mouthpiece therefore vibrated by the upper lip .  To change the chalumeau to a clarinet he added a 'speaker key' (also known as the register key) causing the instrument to ''over-blow'' , creating a new and higher register for the instrument. This register is known as the ''clarino'' register (a reference to a style of trumpet playing) and is thought to be the origin of the name of the instrument. Many modern clarinettists still refer to the overblown register of the clarinet as the clarino register, and to the lower register as the chalumeau. 

Acoustically the clarinet acts like a closed cylindrical tube and overblows at the twelfth.  He also equipped it with a bell by enlarging the bore.The mouthpiece and barrel joint are made in one piece and, with Denner's additional key the earliest clarinets are two-keyed instruments. Extant chalumeaux have single keys at the front of the instrument.

==The Clarinet's Early Days==

There is no mention of the name ''clarinet'' until 1690, right after Denner made the first playable clarinet.  In this year, the Graf (Duke) of Gronsfeld in Nuremberg ordered two clarinets from Jacob Denner for the use of his musicians. In 1712, four clarinets that were made out of boxwood were bought by the Nuremberg Town band (''Ratsmusik'').  Since Denner worked in Nuremberg and that’s where they first appeared in the band, it is said that Denner gave the instrument its name.


== History of the clarinet from 1680-1751 ==
The history of the clarinet is a long history beginning in 1690. During that year a man named Johann Cristoph Denner invented the clarinet. These clarinets only had two keys that were mostly made from brass along with the springs. The clarinet however was made from boxwood, plum, ebony, ivory or pear.  Around 1700 he added the register key to his instrument. In 1740 a third key was added ableing the players to play low E. Nine years later a man named Rameau uses the clarinet in his opera in Paris. Shortly after in 1750 Barthold Fritz added the 4th 5th key to the clarinet.  The clarinet is introduced to London by Bach in 1751.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basics to Airflow ==

A good airflow through the clarinet is the most important thing that a clarinetist can do to achieve a good tone.  The airflow, or airstream, is the most important aspect of playing a clarinet.  If you think it is the embouchure, think again. The embouchure can't be the most important thing because no matter how good of an embouchure you have, if there isn't an airstream then there won't be any sound.  The articulations that you use can't be the most important thing either, because again, there would be no sound or at least not a very good one. It doesn't matter how many rhythms you can count or how fast you can play, for if there isn't a good solid airstream going through the clarinet, then all of it is all for naught because it won't sound good.

To back up the methods that were just introduced in the last paragraph, David Pino writes in his book ''The Clarinet and Clarinet Playing'', &quot;Some players make the mistake of thinking that the embouchure is even more important than what the air is doing; this is a mistake because no embouchure, no matter how good it is, will have any effect if an unimpeded airflow is not traveling through it...  ''all'' other aspects of playing should be considered less important than airflow because they actually &quot;depend upon&quot; it...  some players may think that technique, for example, is just as important or even more important than airflow.  To them I point out that technique is just reduced to much finger-wiggling, unless airflow has been established first...  What is a clarinetist going to articulate if he does not have a good airflow?&quot; Pino clearly shows that all other aspects to clarinet are secondary to the importance of airflow.

Leon Russianoff writes in his book ''Clarinet Method'' that the clarinetist must create an ''art'' to handle and improve every aspect of performance, which includes the ability to:

*take in sufficient air at the right moment to sustain long passages
*use air to play easily at any volume, and to increase or decrease that volume at will
*intensify sound
*produce a vast rage of tone colors

To maintain a good airflow through the clarinet, the clarinetist must fill up the lungs with air by filling the bottom of the lungs first.  Fill up with air from bottom to top, the shoulders should, for the most part, remain stationary; do not arch back as you breathe in or crouch over, or slouch for that matter.

&quot;The airflow or the player's use of air generally, can be thought of as having two qualities: (1) pressure, which is a 'constant' and (2)speed, which is a 'variable',&quot; writes Pino.  The pressurized aspect of the airflow, that is caused by  muscular action of the player in the area of his or her waistline is constant, and should remain the same throughout the entire practice time.  This pressure aspect of the airstream is what many people call breath support.  The speed of the airstream should change variably, depending on the music, whether the dynamic is ''forte'' or ''piano''.  In both of these cases it's not so much as to what the muscles of the stomach or diaphragm are doing, but it's more of what it &quot;feels&quot; like.  David Pino continues to write &quot;There are always some exceptions clouding the issue, of course,&quot; by this he means that there are certain instances that when played on the clarinet go against that general rule.  For example, if the player wishes to go down through the &quot;register break&quot; the player may be required to push more air.

As with all wind instruments, you are never really blowing or forcing the air down the shaft, but rather &quot;letting go.&quot; As a final note to airflow and some what of a &quot;summary,&quot; the airflow should be consistent all the time.  Once the clarinetist has discovered how to maintain a good airstream what he or she might have thought at first were finger and technical issues will disappear because the only thing that needed help was not the fingers, but a good strong tone and airstream to flow through the clarinet.

== Breathing exercises ==

There are many different breathing exercises to help teach good constant air flow, and here are just a few examples:

1)  Lie on the floor and just take in deep breaths, as deep as you can make them, then make your mouth into the clarinet embouchure and breath out slowly until all of the air is gone.  Now take a few seconds and breath normally, and then do it again, each time you do it try to take in a little bit more air, expand your lungs, and your rib cage.

2)  Set a metronome to 80 beats/min, and fill up as much air as you can in one count, hold for two counts, then take two quick breaths (one on each beat), and exhale for a designated amount of time (i.e. four beats, six beats, eight beats, eleven beats, etc... it doesn't matter).  You can do this exercise laying down, sitting up, or standing.

3)  Set a metronome to 80 beats/min, and fill up as much as you can in four counts, then hold for two counts, then take two quick breaths on the next two beats (one on each beat), and exhale for a designated amount of time (i.e. four beats, six beats, eight beats, eleven beats, etc... it doesn't matter).  You can do this exercise laying down, sitting up, or standing.

4)  Do exercise 1), 2), or 3) but in a chair, and exhale through your clarinet.

== [[:WikiPedia:Circular Breathing|Circular Breathing]] ==

Circular breathing, if done properly, enables a good constant airflow to be maintained for any desired period of time. Here is how:

# Learn to hold air in your cheeks while breathing in through your nose.
:# Close your mouth and puff your cheeks out.
:# Attempt to breathe in through your nose while holding the air in your cheeks.
:::i) If you suck the air in your cheeks back into your lungs when you try to breathe in through your nose, you need to think about the position of your tongue.
:::ii) Try taking a sip of water (small) and holding it in the back of your throat without letting it travel down your throat.  Think about the position of your tongue while preventing the water from traveling down your throat.  This is the same position as when beginning to say the letter &quot;K&quot;.
:::iii) Swallow the water and then try to hold air in your cheeks again. (Think about the position of your tongue to close off the back of your throat as before.)
:# Practice slowly squeezing the air in your cheeks out through closed lips to create a buzzing sound.
:::i) It is important to remember to keep your throat closed while buzzing in this fashion.
:::ii) You should eventually be able to relax and buzz your lips while breathing in a relaxed manner through your nose.
:::iii) As a secondary thought, you should be able to also hold your mouth open and breath in through your nose ''without'' breathing in through your mouth at the same time.
# Practice blowing out your mouth by squeezing the air as above with the mouthpiece and reed in your embouchure.
:# Do not worry about breathing in through your nose yet while squeezing the air out.  Just get used to squeezing the air from your cheeks quickly and controlled enough to get a smooth sound.
# After learning to squeeze the air from your cheeks to get a smooth, controlled sound a for a second or two, attempt to quickly breathe in through your nose at the same time.
:# Repeat this routine over and over until you alleviate any breaks in the sound.

'''Before continuing to read this guideline it would be advisable to initially consider if your specific game textbook would be suitably put here.  Many game textbooks would be more appropriately on [[StrategyWiki:Main Page|StrategyWiki]].'''

== Game textbook must be in a well organised book format ==

Game textbooks should not be pages and pages of short data, but instead be read as a book. Glossaries or other appendicies are fine however.

Additionally, game textbooks should not have large amounts of short, stubby pages. Game textbooks should flow naturally, and a large amount of short pages would flow much better if merged into a single page.

== Maintain a presentable quality ==

Game textbooks should look good, and be as valid as possible. There are plenty of low-quality or incorrect sites gamers can go to, Wikibooks should not be another one.

== Game textbooks must be more than just a walkthough or database ==

Every wikibook should be a textbook in its own right. A walkthrough or database is not a textbook. Every game has its own walkthough already, be it at GFAQs or some other random place on the internet - so wikibooks does not need to repeat this. If you're looking for game guides, you might want to try [[wikicities:c:gameinfo|Gameinfo]] or [[StrategyWiki:Main Page|StrategyWiki]]. Encyclopedia articles about games are found at Wikipedia, for example [[w:Go (board game)|Go]] and [[w:Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros.]]. [[Wikiquote:Electronic games]] is a collection of quotes from computer and video games.

A useful question to ask is &quot;Will my textbook be useful to non-gamers as well as gamers?&quot;. If you can say yes, then that is indicative that the textbook may be able to stay.</text>

== Lets get this policy started ==

Aight, seems like discussion has died down. But there are still game guides that don't look so good out there, so we need some policy right now to at least begin cleanup of the poorly made guides. To start things off, I say that guides contain more guide material than appendicies. Just that seems to be where game guides ususally go. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 20:59, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

:You know, I actually like this approach better.  Raise the standards, not get rid of it all.  If we want the game guides to be taken seriously, they should be something that would be almost an academic study of the game, not just a page of cheat codes or hacks that would allow you to cheat in multi-player games.  History of the game, earlier games that &quot;inspired&quot; the game design (no software is written in a vaccum... it all has some history to some earlier piece of software), and the philosophy of why the game was designed would be useful.  A brief interview of the game designer would be interesting as well, or perhaps a summary from other sources if it can be found.

:Strategies and statistical analysis would also be very useful.  One game guide I like is [[Monopoly]] which does this kind of detailed strategy without copying the game rules.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:59, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::Now ''that'' would be something even '''I''' might support. :-) --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:58, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::I think the idea of an all-encompassing book is great, as long as the guide content doesn't get buried--most of our visitors are ''still'' only wanting to know how to finish a particular level or beat that final boss. However these individual sections must still be longer than (and &quot;superior&quot; to?) their existing Wikipedia entries. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::: Funny, I've know people who have written the philosophies of why you should choose XXX maple story character over another. Brute force for Warrior, Technology superiority for Crossbowmen, etc. etc. :) Strategy analysis has been done in fighting games such as Dead of Alive; why the &quot;slope&quot; offers an advantage, how to take advantage of a &quot;slope&quot;, and tiers in SSB:M have been created based on frame-by-frame analysis of the game. I think it is possible to do that :)

::: Now something that has been brought up is the &quot;cookbook&quot; style books, geared towards video games. That is, that book right now that is being written about Fighting Game moves. I'm sure there '''has''' to be a way to include that here? Or is it good enough to clean up the fighting-game moves into histories and patterns of the common attacks? d df f punch == long range from Mortal Kombat Lu Kang but has been used in Street Fighter for Ken/Ryu and the like? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

There are many more ways to teach somebody how to play a game other than walkthoughs. For instance, you can have incremental hints, in-game help, practice your skills et cetera.--[[User:Branko|Branko]] 16:20, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

: Exactly. But I'm sorry to be ignorant, but I don't see your point :-/ Maybe you want to make it a requirement that all game guides should include more than just a walkthough? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:27, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I was merely agreeing to the above, and stating a couple of further ways that games can be taught. As for requirements, I believe in as little requirements as possible.--[[User:Branko|Branko]] 17:32, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Proposed Policy: Game Books must be more than just a common walkthough or databases ===

Every game has its own walkthough already, be it at GFAQs or some other random place on the internet.

Idealy, games guides should include stuff that is useful not only to the gamer, but stuff that is useful for the game developer. This does not necessarily have to be formulas; for example, a breakdown of the AI in pac-man so that the gamer can predict where the ghosts go would be more than enough to fit this requirement. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 14:28, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

=== Proposed Policy: Game Books must be well formatted ===
Basically, just organize the book so that you can click on &quot;level 10&quot; and you'd have a walkthough of it right there and then. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 14:28, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

=== Proposed Policy: Spoiler-free in regards to storyline ===
No story should be spoiled by the guide. However, cheats and level guides aren't exactly &quot;spoilers&quot;. If a &quot;spoiler free&quot; section is made in the book, then it should not contain the &quot;answer&quot; to any puzzle. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:48, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

:I'd say this is an impossible requirement, and one that doesn't make a lot of good sense to try in many cases (for example, you may fight a boss who was earlier an ally).  If you're doing a walkthrough, you will be giving spoilers.  A better idea may be to put a spoiler warning around major info of that sort, or to put a general spoiler warning on pages which may contain spoilers.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 22:08, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

:: Aight, i can settle for that. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 00:32, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== How about the Fighting Game Moves guide? ==
sigh... OK.  There I was sitting and working on this wikibooks project that I started last night, and made considerable progress on, when in the middle of editing a new entry, I see &quot;You have one new message.&quot;  So I go check it out, and there's a message from LV that reads &quot;Good Luck!&quot; and I thought, &quot;how nice.&quot;  So out of curiosity, I clicked on LV and went to his discussion page, where I saw the comment about game manuals, and followed that to the Staff lounge page, and ultimately ended up here.  After reading everything that LV had to say, I honestly can't tell if LV's good luck was genuine or sarcastic.  Why did I end up here starting this project?  Well, one day I went over to the Ken Masters page on wikipedia and proceeded to add some of his move lists, which were promptly deleted from the page, much to my chagrin.  So I thought about it, read the wikipedia policies, and read the wikibooks policies, and concluded that wikibooks would be precisely the place to work on such a project, and it could be even better and bigger than if I had done it on wikipedia in the first place.  And there were other video game manuals on the site so it seemed like the perfect place.  I made sure to cross reference everything between my WB pages and the appropriate WP pages and so forth.  I was relatively happy... until I read a message that wished me good luck.  Funny how that works.

Look, I can understand the desire to have serious content on WB.  It certainly would help to make WB one of the more valuable and worthwhile resources on the internet compared to the crap that's out there.  But serious is in the eye of the beholder, and I find the topic I am writing about, namely fighting game moves, to be a serious topic.  After all, I'm a game developer, and I take such topics seriously.  Will everyone who visits WB consider the topic a serious one?  Probably not.  Will some people who visit WB consider it serious?  Well, if I did, I don't see why someone else out there would not.  I'm sure I could find many books on WB that are about subjects that I don't consider serious subjects, but are here none the less.  Who is the arbitor of &quot;serious&quot;?  Is it the person who owns and runs WB?  Is it a right your earn only after you have contributed a certain amount of text?  Is it open to the public forum?  Here's my biggest question: What does it really hurt to have not-so-serious topics in WB?  Is it causing an increase in the cost of running WB?  Is it slowing the site down?  If someone didn't do a search for game manuals, would they even know that they existed in the first place?  How does their exsistance stop casual readers from using WB the way it was intended?  Just food for thought.  I figured if I could find a book on a subject in Barnes and Nobles, or Waldenbooks, then it would be appropriate for me to offer similar content on WB for free.

I'm not going to work too hard on this project now if it has the potential to be deleted.  And if it went away, I would be sad, but I've got other projects that I can work on.  But the if the existance of the page helps even just a few people, isn't it worth having around?  Isn't that the point, to help readers? That's what I thought it was for...

:: The scope of Wikibooks is starting to be very difficult to assign. I really don't know what to say about that guide you are starting, and as far as I could tell, it is in good shape. I know I used your guide as an example in my argument; but I'm sorry that I didn't know it existed (seriously, I didn't). But now that it is there.

:: As for the basics, I know [[User: Jimbo Wales]] is basically the guy in command here. He is the creator of wikipedia, and is part of that board thingy (not too sure about things). Things are getting confusing as far as I could tell on this, and I'd hate to loose a contributor to this project; especially that I know you are doing a good job (so far) with your guide.

:: As far as arguments are, I hope you understand the [[Jokebook]] incident? Its organization is similar to yours IMO (a cookbook style organization that has little &quot;teaching&quot; value and won't be used in a classic kind of class). As far as I know, the current test for what is on Wikibooks is &quot;Will it be used in a class?&quot;

:: Now, I don't really agree with that test, but that is what seems to be what most people follow. Strange that we have at '''least''' 2 bookshelves on games that technically don't follow that test :-/

:: Well, lets me put the situation straight now. Wikibooks is going through a policy defining period, and not everyone believes Video Games should be on Wikibooks, and not everyone agreed on it before. The issue has however; been brought out by 3 deletes by [[User: Jimbo Wales]], 2 obviously bad books that proclaimed racism, and 1 book called the [[Jokebook]]. The Jokebook is really the only real controvercial delete left, but the Jokebook authors simply moved the Jokebook onto another site an now the debate has shifted over to Video Games.

:: That is the situation in a nutshell. In my opinion, you are doing a great job on your guide, and I'd like to see it done. IMO, it would be better if you had a page on attack patterns, d--df--f punch for example, tends to be a long-range attack in Fighting Games. That way, it is useful to both Video Game players, and can be used in a Video Game Design class as the best &quot;User Interphase&quot; design. This is strictly opinion however, so I can't really guarentee a yes/no answer to your guide unless the admins/sysops get in here and agree with me. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Yes, don't let ''MY'' opinions on matters affect your editing. WB is under some confusion right now, but hopefully things will be worked out soon. The Board is meeting this week, so hopefully we will have some closure on these issues. For now, just keep plugging away. If you, or anyone, has any questions, please feel free to ask me. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:47, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:::: Oh, and believe me, I know what you are going through right now. When I got here, I started working immediatly on my [[MapleStory]] guide, then the whole Jokebook incident started up. I understand what it is like to feel that your stuff is about to be deleted. What I reccomend is to learn everything you can, and try to argue your point why it should be here. Also, you wouldn't have to worry about an immediate deletion; usually the admins give a couple of days for anyone to download the stuff before it is deleted. Even then, if something is &quot;deleted&quot;, admins can still view what used to be there. So your work will still be saved, and I guess that is what counts. -[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:57, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

== For (Wikibooks should include game guides) ==
* Game strategy guides qualify as '''how-to guides''', and Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|includes those]].
* Wikibooks should include instructional material, including game guides, even if it can only be read outside of school.
* '''Wikicities is not a sister project''' of Wikibooks, so it is incorrect to imply that because Wikicities exists, we should move game guides from Wikibooks to Wikicities.
* Related to the above point, there is no other Wikimedia sister project other than Wikibooks that would be able to host game guide content, baring the possibility of creating a whole new Wikimedia sister project exclusively for this sort of content.
* Potential contributors can use the guides to '''become familiar with how to edit Wikibooks'''. Some contributors might be less afraid of damaging a game guide, rather than the calculus textbook.
* The game guides can '''attract readers''' to Wikibooks who might become contributors to other parts of Wikibooks.
* Some games are '''studied in schools''', especially [[Chess]]. Also, schools for video game developers study existing video games.
* College major areas of study include video game theory and game design in some Universities.  Some Game Design courses include:
**[http://www.gamedegree.com/ UAT bachelors degree in Video Game design]
**[http://www.fullsail.com/index.cfm/fa/landing.gamedesignschool/mnc/25/game-design-school Full Sail Game Design Major] (BTW, 1st major univserity to offer game design major)
**[http://www.stanford.edu/class/sts145/ History of Computer Game Design at Standford University]
**[http://www.newport.ac.uk/amd/ug/cata.htm University of Wales Computer Game Design Major]
**[http://www.animationarena.com/majoring-in-video-game-design.html Discussion of a Master's Degree in Video Game Design at Southern Methodist University]
**[http://gdiac.cis.cornell.edu/contact.html Video Game Design Curriculum at Cornell University]
* Wikibooks '''should include sports''' because many schools have sports teams.
* Many schools have extracurricular activities for groups of gamers. Some '''student government associations recognise''' these gaming groups.
* '''Wikipedia includes games''', so Wikibooks should too.  If a Wikipedia article exists, it ought to be reasonable to make a NPOV Wikibook on the same subject, given enough source material to work with to add enough content for a full book-length project.
* '''Students want to learn games.''' Wikibooks should include game guides so that these readers are satisfied.
* Game guides will '''help in the future''' the growth of Wikibooks. (Including game guides simply makes Wikibooks larger.)
* It would be '''difficult to remove or transwiki''' a potential of 2 bookshelves, [[Wikibooks:Games_bookshelf | Games Bookshelf ]] and [[Wikibooks: Computer and video games bookshelf | Computer and video games bookshelf]]
* German Wikibooks chose [[:de:Go]] as '''book of the month'''. Other games at Wikibooks in other languages:
** [[:fr:Solution, truc et astuce de jeu vidéo]] ''video games''
** &lt;del&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:de:Regal:Diverse#Spiele]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/del&gt; ''games''
** &lt;del&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:de:Regal:Sport]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/del&gt; ''sport'' -- &lt;small&gt;de-WB changed subjects -- [[User:Juetho|Juetho]] 09:29, 5 February 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
** [[:de:Regal:Spiele]] ''games''
* Bandwidth issues for hosting and serving Game Guide content really is trivial and elimination of all game guides is not going to make much of an impact on server performance for any Wikimedia project.
* Gaming guides and Wikijunior are two relatively isolated development groups so there is not going to be any real impact on Wikijunior regardless of what decision is made on gaming guides.  Besides, future directions of Wikijunior are going to open up a seperate domain like http://www.wikijunior.org that is already live.  It is more likely that kids are going to start on Wikijunior and then discover the gaming guides later, especially given the limited content on Wikijunior at the moment.
* The actual transwiki (if it takes place) would be a minor inconveniance compared to the '''backlash of the readers and editors''' when they find out they are no longer welcome here.
* '''Writing textbooks should be encouraged'''. As it it, Wikibooks is woefully lacking in finished content. Chasing away potential authors is a bad idea.
* '''FUD arguments against should not count'''. Many of the arguments against focus on fears that something bad will happen if game books are allowed here. For instance, Wikiversity might split if it has to share the same room with game books, or children might read game books instead of the especially designated children's text books. These are problems that can be tackeld when we get there.

== Against (Wikibooks should exclude game guides) ==
* Game guides are '''random guides on a subject that someone likes''' (see [[WB:WIW#What Wikibooks includes]]) so they are not allowed at Wikibooks.
* '''It doesn't matter if the games themselves are on Wikipedia'''. That is an encyclopaedia, this is not. The most editing article on WP is George W. Bush. Do we need a Wikibook on how to become the U.S. President? There is an article on Ann Coulter. Do we need a Wikibook on ''How to Talk to a Liberal (If you Must)''? Just because something is germane to WP does not make it germane for WB.
*Yes, classes may be offered on video game design, but a textbook for those classes would '''not include multiple complete walkthroughs and cheat codes'''. Maybe one or two examples within a larger [[video game design]] book, but not one for every game available.
* '''Entertainment is not academic.''' Because game guides instruct the reader in how to entertain oneself, they cannot qualify as academic, which makes them less useful for Wikibooks. (Instructing the reader to entertain ''others'' might be academic. Game development instead of game strategy.)
* The game guides '''waste bandwith'''. Excluding them would reduce the stress on the Wikimedia servers.
* Game guides '''harm Wikijunior''' because  children may read them instead of [[Wikijunior]].
* There is '''no school class for videogame strategy''' anywhere. So Wikibooks cannot allow video game guides, even if its allows other game guides.
* Game guides '''reduce the standard of Wikibooks'''. Removing all game guides would reduce the scope of material on Wikibooks, which would have several benefits. Wikipedia would be discouraged from moving material to Wikibooks during &quot;articles for deletion&quot;. Contributors would have more interest in Wikibooks because Wikibooks would be more academic.
* Moving game guides to Wikicities would '''help Google ads fund Wikicities'''. Though Wikicities is not a Wikimedia project, some Wikibooks contributors are also Wikicities contributors who support both Wikibooks and Wikicities.
* '''There are other places to go''' if you want to find video game guides.
* '''Just because something is easy, does not make it right.''' People claim the sheer difficulty of transwikiing an entire bookshelf should stop it from being done. Cleaning up after vandals is hard, should we just stop doing that too? Also, one can use [[Special:Export]] and [[Special:Import]] to help in transwiki.

== Double-edge Arguments (Arguments that can be viewed to support either side) ==
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|For game guides|| Against game guides
|-
|Gamers would be isolated if Wikibooks looked more academic

----
Here is a quote of [[User:Aya]] on [[Wikibooks talk:Policies and guidelines]]. One could argue that this is the appropriate location for game guides, or that they should be moved to yet another wiki.

''It all started with the project now hosted at en.wikipedia.org. The idea being to collaboratively create a generalized encyclopedia with no (apparent) limitation on its scope. ... At some point, someone (perhaps Jimbo?) decided this was going to get in the way of creating an encyclopedia, so a number of other Wikimedia projects were set up, in the hopes that this data could be transferred to a more appropriate location. ... Over time, some content was transferred, while some was not. Since each project had its own 'what &lt;project&gt; is/isn't' page, users changed its scope over time as well. The endless cycle continues today:''

# ''Create a new wiki
# ''Create a badly-defined scope
# ''Fill it with inappropriate content
# ''When it becomes unmanagable, goto 1''

== Strategy Wiki ==

I'm not sure if this has been raised or not, but a move of all game guides to [http://strategywiki.net/wiki/Main_Page Strategy Wiki] may help to improve the quality of all the game guides while freeing up space and bandwidth on the Wiki Book servers. The guides would receive much more attention and would be better placed than in an academic area. [[User:Jackhynes|Jackhynes]] 21:47, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

:I've never heard of this site before (you must be new) but yes that's certainly another possible destination. When and if the time comes we may even end up lining up all the contenders and then voting between them, who knows? Anyway, thanks for the heads-up, I'm enjoying the OOT guide already. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:12, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

==Video game walkthroughs to be removed from Wikibooks==

Please see these postings from Jimbo [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Computer_and_video_games_bookshelf&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=434943] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=434945]. These manuals need to go (except if they can be shown to be of clear educational value - and maybe none of the walkthroughs we have meets that criterion, though there may be the odd exception). 

This is a decision of Jimbo's based on Wikimedia Foundation's charter. Therefore, whilst the details of how it is implemented are open for discussion, and it is clear that Jimbo is happy for there to be sufficient time for the content to find a new home (or new homes) before it is removed from wikibooks, the general principle (that content should be educational) is not open for debate.

As this move is likely to have general interest, I suggest discussion on it is directed to the [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge|Staff Lounge]], [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:49, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

: Actually I do not recall anything in the Wikimedia Foundation charter being invoked, and [[User:Jimbo Wales]] did not invoke its position as the President (or whichever title) of the Wikimedia Foundation. However, the removal of video game guides appears to have broad support. Do discuss it at the [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:29, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

::To be clear, Jimbo said &quot;They are a violation of the educational mission charter of the Wikimedia Foundation!&quot; on [[Wikibooks talk:Computer and video games bookshelf]], [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:03, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:::I cannot believe that is why totally perfect game books are being deleted. Well I think then the mission charter of Wikimedia Foundation needs to be changed. Biographies of indiviuals on Wikipedia are kept, &amp; they are at such a high quality. Biographies of indiviuals have NO educational value, and they are still kept! How can people delete these books?!!???? Education is within the eye of the beholder. Games improve handeye coordination. How are books which help you achieve a certain goal in a game, games improve handeye coordination, not be educational?!!?!??!![[w:User:100110100|100110100 of Wikipedia]][[User:198.161.51.112|198.161.51.112]] 20:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

== Expanding and revising this guideline ==

The whole debate over video games has missed the mark entirely, in my opinion.  This guideline was established well before the debate over video games was brought up by Jimbo, and it seems as though he didn't even know it existed or what direction that Wikibooks was going.  I propose that we as Wikibooks contributors help define these guidelines and now try to make them more official policy instead as to what is considered acceptable for a Wikibook about video games.

This ''topic'' should not be forbidden, but instead the standards for what might be considered acceptable should be raised and narrowed.  Mind you, this in effect becomes a sort of [[WB:WIW]] policies that apply specifically for this one bookshelf.

One &quot;policy&quot; that I think needs to be move to an enforced standard is that video game walkthroughs should be specically prohibited.  That seems to be Jimbo's largest argument against video game books, and I would agree that they are not only non-textbook in nature, they are non-book in nature as well.  These are in essence video game reviews, and that is something that should not be on Wikibooks, and reviews of this nature have been repeatedly culled from Wikibooks for a number of reasons.  Art reviews and book reviews have also met similar fates in this regard.

A general deletion of all content on the video game bookshelf is simply pig-headed and wrong.  That is deleting content strictly because of its topic, and does not follow any sort of guideline of any kind.

I think other areas should be addressed by this guideline.  The whole point here is that authors who try to create a Wikibook should know ''in advance'' what is considered acceptable, and things like the Pokedex should not have been allowed to develop to the degree that it had before objections occured.  Obviously some specific policies need to be established over acceptable content with this topic, and that is something that has occured with other collaborative projects in the past, including on Wikipedia.  Because of the actions of a few, we have to be much more restrictive in this particular area than with other topics on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

:What do you propose should stay and what should go? If we prohibit walkthroughs, and if we prohibit reviews, then what else is there to write on the topic of individual games? Besides perhaps an annotated discussion of the story or the dialog in a particular game, I can't imagine what else we would have here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:21, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

::Hmmm... it would seem that an &quot;''annotated discussion of the story or the dialog in a particular game''&quot; would be more germane in an encyclopedia article. I'm thinking Rob has the right idea. We can have plenty of books on the design of the game, the history involved in making it, any real-life implications of the game, other issues dealing with the game, ''plus'' a brief summary of the plot/characters if warranted. The topic is fine, the content is what needs to be judged. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:40, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

:::I think that you are trying to walk a fine line, and are setting yourself up for future problems. &quot;Real life implications of the game&quot; and &quot;Other issues dealing with the game&quot; reek to me of ambiguity and--worse yet--of NPOV violations. The design of a videogame, like books on the design of any other peice of software, belong on the CS bookshelf (possibly with a cross-reference on the art bookshelf), not a specialized VG bookshelf. The entire subject of videogames is certainly not a taboo subject, but if we cut out all the fat, there is virtually no reason to keep a separate bookshelf around for it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:53, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
::::Well then perhaps we don't ''need'' to have a separate shelf. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
:::Although, now that I think about it, perhaps a good way to handle many of these games would be to have one main textbook (Video Games/Video Game Design/Issues in Video Game/Some other title) with each particular game as a chapter. Kind of like a book of case studies. Maybe chronological? Start with something like Pong/Atari-type games, move to NES (Mario Brothers/Duck Hunt), yadda yadda yadda, Playstation2 (Grand Theft Auto/Madden football... and yes, I know these have been around longer than PS2 ;-)), X-Box 360 (whatever the hot game of the moment is?). That way games could be looked at, but in an academic sort of way. Pinnacle games could be looked at with a few oddballs thrown in. This doesn't have to be the only game book on WB, but I think this would be a good start to show games have a place. Anyone wanna help start building a list of topical games? I already have pointed out a few to start. Thoughts? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:55, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
::::This has been a long standing issue on Wikibooks as well, wheither a topic should be confined under one title or if multiple Wikibook titles can be created.  Perhaps at this time, just to prove the point, video games should be put under a single book, especially if we can't find too much content from the individual Wikibooks that currently exist that don't fit the restrictions of no or very limited walkthroughs.  If somebody wants to make, for instace, the [[Doom]] book that goes into detail about John Carmak and ID software, and does a scholarly textual exposition on the topic of Doom as a game, I don't see what the problem is.  There is material available to write such a book, and I think there is value to having something like that here on Wikibooks.  This is about raising standards and noting that Wikibooks that are about video games need additional restrictions precisely because this has been abused in the past.  BTW, I do think that a general Video Game book that goes into the chronilogical order of video game design, starting with [[w:Space War|Space War]] (written about a decade before Pong) and ending up with MMORPGs would be a fun and interesting book.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:19, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

This initiative of Rob's to regularise the situation, which includes [[WB:WIW]] and a new [[How-to book guidelines]], is, in my view, to be welcomed. It would be good to emphasise that Wikibooks is for textbooks, and making it clear that &quot;textbook&quot; is to be given its normal, wide meaning. As Jimbo has noted, a game manual or walkthrough is not a textbook, but it is possible to have a textbook on game design or game strategy generally. I have made a number of suggested amendments (including a name change) to help reflect this.

I also wish to add that I think the point about potentially merging some of the content is a good one - so that we don't end up with a separate wikibook relating to study on each game, and instead having a smaller number of books describing aspects of different games, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:39, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== Added metric for what is acceptable here ==

Meh, I'm not sure if I should even comment on this, it almost seems like a minor edit, but just incase anyone disagrees with my [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Game_textbook_guidelines&amp;diff=488372&amp;oldid=488310 edit], discuss it here. The only issue I can see that we run into is Chess strategies, as most strategy books for humans suck for computers. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 19:41, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

:The only disagreement I have with it is that I don't think the answer to your question is conclusive on the point, although it would be a good indicator as to whether it is appropriate to Wikibooks. I've therefore toned it down a bit, but kept the implication, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:13, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

== Is there a notability criteria for games to have books on them here? ==

I've noticed that there's absolutely no mention of this anywhere in any of the Wikibooks policies I can find, and none on these guidelines.  Well, for instance, take this freeware ASCII game that just had its first public release, [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/ Dwarf Fortress]; it would plainly never pass, say, Wikipedia's notability guidelines on anything.  Even though the version is technically an alpha, though, it's been in the works for around four years and is rather large and complex. Would it be approprate to write a textbook on it here? (The game could certainly ''support'' a large and detailed textbook, despite what it might sound like; my only real question is if such a low-profile games should have guides here in the first place.)  My guess is no, but I couldn't find a single policy that would make its low profile an issue, so I thought that at least asking here could lead to the policies getting clarified. --[[User:Aquillion|Aquillion]] 21:15, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

:You have to understand that the notion of a &quot;textbook&quot; doesn't have anything to do with the notability of the game. Even the most notable games in the world simply don't get &quot;textbooks&quot; here on wikibooks. A &quot;textbook&quot; is a book that can be used as a companion text for a course of study in an accredited institution. For example, you could write a book that involves a completely obscure game, if you taught a greater lesson, and if the book could be used in a course. Also, we don't cater to hypothetical courses, such as &quot;they could possibly teach this somewhere&quot;. Now, there are courses about ''video game design'', but there are simply not courses on ''video game playing''. Now, since this game you are talking about is in an alpha version, and is currently being developed, it is possible (albeit unlikely) that you could write a textbook on the rigours of videogame development, the fine points of videogame story line writing, The user-interaction methodology for a text-based game (or for that matter, the methodology for designing a text-based interface to any software program). In short, it has more to do with the way you write your textbook, and less about the object on which you write. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

: Nonetheless: we'll need a metric to distinguish between Chess and other games. I'm all ears; and so is the policy. Jimbo himself said Chess is allowed on wikibooks; and i'm sure we all agree to that. But what we don't know... is where do we draw the line? 
: An edutainment game (Reader Rabbit for example) should be allowed on Wikibooks IMO; even if it is a video game; and a book on the act of playing the game as well. Finally; a well made game should be documented in a book somewhat. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 20:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Talk 1==

Hi, this is &quot;Old Word Wolf&quot; speaking.  Yes, there's much that could be better organized and clarified, as the prior speaker (below) points out in several specific ways. I cannot address all his/her points because I haven't gotten that far yet -- but I will, I promise.  

My initial contribution, right now, is a strong distaste for the intro's reliance on the phrase &quot;good writing.&quot;  Good implies a moral quality, although I know that's not the intention here.  If no one objects, I'll change it to a more precise adjective, depending on the context:  clear writing, precise writing, etc., along those lines.

Also, there's a major difference in meaning between &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;complex,&quot; and I think the introductory text really means &quot;complex.&quot;  Writing, in all its forms is arguably quite complex, but it is often quite UN-complicated.  Most modern organizational frameworks are not complicated; many sentence patterns are not complicated; many arguments are simple and straightforward, i.e., uncomplicated.

My observations here are not meant to discredit or detract from the valuable contribution prior writers have made to this section. Quite the opposite.
O.W.W. (m.j.tarnowski)

==Talk 2==

I think the term &quot;mode&quot; is confusing here when talking about steps or activities in the writing process. Most compositional theorists use &quot;mode&quot; to describe the generic &quot;types of writing&quot; -- ie definiton, narration, cause and effect, etc. I wouldn't quibble over this word if it weren't used within the same discipline to mean something much different. Thus, I've replaced &quot;mode&quot; with &quot;steps&quot; or &quot;activities.&quot; 

What's up with the &quot;5 criteria&quot; section coming right in the middle of the preview of the process? Is this promise carried throughout rest of wikitext? if not, it maybe should go away -- it seems thrust in willy nilly with no hookup or followup to surrounding content.

Also, the &quot;materiality and genre&quot; subchapter heading seems out of place in &quot;process&quot; here -- unless it is going to be written (hasn't been done yet)specifically on how these elements affect the writing process. There is quite a substantial discussion on analyzing assignments and deciphering/negotiating &quot;modes&quot; that seems to do the job. I suggest deleting this section unless someone can make it unique and a seamless part of the other steps in the writing process section.

Finally, I am waaaay confused about how revising and editing are presented. Maybe I'm being overly simplistic, but isn't it somewhat accepted that &quot;revising&quot; is changing text at the macro level, &quot;editing&quot; is changing at the sentence level,&quot; and &quot;proofreading&quot; is looking for typos and formatting errors? If not, I will totally back off. But if others agree with me about this distinction, i think we should revamp and reorder these sections...even though we are emphasizing recursivity, which is cool, i think the order should be drafting, revising, editing, proofreading........

this is what i was taught in grad school about the levels of the process, and it is the way i teach my students, which is a hard task, since they come from hs with the notion that doing &quot;editing&quot; on the sentence level is the first and only process they need while drafting...is a better way to look at this, going from higher concerns to lower concerns?

----
First off, I'm not sure who is speaking above. However, I'm not familiar with your description of &quot;revision&quot; and &quot;editing.&quot; Editing is considering changes that should be made to a document, whereas revision is actually making changes. Professional editors usually don't actually revise a document--that's up to the writer. Proofreading is simply the &quot;last scan&quot; of a document to check for typos and such (at that point, no major changes should be necessary). --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 18:38, 4 December 2005 (UTC)
----
Someone has been adding chapters here. Do we really want to add these chapters? I think the one on collaboration is a good idea. I'm not sure if the &quot;Materiality and Genre&quot; section is a duplicate of the &quot;Analyzing Assignments&quot; chapter under Writing Apps, though. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 18:41, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

== Research misspelled ==

Towards the end of the second paragraph of the &quot;research&quot; section.

==Introduction vs Overview==

At some point, the title of the first heading was &quot;Overview&quot;, later changed to &quot;Introduction&quot;. As this section is a sort of summary of the book, and, AFAIK, summaries of this sort are typically titled &quot;Overview&quot;, I have reverted &quot;Introduction&quot; to &quot;Overview&quot;. An overview can be likened to a birdview of a landscape; it provides a big picture of what is to come, leaving out the detail. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:10, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

== spelling... ==

In the 2nd paragraph of Research...the word research is spelled incorrectly twice.

== major omissions ==

typical of web articles on this subject
but incomplete and suboptimal approach given as the final answer

== Above the heads of first year college students? ==

&quot;Churchill grew so irritated at pedants telling him...&quot; Do first year college students know the meaning of &quot;pendants&quot;? I thought it was a typo at first. I looked up the word, and the meaning is appropriate, but it might read more easily if it just said &quot;people telling him&quot; or another word that everyone knows. --[[User:Polintr|Polintr]] ([[User talk:Polintr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Polintr|contribs]]) 21:39, 8 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Numerous Universities offer courses on the design and programming of Operating Systems Kernels. This textbook is designed for the students of such courses. Please note, however, that while this book is aimed at individuals who hope, either professionally or as a hobby, to work on programming operating systems in the future, it '''should not''' be used as an organisational space for creating a new operating system. Rather, this book is aimed at discussing key issues in the design of Operating Systems, and existing theories about doing so effectively, from a Neutral Point of View.

Also, this Wikibook is focused on single-box operating systems. None of the [[Wikipedia:TOP500]] computers are like that — most of them distribute their operating system in the way described in the [[Building a Beowulf Cluster]] Wikibook (many boxes in one building), and even more widely geographically distributed systems are also becoming important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:OS-structure2.svg|thumb|right|500px|Structure of monolithic, micro, and hybrid kernels.]]

The kernel is the core of an operating system. It is the software responsible for running programs and providing secure access to the machine's hardware. Since there are many programs, and resources are limited, the kernel also decides when and how long a program should run.  This is called scheduling. Accessing the hardware directly can be very complex, since there are many different hardware designs for the same type of component. Kernels usually implement some level of hardware abstraction (a set of instructions universal to all devices of a certain type) to hide the underlying complexity from applications and provide a clean and uniform interface. This helps application programmers to develop programs without having to know how to program for specific devices. The kernel relies upon software drivers that translate the generic command into instructions specific to that device.

An operating system kernel is not strictly needed to run a computer. Programs can be directly loaded and executed on the &quot;bare metal&quot; machine, provided that the authors of those programs are willing to do without any hardware abstraction or operating system support. This was the normal operating method of many early computers, which were reset and reloaded between the running of different programs. Eventually, small ancillary programs such as program loaders and debuggers were typically left in-core between runs, or loaded from read-only memory. As these were developed, they formed the basis of what became early operating system kernels. The &quot;bare metal&quot; approach is still used today on many video game consoles and embedded systems, but in general, newer systems use kernels and operating systems.

Four broad categories of kernels:
* ''[[Operating_System_Design/Kernel_Architecture/Monolithic_Kernel|Monolithic kernels]]'' provide rich and powerful abstractions of the underlying hardware.
* ''[[Operating_System_Design/Kernel_Architecture/Microkernel|Microkernels]]'' provide a small set of simple hardware abstractions and use applications called servers to provide more functionality.
* ''[[Operating_System_Design/Kernel_Architecture/Exokernel|Exokernels]]'' provide minimal abstractions, allowing low-level hardware access. In exokernel systems, library operating systems provide the abstractions typically present in monolithic kernels.
* ''[[Operating_System_Design/Kernel_Architecture/Hybrid_kernel|Hybrid]]'' (''modified microkernels'') are much like pure microkernels, except that they include some additional code in kernelspace to increase performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spirits are one of the main ingredients in mixed drinks, along with other alcoholic beverages, [[bartending/Mixers|mixers]] and [[bartending/Garnishes|garnishes]]. They are prepared by distillation from a fermented substance such as fruit, vegetables,  grain, sugar cane, cactus juice, etc. The word spirits generally refers to distilled beverages low in sugars and containing at least 40º proof / 20% ABV (alcohol by volume). (In Germany distilled beverages as low as 15% ABV (30ºproof) are considered spirits.)

1½ ounces of 40% ABV / 80ºproof spirits contains about 1 American Standard Unit of Alcohol (which is 14 grams of alcohol, or about 18 ml/0.6 ozs.  by volume).  This is much higher than the United Kingdom's unit which is 7.9 g/10 ml. This must be borne in mind when calculating units of alcohol in drink recipes.

==Brandy==
{{wikipedia|Brandy}}
*40-60% ABV (80-120º proof)

Brandy (short for 'brandywine', from Dutch ''brandewijn''—'burnt wine') is a general term for distilled wine. In addition to wine, this spirit can also be made from grape pomace or fermented fruit juice. Unless specified otherwise, brandy is made from grape wine. It is normally consumed as an after-dinner drink. Brandy made from wine is often colored with caramel coloring to imitate the effect of long aging in wooden casks; pomace and fruit brandies are generally drunk un-aged, and are not usually colored. Cognac is the most highly regarded spirit in this category.

==Cachaça==
{{wikipedia|Cachaça}}
With Cachaça you make the famous long drink ''Caipirinha''. Cachaça is made by the distillation of fermented squeezed sugar cane, and is a very common drink in Brazil. It is also called Pinga or Aguardente. People drink it mostly pure, straight up, room temperature, no ice, nothing on it, on a very small glass like tequila type glass, or vodka type glass. In Brazil it is an inexpensive drink, but not in Europe, since it has to be imported. There are some old brands that can cost quite a lot. It can be found in many supermarkets all around Europe. A simple drink can be made with Cachaça, honey and lemon, serve in the same small glass, no ice, room temperature. Cachaça can be used also as an ingredient in many long drinks, called ''Batidas'' (shaken) with fruits, sweet condensed milk, and a lot of ice. The most famous long drink is ''Caipirinha'', very refreshing, and very strong: one whole lemon cut in 8 equal parts (don´t peel), two soup spoons of sugar, squeeze both inside a glass with a thick stick, smash the lemon with the sugar until all the juice is mixed with sugar, (serve with the lemon bagasse in the glass)(use a long glass type, or short fat glass), add a lot of Cachaça, and a lot of ice, mix, drink, and forget.

==Gin==
{{wikipedia|Gin}}
 
*37.5% ABV (75º proof)&lt;br&gt;
Gin is a spirit, or strong alcoholic beverage. It is made from the distillation of white grain spirit and juniper berries, which provide its distinctive flavor. The taste of ordinary gin is very dry, and as such it is frequently mixed with other beverages. It should not be confused with sloe gin, a sweet liqueur traditionally made from sloes (the fruit of the blackthorn) infused in gin.

The most common style of gin, typically used for mixed drinks, is &quot;London dry gin&quot;, which refers not to brand, marque, or origin, but to a distillation process. London dry gin is a high-proof spirit, usually produced in a column still and re-distilled after the botanicals are added to the base spirit. In addition to juniper, it is usually made with a small amount of citrus botanicals like lemon and bitter orange peel. Other botanicals that may be used include anise, angelica root, orris root, cinnamon, coriander, and cassia bark.  The dry character and forward juniper flavor of these gins allows them to be mixed with comparatively sweet ingredients without becoming overwhelmed, whereas sweeter or more subtle gins might disappear, making the cocktail more like a vodka cocktail with none of the classic aromatic gin character.

A well-made gin will be very dry with a smooth texture lacking in harshness. The flavor will be harmonious yet have a crisp character with a pronounced juniper flavor.

Compound gin is gin where the juniper flavoring is added to the neutral spirit and there is no re-distillation

==Rum==
{{wikipedia|Rum}}
*37.5 - 57% ABV (75 - 114º proof)&lt;br&gt;
The production of rum dates back to the seventeenth century. It is distilled from either fermented sugarcane-juice or fermented molasses, and can be nearly colorless and faintly aromatic with a light body, or dark brown with a heavy body, flavorful and having a rich aroma.

Most of the world's rum comes from the Caribbean. Puerto Rico is home of the white or silver rum which is clear and light in body and flavor. Puerto Rican golden and amber rums have a deeper color and flavor, while Jamaican and Cuban rums are rich and full-bodied.

The distillation process decides the flavor and aroma of the rum, with continuous- or patent-still distillation giving a light-bodied rum, and the traditional pot still a richer and heavy-bodied rum. Some rums are given additional flavor by the addition of herbs, spices or fruits.

The color of the rum depends on how the rum is aged. Most rum is aged in charred oak casks giving it a brownish or yellowish color, frequently enhanced with caramel, while rum aged in steel tanks remains colorless.

In bartending, rum is one of the most important liquors. It is used in a variety of classic cocktails including the Cuba Libre, Mai Tai, Daiquiri and Piña Colada. It can also be served neat (straight) or on the rocks.

==Schnapps==
{{wikipedia|Schnapps}}
* 20 - 40% ABV (40 - 80º proof)&lt;br&gt;

Schnapps is a type of distilled beverage. The word &quot;schnapps&quot; is derived from the German word ''Schnaps'' and refers to usually clear alcoholic beverages distilled from fermented grains, roots, or fruits, including cherries (Kirschwasser), apples, pears, plums, and apricots. German Schnaps has no sugar or flavoring added, but American schnapps typically do have these additives. German Schnaps has a light fruit flavor and is similar to eau-de-vie. Its alcohol content is usually around 40% by volume.

American schnapps (such as peach schnapps and butterscotch schnapps) are different from true German Schnaps. They are produced by a method that does not involve fermentation. They are made from grain alcohol, to which flavoring and sugar are added. Their alcohol content can be as low as 15% by volume.

==Tequila==
{{wikipedia|Tequila}}
* 40% ABV (80º proof)
'''Tequila''' is a spirit made primarily in the area surrounding Tequila, a town in Mexico. It is made from the Tequila agave - the blue agave.   Tequila is most often made at a 38–40% alcohol content (76–80º proof), but there are also several varieties of Tequila produced with 43–46% alcohol content (86–92º proof)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itequila.org/besttequilas.htm itequila.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican law no longer requires that tequila be entirely composed of blue agave distillates, and lower-quality tequilas known as mixtos may contain up to 49% other, more cheaply obtained distillates, resulting in many off-flavors and a generally unpleasant taste.  These tequilas are often labeled as &quot;gold&quot;, and are often artificially coloured to resemble the natural gold color of aged tequilas such as reposados and anejos.  Be sure to only purchase tequila which is clearly labeled &quot;100% de agave&quot;, even for mixing purposes.

Many people prefer the simpler but more vegetal taste of blanco (un-aged and clear colored, also known as silver or platinum) tequilas for cocktails, but slightly aged reposado tequilas may do equally well, so experiment.  However, anejo tequilas (aged longer in a series of different barrels) are almost always very complex and subtle, and should be drunk neat or on the rocks, as mixing them would mask much of their interest and be a waste.

==Vodka==
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Vodka}}
{{Wikipedia|Vodka}}
Vodka is purified by distillation from a fermented substance such as grain or molasses, and it usually has an alcohol content of 35% to 50% by volume (70 - 100º proof). Vodka consists primarily of water and alcohol (ethanol), and sometimes various flavorings.
{{-}}

==Whisky, whiskey==
{{Wikipedia|Whisky}}

*40 - 53.5% ABV (80 - 107º proof) and higher (barrel proof)

Whisky (Scottish Gaelic: ''uisge-beatha''}, or whiskey (Irish: ''uisce beatha''), refers to a broad category of alcoholic beverages that are distilled from fermented grain mash and aged in wooden casks (generally oak).

Different grains are used for different varieties, including: barley, malted barley, rye, malted rye, wheat, and maize (corn). Whisky derives from the Gaelic word for &quot;water&quot; (uisce or usige), and is called in full uisge-beatha (in Scotland) or uisce beatha (Ireland), meaning &quot;Water of Life&quot;. It is related to the Latin aqua vitae, also meaning &quot;water of life&quot;. It is always Scotch whisky, and Irish whiskey; other countries may use either spelling.

===Types of whisky===
Whisky or whisky-like products are produced in most grain-growing areas. They differ in base product, alcoholic content, and quality.

====Scotch whiskies====

Scotch whiskies are generally distilled twice, though some are distilled a third time.  Laws in many countries require anything bearing the label &quot;Scotch&quot; to be distilled in Scotland and matured for a minimum of three years in oak casks.  Whiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the cask, so the &quot;age&quot; of a scotch is the time between distillation and bottling.  This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste.  If Scotch whisky is from more than one cask, and if it includes an age statement on the bottle, it must reflect the age of the youngest whisky in the blend.  Many cask-strength single malts also omit the age as they use younger elements in minute amounts for flavoring and mellowing.
:The two basic types of Scotch are Malt and Grain.
:* Malt is whisky made entirely from malted barley and distilled in an onion-shaped pot still.
:* Grain is made from malted and unmalted barley along with other grains, usually in a continuous column still. Until recently it was only used in blends—but there are now some &quot;Single Grain&quot; scotches being marketed.
:Malts and Grains are combined in various ways
:* Vatted malt is blended from malt whiskies from different distilleries.  If a whisky is labeled &quot;pure malt&quot; or just &quot;malt&quot; it is almost certain to be a vatted whisky.  This is also sometimes labeled as &quot;Blended Malt&quot; whisky.
:* Single malt whisky is malt whisky from a single distillery.  However, unless the whisky is described as &quot;single-cask&quot; it will contain whisky from many casks, so the blender can achieve a taste recognizable as typical of the distillery .  In most cases, the name of a single malt will be that of the distillery (The Glenlivet, Glenmorangie, Bowmore), with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments such as maturation in a port wine cask.  Some single malts (often made to attract a premium price from less sophisticated drinkers abroad) will be given a special name.   
:* Blended whiskies are normally cheaper whiskies made from a mixture of Malt and Grain whiskies.    A whisky simply described as Scotch Whisky is most likely to be a blend in this sense.  A blend is usually from many distilleries so that the blender can produce a flavor consistent with the brand, and the brand name (e.g. Bell's, Chivas Regal) will usually not therefore contain the name of a distillery.  However, &quot;Blend&quot; can (less frequently) have other meanings.  A mixture of malts (with no grain) from different distilleries (more usually called a vatted malt) may sometimes be referred to as a &quot;Blended Malt&quot;, and a mixtures of grain whiskies with no malts will sometimes carry the designation &quot;Blended Grain&quot;. 

====Japanese whiskies====

Japanese whiskies generally fit within the Scotch tradition and can be categorised using the above typology.

====Irish whiskeys====

Irish whiskeys are generally distilled three times and must be aged in wooden casks for a period of not less than three years.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Ireland, Irish Whiskey Act, 1980 [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980_33.html]{{Dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unpeated malt is almost always used, meaning they have none of the smoky character of scotch, and are more suitable for mixing.

====Canadian whiskies====

Canadian whiskies have the regulatory requirement&lt;ref&gt;Food and Drugs Act, Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/F-27/C.R.C.-c.870/236939.html#Section-B.02.020]
{{Dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; of being aged for at least three years in a barrel. Most Canadian whiskies are blended multi-grain whiskies.

====American whiskeys====

American whiskeys include both straights and blends. To be called &quot;straight&quot; the whiskey must be one of the &quot;named types&quot; listed in the federal regulations and aged in oak casks for at least two years. The most common of the &quot;named types&quot; are;
*Bourbon, which must be between 51% and 79% (inclusive) corn (maize).
*Rye, which must be at least 51% rye.
*Corn, which is made from a mash made up of at least 80% corn (maize). The whiskey is distilled to not more than 80 percent alcohol by volume. It does not have to be aged but, if it is aged, it must be in new uncharred oak barrels or used barrels. Aging usually is brief, i.e., six months. During aging the whiskey picks up color and flavor and its harshness is reduced. 

:All straight American whiskeys except straight corn whiskey must be aged in new casks that have been charred on their inside surface. American blended whiskeys combine straight whiskey with un-aged whiskey, grain neutral spirits, flavorings and colorings. These definitions are part of U.S. law. Not defined by the law but important in the marketplace is Tennessee whiskey, of which Jack Daniel's is the leading example. It is identical to bourbon in almost every important respect. The most recognizable difference is that Tennessee whiskey is filtered through sugar maple charcoal, giving it a unique flavor and aroma.

====Pure pot still whiskey====

Pure pot still whiskey refers to Irish whiskey made from a combination of malted and unmalted barley and distilled in a pot still.

====Welsh whisky====

====Indian whisky====

Indian whisky is an alcoholic beverage that is labeled as &quot;whisky&quot; in India.  Much Indian whisky is distilled from fermented molasses, and as such would be considered a sort of rum outside of the Indian subcontinent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Clarinet Basics ==

The clarinet is one of the harder woodwind instruments to learn how to play well. One must balance tone, embouchure, tonguing, and good technique all at the same time, while trying to adjust the clarinet the way you want it due to it having the most variables of any other woodwind instrument. It is believed that clarinetists should have a list of priorities that they need to accomplish in a certain order to become refined clarinetist; this particular order is the same order that's in this chapter.

The clarinetist needs to create a good solid airstream; without airflow, the clarinet doesn't work. This is its &quot;breath of life&quot;, both literally, and metaphorically. Without a good solid airstream there is no possible way that any clarinetist can produce the desired fluid tone that the clarinet is famous for. A good solid airstream is one of two key elements in creating a good tone.

After the player can give a consistent airstream, next is acquiring a good embouchure. Embouchure is the second aspect of creating a good tone and is the airstream's doorway into the clarinet. The embouchure holds the reed and mouthpiece in check, regulates the tone, the tuning and poises the tongue to articulate when necessary.

Once a clarinetist has achieved the first two objectives, next is learning how to poise the tongue and how to articulate.  Most clarinetists aren't taught how to correctly articulate. Thus the articulations are sloppy, usually fat, and it becomes easier and easier to fall behind in tempo when it comes to playing.

Now that everything is right with the face of the clarinetist, he or she can now work on technique. This is when the clarinetist learns what fingerings should go with what note combinations. How to get past complex rhythms, and just become an all 'round better musician. This step must not be the focus until the preceding steps are completed.

The above is a lay out of how the clarinetist should approach learning this fine instrument. Theoretically the clarinetist should work on all of these aspects at once. Although, beginners should concentrate on one step at a time, while still touching the others, then go in order from there.

The monolithic approach is to define a high-level virtual interface over the hardware, with a set of primitives or system calls to implement operating system services such as process management, concurrency, and memory management in several modules that run in supervisor mode.

Even if every module servicing these operations is separate from the whole, the code integration is very tight and difficult to do correctly, and, since all the modules run in the same address space, a bug in one module can bring down the whole system. However, when the implementation is complete and trustworthy, the tight internal integration of components allows the low-level features of the underlying system to be effectively utilized, making a good monolithic kernel highly efficient. Proponents of the monolithic kernel approach make the case that if code is incorrect, it does not belong in a kernel, and if it is, there is little advantage in the microkernel approach.
More modern monolithic kernels such as Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris can load executable modules at runtime, allowing easy extension of the kernel's capabilities as required, while helping to keep the amount of code running in kernel-space to a minimum.

[[File:OS-structure.svg|thumb|400px|Structure of monolithic and microkernel-based operating systems, respectively.]]
The microkernel approach is to define a very simple abstraction over the hardware, with a set of primitives or system calls to implement minimal OS services such as thread management, address spaces and interprocess communication. All other services, those normally provided by the kernel such as networking, are implemented in user-space programs referred to as servers.
Servers are programs like any others, allowing the operating system to be modified simply by starting and stopping programs. For a small machine without networking support, for instance, the networking server simply isn't started. Under a traditional system this would require the kernel to be recompiled, something well beyond the capabilities of the average end-user. In theory the system is also more stable, because a failing server simply stops a single program, rather than causing the kernel itself to crash.

However, part of the system state is lost with the failing server, and it is generally difficult to continue execution of applications, or even of other servers with a fresh copy. For example, if a (theoretic) server responsible for TCP/IP connections is restarted, applications could be told the connection was &quot;lost&quot; and reconnect, going through the new instance of the server. However, other system objects, like files, do not have these convenient semantics, are supposed to be reliable, not become unavailable randomly and keep all the information written to them previously. So, database techniques like transactions, replication and checkpointing need to be used between servers in order to preserve essential state across single server restarts.

Microkernels generally underperform traditional designs, sometimes dramatically. This is due in large part to the overhead of moving in and out of the kernel, a context switch, in order to move data between the various applications and servers. It was originally believed that careful tuning could reduce this overhead dramatically, but by the mid-90s most researchers had given up. In more recent times newer microkernels, designed for performance first, have addressed these problems to a very large degree. Nevertheless the market for existing operating systems is so entrenched that little work continues on microkernel design.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breast Cancer - Ashkenazi Jew'''

==Introduction==
*How are they, did they have any problems finding the place?

==Contracting==
*Find out what she knows about cancer and testing.
*Review family history
*Review medical history
*What cancer is, how it happens
*Talk about the specific risks to your family
*Talk about the testing options and what it can tell you.
*Talk about management

==Family history==
*Names of relatives
*Cousins?
*Daughters' screening practices?
*Any more details about age of living uncles (paternal and maternal)
*Bilateral/unilateral cancers?
*Any idea about country paternal great-grandmother is from?
*Anyone else with cancer?
*Could we get documentation of the sarcoma or brain tumors?
*Any leukemias?
*Any pancreatic, melanoma?

==Medical history==
*How is she doing currently?
*What are current screening practices? mammograms, self exams?
*Any surgeries?
*Any hospitalizations?
*Medications?
*Exercise/diet?

==Psychosocial==
(throughout)

*Recently diagnosed with cancer/ currently undergoing treatment. How are you dealing with all of this?
*Who do you go to for support?
*Many family members with cancer. How did that impact your idea of risk?
*Have you talked about this appointment with your family?
*Are you concerned for your own health, what are your concerns/fears?
*Have you considered the implications to the rest of your family?
*Have you thought about what if it wasn't familial? How will you feel if testing is not warranted?

==Causes of breast cancer==
*Basic definition: the uncontrolled growth of cells.
*Divisions
**70-80% = sporadic (just happens to people for no connected reason -no previous family history)
**20-30% = familial
*chance alone
*genetic susceptibility
*shared environment
*combination
**5-10% = inherited - this is what we are concerned about and can help you test for
*BRCA1
*BRCA2
*other genes?
*Genes and chromosomes
**People -&gt; genes -&gt; nucleotides = CAGT
*chromosomes = instruction manual
*genes= instructions
*amnio acids = words
*nucleotides = letters
**Two copies of every chromosome, every gene.
**Dominant Inheritance (50%)
*Cancer is actually caused by a change in a tumor suppressor gen*= they control cell growt*When both copies of the gene are changed (have a mutation) they cannot stop cell growth = tumor. (Two-hit hypothesis)
**Two different ways it can be affected
*acquired
*inherited
*The genes
**Chromosome 17 (BRCA1)
**Chromosome 13 (BRCA2)

==Who do we offer testing for - at greater risk?==
*More than one family member with cancer*
*Single woman with breast and ovarian
*Woman with bilateral breast cancer
*Early onset age of cancer (&lt;50)
*Ovarian cancer at any age
*Ashkenazi Jewish*
*Odd cancers - male breast cancer, laryngeal cancer

==Based on your family history==
*What do you think you risk of being a carrier is?

==Familial chance of risk==
*Background risk of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carrier for As*Jewish heritage
**1/40 is a mutation carrier
*Three common mutations
**BRCA1 - 185delAG (1.0%)
**BRCA1 - 5382insC (0.15%)
**BRCA2 - 617delT (1.5%)
*BRCAPRO - 28.0% chance of carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2
**BRCA1 - 9.5%
**BRCA2 - 18.5%
*Couch model
**avg age of dx 50-55 = 12.7% for BRCA1
*Shattuck-Eidens greater than 2 br. c*greater than 51 dx = 13% for BRCA1
*Claus Model (risk for your daughters to develop cancer) - based only on their mother.
**Describe the numbers using the chart with the client* (get this chart!!)
*0.2% by age 29
*0.8% by age 39
*2.3% by age 49
*4.9% by age 59
*8.2% by age 69
*11.0% by age 79 -lifetime risk.

==Cancer risks (for carriers of BRCA1/2)==
*Three types of risk
**population risk
**age based risk
**lifetime risk
*Risks associated with dev. Breast cancer
**General pop. Lifetime = 11%
**BRCA1/BRCA2 lifetime = 87%
*Jewish carriers - 56% lifetime
**BRCA1/BRCA2 age 40 = 20%
**BRCA1/BRCA2 age 59 = 59%
**BRCA1/BRCA2 age 70 = 82%
*Risk of dev. Second primary breast tumor BRCA1
**age 50 = 48%
**age 70 = 64%
*Risk of second breast cancer with BRCA2
**50% lifetime risk
*Ovarian cancer risk
**General pop lifetime = 1-2%
**age 50 w/ BRCA1= 29%
**age 70 w/BRCA1 = 44%
**Jew. Pop= 16%
**age 70 w/BRCA2 = 15-20%
*Other cancer risks
**Prostate cancer = 30% (gen. pop = 17%)
**laryngeal cancer, pancreatic cancer = slight increase
**Jewish pop. prostate cancer=16% (depending on mutation - see results session outline)
**Colon cancer slight increase
**Male breast in BRCA2 age 70 = 6% (pop.=0.1%)

==Testing==
*The actual test
**Ashkenazi triplet test (direct mutation analysis)
*$375
**BRCA1/BRCA2 sequencing
*after triplet screen = $2380
*Reasons to test
**improved risk management
**answer ? about the cancer risk
**Info for family members
**Lifestyle choices
*Reasons not to test
**psychological distress
**worries of discriminations of employment/insurance
**change in family dynamics
*guilt complex
*survivor guilt
**false sense of security
*Limitations of testing
**The possible results of As*Jew. panel
*positive result
*negative result - may be one of the 17% who do not have the common mutations. Strong indication to do sequencing.
**the possible results of sequencing
*positive, known mutation
*negative result - not informative unless we know a previous mutation
*mutation of unknown significance - it is a mutation but we don't know what it means.
**not all mutations are detected
**results are a probability, not a certainty.
*Two types of testing
**Research
*free
*only tests some of the genes
*detects 50% of mutations
*takes 6-12 months
**Clinic
*expensive ($2400 for first relative)
*sequences entire gene
*takes 3-6 weeks (one month)

==Discrimination Issues==
*Health insurance
**passage of HIPAA (Health insurance portability and accountability act)
*for groups plans
*protects from a change in individual charge based on genetic testing
*genetic testing results can not be viewed as a previously existing condition
*doesn't prevent access to genetic info.
*doesn't prevent insurers from demanding testing as a coverage condition
*doesn't prevent group rate hikes
*doesn't provide protection if you are outside a group plan.
*doesn't cover life or disability issues

==Results==
*Positive for deleterious mutation
*Negative for mutation
**means that for the areas tested, there is no gene mutation.
**ONLY definitive if thee is a known mutation in the family
**Possibility of other genes that we don't know about.
*Variant of unknown significance

==Management==
*Breast recommendations for at risk family members
**monthly self breast exam (starting at age 18)
**clinical surveillance - every 6-12 months (starting at age 25)
**annual mammography (age 25-35)
**prophylactic mastectomy
*reduces risk
*Ovarian screening
**Pelvic exam
**Transvaginal ultrasound -every 6-12 months (staring at age 25-35)
*more sensitive than transabdominal ultrasound
*minor discomfort (bladder is empty)
*assess abnormal structural findings
**ovarian volume
**cyst wall thickness
**septal structure
**CA-125 testing - every 6-12 months
*measures a chemical in your blood - glycoprotein antigen - shed in blood stream from ovarian cancer cells.
*level is elevated ½ patients with stage I ovarian cancer
*level is elevated in 90% of patients stage II ovarian cancer
*sensitivity is low
*specificity is low due to other contributing factors
**prophylactic oophorectomy
*eliminates primary ovarian cancer risk (but residual could have cancer)
*induces menopause
*Colon screening
**colonoscopy every 3-5 years starting age 50
**annual fecal occult tests

Have you considered voting for [[UK Constitution and Government]] again this month, as it has been renominated. It really is a very good book.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 15:53, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Move pages ==

You seem to be copying many pages, so...

There should be '''move''' tab next to the &quot;History&quot; tab on this wiki. The &quot;move&quot; feature is the correct way to move pages.

Otherwise:
* There are two copies of pages, and users can edit both of them, thus causing an accidental [[WB:FP|fork]].
* [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] will have to temporarily delete pages to merge their edit histories.

== Aside: [[Wikibooks:Books possibly in contravention with WIW]] ==

You wrote: ''do the multiple hands of Wiki Foundation follow what the others have done?''

First, as an aside, there is no &quot;Wiki Foundation&quot;. You probably meant [[Wikimedia:Home|'''Wikimedia''' Foundation]]. Words like ''wiki'', ''Wikipedia'', ''Wikimedia'', ''MediaWiki'' are not the same; it is explained at '''[[MetaWikipedia:Names]]'''.

My impression is that communication between the English-Wikibooks project and the Wikimedia Foundation is poor, and that '''the persons administering the Wikimedia Foundation mostly give no attention to anything outside English Wikipedia'''. Actually, there is at present no mechanism for me to track news in other Wikimedia projects. Not the defunct [[MetaWikipedia:Reports]], not the http://www.wikizine.org. Even if I read [[Wikisource:Wikisource:News|Wikisource:News]], I would still need news from English Wikiquote. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:41, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

== The language in Novial WP is not Novial ==

Hi, I just followed your requests for supporting Novial wikipedia and came to it. However all the texts [[w:nov:Special:Recentchanges|you are pasting there]] '''are not''' for that wiki as they are in English. -- [[User:Bggoldie|Bggoldie]] 08:49, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

In fact most of the texts I have posted are in Novial (translations from English Wikipedia).There is one special reference section which is what you saw. It contains the original description (which was written in English) of the Novial language and an ongoing project to translate it into Novial. 

By the way the voting for that Wikipedia ended months ago and it as approved. [[User:Nov ialiste|Novialiste]] 10:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

Hi. I'd like to learn Novial. Is it possible to mail you or speak on MSN or IRC with you? I want somebody with who I can practice speaking to. Thanks! [[User:198.54.202.246|198.54.202.246]] 05:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Nov ialiste. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Nov ialiste~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CADASIL'''

CADASIL = Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and

*Leukoencephalopathy (destruction of myelin sheath covering nerves)
*Microangiopathy (disease of the arteries) mainly affecting the brain

==Contracting==
*Welcome and Introductions.
*I understand you have come to discuss your family history of CADASIL disease.
*Why have you sought out genetic counseling at this point in your life?
*What do you already know about CADASIL? How familiar are you with your family history? What reading/research have you done on your own? Why are you interested in genetic testing?
*What are you hoping the test can tell you? What are you planning to do with the information? How will the results affect your life?
*Set agenda: get a little more information about your family, review CADASIL, talk about the different kinds of testing available (what they can tell us, how sensitive they are, how much they cost), and help you make a decision about testing

==Intake==
*Review medical history
**Any health concerns? Any problems with migraines, depression, TIA's, high blood pressure, memory loss?
**Has you doctor been screening you for any signs or symptoms?
**Have you ever had a brain MRI? Skin biopsy?
*Review family history

==Disease Characteristics==
*Symptoms (variable phenotype)
**migraine headaches (w/ or w/out aura-- sensations of lights, voices or numbness) (40 to 60%)
**recurring TIA's and strokes (&gt;80%)
**cognitive and behavioral disturbances (extent is variable)
**psychiatric disturbances (depression, personality changes) (~30%)
**dementia (subcortical type - memory disturbances, psychic slowing, loss of initiative) (&gt;85% in patients older than 65)
**pseudo-bulbar palsy -- slurred speech, difficulty with swallowing, weakness of face, tongue, and swallowing muscles, a tendency for uncontrollable laughter or crying, and brisk jaw and gag reflexes due to the degeneration or loss of the lower motor neurons (in the brainstem) that supply nerves to the muscles of the throat, larynx, face etc.
**epilepsy (10%)
**diffuse white matter lesions and subcortical infarcts on neuroimaging
*Ages of Onset
**Variable (even within the same family)
**Mid-Adult onset (30's - 60's)
**extensive testing has identified individuals who have relatively mild disease, or may even be clinically unaffected in the 7th or 8th decade
*Progression/Stages of disease
**migraines first occur at a mean age of 26
**TIA's and stroke beginning, on average, at 45 years of age (range 20-60's)
**Cognitive decline can start as early as 35 years of age (by age 45, more than 50% of patients have it)
**Dementia/severe cognitive deficits by age 65
**Death usually in the 7th decade

==Genetic Etiology==
*Due to mutations in the NOTCH3 gene (19p13.2-13.1)
**identified in &gt;90% of patients
**all pathogenic sequence alterations result in the gain or loss of a single cysteine residue (95% of mutations are missense)
**penetrance is probably 100%
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
**affected person has a 50/50 chance of passing it on to each child
**de novo mutations are rare
*Prevalence is unknown
**some 200 families have been described from all continents, but most have been of European origin
**many families are likely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed

==Testing==
*Diagnostic Testing
**Neuroimaging (MRI)
***diffuse periventricular and deep white matter lesions
***subcortical infarcts in white matter, basal ganglia, and brain stem
***external capsules and temporal lobes are often affected
****Leukoencephalopathy is often present on MRI before developing symptoms
****When white matter abnormalities are absent on MRI of a person older than 35 years of age, CADASIL is usually excluded.
****Sensitivity 89-93%, specificity 45-86%
**Skin biopsy (Electron Microscope evaluation)
***electron dense granules in the media of arterioles
***granular osmiophilic material in the media
****Sensitivity 45%, specificity 100% (false negative rate is unknown)
****New immunostaining technique has a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100%
*Genetic Testing
**Available on clinical basis at Athena and CHOP
**Identifies 90-95% of mutations
****Scanning of the 5 exons with the highest mutation frequencies (3, 4, 11, 18, 19) detects 87% of patients with skin biopsy-confirmed CADASIL
****When testing at-risk people, an affected family member should be tested first to confirm that the mutation is identifiable by currently available techniques.
****To get the most information, we need to know an identified mutation in an affected relative
****Otherwise, we will not be able to rule CADASIL out completely (even with a negative genetic test because we won't know if you have a mutation that they just couldn't find)
**Possibility of a variant of uncertainty
**Prenatal testing is available for identified mutations (uncommon request since adult-onset disorder)

==Psychosocial Counseling==
*Motivations for testing (reproduction, career, financial matters, need to know)
**Testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression
*How will you feel if you pay the money to have the testing, but we don't really know the answer for sure?
*Future life plans
*Concern about insurance/employment discrimination
*There is no preventative or symptomatic therapies available
**many neurologists prescribe salicylates - no studies on whether these have any effect on preventing stroke
**angiography and anti-coagulants are contraindicated because they may provoke cerebrovascular accidents

==What if this turns out to not be CADASIL? What if it is something else we cannot test for?==
*Make decision and establish plan for testing and follow-up

==MRI==
*Approximately 90% of individuals with CADASIL will show white matter abnormalities
*CADASIL can usually be ruled out in individuals over age 35 if no abnormalities are found on MRI

==Skin Biopsy (electron microscope evaluation)==
*Detection of a substance called granular osmiophilic material in the small blood vessels is diagnostic
*Substance only detected in about half of individuals with CADASIL
*Immunostaining is being developed which detects approximately 96% of individuals with CADASIL

==Genetic Testing==
*Mutation scanning and sequencing available for up to 23 of the 33 exons in NOTCH3
*If a disease associated mutation is found in an asymptomatic individual than the individual will likely develop symptoms eventually
*If a disease associated mutation is not found in an asymptomatic individual than we don't know if it is because they didn't inherit the mutation present in the family or if a mutation was not found due to limitations of the test
*Therefore it is best to test a family member with CADASIL first
*Chance that a variant of uncertain significance could be identified

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Canavan Disease: Heterozygote Screening'''
(2002)

==Contracting==
*What do you know about Canavan Disease?
*What are your concerns? What do you hope to learn?

==Etiology and Natural History==
*Also called aspartoacylase deficiency or spongy degeneration of the brain
*Caused by deficiency of aspartoacylase enzyme
**Encoded by the gene ASPA
**Found at chromosomal locus 17p13
**Responsible for hydrolyzing N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) into aspartic acid and acetate
**Expressed throughout body but mainly causes problems in central nervous system
***Build-up of NAA in brain
***Causes demyelinization leading to evidence of clinical symptoms
*ASPA mutations
**Over 30 different mutations have been identified
**Three common mutations
***Account for 99% of disease causing alleles in Ashkenazi Jewish population and 55% of disease causing alleles in other populations
***Includes E285A, Y231X, and A305E
***Null mutations make no aspartoacylase, missense mutations make less active forms
**No strong genotype-phenotype correlation but missense mutations not as severe as null mutations
*Autosomal recessive inheritance
**If both partners heterozygous for a mutation, each pregnancy has a 25% risk of resulting in a child with Canavan disease
**Explanation of autosomal recessive inheritance

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Most reported cases are individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent
**Carrier frequency about 1 in 40 to 1 in 60
**Incidence is about 1/6400 to 1/13,456
*Carrier frequency in general population is not known but assumed to be much lower than 1 in 40 (Maybe 1 in 300?)

==Clinical Features==
*Infants appear normal early in life
*Developmental delay apparent at 3-5 months of age
**Particularly delayed in motor skill development
***Can laugh and smile, reach for objects, and raise their head but may lose those skills
***Hypotonia, seizures, and poor eye contact develop by sixth month
***May not learn to sit, stand, walk, or talk
**Can learn to interact socially but are sometimes irritable
**Sleep disturbance and feeding difficulties begin as they get older
**Macrocephaly
*Life expectancy is variable
**Varies from few years to the teens or beyond
**Depends on clinical course of disease and medical care
*Some studies have reported three forms
**Neonatal, infantile, and late-onset
**More recent studies show that disease usually begins in infancy with highly variable rate of disease progression
*Neuropathology
**CT or MRI in infancy may be normal
**Later studies will show diffuse, symmetrical white matter changes and possible involvement of cerebellum and brainstem
**Subcortical spongy degeneration
**Distorted mitochondria

==Testing==
*Diagnostic testing
**Increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in urine
***Measure using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
***Can also find elevated levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of older children
**Aspartoacylase enzymatic activity
***Can be measured in cultured skin fibroblasts
****Affected patients have unmeasurable activity
****Carriers have about ½ normal activity
***Not detectable in white blood cells
***Cannot be used for prenatal diagnosis because normal enzyme levels very low in amniocytes and CVS tissue
**Can do molecular testing to confirm diagnosis
*Molecular testing
**Primarily used for:
***Identify specific mutation in affected individuals
***Carrier testing of individuals of Ashenazi Jewish heritage
***Carrier testing for individuals with affected family members and their spouses
***Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies
**Most labs use a two allele panel for testing
***Some labs use three allele panel
****Detects 99% of mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish population
****Detects only about 55% of mutations in other populations
***Testing for remaining mutations is on research basis only
**Population Screening
***Initiated for Jewish individuals of reproductive age recommended by American College of Medical Genetics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
***Couples and partners who are carriers can be made aware of risks and status before having children

******2. Mouthwash: Please Note: Patient should not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum for at least one hour prior to collection (see specimen kit for detailed instructions). Mouthwash samples can be sent when ordering up to two tests. When ordering more than two tests, blood samples are required. Mouthwash cannot be used for Tay-Sachs disease carrier screening as Tay-Sachs enzyme analysis requires a blood sample. 10 ml of Scope® mouthwash that has been swished vigorously for at least one minute. Collect in orange-top 50 ml polypropylene tube. Turnaround Time: 10-14 days
*****Tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, Cystic fibrosis, Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, Familial dysautonomia, Familial hyperinsulinism, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, Glycogen storage disease type 1a, Maple syrup urine disease, Mucolipidosis type IV, Nemaline myopathy, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Tay-Sachs disease, Usher syndrome type III , Usher syndrome type IF

*Laboratory or molecular genetic testing can be used to distinguish from these diseases
*Spongy degeneration of the brain found in some viral disorders can also be distinguished by testing

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Past experiences with family members with Canavan Disease
*DNA banking, particularly if an individual is diagnosed based on elevated NAA levels but molecular testing does not identify a mutation
*Feelings about preimplantation genetic diagnosis and termination
*Daily management of an affected family member
*Financial pressures
*Lifestyle changes necessary to care for an affected child

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cancer'''

==Cancer Epidemiology Data==
*Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. All cancers are genetic, but not all are inherited. It is a multifactorial disorder, caused by both genetic and non-genetic factors.
*Cancer is a very common disease. 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will develop some form of cancer in their lifetimes. The most common cancer sites are lung, breast, prostate, and colon.
*In the U.S., approximately 175,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year (50,000 of these are in women under 40).
*In the U.S., 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetimes. Average age of developing cancer is 62. 2/3 of the women will be over 55 years old.
*Genes are on chromosomes and they come in pairs (1 mom, 1 dad). Autosomal dominant, so 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene. Explain tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, mutations.
*About 5-10% of all breast cancer is hereditary. About 20% of it is familial (combination of different genes and environment). Most cancer is sporadic.
*Familial clustering is more common than hereditary breast cancer. A combination of genes from both sides of the family plus environmental factors.
*Our job is to figure out where your cancer lies. Of the hereditary type, 2/3 is caused by BRCA1 (45%) and BRCA2 (35%) mutations (increases the risk up to 85%).
*Management: mammograms at age 40, physician exam twice a year, self-exams monthly.

==Cancer Pedigree Questions==
*A pedigree is our &quot;physical exam&quot;. Gives us clues as to whether the cancer is hereditary. It's important to know who has AND who doesn't have cancer.
*&quot;Tell me about your experience&quot; or &quot;Tell me what happened&quot;
*Very specific questions about the cancer in different family members
*Age at diagnosis
*Current age &amp; screening practices
*Age at death &amp; specific cause of death
*Primary site of cancer (type, location, stage, laterality)
*Metastasis or any new primary cancers
*Methods of treatment/surgery
*Any types of precancerous lesions
*Ethnic background
*Environmental exposures
*Lifestyle issues (diet, exercise, stress)
*Screening habits of &quot;unaffected&quot; relatives
*Any other medical conditions that may be associated with cancer
*any family hx of early heart attacks, blindness, deafness, birth defects, or multiple miscarriages
*Things that make us suspicious. . .cancer across one or more generations, multiple people affected in the same generation, early age of onset (before 50)
*Need a medical release for pathology reports, clinic notes, autopsy reports, death certificates, etc. for verification.

*Congenital choreoathetosis
**Recognized after several months or a year
**Causes some combination of chorea, athetosis, ballismus, myoclonus, and dystonia
**Causes defect in voluntary movement
***May be mild resulting in &quot;fidgets&quot;
***May be severe, intense involuntary movements
***Even with rehabilitation, the most severe rarely achieve enough motor control to live independent life
**Intelligence may not be affected
*Kernicterus
**Was common when postnatal serum bilirubin was kept below 15 mg/dL
**Majority of infants die within 1 or 2 years
**Survivors usually mentally retarded, deaf, and totally unable to sit, stand, or walk
***Several patients reportedly were not mentally retarded and learned to walk backwards
***Have rigid limbs

==Management/Treatment Options==
*Outcome depends on severity of associated intellectual handicaps
*Early application of stretching to prevent contractures
*Orthopedic appliances and surgical procedures to improve mobility
*Special education to help with motor problems and intellectual involvement
*Prevention is great challenge
**Prevention of kernicterus by phototherapy has helped
**Providing low-birth weight infants with extra care may help
***More prone to respiratory distress
***Must provide good surveillance of respiratory function

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Leukodystrophy - spinal tap showing elevated spinal fluid indicates leukodystrophy
*Hydrocephaly if child has large head
*Tumor of cerebral hemishphere - disease is progressive
*Spinal cord lesions - weakness limited to lower extremities
*Muscular dystrophy - tendon reflexes would be normal
*Ataxia telangiectasia

==Recurrence Risks==
*Depends if cause of cerebral palsy can be determined
*Autosomal recessive
**Each pregnancy from heterozygote parents has 25% risk of child being affected
**Each pregnancy has 50% risk of being carrier
*Autosomal dominant
**Each child born to affected parent has 50% chance of being affected
**May also occur due to new mutation so low recurrence risk
*X-linked
**Sons of affected males not affected
**Daughters of affected males must be affected
**Daughters of carrier females 50% risk of being carriers
**Sons of carrier females 50% risk of being affected
*Most cases probably caused by hypoxic or ischemic injury to brain so recurrence risk is low

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Parental guilt
*Burden of disease that requires daily management
*Social stigma
*Financial pressures, disruption of daily activities for special therapies, orthotics, or other needs
*Potential need for lifetime care

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting to Know the Clarinet ==

The clarinet has six different parts to it:               

*Mouth piece
*Ligature                                                               
*Barrel Joint                                
*Upper Joint
*Lower Joint
*Bell
as illustrated in the diagram.

A clarinet cannot play unless you have a reed, which is held onto the mouthpiece by the ligature.  
The reed vibrates at a very high speed (changes with each note, but remains at a high rate no matter what) when the player blows through the clarinet which in turn makes sound.

== Getting Started ==

Now that we know the different parts of the clarinet, let's get started.  As clarinetists, we will need to get the tools necessary to keep the clarinet clean and in working order.  The following &quot;tools&quot; are what the most prestigious of players use to keep their instrument, the clarinet, in top working order:

*Polishing cloth.
*Old cloth.
*Cork grease.
*Swab. (the best candidate is a handkerchief tied to a thick string, or a swab that can be purchased at almost any music store).

So now that we have our &quot;tools&quot;, let's put together the clarinet:

#Moisten the reed in your mouth. You may want to run it under some water if your mouth is dry.
# If necessary, put a small amount of cork grease on the ends of the clarinet that has a cork stub.  It should just be enough to make the cork a little slippery, '''Do not put an excess amount of cork grease on the cork of the clarinet. Greasing the Corks is only needed when you find it hard to put the Clarinet Pieces together. If the grease does not improve it, you may need to replace your corks.'''
#Now take the bottom of the bell and place it in the palm of your right hand and clasp your fingers around it.
#Now take the lower joint in your left hand, be sure that the thumb rest is in the creves between your thumb and index finger and clasp your fingers around the keys of the lower joint.
#Now put the two ends together being sure to twist back and forth until they are secure and you cannot push them together anymore
#Now with your right hand take hold of the bell while placing your thumb on the last pad on the lowest part of the clarinet, and with your left hand take a hold of the upper joint similar to the way you did with the lower joint in step 3, but this time there will be no thumb rest. Make sure that the '''bridge key''' on each of the two main joints line up perfectly and touch. This is essential for the clarinet to work properly.
#Now twist the two joints together in a back and forth motion, be sure that the lever on the side that was metioned in step 8 and the lever on the same side of the lower joint are aligned.
#Now put the barrel joint on, then the mouth piece and ligature on in that order.  '''Do not put the ligature on too  tightly, but merely turn the screws until it is snug. Turning the ligature screws too tightly inhibits proper reed vibration, producing an unsatisfactory tone.  Over-tightening to extreme levels can destroy the reed or even the mouthpiece.
#Now put the reed on the mouth piece, be sure that the reed is placed evenly on the table of the mouth piece and that when you push on  cut of the reed the tip is black because it touches the tip of the mouth piece, placing the reed on the clarinet correctly might take a little practice before one gets the hang of it.

All of these procedures are necessary to keep the clarinet in good working order.  The amount of instruments sent in to be repaired could be decreased by about 70% if they were assembled correctly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tone  ==

'''Tone''' is usually made up of two parts, airflow and embouchure.  There is still the matter of deciding your mouthpiece/reed combination that best suits you, but the player doesn't need that until he or she can establish good airflow, and a good embouchure.  The tone of the clarinet has made it famous.  Before the clarinet and even today there isn't an instrument with the dark and fluid sound of a clarinet.  The tone of a clarinet depends nearly solely on what's going on at the top of the clarinet, i.e. is there a steady airstream going through the clarinet? Is the embouchure set correctly?  Is there a good reed that's compatible with the mouthpiece and the player?  Does the mouthpiece suit the player well?  All of these questions are questions to ask when trying to create a good tone on the clarinet.

==Introduction==

==Contracting==
*Find out what your concerns are
*Review family history
*Review medical history
*Physical exam
*Recommend testing options
*Answer any questions

==Review family history==

==Review medical history==

==Additional psychosocial Issues==
*Having to learn a lot in a short amount of time
*Support system? The difficulty of raising three kids on your own with one having medical dependence.
*Coping strategies
**Does she have a home care nurse?
**Has she used respite care, does she know about it?

==Possible counseling issues - CHARGE Syndrome==
*Heterogeneous condition (caused by the interaction of many genes)
*Recurrence risk for next child = 1-2%
*Resources for mom
*See fact sheet below for more details that may need to be addressed

==What Is It?==
*A specific set of birth defects that are found in a single child. The letters of CHARGE represent the different anomalies that are found.
*C- coloboma in 80-90% (a keyhole shaped cleft in the pupil, iris, or disc)
*C- cranial nerve anomalies
*CN I - olfactory 40%
*CN II - optic
*CN VII - facial palsy 40% (usually one sided)
*CN VIII - sensorineural hearing loss
*CN IX, X - swallowing difficulties
*H- heart defect in 70-85% (usually a VSD, PDA, Tetralogy of Fallot, or DORV - double outlet right ventricle)
*A - atresia choanae 50-60% (blockage or narrowing of the passageway that connects the nose to the throat and allows a person to breathe through their nose. Extremely dangerous because newborns are obligate nose breathers until 4-6 weeks old.)
*R - retardation of growth 80-90%
*G - genitourinary anomalies in 70-80% of males (small penis, hypospadias, undescended testicles)
*E - ear anomalies/deafness (80-85% have sensorineural hearing loss)

==What Are Other Manifestations?==
*Feeding problems are common/swallowing difficulties
*Developmental delay in 100%
*Mental retardation from mild - profound in 80-95%
*Visual impairment
*Cleft palate in 20-30%
*Tracheomalcia and laryngomalcia
*Characteristic facial features in &gt;50% (square face, large eyes, small nostrils, small mouth, facial asymmetry with or without paralysis)
*Usually there is not growth retardation parentally. Typically babies are born with an average weight and then linear growth starts to shift below the third percentile by 6 months of age.

==What Is the Cause?==
*This is unknown, but suspected to be heterogeneous. Also, it seems that it may be a result of arrested development between days 35-45 after conception. This is based on the developmental pattern of each of the birth defects related to CHARGE.
*Additionally, it seems that the involvement of cranial nerves IX and X cause the majority of the neurologic function of swallowing resulting in gastroesophageal reflex and aspiration pneumonia.

==What Is the Prevalence?==
*1/10,000 - 1/12,000

==What Is the Recurrence Risk?==
*Recurrence of an affected sibling with two unaffected parents = 1-2%
*Recurrence to an affected person is expected to be slightly increased. Until a specific gene change is determined, it is difficult to predict the recurrence risk to an affected individual. However it would not be greater than 50%.

==What Is the Predicted Outcome?==
*There is a lower life expectancy in children with CHARGE syndrome because of the high risk for hospitalization and the severe involvements. The highest mortality is in the first three years of life. Studies have shown a 70% survival rate to 5 years.

==What Are the Management Suggestions?==
*Ophthalmology exam
*Cardiac evaluation
*Hearing Test
*Placement of stents (plastic tubes) in the nasal passageway.
*Placement of a G-tube for feeding if reflux is severe.

==Is Prenatal Testing Available?==
*The only way to diagnose CHARGE syndrome prenatally is through a Level II ultrasound looking at some specifics:
*Polyhydramnios
*Cardiac involvement
*Genitalia
*Cleft lip/palate

==What Are Resources for Parents?==

(X-linked Dominant - Conradi-Hunermann)

==Introduction==
*Assess concerns and ask what they hope to gain from the session
*Discuss reason for follow-up
*Provide overview of session
**Interim medical/developmental history
**Discussion of concerns/questions
**Dr. will come in and do physical exam
**Discussion about follow-up plans

==Elicit interim medical history==
*Any illnesses/hospitalizations/surgeries since last visit in
*Current medications-are there any?
*Any recent medical tests or procedures?
*Immunizations up to date?
*Review of systems

==Elicit developmental history==

==Elicit interim family history==

==Psychosocial update?==
*Any changes in work?
*Any changes with who is around at home?
*How are things around the home generally?

==Genetic etiology==
*Several forms of chondrodysplasia punctata known-about 25% of these are of the X-linked dominant type
*Incidence figures are difficult to determine because it is very rare
*____'s is likely due to a new mutation, although there is some chance one of the parent's has gonadal mosaicism
*Recurrence risk for parents to have another child with _____'s condition is probably less than 2% (probably MUCH less, but in case of gonadal mosaicism, we should say this number)
*Risk for _____to have a child with her condition: 33% affected female, 33% unaffected female, 33% unaffected male (affected males usually die from condition in utero)

==Molecular genetics==
*Exact gene associated with this condition is unknown
*People with this condition have been found to have mutations in &amp;#916;8-&amp;#916;7 sterol isomerase, an enzyme involved in the biochemical pathway leading to the synthesis of cholesterol
*People with this condition typically have elevated levels of 8(9) cholestanol, a product in the pathway of cholesterol synthesis

==Testing options==
*Testing serum 8(9) cholestanol levels is a highly sensitive way of detecting people with the sterol isomerase mutation
*Clinical and research testing is available for both the serum 8(9) cholestanol level analysis and mutation analysis at several sites throughout the country
*There are research trials underway to understand the spectrum of mutations in the sterol isomerase gene

:This is a great organization. Can hook up parents of children with a particular condition with a family that has a child with that same condition. There are 4 people registered on this network with this condition. This can be helpful if the parents really want to know what to expect. This will not be so helpful if they are paired with a family whose child has had a much better or much worse time with the condition. It could give false hope, or more likely could make the family feel more afraid of what is to come. Should only be offered to parents who really seem to have a lot of questions about what to expect in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Teaching our children well: your concerns about white supremacism and racism in my writing about Venezuela==
:Hello!
:Thank you for your edits to the WikiJunior page on Venezuela, which I have only just seen.
:I must admit I don't know much about the problems of racism/white supremacism over there. And indeed in all of South America.
:(Really I cannot comment on Poles and racism or otherwise, or rather, I do not wish to).
:I do appreciate how hard it must be for people (like me) to write about the place when they don't live there or even know there.
:When I said 'civilians' I certainly never meant for them to have any colour or race. I only meant people who weren't military.
:And surely a leader is elected for what he or she means to the people. I wasn't fully aware of what the businessmen did to Chavez, though I may have suspected as much in media coverage which I have read over the years. And if he were recalled from office, well, that puts a different complexion (sorry about the pun) on things.
:I agree I was loading the dice slightly by putting European first, then African, then indigenious. Too broad a brush, perhaps. And if it wasn't accurate...
:Well, ignorance is most certainly not an excuse, particularly where children are involved/concerned. Ethnicity is not really such an obvious thing; not in words anyway.
:I greatly appreciate your edits on Venezuela and the rest of WikiJunior South America, and I appreciate your concern. It's not exactly right to have the whole world read about it.
:I realise I have a lot to learn and I hope I will continue to learn. And I will learn to read my sources more critically and interpret them more accurately. Particularly first-hand ones!
:Here, by the way, are my sources:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela|Venezuela]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chordates_(General_Biology) needs complete revision as it has many defects ranging from spelling errors (e.g. &quot;natho-stomes&quot;) to serious misclassifications (e.g. entries for &quot;synapsid&quot; and &quot;pelycosaur&quot; under &quot;diapsid&quot;!).

Some other suggestions:
* It's difficult to squeeze the whole of chordate or vertebrate phylogeny into 1 page. It might be best to adopt the compact style used by e.g. Palaeos (http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Lists/Cladograms/100Summary.html), an dmake the names in the tree link to descriptions either further down the page (need to be brief) or in other pages.
* Deciding the structure of the page(s) about chordates (or any other high-level taxon) needs centralised editorial control in order to make sure the structure is coherent, e.g. whether to have descriptions in the same page as the outline phylogenetic tree or on separate pages or both.
* High-level phylogeny pages must acknowledge that some areas of the tree are under debate and therefore fluid, e.g. synapsids, whether monotremes are actually in the same &quot;branch&quot; as marsupials and placentals, early hominid evolution.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most important part of citing your sources is following your teachers' instructions and obtaining a copy of the correct style manual in its current edition. Style manuals vary widely amongst themselves and between editions. For example, the American Psychological Association made major revisions in citation style between the fourth and fifth editions. Do not assume that teachers in the same school use the same style manual. If in doubt, ask early in the writing process.

''Learning'' a citation style well can be very useful, at least in a few standard forms. Memorizing the format for books and journal articles, for example, will probably mean you will not have to consult your style guide for the vast majority of your citations. This will save time (and misery) and allow you to concentrate more on the actual ''writing'' of the paper than on the formalistic aspects of citation.

Citation itself is very important for two major reasons. First is that citation allows you to give adequate credit to what others have said — this is important in order to ward off plagiarism and all of its evils, and is additionally valuable because &quot;credit&quot; is one of the primary currencies of academia (even if you don't regard it as such, your professor probably will). 

Citation also allows the reader to know where your sources are located and what sources you have consulted—useful to your paper graders both in assessing both your argument as well as how much work you have done, and necessary in general to appreciate the value of a historical paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Command Line Interface}}

A command line interface or CLI is a method of interacting with a computer by giving it lines of textual commands (that is, a sequence of characters) either from keyboard input or from a script. They were originally developed for interfacing with computers over teletype machines in the 1950s. It is occasionally also referred to as a CLUE, for Command Line User Environment. Some argue that the CLI is not actually a user interface at all, but a programming language, entered one line at a time, and has very little utility for users compared to developers. Indeed, command lines are most often used in scientific or engineering environments for programming.

In its simplest form, the computer displays a prompt, the user types a command on the keyboard and terminates the command with a keyboard key (usually the Enter key) and the computer executes the command. The computer then carries out the command given. The term is usually used in contrast to a graphical user interface (GUI) in which commands are typically issued by moving a pointer (via a pointing device) to a zone of the screen and pressing a button mounted on the pointing device (clicking).

Programs that implement these interfaces are often called command line interpreters. Examples of such programs include the various different Unix shells, VMS' DCL (Digital Command Language), and related designs like CP/M and DOS's command.com, both based heavily on DEC's RSX and RSTS operating system interfaces (which were also command line interfaces). Microsoft claims their next major operating system, Windows Vista, will include an enhanced command line interface named MSH (Microsoft Shell, codename Monad), which combines the features of traditional Unix shells with the object-oriented .NET framework.

Some applications provide command lines as well. The CAD program AutoCAD is a prominent example. Another excellent example is the engineering/scientific numerical computation package Matlab, in which practically no GUI exists and/or is unnecessary for performing most of the calculations. In some computing environments like the Oberon or Smalltalk user interface, most of the text which appears on the screen may be used for giving commands.
The commands given on a command line interface are often of the form

 [doSomething] [how] [toAFile]

or

 [doSomething] [how] &lt; [inputFile] &gt; [outputFile]

doSomething corresponds to a verb, how to an adverb (it describes how the command should be performed in this instance — for example, should it be particularly &quot;verbose&quot;, or particularly &quot;quiet&quot;) and toAFile to an object (often one or more files) against which the command should be run. The standalone '&gt;' in the second example is a redirection character, telling the operating system (i.e., usually a command shell interpreter) to send the output of the previous commands (that is, those on the left of '&gt;') to some other place (that is, the file named to the right of the '&gt;'). Another common and important redirection character is the pipe ('|'), which tells the CLI to treat the output of this command as the input of another; this can be a very powerful mechanism for the user, as explained under pipeline (Unix) and pipes and filters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How Can You Contribute?==
If you are a genetic counselor/consultant/clinical geneticist visiting this site and using these outlines in your own practice, please considering updating the content of this book by supplementing the information with your own research findings.  

Other ways in which you can contribute:
*Clean up the outlining
*Fix hyperlinks or add links to Wikipedia or other online resources
*Add new outlines for conditions that have not been included in this text
*Update Wikipedia articles on these conditions - it will improve Wikipedia and help you learn more about the condition at the same time

==MIM numbers==
Think it would be better, that each disease would have own MIM number with the link to OMIM in the headnote - already started add or transfer them from references. [[User:Ramujana|Ramujana]] 1 Dec, 2005
:Seems like a good idea.  Maybe once I finish transferring all of the outlines over I'll start on that.

==Copyright Issues==
This Handbook seems to be a Copy from [http://www.genesoc.com/counseling2/], and it might be a legal copy but do not state the source nor if it is a legal copy. Also ref Copyright notice on bottom of [http://www.genesoc.com/counseling2/]. Have not put it on CopyVio-list as I'm not shure it is... [[User:Oyvind|Oyvind]] 12:31, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
:That site is being taken down.  It did not have enough people contributing to it because of the CMS software that was being used.  As soon as all of the outlines from that site are transferred to here, that site will be taken down.  My wife is the person who set up the other site (with my help) so she holds the &quot;copyright&quot; on that other site.  She is happy to move the outlines here hoping other people will contribute to them given how easy it is to do so on Wikibooks. Also, for all future reference, the content here is now being released under ghe GNU Free Documentation License. 

{{GFDL}}

== Layman's terms ==
Needs some information to make it accessible to laypeople. If not intended to be read by laypeople, should state prerequisite texts.
:I'm not sure there is a whole lot that can be done there.  Ideally as other genetic counselors visit the site and use these outlines they may update the outlines and flesh them out a bit, making this more accessible for non-experts.  But keep in mind this is a handbook for genetic counselors - so it is designed with experts in mind.</text>

Does this even belong here?  I'm not sure a story with no corroboration told over two millenia ago rises to the level of being included as a &quot;fact.&quot;  I'm sorry if this has been discussed elsewhere, but I wanted to check. [[User:Rjstreet|Rjstreet]] 04:00, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

I'm as big a fan of the Atlantean Story as anyone, but i'm not sure that including it in a book is a good idea.  We Still have NO CLUE as to where Atlantis might be, its lost, precisly why we can't find it.  Good Effort, but this page should be removed.

I also think this should be removed from &quot;Ancient Civilizations&quot; or better moved to some section for &quot;fictive ancient civilizations&quot; which would be intresting as well.

:I would have to add that I don't think this really belongs here.  Most of this can and ought to be incorporated into the Minoan module instead, as the Minoans are considered a very likely source of the Atlantean ledgends.  They are geographically close to Greece (you don't hear about Atlanteans from the Aztec or Myan cultures), and there is geological evidence that volcanic activity may have &quot;destroyed&quot; Minoan cities in historical times, giving a good scientific explaination as to what may have in fact happened to them and a potential source of Altantis ledgends.  And certainly even simply weapons like a Bronze sword may have been significantly advanced compared to what most of Greece had for centuries before Plato, not to mention that they would have been in contact with Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians as trade routes from these empires would have gone through the Minoans on their way to Greece.  Writing systems and scientific knowledge from those other civilizations, with perhaps unique insights of their own, would have made the Minoans quite advanced in their scientific knowledge as well compared to the Greeks before their demise. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)


I found this page in a state of relative dissarray and re-wrote it in a style that: 
A. Was more suitable for children 
B. Clearly emphasised the legendary and possibly ficticious state of the civilisation.
C. Was, to my knowledge, grammatically correct with all poor spellings corrected. Please point out or correct personally any spelling mistakes that remain in the article.

It is unclear as to whether this page is discussing the original Atlantis page or my revised one, but as far as I can tell, all arguments here apart from the Minoan one are no longer relevant when looking at what I did to the page. I hope that this situation is cleared up to a satisfactory standard and I am more than willing to insert a section into the page about how it is easy to theorise that the Minoans may be the basis of the legend, with links to that page, copying this new part of the article largley from Mr Horning's above comment if I may. However, I do not think the article should be deleted. Anyone researching the Atlanteans may not be able to find the information they require if it is in the Minoan section. Without the knowledge of the Minoan theory, a reader might assume there is no information about the Atlanteans on the site at all and could go looking for information elsewhere. I hope you take these notes into account when making your judgement. For your reference, I had no idea that the image in the page was copyrighted and I did not publish it onto the page personally. And '''legend''' is definately the correct spelling...-- BB. 7th February 2006.

===Image copyright violations===
The images are in direct copyright violation.  However I have found the artist and contacted him asking for permission to use them on this page.  But if permission is not granted they will have to be deleted.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 05:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:Note that the text here is more or less original contributions, and that will not be deleted.  All that is going to go is the images, which IMHO is no major loss.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:37, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

== atlantis ==

what if Atlantis was right under our feet and didn't even know this because of different ocean floor patterns of time?
What if the civilazation is under another civilization of our time: like Troy?
some things that are not found are covered. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:74.67.97.46|74.67.97.46]] ([[User talk:74.67.97.46|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/74.67.97.46|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:I would like to point out that as a serious study of ancient cultures, Atlantis barely fits in here.  Plato is about the only &quot;authoritative&quot; source about Atlantis, and even that is mainly something that would otherwise be considered something of a Wikipedia-type stub article at best.  The rest is fictional conjecture and psuedoscience that makes UFO researchers seem like a paragon of scientific accuracy.

:I will admit that I have some prejudice about even having this article included next to ones about ancient Egypt and Rome, as this seems to be something akin to purely fictional civilizations such as Narnia and Minas Tirith.  The only difference is that Atlantis seems to have been discussed anciently and in mideval times as well, so there may be a small bit of truth to the whole thing.  I would emphasize that in particular for this article, some very substantal and credible sources ought to be used to substantiate any statements made about this civilization.  I have some serious dobuts that is even possible beyond Plato and his comments, but I may be surprised.  You certainly will be completely unable to find credible archeologists who have done any excavations of any Atlantean artifacts that confirm anything related directly to what Plato described, unless it is another civilization that already is known with another name and should be included with this Wikijunior book under that more commonly used scientific or popular culture name.  Please convince me (and others) that this article really needs to remain.

:I'm not pushing hard for an immediate VfD here, but it may end up going that way.  I'm willing to entertain that something of quality can be made from this article but in its current form this article is seriously wanting and in need of significant improvement and citations of scholarly sources.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:15, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a setup guide for AT&amp;T Mobility '''[http://www.wireless.att.com/learn/messaging-internet/media-entertainment/media-net.jsp MEdia Net]''' (as distinct from [http://www.wireless.att.com/businesscenter/plans/dataconnect.jsp Data Connect]).
'''Important Notes:'''
* This information is provided as a public service '''without warranty''' of any kind. '''Use at your own risk.'''
* &quot;Tethering&quot; is discouraged, and AT&amp;T reserves the right to deny service based on usage, including tethering. (See [http://www.cingular.com/media/media_legal MEdia Legal Notices])
* Items not covered here should be left at default values unless you really know what you are doing.


== Differences between MEdia Net and Data Connect ==

* MEdia Net uses the AT&amp;T WAP profile (settings) to support most types of Internet access (''e.g.,'' HTTP [Web browsing], SMTP/POP3/IMAP Email, FTP, Telnet, SSH, SSL). However, not all protocols seem to be fully supported, so problems may be seen with such things as VPN], and [[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ#What is Data Acceleration?|Data Acceleration]] is not available. Note that MEdia will not work with AT&amp;T Data Connect profiles. MEdia is less expensive than Data Connect (as of this writing).

* [http://www.wireless.att.com/businesscenter/plans/dataconnect.jsp Data Connect] uses AT&amp;T Data Connect profiles (settings) to provide standard Internet connections with AT&amp;T as the ISP (Internet Service Provider). Connections can be configured with or without [[AT&amp;T Mobility FAQ#What is Data Acceleration?|Data Acceleration]] (which significantly boosts throughput by means of image compression [which reduces image quality], caching, and transport optimization). Data Connect is more expensive than MEdia (as of this writing).

== Handset (Phone) Configuration ==

If WAP isn't already working on the handset, the handset and SIM must first be configured for AT&amp;T WAP:

* This is best accomplished by asking AT&amp;T Support (dial 611) to &quot;push&quot; WAP settings to the handset (normally done automatically by SMS when a WAP package [''e.g.,'' MEdia] is added to the account).
       
* Alternative: [https://www.wireless.att.com/support/tutorials.do? Cingular On-line Phone &amp; Device Support]&lt;br&gt;Select your Network, and handset Manufacturer and Model (or a similar device) to access Device Setup.

* [appears to be discontinued] Another alternative (untested), for Sony Ericsson devices, is to use the ''Configurator'' on the [http://www.sonyericsson.com/ Sony Ericsson website]. Select ''Configurators'', Phone model, ''WAP Read more'', and then follow the prompts. (Email and MMS can also be configured this way.)  

This configuration is sufficient for WAP and/or Web browsing with the handset alone. It's also sufficient for Email given an Email client in the handset that has been properly configured (including selection of the WAP profile for connections).

=== Using Windows XP Dial-Up Networking ===
''This is for an EGPRS(EDGE) handset.  For HSDPA, see [[#HSDPA Handset (Motorola V3xx) Configuration|HSDPA Handset (Motorola V3xx) Configuration]].''
* '''Create a handset modem entry.''' If your handset connection (serial cable, USB cable, IrDA, Bluetooth) created a modem entry for your handset (''e.g.,'' Standard Modem over Bluetooth link), then you can skip to next major step (Create DUN connection); otherwise:
** Obtain the latest handset modem driver.
** Make sure your handset connection (serial cable, USB cable, IrDA, Bluetooth) is installed properly, and note the COM port assigned. Make sure the handset is connected and powered on.
** Use ''Control Panel'' &amp;rarr; ''Modem'' to Add the handset modem. Windows should detect the modem, and then search for the best driver. When it does, give Windows the location of the modem driver, and complete the installation. (If auto-detection fails, try to Add the modem manually using the appropriate COM port with the driver.)

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Email ===

* The usual problem when sending email from a handset with SMTP capability is the outgoing SMTP server. Thanks to spammers, outgoing SMTP servers now generally require some form of '''authentication''' when you're off the provider's network. You should be able to find out what kind(s) of authentication are supported by contacting the email provider (''e.g.,'' your ISP). Finding out what your handset supports may be a bigger challenge -- documentation is often woefully inadequate in this area.

* If the email provider supports '''POP3 before SMTP authentication''', then you need to find a way to have the handset do a POP3 check or download before sending mail.

* Some handsets (''e.g.,'' Sony Ericsson Z600) now have support for SMTP-AUTH (Authenticated SMTP, different from POP3 before SMTP). For this to work, you usually need to configure the handset with a valid mailbox id and password for the email provider.

* On the AT&amp;T network you can use '''cwmx.com''' (preferred, no footer added) or '''photo.mycingular.com''' (adds a photo messaging footer) as an outgoing SMTP server. Since you're authenticated by being on the AT&amp;T network, no further authentication is required.

=== Speed ===

* Handsets and PC Cards do not all have the same data performance -- maximum speeds are limited by GPRS/EGPRS/EDGE Multislot Class](and the carrier). In general, all reasonably recent GPRS/EGPRS/EDGE-capable devices from Ericsson and Sony Ericsson support Class 8 (4+1) and Class 10 (4+2, max of 5), whereas most Nokia devices (as of this writing) are limited to slower Class 4 (3+1) and Class 6 (3+2, max 4). Motorola has both Class 4 and Class 8 devices. (The first number is the maximum number of downlink slots, and the number after the &quot;+&quot; is the maximum number of uplink slots.) This can translate into a substantial difference in throughput -- if supported by the carrier, Class 8 is 33% faster on downlink than Class 4.

* Connections between handsets and &quot;tethered&quot; devices (''e.g.,'' notebook computer, PDA) are typically implemented as a serial port, either real or virtual, and port speed usually defaults to 115 Kbps. (Bluetooth is typically implemented on a computer as a virtual serial port that will go as fast as 921.6 Kbps, but which runs at only 115.2 Kbps by default.) While 115 Kbps is generally fast enough for GPRS, it can be a bottleneck for EGPRS(EDGE) (as well as UMTS/HSDPA). In general, port speed should be at least 230 Kbps for GPRS and 460 Kbps for EGPRS(EDGE) (920 Kbps for UMTS/HSDPA).

=== WAP ===

* WAP as built into many handsets is much more limited than standard HTTP -- much of the Internet (World Wide Web) cannot be accessed through WAP.

This module covers the making of a long-stitched soft-board binding.  This style was recommended for small-scale projects by the book conservation lab at the University of Iowa.

If there are professional bookbinders in your area (and most large cities have them), you should be able to get your book bound for somewhere on the order of $20. Professionals have machines and supplies to do a case binding on fairly short order.

==Cover==
The cover for a long-stitched binding is made of cardboard -- specifically acid free two ply [[Bookbinding/Museum board|museum board]]. In determining the size of the cover, you have to allow for not only the thickness of the paper, but the thickness of the thread used to sew the binding, so now is the time to get the thread. The thread should be heavy, heavy enough that you might be as likely to call it fine cordage as you are to call it heavy thread! Thread diameters of close to a millimeter (when uncompressed and not under tension) are quite reasonable. The thread should compress to about 1/2 millimeter when successive turns are wrapped tightly around a pencil.  ''See the section on [[Bookbinding/Thread|thread]] for other criteria.''

If you have 19 sections, as in DEC's 1973 Introduction to Programming, you'll need to add the thickness of 19 threads to the thickness of your book. To find this, wrap 19 turns of thread tightly around a pencil and measure the length of the wrapping, then add this to the thickness of the clamped spine of the stack of sections that will make up your book.

The museum board has the interesting property that it flexes fairly easily in one direction but it is fairly stiff in the other. You want your cover to flex easily from side to side, since that's the way you tend to bend the covers of a book when you hold it open to read. You want the book to be stiff from top to bottom, since bending in that direction should never happen. Taking this into account, cut a rectangle of museum board with the dimensions shown in Figure 4.1:

[[Image:Jones book cover dimensions.PNG|thumb|454px|Basic dimensions of the cover. &lt;small&gt;Starting with a rectangle the size of one unfolded sheet of the photocopied book, add the following dimensions to the width: P&amp;mdash;the thickness of the stacked sections that will make up the book's body, compressed and measured away from the creased edges.  T&amp;mdash;the thickness of the thread.&lt;/small&gt;]] 

Do not cut the cover oversize. The cover used with this style of binding is intended to cover the pages of the book in the way a conventional paperback cover does, with the edges of the cardboard exactly even with the edges of the bound pages.

I did all my cutting with a carpenter's square to guide a large X-acto knife. It took two or three scores with the knife to cut all the way through, and I used an old cardboard sheet as backing so I wouldn't cut into the top of the table I was working on. A paper cutting guillotine also works well to cut out the cover, particularly the type of guillotine that clamps the material being cut so that the blade does not pull the cardboard sideways as it cuts.

Having cut out a rectangular piece of cardboard, you need to score the creases where the cover will hinge to wrap around the pages. I measured twice to avoid error, then set my straight-edge along the planned hinge lines and used a blunt tool to score the crease. Traditional bookbinders would use a bone tool for this. I used the rounded and polished end of a metal ruler I found in my toolbox. Be careful not to cut or tear the fibers of the board when you score it; your goal is to compress the fibers in order to guide the crease. Figure 4.2 shows the cover with scored creases.

[[Image:Jones book cover slits.PNG|thumb|454px|The cover, slit and creased.]]

Before you bend the cover, you need to cut a series of equally spaced square-ended slits in the cover, as shown in Figure 4.2. Typically, these should be about an inch apart, (anywhere from 2 to 3 cm will do) and the slits at the top and bottom should be a bit closer to the top and bottom edges of the book (about 1/2 inch or 1.5 cm is nice). Each slit should be about 1 mm wide, but the precise width is less important than the uniformity.

I cut 8 slits for this purpose, but 7 would be just as good. The ends of the slits should be about 1/2 the thickness of one section of your book from the creases that you just scored in the cover.

There are several ways to cut these slits. For my first effort, I used an X-acto knife, but I've found that cutting cardboard with a hammer and chisel is very fast and accurate. Use a broad-bladed wood chisel that's almost the length of the slit you want, and make sure it's very sharp. Place the chisel so the flat side faces the side of the slot you are keeping, and the beveled face faces the waste material you will discard. Always work against a disposable backing that won't damage the chisel; I use some heavy strathmore board for this. Practice a bit on scraps of your cover material before you attack the real thing.

Another way to make these slots was suggested to me by Neil Tyler. He has done this with an inexpensive utility knife, the kind with a cast metal handle that is in two halves held together by a screw. Normally, you put only one blade in such a knife, but if you put two blades in, side by side, with a spacer between them, you can cut slots that are about as wide as the thickness of the spacer plus the thickness of one blade. There is one warning about this method! Be extremely careful! Wounds made by closely spaced parallel blades are nasty, difficult to bandage and slow to heal when compared with the commonplace cuts that most users of sharp tools have experienced on occasion.

==Punching holes==

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bookbinding/Punching_holes&amp;action=edit Edit this section.]
Paper is hard stuff, and pushing a sewing needle through 8 layers is no fun; it is far easier to pre-punch each section for sewing!  To do this, make a jig out of a scrap of cardboard with a very straight edge.  

#Cut a shallow wide notch in the cardboard.  The depth of the notch should be about the thickness of the 8 sheets of paper that make up your sections.  The width of the notch should be the height of the spine of the book.  
#Lay out the holes that will be punched, making a mark for each one on the edge of the cardboard.  In the case of a [[Bookbinding/Long stitch|long stitch]] binding, these measurements can be transferred directly from the [[Bookbinding/Long stitch#Cover|cover]] as follows: 
#*Put the jig parallel to the length of the part of the cover that will be the spine, so the notch just brackets the cover.
#*Carefully mark where each slot in the spine passes your jig.  
#Make a V shaped notch at each mark.  These notches show where the holes go in the crease of each section.
#It's a rare day that you can get the jig (or the slots in your spine) perfectly symmetrical, so mark one end of your jig as the top, so that you can punch all of your sections the same way.  Always make the up direction point towards the top of the page, and your book will come out with even edges.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Figure 5.1 illustrates the finished punching jig,
resting against the spine of the cover:

[[Image:Jones punching jig.PNG|thumb|274 px|The punching jig against the spine of the cover.]]

The purpose of the V shaped notches is to guide the tip of an [[Bookbinding/Awl|awl]] as you
punch holes in your sections.  Slide your jig into the center of a folded section until the notched edge rests in the crease, then hold the back of the section against a scrap of wood and use a good sharp awl to punch a row of holes, one per notch in the jig.  Keep the section folded fairly tightly, and the awl will find the center of the crease in the section and the center of the notch fairly naturally.

==Sewing==

The long stitch I used is a fairly modern modification of an ancient style of bookbinding; the basic rules are simple: Sections of the book are sewn into the cover one at a time, in sequence, from the front of the book to the back, using a single length of thread to sew the entire book. In sewing each section, the thread runs once down the length of that section, alternately inside the fold of the section and outside the spine of the cover.

The thread is always sewn inside the fold of the section at each end of the book; except at the ends, the threads of successive sections alternate, so that the sewing pattern on the back of a finished book (with 4 sections in this example) should look something like is shown in Figure 6.1:

[[Image:Long stitch bookbinding1.PNG|thumb|280px|Figure 6.1:  The sewn spine, from the back. &lt;small&gt;B&amp;mdash;The beginning of the thread.  E&amp;mdash;The end of the thread.&lt;/small&gt;]]

The book is sewn with a single thread, between the indicated points. Note that it takes a bit of cleverness to sew the ends of the sections, since the natural alternation of over and under brings the thread out somewhat randomly in one or the other orientation.

The thread should always pass over the end of each section and around the end of the spine. This helps prevent the pages from tearing out, because tears almost always begin at the end of the crease.

Before you start sewing, you need to measure out enough thread to sew the entire book. For a book with 19 or 20 sections, wrap the thread 10 times around the handfull of sections when they're clenched tightly in the cover. Then wrap one or two turns for good luck. It's better to have a bit of extra thread than to have to knot the thread in midbook!

Before you start sewing, it helps (but is not strictly necessary) to [[Bookbinding/Thread|wax the thread]] with beeswax.

A note of caution: You do your final quality control check when you commit yourself to sewing in a section! Once the wrong section is sewn in or the right one is sewn in with a missing or inverted page, it's no fun to undo. Check what section you are sewing, and make sure it is all there and right-side up! As you gain experience, you'll find that you spend less time checking, but it's better to do too much checking than too little.

Also, with each section, check that all the pre-punched holes line up with the slits in the cover. If they don't you've probably got the section upside down. If they still don't line up, you've done a bad job punching the holes, and you'll have to repunch a few.

Figure 6.2 shows, in some detail, is a cross section of the knotting at the end of a thread:

[[Image:Long stitch bookbinding2-Jones.PNG|thumb|304px|Figure 6.2:  Cross-section through the first or last section of the book.  &lt;small&gt;T&amp;mdash;The thread  P&amp;mdash; The pages being sewn in  C&amp;mdash;The cover  K&amp;mdash;The knotted end of the thread &lt;/small&gt;]]

Try to keep the knot and the loose end on the inside of the book. A tight square knot will do well here. Start by making the knot at one end of the first section, and finish sewing the first section to the spine. At the end, you'll face a problem -- how to finish one section and start the next.

Here, in some detail, is the sewing pattern used to change from one section to the next. If the thread emerges from the end of a section in the crease of that section, go outside the cover and down into the first prepunched hole in the next section, then out the crease, over the spine, and through the same hole as you begin sewing the length of the next section.

If the thread emerges from the end of a section outside the spine, go around the end and down the crease, re-using the last hole in the same section before going outside, around the end of the next section, and up the crease.

In both cases, the above sewing pattern will produce the result shown in Figure 6.3.

[[Image:Long_stitch_edge_detail-Jones.PNG|thumb|267px|Figure 6.3:  Detail, looping from one section to the next.]]

Here, dashed lines are used to show threads that are tucked into the crease of a section, while double horizontal and diagonal lines show the threads visible from the outside of the spine.

Whenever you use the same hole twice, always be sure not to sew the thread through itself. Pull the thread that goes through the hole off to one side, then thread the needle through to the other side of the same hole. If you do accidentally sew through the thread, it will make it difficult to tighten the thread when you're done sewing.

As you reach the end of the book, it will get hard to squeeze the last few sections in. You'll have to press hard to move the already bound pages down the spine to make room for the last sections, and as you work on the very last one, you'll have to squeeze the book again each time you try to get the needle through. If you measured the spine width correctly, you'll just barely manage to fit the last section in -- that's the test of a perfect fit.

If you run out of thread before you reach the end of the book, follow the instructions below for tightening the thread before you tie on a new length of thread, then tie the knot (a square knot) as close as you can to the last hole the thread passes through, Keep the knot on the inside of a crease! Do not back yourself into the situation where you have a knot that you need to pull through a hole in the sewing when you try to tighten the thread later.

Before you tie the final knot in the book, tighten the thread, working along the spine from the initial knot towards the end, pulling out any slack until the thread is uniformly tight throughout the sewing. I use a sharp awl (the same one I used to punch the holes in the sections) to do this, since it is easy to insert the tip under a tight loop of thread and pull the slack forward to that loop, tightening the previous loop. You don't need to pull too hard, but you don't want to leave any slack in the binding.

Finally, when the sewing is uniformly tight, tie the final knot, and you have a book! If the pages aren't in the right order at this point, though you'll have trouble fixing the order without cutting the thread and re-sewing!

The spine of the finished book is shown in Figure 6.4. Note that the end sewing and the threads holding the center sections of the book match almost perfectly with the pattern illustrated in Figure 6.1. The pattern of the threads holding the very first and last sections is somewhat obscured by the tighter packing of these lines of sewing.

[[Image:Long stitch binding-Jones.jpg|thumb|380px|Figure 6.4:  The sewn result!]]

The book shown in Figure 6.4 has seen several years of use, and the impact of this wear is quite visible. Repeated flexing of the fold where the book front meets the spine has torn some of the surface fibers. Should this crease ever begin to tear, it would be a simple matter to thread linen tape through the sewing and glue it to the front and back covers in order to reinforce the spine and hinges. The photo shows no wear on the threads, and the torn fibers along the crease are very clean; this is because the book has been protected by a dust jacket since it was bound.

This page will talk about some common integrated circuits, including where to buy components, form-factors, etc...

== Form Factors ==

=== DIP, PDIP, SPDIP ===

[[Image:AMD C8080A.jpg|thumb|right|This AMD chip is a CERDIP]]

DIP stands for &quot;Dual Inline Package&quot;, and is what common Integrated Circuits come as. The &quot;P&quot; Prefix means the chip will be plastic, the &quot;S&quot; prefix means it will be thinner then a normal DIP, or it will have pins that are closer together. Occasionally packages will be found called &quot;CERDIP&quot;, where the &quot;CER&quot; prefix means that the package is made of ceramic, and is therefore more resistant to heat. CERDIPs are more expensive then PDIPs, but are less susceptible to heat and static charge.

=== SSOP ===

SSOP stands for '''Small Shrink Outline Package'''.

=== SOIC ===

SOIC stands for '''Small Outline Integrated Circuit'''.

== Suppliers ==

=== Distributors ===

Mouser Electronics,
Digikey,
Futurlec,
Jameco,
SparkFun

=== Manufacturers ===

Out of many, many, different manufacturers around the world, some of the most common are:

*Texas Instruments (home to the first integrated circuit)
*Fairchild Semiconductor
*Maxim Semiconductor
*Xilinx
*ON Semi
*Mitsubishi
*Analog Devices
*STMicroelectronics

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Museum board''' is a special type of cardboard.  Specifically, it is a white, acid free cardboard with  the interesting property that it flexes fairly easily in one direction but it is fairly stiff in the other.  This is because of the [[Bookbinding/Grain|grain]] of the paper fibers.  Denny Jones recommends two ply museum board for [[Bookbinding/Long stitch|long stitch]] binding. Good art-supply stores carry this.  One sheet will make about eight book covers for books printed on standard sized typing paper.

The powdered stuff is any of those fruit, dried and crushed; you can get hot, sweet, or mild paprika. &quot;One paprika&quot; would be like one bell pepper, or perhaps one sweet pepper (Italian pepper).

::Thanks! I knew the source of the dried spice, but had never heard &quot;paprika&quot; used to refer to the fresh veg itself. Now I know! [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 14:36, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

Might want to add some serving suggestions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Road map to a technological utopia ==
In man's eternal journey to a fuller understanding and control of the world around him certain new technologies have been developed and will be developed that vastly change almost every aspect of human life. To start we should cover those vital gifts of science which mankind already benefits from, the first foundation stone of all society is surely communication.

== Communication ==
Early man soon set himself apart from the other animals and rose to the top of the food chain with the effective use of team-work. A team of maybe six pre-historic hunters armed with spears could confuse and overwhelm even the largest of prey by using only the most basic of communication and planning skills. In modern times communication has become an art form, indeed a plethora of art forms; oration, poetry, prose both fiction and factual even separating over time into such specialties as political, technical, short hand and a myriad of archaic almost forgotten variants. Communication could be said to be the first and still most important invention of humanity.

In the technologically advanced twentieth century communication developed a new front; the fast developing field of communicating with computers, new languages especially for this task were created. How ever it was not only computers that inspired new languages, short hand was developed to allow secretaries to take memos at great speed. Created using a simple system of easy to draw symbols for commonly used words it was a mild revolution in the office and foreshadowed the invention of the Dictaphone as a time saving tool for executives on the move. Like short hand the language ‘Lojban’ was invented to stream line language for better use in a specific purpose, while short hand increases speed Lojban increases accuracy and logic. The phrase ‘cute little girls school’ for instance has 22 connotations in English while in Lojban you could only say one precise meaning e.g. the school for girls who are both little and cute or the school which is little and cute and for girls.

In any kind of utopia good communication would be a vital thing; many attempts have been made to enforce an attempted utopian regime by controlling communications, Nazi Germany developed propaganda into an art form and made the use of it on both the enemy and the home state standard practice. George Orwell even theorized in ‘1984’ that language could be used in a more sinister way to subjugate the masses, he suggested that if someone could not say something then they wouldn’t be able to think that thing and so by removing certain phrases from the language thus any rebellion would be literally – unthinkable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Choroid Plexus Cysts on Ultrasound'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*Ask how the pregnancy is going
*Ask about dates
*Explain the session
**Getting family hx/pregnancy hx
**Talking about what a choriod plexus cyst is and what it means for the pregnancy, testing that may be offered
**What questions do you have?

==Pregnancy hx==
*Any illnesses?
*Any infections/exposures?
*Any medications?
*Verify dates
*Screening tests up to now…ultrasounds? Triple screen test?

==Family hx (probably at end of session)==
*Get two generation pedigree
*Determine any risks to pregnancy
*Specify any particular ethnic concerns as well

==Choriod Plexus Cysts (probably at beginning of session)==
*What have you heard about them?
*The Choroid plexus
**A spongy layer of cells and blood vessels along the edge of the ventricles (pockets or spaces in the brain
**Produces the cerebrospinal fluid that fills the ventricles and provides a cushion to the brain and spinal cord.
**Development starts at 6th week
**By 9th weeks the choroids plexus fills ~75% of lateralventricles
**Starts to slowly decrease in size and by 20th week the choriod plexus has assumed its adult form
*Choriod Plexus Cysts
**Description
***Caused by folding of the spongy layer = trapping fluid in the area
***BENIGN!!! They do not cause any problems for the fetus
***Usually &lt;1cm in size
***Can be unilateral or bilateral
***Usually can be detected by 11th week of pregnancy
***usually resolve by the 24-28th week of pregnancy
**Incidence
***Found in 1% of pregnancies scanned between the 16th - 20 week.
***Found in 50% of autopsies (fetuses, adults, elderly)
*Association with chromosomal abnormalities
**HIGHLY controversial
**Trisomy 18
***~45% of fetuses with Trisomy 18 had choriod plexus cysts
****does not depend on gestational age, unilateral or bilateral or size
***1-2% risk of a chromosomal abnormality when CPC are found. Most likely Trisomy 18 if anything
***TRISOMY 18 the syndrome
****Describe genes and chromosomes
****1/3000-1/7000 live births
****most do not survive to term
****if live birth, usually die in days,weeks following birth
****90% die within the first year of live
****severe congenital anomalies
**90% heart defects
****severe mental retardation
***70-77% babies with Trisomy 18 will have other findings on ultrasound (some studies say ~100% after 24 weeks)
****clenched fists
****heart defects
****rocker-bottom feet
****omphalocele
****hydrocephalus
**VERY CONTROVERSIAL- relation to Down syndrome (thought to be coincidental by most authors)
***Very rarely seen to be related to CPC cysts
***1/660 live births
***DS - the syndrome
****Mild-moderate MR
****Heart problems in 40%
****Characteristic facial features
***Ultrasound findings
****Echogenic bowel
****Femur length
****Nuchal fold thickness

==Discussion of triple screen results (if they are present)==
*SCREENING test - NOT diagnostic
*Measuring three values of proteins in the mother'sblood
*They are produced by the baby in its liver
*MoM values of 1.0 are the standard
*Maternal age and gestational age are considered
*For risks associated with Trisomy 18 = expect all three values to be low
*Your results show (no/an) increased risk over the general pop of mothers who are your gestational age.

==Risk of having a baby with Trisomy 18==
*Consider maternal age
*Consider CPC
*Consider triple screen results
*Consider presence of other markers on ultrasound
*USE CHART (see attached or ask Kris for a copy of hers)

==Testing Offered==
*Detailed ultrasound to look for other markers (previously discussed)
*Amniocentesis
**Risk 1/200
**Determines presence or absence of aneuploidy
**Does not guarantee a healthy baby
**Some centers debate about offering based solely on CPC

==Important Points==
*18% of unaffected fetuses will have more than just CPC on ultrasound!!!!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Classical Myotonic Dystrophy'''

==What is myotonic dystrophy?==
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common adult form of muscular dystrophy. It is a multisystem disorder that affects the muscles, as well as the eyes, heart, endocrine system, and central nervous system. Myotonic dystrophy causes muscle weakness accompanied by myotonia, a delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. Myotonic dystrophy, also known as Steinert's disease and dystrophia myotonica, is a hereditary condition.
.

==What causes myotonic dystrophy?==
Myotonic dystrophy is caused by a defect in a gene called DMPK. The gene has a stretch of DNA that contains a series of CTG repeats in its sequence. Normally, the DMPK gene has less than 37 CTG repeats. However, individuals with myotonic dystrophy have more than 37 repeats, making the gene unstable. The greater the number of repeats that an individual has, the more severe the symptoms will be. Genetic anticipation is often observed in the inheritance of myotonic dystrophy. Anticipation means that the number of repeats tends to increase as the disease is passed from one generation to the next, leading to increasing severity of symptoms and decreasing age of onset. Anticipation is most commonly observed in the transmission of myotonic dystrophy from maternal genes.

==How does a person get myotonic dystrophy?==
Because myotonic dystrophy is a hereditary disorder, it is transmitted from generation to generation. The defective gene is dominant, meaning individuals who inherit the gene from either their mother or their father will have the disorder. If one parent has the disease, there is a 50% chance that myotonic dystrophy will be passed on to their offspring.

==What are the symptoms of myotonic dystrophy?==
The effects of myotonic dystrophy vary widely, even among members of the same family. Some individuals have symptoms so mild that they hardly notice them. In other individuals, muscle weakness and wasting may cause more severe disabilities. In general, the older a person is when muscle weakness becomes noticeable , the slower the disease progression and the less serious the effects. Myotonic dystrophy is loosely classified into three categories based on the number of CTG repeats in the gene, the severity of the symptoms, and the age of onset. The three forms are: mild, classical, and congenital.

==What are the characteristics of classical myotonic dystrophy?==
Individuals with classical myotonic dystrophy have 100-1500 CTG repeats in the DMPK gene. The age of onset is typically between 10 and 30 years. The predominant symptom is muscle weakness and wasting which usually begins in the distal limb muscles, including the forearms, hands, feet, and ankles. This muscle weakening may lead to foot drop and difficulty performing tasks requiring hand dexterity. Muscle weakening may also be observed in the neck or shoulders. Very rarely, the disease may progress to the point where an individual is confined to a wheel chair. Myotonia is also observed and may lead to difficulty performing some daily activities.
Individuals with myotonic dystrophy often have long, thin faces, and weakness of the muscles in the eyelids may cause them to droop. Some men with myotonic dystrophy experience frontal balding. Other symptoms that individuals may experience include speech problems, cataracts, and cardiac arrhythmia. Myotonic dystrophy may also lead to constipation, diarrhea, or gallstones. In the later stages of the disease, some people experience sleep apnea and hypersomnia.
Women with myotonic dystrophy have an increased risk for pregnancy complications. Problems may include an increased risk for spontaneous abortions, prolonged labor, a retained placenta, and post partum hemorrhaging. Men may experience testicular atrophy, although myotonic dystrophy has not been associated with an increase in infertility. Hyperinsulinism and abnormalities in the secretion of growth hormones have also been observed, but they rarely cause clinical problems.
Learning problems have been associated with classical myotonic dystrophy. Also, obsessive compulsive, passive-aggressive, and avoidant behaviors have all been observed in some individuals with the condition.
Individuals with myotonic dystrophy may have a shortened life span. The average age of death is 48-55 years old. Common causes of death include pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiovascular problems, sudden death arrhythmia, and tumors.

==How is myotonic dystrophy diagnosed?==
A physical examination may reveal muscle weakness and myotonia. A special test called a muscle biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Also, DNA testing can be performed to determine the number of CTG repeats on the DMPK gene. This blood test is 100% sensitive and specific. Presymptomatic testing is available for individuals who have no features of the condition but have a family history of myotonic dystrophy. Prenatal testing is also available.

==How is myotonic dystrophy treated/managed?==
Currently, there is no treatment for myotonic dystrophy. Muscle weakness can be managed with orthotics or other assistive devices. Treatment is available for many symptoms of myotonic dystrophy, including cataracts, diabetes, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, and myotonia. In addition, close monitoring of the heart with an annual EKG, the eyes with an annual ophthalmologic exam, and screens for glucose concentration can provide early identification of some potential effects of myotonic dystrophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cleft Lip and Palate'''

==Introduction and Contracting==

==Review Medical History==
(fill out remainder of intake and verify info)

==Family History==
(verify pedigree if we have one in his mother's chart or make a new one)
*Be sure to include:
**cleft lip and palate
**heart defects
**birth defects
**learning difficulties
**mental retardation
**miscarriages
**early deaths
**consanguinity





==Inheritance and Recurrence Risk==
*If neither parent has a cleft than the inheritance is probably either multifactorial or recessive and these are not distinguishable usually
*multifactorial -- combination of genes and environment
*approximately 3-5% chance of having another similarly affected child this is 20-35 fold increase over baseline
*(this risk increases more if the couple have more than one affected child)

==Multifactorial Risks of Cleft Lip/Palate==
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Relationship to index case !! Cleft lip/palate !! Cleft palate
|-
| Siblings (overall risk) || 4% || 1.8%
|-
| Siblings (no other affected) || 2.2% || -
|-
| Siblings (2 affected siblings) || 10% || 8%
|-
| Siblings &amp; affected parents || 10% || -
|-
| Children || 4.3% || 6.2%
|-
| Second degree relatives || 0.6% || -
|-
| Third degree relatives || 0.3% || -
|-
| General population || 0.1% || 0.04%
|}

*recurrence also influenced by how severe the cleft is 5.6% for bilateral lip/palate, 4.1% for unilateral lip/palate and 2.6% for cleft lip without cleft palate
*if it can be established that there are no other affected relatives, the risk to siblings (2.2%) is less than the overall risk (4%).
*The higher figure should be used if the history is unreliable or unavailable.
*If there is a third first degree relative than autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance should be considered.
*recessive inheritance
**both parents contribute the same recessive gene to affected child
**recurrence risk 25% or 1:4
**gene not mapped
*Autosomal dominant -THIS IS WHAT WAS COUNSELED FOR THIS FAMILY
**usually one parent will also have cleft
**risk of recurrence is 50% or 1:2
**gene mapped to short arm chromosome 6
**X-linked recessive
**pattern seen sometimes with clefting of the secondary palate or bifid uvula
**x-linked recurrence risks
**in one of these families from Iceland the single gene has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome X
*Association with a syndrome or collection of physical findings which run together in the same person, and for the most part are seen in all individuals who have that syndrome
**Syndromes are more common in cleft palate alone than in cleft lip with or without cleft palate, but can occur in any of these
**Syndromic clefts are commonly inherited as single gene defects, but they can be due to changes in the baby's chromosomes, something used during pregnancy or a sporadic change

==Prevalence of Clefts==
*1:700 live births over 5,000 in US each year
*between 1/5000 and 1/1000 for cleft lip and/or cleft palate, and about 1/2500 for cleft palate alone
*more common among Asians 1: 500 and certain groups of American Indians 1:300 than among Caucasians 1:800
*occur less frequently among African-Americans 1: 2000
*Cleft lip and cleft palate together are more common in boys 3:2 ratio

==Cleft Repair==
*cleft lip-- usually be repaired in the first few months of life-- for most infants with cleft lip alone, the abnormality can be repaired within the first several months of life (usually when the baby is 10 to 12 pounds)
*cleft palate repairs are usually done between the ages of 9 to 18 months, but before the age of 2
*exact timing of these repairs depends on the baby's health and considerations of his or her future development and will be decided by surgeon

==Other Possible Complications==

===Feeding Problems===
*Feeding difficulties occur more with cleft palate abnormalities
*some babies with clefts have very few or no problems feeding
*others have more difficulty --the infant may be unable to suck properly because the roof of the mouth is not formed completelely
*breastfeeding is possible, but the use of special bottles and careful positioning of the baby are sometimes helpful modifications-- there are many types of bottles and nipples on the market that can assist with feeding an infant with cleft palate
*Dr. Doktour recommended Haberman Feeder®
*This is a specially designed bottle system with a valve to help control the air the baby drinks and to prevent milk from going back into the bottle

===Hearing===
*important for ears and hearing to be examined on a regular basis because children with cleft palate are more susceptible to ear infections (otitis media) than children without clefts
*Ear infections are often due to a dysfunction of the tube that connects the middle ear and the throat
*Children with many ear infections are at risk for hearing loss, language delays, and speech problems because they are not able to hear language normally when fluid collects in the middle ear.

===Teeth Considerations===
*only cleft lip-- teeth will probably not be affected
*if affects the gums where the teeth grow - teeth may not erupt normally and probably need dental/ orthodontic treatments

===Speech Difficulties===
*only lip --speech problems are unlikely
*cleft palate over half need speech therapy at some point in childhood
*many children who are born with a cleft palate develop normal speech by the age of 5
*delay in both the onset of speech and the development of speech sounds during the first 9-24 months of age is not unusual
*important to remember that some children, with or without a cleft palate, may simply develop speech more slowly than others.
*important to talk to your child and to encourage your child to talk to you
*before palate repair
**there is no separation between the nasal cavity and the mouth and it can be difficult to learn how to make some sounds because the child cannot build up air pressure in the mouth because air escapes out of the nose and/or there is less tissue on the roof of the mouth for the tongue to touch
*After palate repair
**your child may be able to learn more consonant sounds and say more words
**speech may still be delayed during the early years
**articulation problems (difficulties in making certain sounds) may persist in some children throughout early childhood for a variety of reasons.
**if teeth do not &quot;line up&quot; correctly, speech may be understandable, but some sounds (like &quot;s&quot; or &quot;sh&quot;) may sound distorted or &quot;mushy.&quot;
**VPI (velopharyngeal insufficiency or inadequacy)
**when speech is produced correctly, the soft palate lifts and moves toward the back of the throat, separating the nasal cavity from the mouth so that air and sound can be directed out of the mouth.
**inability to close off the nasal cavity from the mouth is called velopharyngeal inadequacy.
**characterized by hyponasal speech &quot;talking through their noses.&quot;
**occurs because when the soft palate cannot close off the nose from the mouth, air and sound can escape through the nose during speech
**Approximately 25% of children with repaired cleft palates still show signs of velopharyngeal inadequacy.
**grunt or growl sounds may be behavior that some children learn in an attempt to compensate for velopharyngeal inadequacy-- although it can be corrected by speech therapy it should be discouraged
**Children with velopharyngeal inadequacy may also have a voice disorder.
**voice may sound hoarse or &quot;breathy&quot; and may fatigue easily and is usually caused by the strain that he or she puts on the vocal cords while trying to build the pressure necessary for normal speech.
**Speech therapy alone may be able to correct your child's speech disorder. Therapy can be extremely effective for children with mild hypernasality, an articulation disorder, or speech delay.
**Speech therapy alone will generally NOT correct hypernasality that is caused by moderate to severe velopharyngeal inadequacy.
**may require another palate surgery to help with speech
**surgery is the most frequently-chosen approach for improving velopharyngeal function, but a prosthetic device may be an option for some patients.

===Learning Difficulties===
*none expected it isolated cleft lip and palate
*if part of a cluster of a syndrome learning ability is sometimes affected

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*Having a baby can be pretty stressful especially when there are complications. How are you handling it?
*Do you have help from your family?
*Have you explained any of this to your friends or family?
*Is the father of the baby involved in any way?
*How is that?
*Are you attending school?
*Working?
*The surgeries and treatment can get pretty expensive do you have health insurance coverage?
*Other financial assistance?

==Financial Assistance==
*Health insurance will pay for all or part of the necessary care
*may qualify for BCMH
*would probably qualify for WIC

==Psychosocial Concerns==
*Initial shock and adjustment for the family
*Often a period of mourning the anticipated child and the situation
*Possibility of mother interacting differently and interacting less with infants with anomalies
*Guilt - nothing you could have done to prevent or cause this
*Feelings of concern, anxiety, and grief are not unusual
*mothers of babies with clefts report more stress and more concerns about their competence as parents than mothers of healthy babies
*reproductive plans generally unaltered by birth of child with cleft
*later challenges as the child grows

== What country did they live in? ==
The Scythians lived in the steppes to the north of the Black Sea, in the south of modern Russia and Ukraine. They were first described by the Greek historian Herodotus. They were cattle-breeding nomads, meaning that they did not stay in the same place for long. When cattle ate out all the grass around, they travelled to a different place, where the grass was fresh and untouched. They were also skilled horsemen and brave warriors. They were the first who used light cavalry as a main military force. 

The horse was everything for a Scythe. They started riding horses when they were small children. Horses were not just transportation for Scythians; they were their protectors, providers and best friends. When a Scythian warrior died, his horse was buried with him. 

Scythian women were brave warriors as well. Living in the steppes was dangerous as you have literally nowhere to hide. Scythian women had to be strong and know how to protect themselves.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
Scythians did not have buildings. It does not make sense to build a house if you know that you are leaving soon. They lived in tents instead.

The only buildings they left behind them were kurgans – artificial hills, made of stones and earth, elevated on top of the tombs of nobilities. These tombs were filled with everything that a person could need in the afterlife: clothes, dishes, weapons, golden jewellery. They cremated their dead by covering the body in wax.

== What did they eat? ==
The favourite drink of Scythes was horse milk, often mixed with blood. They ate grains, fresh fruit, horse meat, and fish.

== What did they wear? ==
Both men and women wore clothes that were comfortable for riding horse: leather pants and jackets, short soft boots tied at the ankle, and felt pointed hoods. Both men and women wore their hair long and loose, and men had beards. 

Scythians also liked to decorate their clothes, horses and weapons with golden jewellery. Since Scythes were very close to nature, the main motif of their jewellery was animals. They loved to show animals in motion, because these images showed what Scythes valued most: strength, speed and freedom.

== What did their writing look like? ==
Scythians did not develop any written form of their language. Though later, when they came in contact with other cultures, like the Greek colonies in the sea costs, they carved some texts in stones, but these were mostly for religious reasons and for the tombs. We don't know what their language was like and cannot read their writings. Their writing used the Greek alphabet with some modifications.

== What did they believe? ==
The Scythians, who originated form Iran, were nomadic horsemen of the Eurasian plains who lived from around 500 to 200Bc. Over the past two centuries numerous Scythian mummies have been discovered in the Altai Mountains. The Altai Mountains are the meeting place of the four countries; the Russian Federation, China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cleft Lip - Isolated, Unilateral, Incomplete'''

==Contracting==
*Acknowledge previous contact
*What were you hoping to gain from today's session?
*What concerns and questions do you have?
*Outline session agenda
*Interim history
*Dr. will examine to rule out possible syndromes associated with CL
*We aren't expecting Dr. to find anything that makes him suspicious.

==Medical History==

==Family History==
*Have you found out anything new about the family history?
*Any new births, deaths, or diagnoses?

==Cleft lip and palate==
*Before genetic counseling can be given, numerous syndromes must be excluded.
*Definition: CL/CP due to a failure of the union of the frontonasal process of the face with the lateral maxillary prominence at about 3-4 weeks post conception (35 days gestation)
*Classification of clefts
*Nonsyndromic vs. syndromic
*80% are unilateral, 20% bilateral, extends to the palate in 70% of unilateral cases and 85% of bilateral cases
*Incomplete or complete (involving the lip and the anterior maxilla vs. involving the lip, anterior maxilla, hard and soft palate)
*Unilateral clefting commonly occurs on the left (2x more frequently than right)
*Male to female ratio is 2:1

==Incidence==
*CL +/- CP occurs in 1:1000 Caucasian births, 1.7:1000 Asian births and 1:2500 AA
*Isolated cleft lip and palate account for 25% of the cases of clefting
*Left unilateral clefts, right unilateral clefts, and bilateral clefts occur at a 6:3:1 ratio.

==Inheritance and Recurrence Risks==
*Most isolated occurrences are inherited multifactorially
*Background risk: 0.1% (Harper)
*RR- 3-7%, empiric
*2-4% risk for offspring of an affected parent
*2nd degree relative: 0.6% risk (Harper)

==Risks==
*Specific factors increase the risk for CL/CP
**Severity of the trait (unilateral vs. bilateral; complete vs. incomplete)
**Number of affected relatives
**Sex affected (whether the person is of the sex opposite the most often affected)
**How closely the individual is related to the affected person)

==Multifactorial Inheritance and Genetic counseling==
*A condition that is caused by several genes and the environment
*Threshold model- baby inherits genes from both parents that increase the risk for cl/cp, then in combination with certain environmental factors the risk goes beyond the threshold level and the baby develops a cleft
*Although there are multiple genes involved 3 predisposing genes have been identified.
**Explaining this to parents:
***Children with cl/cp inherit genes in a random way from their parents
***Parents cannot control which genes they pass on
***Some of these genes contribute to facial development. We know that there are over 100 genes that contribute to the development of the lip and palate; there have been 3 genes found that we call predisposing genes- which means that in animal models we have been able to show that disruption or changes in this gene can lead to clefting.
***when the lip forms in early development, cells migrate together to close the lip
***Multiple genes tell those cells to move the way that they are supposed to
***It takes more than genetic factors for someone to develop a cleft
***Environmental factors play a big role.
***We know some of the factors that interact with genes to cause clefts (smoking, alcohol, some medications) but we don't know them all.
***There are some protective factors- folic acid
***Timing is important, the lip is completely closed by the 35th day of gestational development (medicine or other factors after this time wouldn't have an effect on the lip)
*Reassurance: you did everything within your control to have a healthy baby. Even if risk factors were present (smoking, drinking etc.) the mother should be reassured that even without these factors the baby could have been born with a cleft.
*Currently there is no way to guarantee that a baby isn't born with a cleft. The best thing to do in future pregnancies is to avoid smoking, drinking, and certain medications (anticonvulsants, retinoic acid), and to take folic acid periconceptionally.

==What's next?==
*Feeding issues? Make sure the baby is getting enough nutrition. Infants with isolated cleft lip (without cleft palate) seldom have problems feeding by breast or bottle.
*Surgery: objective- to close the lip to create a pleasing face that will develop normally with minimal scarring.
*Closure is performed when the baby is approximately 3 months old at weighs at least 10 pounds.
*Correction of the nasal deformity is usually performed at the time of the lip repair.
*Additional surgeries will be necessary to enhance the appearance of the lip and/or nose.
*Initial surgery lasts ~2-3 hours and the hospital stay is usually 2-4 days.
**During this time special considerations are necessary for feeding and positioning. Elbows are restrained from bending. Positioning the child in an infant seat prevents rolling over and injuring the lip/nose. No pacifiers or nipples allowed. Fed with a special syringe feeder with a soft tube. It takes about 3 weeks for the wound to heal enough to stop these special precautions.
**The lip scar is initially red and swollen, but begins to mature and improve in appearance in ~6 months.
*Isolated cleft lip- no expected problems with hearing or speech.
*Possible problems with teeth…there can be missing or crooked teeth in the area of the cleft.

==Follow up==
*Pediatrician for routine care
*Contact craniofacial team- referral made, scheduled for the Nov. infant/toddler meeting- letter has been sent.
*help with feeding, special bottles, positioning of the baby
*The craniofacial team has a psychologist that can help with the emotional concerns of having a child with a facial cleft. Interested in scheduling an appointment?
*Follow up with Dr. Billmier
*and Dental services?

==Contracting==
*Introduction
*Do you have any concerns or questions you would like us to address?
*Address any immediate concerns
*Discuss reasons for being followed by genetics
*Discuss how the genetics visit will include
**Asking some standard questions about his health
**Reviewing the family history

==Interim History==

==Family History==

==Psychosocial Assessment==

==Cleft Palate==
*Prevalence 1:2000 live births
*More likely to be associated with a syndrome than cleft lip with or without cleft palate
*At Super Duper Medical Center craniofacial team about 55% of children seen with cleft palate have underlying syndrome

==Etiology==
*Can be part of a sequence or syndrome
*Sequence - anomaly or pattern of anomalies that arise from a single known or presumed anomaly or mechanical factor (usually known sequence of events with one thing that triggered it)
*Syndrome - often due to an underlying genetic explanation or a common suspected cause for anomalies that are often associated with each other (often the characteristics are variable and often have multiple primary defects)

==Pierre Robin Sequence==
*Common cause of cleft palate (horseshoe shaped)
*Associated with an underlying syndrome in over 50% of cases
*Can occur in isolation
*Not a diagnosis, but more of a description of the pathogenesis of cleft palate
*Small jaw (micrognathia) due to interference of normal development of jaw at 9 wks
*Forces tongue to remain high and tongue gets in the way and keeps the palate or roof of the mouth from closing off completely

==Characteristics in Pierre Robin==
*Often born with tongues positioned posteriorly
*Can cause blockage of pharynx and airway (glossoptosis)
*Affects feeding and breathing

==Medical Management==
*Place in prone position so gravity allows tongue to fall forward
*Sometimes require nasopharyngeal airway (sometimes needed until 3-4 mths old)
*Some require tracheostomy (tube directly in trachea to bypass upper airway obstruction
*Usually in place until palate repair (about 14 mths ?)
*Prevents most vocalizations which can exacerbate speech issues in future
*Feeding difficulty occurs in most cases - difficulty coordinating breathing, sucking, swallowing
*May require nasogastric tube for feeding or a gastrostomy tube (g tube)
**FOR SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH PIERRE ROBIN ALSO SEE CHARTS ATTACHED

==Stickler Syndrome (possible differential)==
*Most common identifiable cause cleft palate
*AD disorder variable expressivity
*Heterogeneous
*At least 4 genes can cause
*Diagnosis made clinically

==Classic Phenotype==
*Pierre Robin Sequence
*Cleft palate
*Early onset osteoarthritis
*Myopia -- Can be severe most mod to high
*High risk for retinal detachments (follow close)
*Sensorineural hearing loss common (follow with serial audiograms)
*Facial Features
**Micrognathia in infancy
**Flat facial profile
**Epicanthal folds
**Midface hypoplasia
*Development usually typical
*No increased risk for LD
*Problems related to cleft, hearing loss, tracheostomy

==VCF (probably not as likely of a differential)==
*1 in 4000 live births
*deletion 22q11 in 90% of patients diagnosed
*most new deletions but 10-20% have affected parent
*highly variable characteristics
**most common --VPI
**second most common - cleft palate
**associated with Pierre Robin Sequence
**congenital heart defects most commonly conotruncal
*facial characteristics
**microcephaly
**narrow palpebral fissures
**wide nasal root
**bulbous nasal tip
**thin upper lip
**long face
**micrognathia
*many possible medical problems
*developmental disabilities

==Recurrance Risks==
*Vary depending on the diagnosis
*Pierre Robin Sequence 1-5% recurrence (ref #3)
*What do you and Dr. Saal quote?
*Stickler and VCF if new mutation than small risk probably 1%?
*If parent affected than 50% recurrence

==Support Group and Patient Info.==

*How have things been going since your last visit to genetics?
*What questions or concerns would you like to discuss today?
*Set agenda for session

==Etiology==
*Association of micrognathia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis
*Multiple anomalies caused secondarily by a structural anomaly
**Micrognathia or retrognathia at 9-11 weeks of embryonic development prevents tongue from descending from between palatal shelves
**Tongue prevents palatal shelves from growing together horizontally and fusing
**Causes tongue to be displaced, blocking airway
*About 80% of cases may be caused by a multiple anomaly syndrome
**34% of Pierre Robin due to Stickler syndrome
**Due to mutations in COL2A1 gene usually at 12q13
**Also could be due to mutations in COL11A1 (1p21) or COL11A2 (6p21)
**Autosomal dominant disorder with 50% recurrence risk
**11% of Pierre Robin due to VCF
**Deletion of 22q11
**Recurrence risk 50% if one parent has deletion
**Many other single gene disorders, some X-linked recessive disorders, recessive disorders
**Teratogenic exposure
**Fetal alcohol syndrome
**Fetal hydantion syndrome
**Retinoic acid embryopathy
*Isolated Pierre Robin sequence
**May be due to fetal crowding due to presence of multiple fetuses, abnormal fetal position, uterine anomalies, or oligohydramnios
**Associated deformities may also occur
**Multifactorial inheritance
**Recurrence risk if one child with cleft palate 3-5%
**Recurrence risk if two children with cleft palate 10-12%
**Affected individual has 3-5% chance of having a child with cleft palate
*Incidence is about 1/2500 births for cleft palate

==Clinical Features and Natural History==
*Craniofacial
**Often U-shaped cleft involving both hard and soft palate
**Small and symmetrically receded mandible
**May cause dental crowding
**Jaw may &quot;catch up&quot; in adolescence if due to mechanical constraint
**Flattened base of nose
*Growth and Feeding difficulties (long-term feeding problems 50%)
**Failure to thrive evident in neonatal period
**Poor suck due to cleft palate
**Inability to nurse, irritability, aspiration
**Often due to respiratory difficulties
*Respiratory complications
**Upper airway obstruction often present at birth or shortly after
**Deep pectus excavatum
**Cyanosis not common but may occur
**May be due to glossoptosis obstructing the epiglottis
**Complications of continuing airway disorder may include sudden death, failure to thrive, persistent deformation of sternum, decreased pulmonary function, cognitive effects of hypoxia
*Ears and Hearing
**Middle ear disease due to cleft palate
**Chronic ear infections may lead to conductive hearing loss
*Cognitive and motor development normal in isolated Pierre Robin sequence

==Testing Options==
*Genetic testing may be offered if genetic syndrome is suspected
**Chromosome analysis
**FISH for deletion of 22q11
**DNA testing for mutations in collagen genes indicated in Stickler syndrome
*Level II ultrasound prenatally at 18-20 weeks gestation for cleft palate but difficult to identify

==Management and Treatment==
*Overcoming feeding difficulties
**Important that baby learns to actively suckle
**Establish feeding routine that requires short feeding time
**Use special cleft palate nursing bottle
**Reflux may be treated with medication or regular breaks to burp
**May require NG tube or g-tube
*Cleft palate repaired surgically 9-18 months
**Weight, size of airway are factors in when surgery performed
**Must be sure lower jaw is wide enough to accommodate tongue once palate repaired
**Usually requires 1-3 day hospital stay
*Jaw distraction surgery now being performed on infants in some hospitals
*Tracheostomy may e required if severe airway issues
*Special services
**Speech therapy to prevent speech and language delays
**May require IEP from school or other services, particularly if caused by underlying genetic syndrome
*Chronic middle ear infections treated aggressively with antibiotics or PE tubes to avoid conductive hearing loss, speech and language delays

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Most commonly associated with VCF or Stickler syndrome
*Some other associated syndromes include Myotonic Dystrophy, Campomelic dysplasia, Lenz syndrome, Nager syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and Turner syndrome

==Psychosocial==
*Frustration, impatience due to feeding difficulties in newborns
*Difficulty relating to baby due to physical appearance, inability to breastfeed
*Guilt, anxiety, depression, anger about diagnosis
*Assess support system

      <text xml:space="preserve">Traditionally, unbleached linen thread is the preferred material for bookbinding, but unbleached long-staple cotton will do almost as well. The key is that it is a natural fiber comparable in expected lifetime to the paper and the cover material, and that it have very long fibers, giving it great strength.  For less traditional projects, carpet thread, strong nylon thread, or even waxed dental floss can also be used.

The thread should be heavy, heavy enough that you might be as likely to call it fine cordage as you are to call it heavy thread! Thread diameters of close to a millimeter (when uncompressed and not under tension) are quite reasonable. The thread should compress to about 1/2 millimeter when successive turns are wrapped tightly around a pencil.

Before you start sewing, it helps (but is not strictly necessary) to wax the thread with beeswax. To do this, clamp the thread against a block of beeswax with your thumb and pull it through with your other hand. The thread will tend to cut a slot in the wax, so keep changing the angle of pull to even out the wear on the wax. Do this two or three times with the full length of thread before you start sewing.

== Do we need all the deltas ==

I know it is technically correct to put a delta ''every'' time there is a change - but I feel that this makes this otherwise very useful reference MUCH harder to use quickly. Could they please be toned down a bit! [[User:Conrad.Irwin|Conrad.Irwin]] 08:58, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

Someone said that these sections should be added to this book, opposed to having their own books... at least until they are large enough.

--[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 05:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)



I realized that this book was, in some ways, acting as an index to established mythological books, and in other ways acting as a base of writing for new mythological books. I have created a policy statement on the front page to reflect that attitude. That is: if the subject of a culture's mythology has large enough content here, it should be separated into a new book. I believe that
#This statement reflects previous actions in the organization of this book
#This is a wise policy to follow, as to avoid having books within books, and to avoid created dozens of books which others have not shown the will to work on.
Although there are many books out there which are stubs, I see no reason to turn current mythology stubs into new books. Book stubs, although inevitable in some cases, are not desirable, and it is fine to keep a culture's mythology as a module until it grows enough content to be appropriate as a book. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 02:09, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

I am changing the wording from &quot;will be subject to deletion&quot; to &quot;might be subject to deletion&quot;. My idea is that most NPOV violations should be left for eventual editing instead of deleted. Also, they probably are not speedy-deletion candidates (unless they also violate [[WB:WIW]]) so [[WB:VFD]] might vote to keep the page.

Actually, [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] suggests that NPOV violations should be edited, not deleted. But [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]] describes {[tl|npov}} (which redirects here) as a temporary state. The only alternative to an eventual edit is an eventual deletion.

This template happens to be a good demonstration of includeonly and noinclude tags. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:33, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

''See also [[Wikibooks talk:Deletion policy#Impending Doom Template]]''

I am adding a link to [[WB:WIW]] to this template. When the staff lounge discussion is archived, the link to [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] would be removed from this template. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:40, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Jimbo Wales]] reverted the wording from &quot;might be deleted&quot; to &quot;will be deleted&quot;. This is not a problem for [[TTY2006]] (so far), but [[Jokebook]], the other book that uses this template, is still in [[WB:VFD]]. Currently, voters are leaning toward deletion but there are still some significant keep votes.

So, use {{tlx|Impending Doom}} with {{tlx|vfd}} for books in [[WB:VFD]] when most votes are to delete, but voting is not closed. Books less likely to be deleted use {{tl|vfd}} only, while books more likely to be deleted are already deleted. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:54, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

== golden ratio wave mechanics and hydrogen:clue to constructive charge collapse and therefore gravity? ==

It is clear that planck length times powers of golden ratio
virtually precisely predicts multiple hydrogen radii
www.goldenmean.info/goldenproof

evidence suggests golden ratio may be the most generalized solution to constructive wave interference
www.goldenmean.info/matrix

and as such play a fundamental role in the 'cause' of gravity?

It's kinda good because it starts with the assumption that the plant has a simpler life cycle and the story discovers alternation of generations and explains it.

:Can you write it up?

Also, the article on Nori in wikipedia says that some edible seaweed products incorportate blue green algae- how can that be true?

:It is true that some blue-greens are grown in aquaculture to produce a number of products, perhaps best known being a food supplement known as ''Spirolina''.  There a very few cyanobacteria regarded even marginally as &quot;seaweeds&quot;, and none I'm aware of are worth eating, so I'm not sure what the statement is alluding to. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 17:43, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

:Yes, I would agree.  That might be helpful. One reason modules are not numbered (just titled) is to provide flexibility.  I would just have to fix the ToC to fit in a new chapter - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 17:37, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

So far I have been throwing in my evolutionary side notes here and not in wikipedia articles, because they define inbetween articles- but maybe there should be something about a vascular cambium in the gymnosperm article. Or maybe a pre-gymnosperm article. [[User:66.41.66.213|66.41.66.213]] 20:52, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basics ==

Good tone production has a lot of factors in it when playing the clarinet. All the factors this book has already talked about are what create a good tone, but there's still more to think about when trying to create a good sound.  All of this stuff might seem overwhelming, but it is not meant to be learned all at once, just try taking these ideas one at a time.  Soon you will not have to think about it, and by that time you'll know that you'll be ready for the more advanced steps.

== Tight and correct embouchure ==
Keep your embouchure loose, pucker your chin muscles to make a nice flat chin, this is super important for quality tone production. Sometimes using a mirror will help you keep your embouchure positioned correctly.


High and backward tongue positioning
Make a toooo sound with the clarinet in your mouth, to do so notice that your tongue is positioned low and backward to make the sound. This is the way your tongue should be positioned at all times throughout the clarinet register. Doing this will slow down the air, and aim the air flow at the reed so that it will vibrate more steadily, resulting in a steady and velvety tone output. This is the real deal for proper tone production; this is really the most important aspect in clarinet tone production along with air support from the diaphragm and good embouchure.

== Student Tips ==
Make sure you sit up straight, and if you can't get a sound out try a note higher, look for leaks, or if you are a beginner, try and get a squeak out of your clarinet's mouth piece. If none of these work talk to your local band director or take it to a music store. A size 2 or 2.5 reed is recommended for beginners.

==Good Posture==
Sit at the end of your chair; back straight and feet flat on the floor for the best tone quality.

==Reed Hardness==
Use the correct reed hardness. Reed hardness is measured on a scale from one to five. Reed strength does not say how good you are.

==Mouth Piece==
The mouth piece that came with your clarinet is probably of less than superb quality. Invest in a good rubber mouth piece that will cost around $10.

==Develop your mouth==
As you progress in becoming a clarinetist, your mouth muscles will become stronger, allowing you to play the instrument with better tone. Also, tightening up your embouchure  might help as well.

==Fast Air==
Always use fast air with the air coming from the diaphragm.

[[Image:Likecameras.jpg|thumb|right|Missy Cougar at Tiger Touch likes cameras ... really.]]
Captive management of big cats is part of a strategy to keep endangered species from becoming extinct.  It also provides a source of education and inspiration to zoo visitors and helps us study what these cats need to survive and thrive.  What follows is from an interview with John Burkitt of [http://tigertouch.org Tiger Touch], a non-profit organization that keeps cats.

==The Four Types of Fitness==
Once zoos were terrible places for big cats.  Their needs were poorly understood, and therefore poorly met.  Today we understand that there are four types of fitness, all equally important.  ''Physical Fitness'' is more than basic life support.  Animals evolved in a complex environment, and meeting their whole range of needs makes their life longer and better.  ''Mental Fitness'' is as important in captivity as it is in the wild.  It promotes natural social behavior within and between species and reduces neurotic behaviors such as pacing and self-injury.  ''Emotional Fitness'' is the cornerstone of a humane, trusting partnership between man and animal.  When we bring life into the world, we owe it happiness and contentment.  ''Moral Fitness'' is a clear understanding of rules and expectations by man and animal that promotes trust, minimizes stress, reduces accidents, and helps cooperation.

==Safety==
[[Image:Likelove.jpg|thumb|left|Missy Cougar also likes love ... really.]]
Ideally, safety is guaranteed for the animals, their staff, and the visiting public.  The animals are protected as well as possible against items thrown over the fence that may injure the cats or be eaten.  When big cats eat the wrong sort of objects, such as toys or bottle fragments, it causes potentially deadly blockages of the intestines.  The staff is protected by the use of &quot;lockouts&quot; and &quot;air locks&quot;.  &quot;Lockouts&quot; are areas where big cats can be confined while someone performs maintenance on their living area.  It is the only safe way to remove wastes, cut grass, remove foreign objects, or repair fixtures.  &quot;Air Locks&quot; are small chambers with a door on each end that allow people to enter and exit a cat enclosure without having an opening clear to the outside at any one moment.  People come in the outer door, close it behind them, then open the inner door to enter the cat enclosure.  At no time can a cat push past the keeper and escape.  Guard rails around certain exhibits keep visitors at least five feet (1.8 meters) away from the animal's outer fence at all times.  This prevents people from being tempted to touch animals through the mesh or bars and get injured.  Such injuries are more often fatal to the cat than to the visitor since most states require the animal to be killed and tested for rabies if the victim refuses to take precautionary rabies vaccination shots.  ''Zoo visitors that follow the rules are completely safe.''  One less obvious safety feature of zoos and animal parks are the off-hours security systems that protect the animals against nighttime intruders.  Motion sensors, infrared cameras, and perimeter fences prevent people from disturbing the animals after hours.  Finally, the animals are usually confined to smaller areas during off hours, and only released into their large enclosures shortly before opening time.

==Species Survival Plans==
One function of zoos is to provide safe places where endangered animals can breed.  To be effective in producing healthy cats that are ''genetically diverse'' (born to unrelated parents), zoos will often ship animals long distances to find mates that would make a good match.  If you let closely related cats have offspring together, their young would be considered ''inbred'', which means they don't have a healthy mix of different backgrounds in their physical makeup.  Inbred animals are prone to be sick or even die.  Computer technology helps zoos be sure which animals would make the best mates for each other and avoid inbreeding.

Animals used in a Species Survival Plan are sometimes taken out of the public viewing areas for a private, less stressful area to breed and care for their offspring in the first critical weeks.  Usually you can tell if animals on display in a zoo are involved in an SSP because there will be a sign posted on their enclosure.

One of the most important differences in zoos today from zoos long ago is that they are more than just living museums.  They are also valuable partners in the battle to save endangered species.

==Food Preparation==
[[Image:Tuckingin.jpg|thumb|right|A tiger eating and &quot;tucking in&quot; at a zoo.]]
Food has to be wholesome and free from disease and parasites.  It may be meat, a prepared diet such as ZuPreem or Mazuri, or a combination of both.  Food is served raw to prevent nutrient loss from cooking.  Additives make up for the loss of calcium and micronutrients available in regular prey.  Finally as part of good animal husbandry, food is individually prepared for each animal based on weight control and medication needs.

==Veterinary Care==
Like all other animals in captivity, zoo animals require occasional trips to the vet.  The veterinarians that handle zoo animals are specially trained in ''exotic medicine'', the diseases and conditions of animals not usually kept as pets.  Veterinary care usually is done at the zoo in a special health care building that has the special equipment needed to fill cavities in a tiger's teeth or perform surgery on a lion.

==The Nursery==
When, for one reason or another, the parents of young big cats cannot raise their own offspring, the cubs and kittens are sent to a nursery where specially trained zoo staff and volunteers provide them with the food, stimulation, and affection.  Young cats of all species cannot properly pass solid wastes on their own.  A warm, wet washrag or sponge is used to wipe the backside of kittens and cubs to stimulate them to pass wastes, something they usually do in the wild when their mother cleans them with her tongue.  Proper nursing is especially important: cubs and kittens are never given milk while they are lying on their back.  This can cause pneumonia.  The milk given to cats is different than the milk given to human children in a number of ways.  Zoo personnel know the right way to mix milk for the different species of large and small cats in their care.  Temperature is carefully controlled since these young animals are not as good at controlling their body temperature as are adults.

==Enrichment==
[[Image:Nalaplaying.jpg|thumb|left|A lioness plays with a bucket.]]
Keeping animals happy as well as healthy is a challenge.  The best way is a combination of several things: physical interaction with others of its own kind or specially-trained human companions, desirable features in the enclosure such as swimming pools and ledges for perching and sleeping, and toys to play with.  Sometimes food is hidden about or put on ropes where it can be jerked away to stimulate chase, hunt, and play behaviors and reduce boredom.  Many zoo animals are fond of visitors and develop routines to impress the people that come to see them.  Large, natural enclosures give the animals more freedom of movement and encourage physical activity.

==Training==
While most modern zoos do not teach animals to perform &quot;tricks&quot;, they do train animals to respond to certain commands to make them safer to handle, move and examine. This training emphasizes rewards for good behavior rather than punishment for bad behavior. Using the reward system not only makes training easier and more humane, it avoids the ever-present danger that an angry cat may find a chance to lash out at its tormentor. That only needs to happen once briefly for tragedy to occur.

==End of Life Issues==
Although it is unpleasant to think about, death is a part of life.  When a decision is made by the zoo staff that a certain cat is in too much pain to have a good life, the life of that cat is humanely ended.  The phrase ''put to sleep'' or ''put down'' is not accurate and does not confer the dignity that usually accompanies the act.  Zookeepers almost always experience grief when one of their long-term friends dies.  Whenever possible, someone the cat loves is allowed to be with them as the drug is administered.  This special drug is designed to calm the cat and lull it to sleep before death occurs.  After death has been certified by the veterinarian, a necropsy (animal autopsy) is performed to determine the exact cause of the animal's illness or injury.  This information is used to help protect other animals.  Many zoos, and most sanctuaries and animal parks, have special plots where beloved animals are laid to rest.  These are rarely open to the public.  Animals that are not buried are usually cremated (burned) for health reasons or used to provide skeletons and skins for educational use at the zoo or in museums and universities.

Tagalog today is written in the Latin alphabet.  However, in the past, it was written using Baybayin.  While this article will cover mostly the Latin alphabet and its history, a brief history on Baybayin will also be covered.

==Ang Baybayín (Baybayin)==
Baybayin, was the old Tagalog alphabet that is a direct descendant of Kavi, the script used to write Old Javanese.  The alphabet contained seventeen letters where three letters (the vowels a,e/i,o/u) were considered double-use.  Related scripts include the Kulitan, Hanunóo, Buhid, and Tagbanwa scripts and the script was used in the past to write the Ilocano and Pangasinan languages.


[[Image:Baybayin_alpha.jpg|center]]


Each letter has a vowel sound.  By default, Baybayin letters are consonants ending with the vowel &quot;A&quot;.  To produce another vowel sound, a special mark (known as a ''kudlít'') was placed either on the top of the letter (for &quot;E&quot; and &quot;I&quot; sounds) or on the bottom (for &quot;O&quot; and &quot;U&quot; sounds).  The kudlít does not apply to stand-alone vowels, as they have their own letters.


[[Image:Baybayin_sample_01.jpg|center]]


In the original form, stand-alone consonants (consonants without the vowel sound) could not be formed.  This was particularly hard for Spanish friars, who were working on translating books into Tagalog.  In 1620, Father Francisco Lopez rectified the problem by inventing his own kudlít in the form of a cross sign (&quot;+&quot;) that removed the vowel sound.  The kudlít functions exactly the same way the virama functions in the Devanagari script used to write Hindi. This is called TAGALOG SIGN VIRAMA by Unicode.


[[Image:Baybayin_sample_02.jpg|center]]


Baybayin eventually died out as the Latin alphabet introduced by the Spanish continued to be imposed in the colonial era.

==Ang Alpabetong Latino (The Latin alphabet)==
The Latin alphabet gained prominence as the Spanish continued their colonization and evangelization of the Philippines.  During those times, Tagalog was written in various ways using Spanish orthography, one of the most popular being the Abecedario, using all Spanish letters at the time. 

A sample of the Spanish letters is as follows:

::A, B, C, Ch, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L, Ll, M, N, Ñ, N͠g, O, P, Q, R, Rr, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

After Spanish rule, two alphabet standards were used: the Abakada and the Alpabetong Filipino

===Abakada===
Abakada was devised during the American colonial era by Lope K. Santos, a linguist and one of the brainchilds of the national language.  He devised an alphabet with twenty letters, directly derived from the letters of Baybayin and pronounced in the same way.

The new alphabet contained the following letters:

::A, B, K, D, E, G, H, I, L, M, N, Ng, O, P, R, S, T, U, W, Y

At that time, other phonemes that would be included much later in additions of the alphabet did not exist yet.  This especially was the focus of languages such as Pilipino, where the emphasis was to use pure Tagalog (which uses the phonemes listed above) before word borrowings even took place.

===Alpabetong Filipino===
In 1973, the National Language Institute adopted Abakada and later, in 1976, expanded the alphabet as the need for borrowed words arose.  The alphabet then contained 31 letters, using the entire Spanish alphabet and the ''ng'' of Tagalog.  In practice, however, the digraphs ''ch'', ''ll'' and ''rr'' were considered as two separate letters.

In 1987, those digraphs were dropped and the alphabet was reduced to today's 28 letters.

==Ang alpabeto ngayón (The alphabet today)==
Today, Tagalog is written using the Alpabetong Filipino.  However, many dictionaries still use Abakada.

The alphabet today uses the following letters:

However, consonants in Abakada are pronounced as they were in Baybayin (Ba, Ka, Da, etc.).  The letter &quot;Ñ&quot; is pronounced the same way as it is in Spanish.

Below is a table of the modern Tagalog alphabet.  There are two pronunciation columns: one for pronunciation in Abakada and the other for pronunciation in the Alpabetong Filipino.  The fourth column is the sound column, to approximate with English.  If there are no notes in the notes column, the letter is written and/or is pronounced the same way as its English equivalent.

== Palatuldikan (Diacritics)==
{{main|Tagalog/Lesson 13}}

Diacritics are normally not written in everyday usage, be it in publications or personal correspondence. The teaching of diacritics is inconsistent in Filipino schools and many Filipinos do not know how to use them. However, diacritics are normally used in dictionaries and in textbooks aimed at teaching the languages to foreigners.

There are three kinds of diacritics used in Tagalog:

;Acute accent or ''pahilís'' : Used to indicate primary or secondary stress on a particular syllable; ''talagá''. It is usually omitted on words that are stressed on the penultimate (second to last) syllable; ''umága = umaga''. It is possible that there is more than one stressed syllable in a word, meaning that that ''pahilís'' mark may appear multiple times, as in ''Repúbliká''. If there is no diacritic on the last two syllables of a word, then it means that there is stress on the penultimate syllable; ''kásayahan'' is actually stressed on two syllables: ''&lt;u&gt;ká&lt;/u&gt;sa&lt;u&gt;ya&lt;/u&gt;han''.

;Grave accent or ''paiwà'' : It indicates that there is a glottal stop (/ʔ/) at the end of the word; ''akalà''. This mark may only appear at the end of a word that ends in a vowel. This mark does not indicate stress. Therefore, following the previously stated rule on stress, ''akalà'' is stressed on the second to the last syllable: ''a&lt;u&gt;ka&lt;/u&gt;là''.

;Circumflex accent or ''pakupyâ'' : It indicates that the final syllable of a word receives stress while there is a glottal stop (/ʔ/) that follows; ''sampû''. This is because it is a combination of the ''pahilís'' and ''paiwà'' marks. This mark may only appear at the end of a word that ends in a vowel. ''dálitâ = &lt;u&gt;dá&lt;/u&gt;li&lt;u&gt;tâ&lt;/u&gt;''

== Overview ==

'''''Disappearing Cabinets''''' or '''''Vanishing Cabinets''''' are cabinets into which you put things, and the things then disappear, normally reappearing somewhere else.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see a Vanishing Cabinet, though it is not identified as such, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|chapter 4]], &lt;i&gt;At Flourish And Blotts&lt;/i&gt; of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'': [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has ended up in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin and Burkes]] after a slight mishap with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo powder]], and has to hide to avoid [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|his father]]. The place he chooses to hide is &quot;a large black cabinet&quot;.

Another Vanishing Cabinet appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|chapter 8]], &lt;i&gt;The Deathday Party&lt;/i&gt;, of the same book. Here, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] has convinced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] to drop a large black and gold cabinet just above [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch's]] office, in hopes of distracting Filch from punishing Harry for some infraction. Filch identifies the artifact at that time as &quot;a very valuable Vanishing Cabinet&quot;.

== Analysis ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Apparently the above two cabinets are linked. After repairing the Hogwarts cabinet, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] uses the cabinets to allow Death Eaters into Hogwarts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|his 6th year]].

The question has been raised, why does Harry not get transported to Hogwarts when he hides inside the cabinet in Borgin and Burke's, in his second year? The Hogwarts cabinet is not dropped until later that year, so it should have simply transported him there. The answer is extremely simple: Harry never completely closed the door of the cabinet he was hiding in. From [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]: &quot;he shot inside it and pulled the doors to, leaving a small crack to peer through.&quot; He was able to see what was going on in the shop throughout Malfoy's visit, and so the doors must have stayed open that one small crack until Harry was finally able to sneak out of the shop. If he had ever closed the doors completely, likely he would have ended up at Hogwarts.

One of the things that is stressed over and over is that Hogwarts is &quot;unplottable&quot;, that it cannot be put on a map, and that you cannot [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|apparate]] to or within it. Additionally, both in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] it is mentioned that there are spells preventing entrance via any means save the gates, which in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' are guarded by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], and in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' by locks that can be opened only by professors. Much of the action in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' involves the secret ways in and out of the castle, and we as an audience are left with the impression that all such passageways are known. The Disappearing Cabinets are a way around this protection that has not as yet been guarded against.

There are two main sub-themes to the series; one, of course, is the issue of pure-blood versus muggle and the nature of prejudice. A second, less stressed theme is the idea of just consequences: Draco Malfoy tries to Jinx Harry in the Entrance Hall and is punished by being turned into a ferret; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] are playing with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Blood Blisterpod|Blood Blisterpod]]s and get into trouble when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] gets an incurable nose bleed; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] is sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the battle in the Ministry]] and so forth. Every now and again Fred and George do something mischievous but harmful, as when they &quot;push [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] into the old broken vanishing cabinet on the second floor&quot; in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and then don't get into trouble for it; however, in this case, this leads indirectly to Dumbledore's death, as it is while Montague is trapped in the vanishing cabinet that he discovers that it is connected to the one in Borgin and Burke's. Montague passes this information on to Draco Malfoy, who makes use of it as we have already seen.

An '''electric vehicle conversion''' is the modification of a conventional internal [[w:en:Internal_combustion_engine internal|combustion engine]] (ICE) driven vehicle to [[w:en:battery_(electricity)|battery]] [[w:en:Electricity|electric]] propulsion, creating a [[w:en:Battery_electric_vehicle|battery electric vehicle]]. Much of the information in this article is also applicable to the design and construction of electric vehicles from materials and components, as is commonly done by hobbyists assembling [[w:en:kit_car|kit cars]] with ICE engines.

{{Electric Vehicle Conversion/Index}}

{{subpages}}

== Introduction and disclaimers ==
While some conversions of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have been performed by major automobile manufacturers in the United States, all such programs have been terminated due to (to quote the manufacturers) &quot;lack of consumer demand&quot; for these vehicles.  A few specialty rebuilders offer new or remanufactured conversions  to  satisfy a rather limited demand. The demand is low primarily due to the costs of completed vehicles, which are up to twice that of a comparable ICE vehicle. Some of these are built on new vehicles, purchased from the original equipment manufacturer but without the various ICE components. 

This article is concerned mainly with the hobbyist conversion of ICE vehicles to electric propulsion. It is not intended to be a complete instruction manual, but rather a general guide to performing your own conversions and for purchasing or modifying an EV conversion. Some representative types of vehicle conversions will be presented.

For those not interested in conducting their own electric vehicle conversion, there are many electric vehicle conversions specialists throughout the United States.

In this article &quot;''electric vehicle''&quot; (EV) refers to various hobby conversions,  not to high-end manufactured vehicles. Also, only technologies available to the hobbyist are considered in depth.

Branded products may be illustrated where such are commonly used in EV conversions. This should not be considered to be promotional or an endorsement, which otherwise might be considered to be in violation of Wikibooks policy.

&lt;big&gt;''Note the presence of '''hazardous materials and conditions''' that must be approached with proper precautions and procedures to avoid damaging, injurious, or even fatal consequences.''&lt;/big&gt;

==Why have an electric vehicle?==

The greatest fans of electric vehicles are those who have obtained and used them. Owing to the fact that electric vehicles have not been promoted by the major manufacturers in the United States, this is a self-selected group, so their enthusiasm may be misleading. Fans point out the following:

*Range is adequate if not the only vehicle in household or if long commutes are not required. Fans point out that most trips in non-commute vehicles are for shopping, school drop-off/pick-up, visiting, and other  errands within a 10 to 20 mile (15 to 30 km) radius. Long range is simply not needed for such trips and an operating range of 30 to 40 miles (50 to 65 km) is quite sufficient.

*Fueling at home requires but seconds to plug in for overnight charging followed by a few extra moments in the morning.  Some find this to be more convenient than driving to obtain gasoline whose availability and cost is less predictable.

*The homeowner can install on-grid solar photovoltaic rooftop power or residential wind generation and so produce most of the energy required for personal transportation with zero pollution.  Since the vehicles can be charged during low demand times the photovoltaics provide a larger societal benefit by helping to satisfy local peak demand, greatly reducing overall pollution and reducing transmission line loads. Additional benefits can also flow to the user through time sensitive pricing/payback schemes, significantly reducing the cost of a system that will support transportation needs. Once a commitment to producing power is made it becomes an easy decision to commit to producing all household and local transportation power needs. Thus there is a societal benefit from electric vehicles beyond transportation.

*Electric vehicles are quiet. Even if not completely silent, they do not produce the low frequency rumble that can easily penetrate household walls and windows.

*Owners take pride in the non-polluting nature of their vehicles. Some point out that knowing that your vehicle is non-polluting quickly leads to a realization how stinky and noxious even modern, well tuned non-electric vehicles actually are &amp;mdash; something that tends to be ignored when you are part of the problem.

*Some EV fans with a left of center political bias or of a &quot;green&quot; inclination claim that when combined with household photovoltaics, electric vehicle users are not assisting (through their fuel purchases) despotic governments in oil-rich countries, nor the politically powerful companies that prepare and distribute their products, nor the politically powerful coal interests, nor the domestic politicians that serve and protect these companies and countries. Many electric vehicle owners and operators express great satisfaction in this aspect of electric vehicle use, even while acknowledging that this use can have only little effect on these matters unless adopted more widely and produced in greater quantities.

*Some EV fans with a right of center political bias believe that EVs will free the country from foreign sources of energy to ones domestically produced.  This can make a country less strategically dependent on non-democratic oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia. 

*Some USA EV fans have accused the three major domestic manufacturers, [[w:en:General_Motors|General Motors]], [[w:en:Chrysler_Corporation|Chrysler Corporation]] and [[w:en:Ford_Motor_Company|Ford Motor Company]] of deliberately [[w:en:Sabotage|sabotaging]] their own electric vehicle efforts through several methods: failing to market, failing to produce appropriate vehicles, failing to satisfy demand, and using lease-only programs with prohibitions against end of lease purchase. They also point to the Chrysler &quot;golf cart&quot; program as an insult to the marketplace and to mandates, accusing Chrysler of intentionally failing to produce a vehicle usable in mixed traffic conditions. The manufacturers, in their own defense, have responded that they only make what the public wants.  Of the various electric vehicles marketed by the &quot;Big Three&quot;, only the [[w:en:General_Motors_EV1|General Motors EV1]] (manufactured by GM) and the [[w:en:Th!nk_City|Th!nk City]] (imported and marketed by Ford) came close to being appropriate configurations for a mass market. However, at the end of their programs GM destroyed its fleet, to avoid the continuing expense necessary to continue to provide maintenance and support for these vehicles. Ford's Norwegian-built &quot;Th!nk&quot; fleet was covered by a three-year exemption to the standard U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety laws, after which time Ford had planned to dismantle and recycle its fleet; the company was, however, persuaded by the Norwegian Government and others to not destroy its fleet but return them to Norway and sell them as used vehicles. Ford also sold a few lead-acid battery [[w:en:Ford_Ranger_EV|Ranger EVs]] and has allowed a small percentage of lease returns into a limited market (after crushing and destroying 90 percent of the fleet, without saving any components), and some fleet purchase Chevrolet S-10 EV pickups are being refurbished and sold on the secondary market.

*Both Honda and Toyota also manufactured electric only vehicles. Honda followed the lead of the other majors and terminated their lease-only programs. Toyota offered vehicles for both sale and lease. While Toyota has terminated manufacture of new vehicles it continues to support those manufactured and is allowing for some institutional lease returns to be placed in the marketplace. It is actually possible to see a [[w:en:Toyota_RAV4_EV|RAV-4 EV]] on the road but this is indeed a rare sight.

==Why convert or purchase a converted ICE to get an electric vehicle?==

In [[w:en:Europe|Europe]] and some parts of [[w:en:Asia|Asia]] vehicle buyers have the choice of ICE or electric - it is actually possible to obtain reliable, well engineered and road-worthy electric vehicles and to have them maintained by a dealer. Other than for a beginning market for [[w:en:Neighborhood electric vehicle|Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs)]], is not possible in the United States for economic, political, and market-restraint reasons.&lt;!--See large format NiMH battery issues--&gt; Nor is it possible for a person to easily import a new electric vehicle from Europe or Asia. Certain restrictive safety regulations (such as the requirement for [[w:en:safety_glass|safety glass]] rather than [[w:en:tempered_glass|tempered glass]] in windshields, [[w:en:airbag|airbag]] requirements, lighting regulations, plus the destructive testing by barrier collisions all operate to inhibit the use of offshore manufactured vehicles. In contrast there are few restrictions on the personal conversion of an ICE vehicle to BEV (battery electric vehicle). This anomaly is distinctly cultural in English speaking North America and is emblematic of a dichotomy in the American  [[w:en:politics|political]] [[w:en:Psyche_(psychology)|psyche]]: On the one hand, social and political pressures force the government to protect consumers in the marketplace from exploitation by corporations and large corporations prefer legislation that restricts the entry of new players into the marketplace, while the preservation of individual freedom to tinker in one's garage or workshop is considered sacred, being in the spirit of great inventors such as [[w:en:Thomas_A._Edison|Edison]] and the [[w:en:Wright_brothers|Wright brothers]]. 

Note that battery technology is rapidly improving in cost/performance ratios due to the use of batteries in ICE-electric [[w:en:hybrid_vehicle|hybrid vehicles]]. The EV that is converted today will be upgradeable by future battery (and perhaps charger) replacement.

== Recent history of the electric vehicle in [[w:en:California|California]] ==
Beginning in the 1990s, the California Air Resources Board was looking for a way to combat air pollution and when General Motors began work with their EV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; it caught the attention of the Air Resources Board ([[Jananne Sharpless]], [[Who Killed the Electric Car]] Interview). They also saw that the state was spending over $5 billion on air pollution-related illness. There was also a study done in 1989 that reported one out of four 18- to 25-year-olds had severe to moderate lung lesions. The Resources board eventually passed a mandate that stated by 2003, 10% of all vehicles sold in the state would be zero emission vehicles (ZEV).  Toyota, Honda, General Motors, Ford, and Nissan all built limited production runs of battery-powered vehicles.  For a variety of reasons; some say lack of advertising from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), others say the lack of purchase (they were only available by closed-end leases); still others say that the limited production runs kept costs too high to make them affordable by the average buyer.  Almost all of the leased cars were collected at the end of their lease and then destroyed, despite the protestations of willing buyers.  The CARB charter was not necessarily intended to drive up the production of electric vehicles, but rather to reduce air pollution. The manufacturers successfully argued for changes to the rules. The CARB specifications were modified from zero emissions to an equivalent emission reduction by the mandated production of very low emission vehicles, [[w:en:SULEV|SULEVs]] (SUper Low Emission Vehicles)&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; vehicles producing about one tenth the previously mandated emission levels. This effectively created a hole in the mandate, because the U.S. Federal Government is the only governing body allowed to &quot;mandate&quot; MPG; these are called CAFE standards, they also have not changed (until 2008) since the oil embargo of the 1970s. Later on, GM, followed by DaimlerChrysler and several dealerships, would sue CARB. It would not be until the Federal government would come on board, as well as the Bush administration, to help kill the electric car. Not much later, President Bush would commit more than a billion dollars to hydrogen fuel cells, while totally ignoring current and past 170-year-old EV technology, established by analysis to be far more efficient source-to-sink than the proposed hydrogen schemes.

==Attitude==
In general, you should not attempt to maintain and operate a &quot;home made&quot; electric vehicle unless you have some interest and perhaps at least modest skills concerning mechanical and electric devices. Such skills are difficult to come by in many states due to the generally low volume of shop and industrial arts classes in current intermediate and high school programs. However, if you are the kind of person who will at least take apart a malfunctioning small appliance, and can sometimes at least identify the problem (e.g., needs regreasing or new motor brushes) you should have little problem with maintaining an EV.

A professionally built conversion will often be designed to be ignored, being engineered, constructed, and tested to survive with only minor maintenance on the operator's part and regular charging, combined with a regular professionally performed maintenance schedule. On the other hand, a non-professional conversion will probably require regular inspections of details like battery and motor electrical and mechanical connections, security of auxiliary systems, and inspection of wires and cables for chafing and loose connectors in order to avoid more extensive problems. While these tasks do not require a large amount of time, this time is more than is usually required of a conventional internal combustion vehicle, where tasks such as oil changes can be purchased as a service.

==Operating costs==
The direct operating costs will generally be confined to expenses for tires, battery replacement, battery water (where required), and electricity for recharging. Although the cost of electricity for charging these vehicles is generally much less than the cost of fuel for ICE vehicles, the cost of battery replacement can be very high.  In general, the overall cost per mile for an EV&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; including periodic battery replacement&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; may be greater or less that for a conventional ICE vehicle of similar size and performance, depending largely upon the battery type used. For example, if the cost of electricity is (US) $0.12/kWh, the battery pack costs $1200 to replace (a low cost based upon the lowest cost technology), and lasts 20,000 miles (an optimistic number when using lead-acid batteries), and the vehicle uses 400 Wh/mile (a rather high number), the combined cost per mile will be ($960+$1200)/(20,000&amp;nbsp;miles), or less than $0.11/mile, comparable to an ICE vehicle getting 25 mpg at a fuel cost of $2.75 per gallon. This does not count avoided costs, such as engine oil changes (about $0.01/mile), smog inspections (about $0.002/mile), and various repairs required to maintain smog certification (which can be costly on an older ICE vehicle, probably between $0.005 and $0.015 per mile ), so the costs are currently roughly comparable at current fuel prices. With more expensive gasoline or the use of more expensive but longer lasting batteries, the costs further favor the electric conversion in the long run.

Since converted vehicles are usually of an older vehicle, such vehicles may need other maintenance due to accumulated wear, perhaps wheel bearings, brakes rotors or drums, brake pads or shoes, suspension bushings and the like, and other components that are not usually replaced, but keep the vehicle up to date and show pride in ownership such as upholstery, door seals, and body paint. Such work is generally not cost effective in an ICE vehicle if performed by hire, while an interested hobbyist may do much work at quite modest cost and obtain substantial enjoyment in learning and performing various craft skills.

While a worn ICE vehicle of comparable condition would be simply scrapped, you will likely want to maintain and even improve your conversion, so you should consider maintenance (and even ''improvement'') expenses to be a normal part of maintaining an older vehicle. A more common vehicle may be cheaper to maintain when in the seven to twenty year age range than a rare, special interest, or very old vehicle due to the availability of low cost usable parts from automotive recycling yards. Some special interest vehicles have enabled the creation of a robust secondary parts market, although such vehicles are generally best left as ICE vehicles, unless especially suitable for conversion to electric power.

==Skills needed==
A wide range of skills is needed by a converter of a vehicle. Fortunately, there will often be fellow EV enthusiasts in an area that are willing and able to assist the novice builder. Although skill is needed but there should be a willingness along with a team of professionally qualified engineers. 

===Automobile survey===
A builder should be able to identify problems in a potential conversion vehicle. These are the same skills required to identify and purchase a good used ICE vehicle and are especially useful if a conversion (complete or partial) is purchased from another builder. Note that it may be possible to purchase a used EV conversion that only needs batteries - the owner may want to build another vehicle using the proceeds from the sale of an earlier conversion but not wish to invest in new batteries for a vehicle about to be sold. A careful survey of such a vehicle will go beyond that stated above as it is very important that latent electrical defects be identified and corrected, e.g.: the presence of chafing points in the electrical system that could lead to short circuits and an awareness of the possible  necessity for the addition of primary or secondary electrical and operational safety equipment and circuits.

===Basic mechanics===
A builder should be able to fabricate small brackets for mounting sensors, switches, and relays. This can be done using simple hand tools - a small vice, hacksaw, shears, hammer, pliers, and various drills and files.

===Machine shop skills===
Most machining requires expensive equipment and extensive skills. Machine shop skills will not be needed if the converter can obtain &quot;off the shelf&quot; components (components made to order from known specifications). In the case of exotic conversions the converter may have to have specialized work done locally, or ship the transmission to a specialty vendor. The more machine shop skills a builder has the more work that builder will be able to perform, and will be more skilled at selecting professional help. Creation of the motor coupling and the motor to transmission adapter usually require skills and experience of a high order (a typical ''automotive machinist'' will not usually be able to perform the work satisfactorily). A knowledgeable converter will be better able to judge the qualifications of the machinist to be employed, and a cooperative machinist may be willing to allow the converter to perform some of the lower skilled and lower risk tasks. It is also important that the machine shop tasks be well planned out and broken down into the component subtasks, something that a converter of modest machine shop skills will be able to do. Work in a machine shop may be done at fixed price (in which case the enumeration of tasks will aid in bid preparation) or performed using an hourly rate, in which case the estimate will be more accurate. For an exotic conversions where components must be designed a good relationship with a cooperative machine shop is essential to completing a successful and cost-effective project.

===Welding===
For conversion of a unit body vehicle it is especially important that the batteries be well secured. This is typically done by creating ''racks'' from angle steel stock or ''boxes'' from sheet metal welded into forms suitable for the ''batteries'' and vehicle. These racks or boxes are then welded to the unit body or secured to the vehicle's frame (if accessible). This requires care in avoiding warpage of the primary vehicle structure . For popular conversions it is possible to obtain manufactured racks designed for a pre-engineered layout, so this skill may be considered optional but dependent upon the vehicle selected for conversion. For light truck conversions with in-bed batteries no welding is necessary - all retention may be done with appropriate bolted hardwood components.
Welding additionally requires special attention regarding the choice of base metal, fillet, type and size of weld. The weld size must be calculated such that it carrys the load with least weld thickness.

===Automotive mechanics===
The ability to remove, disassemble, rebuild, and install major ICE components such as transmissions, engines, and suspension components is useful but may be performed by a specialty conversion shop.  The builder&amp;ndash;owner should be especially cautious in the employment of ICE auto mechanics for these tasks as they may be unfamiliar with specialized EV procedures and requirements.

===Basic electrical===
A builder should be sufficiently knowledgeable about basic electricity to safely work on household and EV electrical systems. Note that an EV pack can provide extremely high currents, which can rapidly heat wires or misused tools, causing burns, and that batteries so overloaded can explode with consequent hazards of acid and toxic materials. Most traction packs and the associated high voltage accessory wiring (heater and twelve volt converter) supply or use potentially lethal voltages. Specific electrical arrangements are used to minimize the hazards present and it is important that the builder/operator observe proper precautions and maintain the equipment in a safe configuration.

===Basic electronics===
While the systems used in EV safety are not exotic, the builder should have sufficient skill to design and implement basic relay and diode logic for control and alarms. The smaller relays needed may be obtained at a local electronics supply shop or through an EV parts supplier. Some specialty components are obtained from EV parts suppliers or sometimes from automotive parts recyclers.

==Application==
Electric vehicles (EVs) are appropriate for short to medium range commuting. Longer ranges are possible if charging may be obtained at both ends of the commute.

EVs are appropriate for local errands where long range is not important. While [[w:en:Neighborhood_electric_vehicle|Neighborhood Electric Vehicles]] (NEVs, essentially enhanced electric [[w:en:golf_car|golf cars]]) are available from several manufactures, such vehicles are not considered here for hobby conversion as they are readily available from manufacturers and are not suitable for most suburban locations (although they may be well suited for operation in some urban environments and many self-contained communities).

==Vehicle==
[[File:EVTruckFirewall.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Typical firewall components in a light truck]]
While almost any vehicle can be converted to electric power, one should be cautious about converting a vehicle simply because it is available (such as a family vehicle with a non-functioning engine). One should first consider the performance envelope that is both desired and affordable (see below) and then find a suitable vehicle that will satisfy these needs when converted. A good used vehicle in running condition may be a better choice than a vehicle with a major defect, as one can test the running components such as  transmission, differential, suspension, and other components by road test. If the parts to be removed are in good condition it may be possible to obtain a good price by selling the engine while it can be demonstrated in the vehicle. A purchaser will thus have some confidence in the quality of the engine and may be willing to pay more than for one of unknown quality that has been removed from the vehicle. A later model may be available with advanced safety features and better brakes than would be available on a fifteen or twenty year old vehicle.

==Performance envelope==
[[File:EVTruckFwdCompartment.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Charger, controller, and vacuum components in a light truck, garden tractor battery to right of vacuum pump]]
As a minimum, an EV conversion should have sufficient performance so as not to impede conventional traffic operating within the speed limits of the roadway. This does not mean that it is necessary to obtain a level of performance equivalent to an ICE vehicle, although a short range performance vehicle may be constructed which will significantly outperform ICE vehicles below 30 mph (50 km/h).

Some designers point out that a specific type of electric vehicle offers comfort, utility and quickness, sacrificing only range. This is called a short range electric vehicle. This type may be built using high performance lead&amp;ndash;acid batteries, but of only about half the mass that would be expected to obtain a 60 to 80 mile range. The result is a vehicle with about a thirty mile range, but when designed with appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear) does not require power steering, offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, is freeway capable and legal, and costs less to build and maintain. By including a manual transmission this type of vehicle can obtain both better performance ''and'' higher efficiency than the single speed types developed by the major manufacturers. Unlike the converted golf carts used for neighborhood electric vehicles, these may be operated on typical suburban throughways (40 to 45 mph or 70 km/h speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical to these roads and to the short on and off segments of freeways that are common in suburban areas.

==Operating costs vs. capital costs==
Relative to an ICE vehicle an EV can offer substantially lower cost per mile in some applications but not all. An ICE can be very cheap to buy and maintain (until old and worn) but expensive for purchase of fuel and for &quot;[[w:en:smog|smog]]&quot; inspections and oil changes.

An EV can be expensive to build and to replace batteries, yet quite inexpensive to operate if the cost of electricity is low. An EV is especially attractive if a homeowner has installed sufficient [[w:en:net_metering|net metering]] [[w:en:photovoltaic|photovoltaic]] (solar electric) panels, particularly if the net metering applies time of use rates.

This can spin rapidly in place like a carnival ride and its batteries are recharged by the solar panels.

A novelty vehicle or an electric powered [[w:en:art_car|art car]] may not be suitable for on road use. Applications include electric vehicle show demonstrations, parades, parade floats, float towing, and eclectic off-road gatherings such as [[w:en:Burning_Man|Burning Man]].

===Shoebox racer===
A prelude to larger vehicles, intended for the education of middle school students, these are fabricated from a standardised box of components, with the overall design and gear ratios determined by the builder. A building team will typically consist of two students and an adult advisor.

===Electric cart===
Suitable for educating youth in the technologies of electric vehicles, technically advanced versions of the cart can exhibit high efficiency in energy use and are a natural prelude to later developing pure solar electric racing vehicles or the conversion of ICE vehicles to electric drive. Speeds are typically limited to about seven MPH so a running adult can overtake and stop a vehicle. Some classes allow a great freedom in design by having a class first disassemble the previous constructions, returning components to appropriate bins. This disassembly  task informs the students on design methods and equiment assembly. The students, in small teams, then design and construct new vehicles.

===Tour del Sol===
The ultimate in efficiency is exhibited by solar powered electric cars with highly refined chassies, electrics, and aerodynamics. These are designed and assembled by college teams with the support of various businesses, especially those involved with solar power, batteries, electric propulsion, or automotive manufacturing. Competitions are traditionally biennial, with the most widely recognized event being the World Solar Challenge in Australia, an 1800 mile race from Darwin to Adelaide. In the North American Solar Challenge teams race 2500 miles from Austin, Texas through Winnipeg, Manitoba finishing in Calgary, Alberta.

===Electric bicycle===
An electric bicycle is a class of bicycles that are fitted with an electric motor. Often they are powered by rechargeable batteries however some experimental electric bicycles run directly on or recharge their batteries via solar panels, fuel cells, gas generators or other alternatives energy sources. Some experimenters have even used super capacitors to store energy. Using an on-board generator may impact the legal juristictional definition of an electric bicycle. A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or travelling down hills (regenerative braking). With the advent of newer technology further features can be expected.

Some electric bikes have features where the motor can move the bicycle by itself if the rider chooses not to pedal, while others require the rider to pedal at all times. (see the Wikipedia article [[w:en:motorized_bicycle|''motorized bicycle'']]).

The conversion of a bicycle to electric power is probably the lowest cost means of learning conversion methods. Battery packs are usually lead acid gel cells since these are available in small sizes suitable for this application. It is also practical to experiment with more expensive battery types since only a small pack is required. It is possible to repurpose battery packs and chargers intended for powering toys and similar small electrical devices.

===Electric Scooter===
[[Image:EVScooterAtVancouver.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Scooter]]
Not typically suitable for on the road use these may be configured for either standing or sitting use
&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Electric motorcycle===
[[Image:EVMotorCycleFrankendragon.jpg|thumb|right|424px|Motorcycle]]
A specialty niche, this can offer an opportunity to build a relatively low cost electric vehicle. Most of these use a two wheel configuration, although the two types of three wheel vehicle (and sometimes four wheel vehicles) are classified as motorcycles in many jurisdictions if their weight is sufficiently low (typically around 1000 pounds maximum). If a tricycle layout is employed the single wheel should be at the back, with normal automotive type front wheel steering, as the single wheel forward type is notoriously unstable in handling.

===Economy coupe===
A light vehicle can make an excellent choice if care is taken in component selection and placement and use restrictions are accepted. It is possible to obtain conversion kits for some popular light vehicles, most notably the rear motor, rear drive Volkswagen &quot;Beetle&quot;, its &quot;Type 3&quot; evolution, and its successor, the front motor/drive VW &quot;Rabbit&quot;. One should not expect to convert such a vehicle and then use it to transport four full size (or oversize) adults - the cars simply do not have the safe load carrying capacity for that. Instead, count on simply removing the rear seat to obtain space for light luggage. Rear wheel drive vehicles are especially suitable for high performance applications as the weight transfer due to acceleration will increase the traction on the  driven wheels.

By converting a light vehicle it is possible to use a smaller motor, which both weighs and costs less than a larger motor. Lighter overall vehicle weight will reduce power consumption in start and stop traffic and so increase range in many practical driving conditions.

(At least one commercial converter, [http://www.solectria.com/ Solectria], has converted the front wheel drive General Motors [[w:en:Geo_Metro Geo|Metro]] for electric use, creating the [[w:en:Solectria_Force|Solectria Force]].)

===Compact sedan or coupe===
A compact sedan, compared to a subcompact, may have better load capacity and more room for battery placement. But, it is also heavier, and will generally have higher wind drag.  This means, compared to a subcompact, they will require larger and more expensive motors, a more expensive controller, and more batteries ( higher weight and cost) . Some commercial EV Conversions use vehicles in this size range.  One example is a 1992 Honda Civic (http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/542.html).  In this conversion, the back seat was retained, and there is still enough room to sink nine flooded lead acid batteries low in the trunk where the spare tire was located, as well as another nine batteries under the hood.  With suspension modifications, (increasing shock length &amp; spring rating), one will want to make certain that the vehicle is below GVWR to avoid an illegal and dangerous situation. The car should never be driven if the total vehicle weight is above the GVWR, or if either axle weight is above the maximum designed load for that axle. ( This is typically listed in the glove box, or on one of the door sills of the car)

===Full size sedan===
Full size sedans and minivans are generally considered to be less attractive candidates for EV conversion than smaller cars.  It may be easier to obtain upgraded components for some smaller vehicles, since these may be used for sports racing (particularly [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autocross autocross]). Starting with a heavy vehicle and adding batteries will result in poor performance in acceleration, handling, braking, and economy of operation.

===Sports car===
For a person interested in sports car performance a satisfying conversion will likely lead to a number of difficulties in such details as battery disposition, as such vehicles generally have available space distributed in small volumes around the vehicle. This leads to complexity in securing and wiring batteries. Such vehicles can offer stunning performance in the lower speed ranges owing to light weight and rear wheel drive and may also offer good range from their superior  aerodynamics.

By far the most often converted sports car is the Porsche 914 from the early 1970's.  An unusually robust chassis, combined with a large interior storage volume for batteries has made this the vehicle of choice for many successful conversions.

===Light truck===
Light trucks are especially suitable for hobbyist conversion owing to the fact that it is easy to locate batteries remote from the passenger compartment and there is a good load handling capacity for the use of heavy batteries such as the flooded lead-acid batteries commonly used in golf carts. Light trucks also offer substantial utility in use simply because they are trucks. Even if a portion of the  weight capacity is removed by the presence of batteries within or below the cargo bed, much of the spacial utility remains. A light truck is highly recommended as a first conversion effort owing to the simplicity of component layout. Furthermore, a light truck (being a utility vehicle) can reasonably be maintained to a lower level of cosmetic standards - paint and body work may be repaired to a lower standard of ''fit and finish'' than would be expected for a sedan, coupe, or sports car. (A simple light truck conversion example: http://www.campbellot.com/electric-s10/.) Light trucks of the early 21st century have outgrown their original design envelope, being made far taller and more bulky then needed. The last small light truck marketed in the early 2000s was the Nissan Frontier, now, in its current incarnation, &quot;pumped up&quot; with additional bulk and an unstable high center of gravity. The Toyota Hilux, while still manufactured, is not marketed within the USA. The most suitable light  trucks for conversion are built on frames, and date from 1975 to the late 1990's and are almost all import brands.

===Hotrod===
While this type of vehicle is usually made to be a &quot;[[w:en:street_legal|street legal]]&quot; performance machine it may also be developed for occasional use as a [[w:en:drag_racing|drag racing]] vehicle. The leading vehicle in this field was a Mazda RX-7 ([http://store.wilde-evolutions.com/wilde/mazda.html]) sports car converted from  rotary engine to electric. This vehicle can outrun Dodge Viper sports cars in quarter mile drag races. Faster still is John Wayland's White Zombie ([http://www.plasmaboyracing.com/whitezombie.php]). This conversion of a 1972 Datsun 1200 sedan is currently the world's quickest &amp; fastest Street legal car(in the 1/4 mile, per NEDRA).

===Autocross racer===
EVs may prove to be especially suitable for [[w:en:autocross|autocross]] contests as low speed acceleration is especially important to success in this type of racing. Specific classes for electric autocross (called &quot;electrocross&quot; )are being introduced in some venues. Vehicles for these will typically be economy car conversions or custom built chassies but with excess rear weight bias to allow agile handling under the control of an experienced driver (such rearward balance may be dangerous for everyday use).

===Drag racer===
Intended only for specialized straight line quarter mile (acceleration) racing this type of vehicle is used only &quot;off road&quot; at specialized &quot;[[w:en:drag_racing|drag strips]]&quot;.

===High speed straight line racer===
Even more specialized than the drag racer this is intended to obtain high speeds on long, straight, and flat raceways, such as the dry lakebeds found in locations such as the [[w:en:Bonneville_Salt_Flats|Bonneville Salt Flats]]

===Custom chassis===
Suitable for a builder who is capable of constructing a kit car, with good abilities and equipment in machining and welding this can result in a unique vehicle. It is especially suitable for the construction of a lightweight vehicle that can offer exceptional performance.

===Other trucks - full size and most SUVs===
These are rarely converted due to their excessive weight, and inefficiencies (namely due to poor aerodynamics). To make the situation worse, many modern trucks/SUVs continue to get bulkier and heavier . As a direct result, the payload carrying capacity of the vehicles goes down. Such a trait is not desirable because it limits the weight of the battery pack that can be carried, limiting the maximum battery-to-vehicle weight ratio that could be achieved for the vehicle when converted to an EV. For a given battery type, reducing the battery-to-vehicle weight ratio always results in reduced vehicle range per charge. However, despite these mostly unavoidable limitations, several SUVs and larger trucks have been successfully converted to electric power by hobbyists. Some examples include the [http://www.suckamps.com/ &quot;Gone Postal&quot; van] converted to an EV racer by Roderick Wilde and Suckamps EV Racing, the [http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/45 1971 Land Rover EV] converted by Wilde Evolutions, and the [http://www.driveev.com/jeepev/ 1988 Jeep Cherokee EV] converted by Nick Viera.

==Battery technologies==
Considerations
* Life cycle cost
* Initial cost range
* [[w:Energy density|Energy density]]
* Peak power capacity
* Internal resistance
* Voltage depression
* Maintenance
* Available form factors
* Expected degree of discharge
* Low temperature operation

===Lead acid===
Lead acid cells are sensitive to &quot;break in&quot;, in that severe use early in life can shorten the lifespan. They are also sensitive to temperature, with low temperatures severely reducing the amount of energy available - sometimes battery heaters and insulated boxes are appropriate use in cold climates. If sufficiently discharged the electrolyte can freeze at extremely cold temperatures, which can break the case from expansion.

It is important that lead acid cells be kept charged. A deep discharge without an immediate recharge can significantly reduce the capacity of the batteries. Lead acid batteries also give the most total energy throughput over their useful life if the discharge cycles are relatively shallow, but such repeated shallow discharging can reduce the total energy available between recharges. The electrolyte is [[w:en:Sulfuric_acid|sulfuric acid]] in water and is not especially strong but is hazardous to skin, eyes, and clothing and corrosive to steel and aluminum. It does not affect most plastics and stainless steel. It is easily neutralized with common baking soda ([[w:en:sodium_bicarbonate|sodium bicarbonate]]), which should be kept available near the batteries. (Note that a common &quot;dry powder&quot; fire extinguisher is charged with sodium bicarbonate and is appropriate for use on electrical equipment.) When combined with the acid it will evolve [[w:en:Carbon_dioxide|carbon dioxide]], leaving a relatively harmless [[w:en:sodium_sulfate|sodium sulfate]] residue. When working on the batteries some baking soda should be kept at hand in case of an electrolyte spill. ''Safety glasses should be worn when working near or upon the batteries.'' Sometimes acid will leak from the seal between the top and the case, or may be spilled when moving or testing the batteries. Such an acid leak can not only corrode the vehicle's structure, it can also cause a highA&amp;ndash;resistance ''current leak'', which can cause some types of battery chargers to fail with a ''ground fault''. In the case of an acid spill, battery cases and tops should be wiped down with a solution of water and baking soda. This should be repeated until no bubbles of carbon dioxide are seen.

Discharge and failure to recharge will cause sulphanation, a chemical change on the surface of the plates that reduces capacity and increases internal resistance. Keeping the battery properly charged and well watered (where appropriate) is the best care to ensure long service life. Overcharge of some types of batteries can also be harmful.

If the battery is not likely to be used and quickly recharged it should be placed on a &quot;float charge&quot;, where the charger applies a voltage that will not cause overcharging (which is harmless to wet cells but consumes the water in the electrolyte through electrolysis into [[w:en:hydrogen|hydrogen]] and [[w:en:oxygen|oxygen]] and is damaging to other lead&amp;ndash;acid battery types).

Batteries in general, and lead acid in particular, will sustain a greater lifetime energy throughput if only partially discharged, generally less than 50 percent being considered an economical design point. As lead acid batteries in particular have a high weight for a given capacity, and this weight must be hauled by the vehicle, it becomes uneconomical in energy to have much excess capacity, but since the greatest expense is not energy cost but rather battery replacement, the main effect of having too much battery weight will be in its effect upon acceleration performance and brake wear.

====Flooded lead&amp;ndash;acid====
Batteries suitable for EV conversions are typically sold as &quot;golf cart&quot; batteries and offer the lowest initial cost per watt-hour of capacity, high watt&amp;ndash;hour capacity and reasonable life when properly cared for. A typical configuration is a six volt battery containing three cells. They are also available in 4-cell, eight volt configurations but these are rarely used in EV conversions owing to a higher total life cycle cost. Flooded lead&amp;ndash;acid batteries are conditioned periodically by overcharging to equalize the state of charge of individual cells in the pack. Care must be taken when charging batteries indoors due to the creation of potentially explosive  hydrogen gas. If such cells are charged in an enclosed space the charging station (or other switched outlet) should also be connected to a vent fan of appropriate size and location. Being &quot;wet&quot; cells they require maintenance in the form of addition of distilled water, or the addition of a Hydrocap&amp;trade; - a [[w:en:catalyst|catalytic]] device that recombines evolved hydrogen and oxygen, reforming the water that would otherwise have to be replaced. When these caps are used the temperature may be monitored to good effect; when all cells are fully charged, all of the caps will be warm from the exothermic recombination of hydrogen and oxygen to water. Devices can be purchased that allow fast and easy central-point watering of the batteries, if catalytic recombiners are not used.

Wet lead&amp;ndash;acid cells will also shed material from their plates, which accumulates at the bottom of the cell. Cells intended for long service life and deep discharge have extra space to accumulate these materials. When the accumulation reaches the plates it will cause a (non-catastrophic) short circuit, eventually rendering the individual cell useless.

This type of cell is particularly resistant to overcharging, since the dissociated water vented as gas may be replaced, or recovered using a catalytic cap. This type is less resistant to vibration than other types and the entire pack will become useless if the electrolyte in a single cell is lost due to case damage, which by not allowing currrent to flow through the cell will bring the entire vehicle to a halt.

The flooded lead acid cells used in EV conversions are readily available at low cost compared to other batteries owing to their high volume use in other vehicles such as golf carts. These batteries tend to have high weight in proportion to their peak capacity and a higher internal resistance than other lead-acid types. Owing to the lower voltage in a battery unit (three cells with a nominal six volts) it is not practical to build a high voltage light weight battery pack. Thus the advantages of the wet lead-acid cell are best exploited in a light truck conversion and in lower voltage automotive applications (96 volts or less using six volt batteries, or 120 volts using eight volt batteries) in lighter vehicles. Note that for certain battery voltages and sizes (e.g. the six volt Trojan T-105) the actual purchase cost can be significantly lower that for other related batteries (e.g., the 16% heavier Trojan T-145), due to the highly competitive golf cart market.
[[Image:EVBatTermMelted.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Terminal melt-down]]
Batteries using tapered post connections are generally considered better than batteries with other connection arrangements such as vertical stud, owing to the greater contact area and less tendency to loosen in service as a consequence of plastic flow of the lead. The more expensive cable to post connections will add to the total cost, however. If the stud type is used a ''small'' amount anti-seize paste (typically used on exhaust manifold bolts) consisting of aluminum flakes in a grease carrier, should be applied to only the stud threads before assembling the connection, keeping the electrical contact area clean.

Batteries intended for automobile starting are not suitable for use in EVs as they are optimized for a different charge-discharge profile and their short service life in this application will greatly reduce their cost effectiveness.

Wet lead acid cells offer a high [[w:en:ampere-hour|ampere-hour]] capacity compared to other types, 225A·h being common in golf cart types. The 225A·h refers to a twenty hour discharge rate and the actual energy available under typical electric vehicle conditions will greatly reduce the total energy available from this type.

Periodically the battery pack should be given a ''balancing charge''. For such a charge the charging voltage is increased to a value that will cause fully charged cells to electrolyze the water in the electrolyte. Any cells not fully charged will continue to charge. Note that this can only be done with the wet cell type as this procedure will damage or destroy other battery types.

A well cared for flooded cell pack in normal light truck service is generally expected to last about three years. It may be possible to extend this life through electrolyte treatments, an option not available with other lead&amp;ndash;acid battery types. Buildup of shed plate material below the cell will limit the ultimate life of the battery.

The few major brands available for this type of battery use different connection locations and so the vehicle may require new cables if the type of batteries installed are significantly changed. Many house brands of batteries will use one of the few major manufacture's form factors.

====Absorbed glass mat (AGM) lead acid====
[[Image:FiatEV.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The ability to position AGM batteries at odd angles is a distinct advantage in this conversion of an elderly Fiat]]
Compared to wet lead acid these cost far more, have shorter life, far less ampere&amp;ndash;hour capacity, but much more maximum power output per unit weight, greater durability, and lower maintenance requirements. Owing to their high output and lower weight per cell this type is particularly suitable for high performance vehicles, being commonly used in electric [[w:en:Drag_racer|drag racers]] and low cost sports cars. Some configurations have been optimized for light weight electric vehicles, offering 12 volts from six cells in a 45 pound (20 kg) package, but only 55 A·h at a slow discharge rate. This type of cell offers low internal resistance and so batteries made from these cells can deliver high power outputs for their size and weight. While substantially more expensive both per ampere-hour and in lifetime energy throughput than wet lead-acid cells they are still considerably less expensive than other types of batteries.

This type is suitable as a replacement for wet cells but must be carefully protected from overcharging as there is no means for replacing lost electrolyte water due to outgassing. The ability to mount these batteries at an angle may be an advantage in some smaller vehicles. The leading developer of this type of battery, ''Optima'', was purchased by Johnson Controls and folded into their Interstate battery group. Subsequent problems with new dead batteries (palette load shipments) have been reported on some electric vehicle forums.

====Lead acid gel-cell====
Gel cells are sealed and the electrolyte is non-liquid. This requires that they be operated and charged within carefully controlled ranges to avoid overcharging. They are also unsuitable for the high-current requirements of a typical direct current application. They are suitable for low current high voltage applications such as is typical in an alternating current system. Gel cells are commonly used in electric bicycles and scooters, and in computer uninterruptible power supplies. This type of cell has been used in CalCars' plug-in hybrid conversion of a Toyota Prius, but is intended only as proof of concept for that application owing to its weight compared to other technologies. While infrequently used in EV conversions this type of cell is available in a wide variety of battery shapes and sizes and this is advantageous if battery space is limited. As many of these batteries have limited total power and current capacity they are sometimes used in parallel groups (called &quot;buddy batteries&quot;) to construct a pack. This type is more sensitive to damage by incorrect charging profiles than is the AGM type. As the gel immobilizes the electrolyte it is not subject to stratification as is the wet cell type. The gel makes overcharging particularly destructive to this type of battery since any evolved gas bubbles (hydrogen or oxygen) will remain at the surface of the respective plate and so prevent electrolyte contact and hence can severely reduce the storage capacity of the battery. Gel-cells are used in the [[w:en:Solectra_Force|Solectra Force]], a commercial conversion of the Geo Metro that is no longer in production.

====Valve regulated lead acid (VRLA)====
A version of this battery by [[w:en:/Panasonic|Panasonic]] was used in [[w:en:General_Motors|General Motors']] [[w:en:General_Motors_EV1|EV1]] electric vehicle, and a version by Delphi in [[w:en:Ford_Motor_Company|Ford Motor Company's]] [[w:en:Ford_Ranger_EV|Ranger EV]]. As with most other batteries, careful charging patterns are required to avoid overheating or loss of electrolyte. VRLA batteries contain catalytic materials to recombine evolved hydrogen and oxygen back into water before they escape to the atmosphere.

====Foam plate and anti-sulphination coatings====
A recent developent the carbon foam grid was initially developed by [[w:en:Caterpillar_Inc.|Caterpillar Inc.]]  in an attempt to create a more robust battery for use in grading and construction equipment. Such equipment is often inactive during a portion of the year and is subject to strong vibrations when in use. This environment will require the frequent replacement of lead-acid service batteries. Carbon foam was being investigated by Caterpiller  [for use in radiators when it was noticed by an in-house battery investigator and subsequently applied for use in the cathode and anode plates of flooded lead acid wet cells. The carbon foam has a very good resistance to repeated bending (a high fatigue life) and a very large surface area, both beneficial to Caterpiller's battery applications. A spinoff company, [[w:en:Firefly Energy|Firefly Energy]] was created for the commercial development of this technology. The first commercial product of this effort, a Group 31 truck battery, is expected in 2008, will be sold under the ''Oasis''[http://www.fireflyenergy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=273&amp;Itemid=100] brand. As trucks are needing considerable energy for &quot;hotel&quot; loads to operate sleeper cabs when the truck is not in use the application is more akin to that of a deep-cycle marine battery rather than that of a simple vehicle starting load. The expectations are that this new battery have better than 40 percent additional capacity and will allow up to 800 full recharge cycles compared to the typical 200 cycles for a conventional Type 31 truck starter battery, and this while replacing only the negative plate with carbon foam. A more advanced application will replace also the positive plate, with projections that at least a third of the weight may be eliminated for the same storage capacity. Special coatings have also been developed by Firefly that reduce the sulfination effects of long discharged times. It is unlikely that batteries specifically suitable for electric vehicles will be available before 2010, and the current Group 31 battery will initially be available only for fleet use. Given the expected performance and cost parameters of this technology there is considerable interest in these developments within the EV conversion community.

===Nickel cadmium (NiCd or &quot;Nicad&quot;)===
The nickel cadmium cells suitable for EV use are &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;flooded&quot; cells. The cadmium in a nicad is particularly toxic, far more so than lead. The battery does not use an [[w:en:acid|acid]] electrolyte but rather a [[w:en:Acids_and_bases (Organic chemistry)|base]], [[w:en:Potassium_hydroxide|potassium hydroxide]] also known commonly as lye, used in processing food, making soap from fat, cleaning drains and many other applications. The electrolyte is hazardous to the eyes and can burn skin but is easily neutralized with common vinegar, which should be kept available when performing battery maintenance. Unlike acids, bases do not attack steel but are extremely corrosive to [[w:en:Aluminum|aluminum]].

For long term use the higher cost may be well repaid owing to longer life. NiCads will typically have about 50% more energy for the same weight than lead-acid, and can be safely discharged to very low levels.  
Most wet Nicads also are said to lack &quot;punch&quot;, not having the ability to supply high currents seen from AGM lead-acid cells.

Nicads also exhibit &quot;memory&quot;, requiring periodic deep discharge (usually a series of three full discharge-recharge cycles) in order to regain battery capacity

This type of battery was applied commercially in the [[w:en:Th!nk_City|Th!nk City]] EV.

===Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)===
These have been used in some production vehicles such as some versions of the [[w:en:Chrysler_TEVan|Chrysler TEVan]], Ford Ranger EV, GM EV1, [[w:en:Honda_EV_Plus|Honda EV Plus]], and the [[w:en:Toyota_RAV4_EV|Toyota RAV4 EV]]. They are also used in most [[w:en:Hybrid_vehicle|hybrid vehicles]],  Their use in hybrid vehicles may result in substantial reduction in cost over the next few years (written 2005). As is well known by [[w:en:Cell_phone|cell phone]] and some [[w:en:Digital_camera|digital camera]] users these batteries have a high self-discharge rate.

===Lithium-ion (LiIon)===
These offer the highest energy density commonly available, although at substantial expense. They were used in the Nissan Altra electric vehicle.  They are currently not cost effective for most converters but the technology is developing rapidly and this type is being used in portable power tools. Previously available versions of this type of battery would degrade over time even if not frequently cycled - exhibiting a&quot; calendar life&quot;. Improvements are expected in the near future as indicated by the recent development of enhanced versions of this type specifically for application in hybrid vehicles by [[w:en:Panasonic|Panasonic]]. This type will be used in a third party conversion of the Prius hybrid to create a plug-in hybrid, expected to be available in 2006.

A new development in lithium-ion technology may be promising to EV conversion.  A123Systems claims their new battery technology delivers up to 10X longer life, 5X power gains and five minute recharge.  This new product also boasts a significant cost and weight savings vs. NiMH or conventional Li-Ion technology.  The price seems comparable to high end lead acid batteries with developer kits available.  Homebuilders should be cautious of new technologies however until the product is in the marketplace for some time.  [[w:en:Dewalt|Dewalt]] will be offering this technology beginning in 2006 so this should give real world testing of this battery

The [[w:en:Tesla_Roadster|Tesla Roadster]] will be powered by LiIon, with a range over 200 miles, 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds, and top speed of 130mph.

=== Pack sizing ===
Several considerations apply to selecting pack capacity, particularly when lead-acid cells are used. Lead-acid cells tend to degrade in capacity in a predictable manner. If the pack is undersized for the application it may perform satisfactory for a time, but due to loss of capacity may not provide sufficient range for its intended use, even though the batteries have substantial useful life remaining. Excess initial capacity will thus increase the service life of the pack. On the other hand, larger packs are not only more expensive, but have to be hauled, so excess capacity will both reduce economy of operation,  acceleration and increase brake wear.

==Pack voltage==
Lightweight vehicles not suitable for freeway use will typically use 24, 36, 48, or 72 volt battery packs.

DC propulsion systems in EV conversions intended for freeway use will usually be 96, 108, 120, 144, or  192 volts. AC systems will usually be 192 volts or higher.

===96 volt and 108===

====Using wet cell golf cart batteries====
96 volts, obtained using sing sixteen 6 volt wet cells*  (used in electric golf carts) and a nine inch DC motor in a light truck this will give sufficient performance for around town and for limited (but not hasty) freeway driving. The total pack battery, holddown, and cabling weight will be about 16×65 lb = 1040 lb (470 kg), representing  a substantial reduction in the vehicle's useful load carrying capacity. The nominal watt-hour capacity will be 225×96 = 21.6 kW·h, with a practical yield considerably less than this value. Nominal specific capacity is 20.8 W·h/lb (45.8 W·h/kg). With sufficiently high (120VAC mains) it may be possible  to use a simple non-isolated charger to charge 18 batteries for 108 volts nominal. An 18 cell pack using Trojan T-145 or equivalent will offer over 140 percent of the system capacity of 16 T-105 or equivalent, for a substantial increase in range with about 130 percent of the weight. The higher capacity batteries will be less cost effective (by a factor of about .92), due mostly to the larger volume demand for the popular T-105 type.

* Calculations based upon Trojan-T-105 with two pounds allowance for cable and hold-down.

====Using AGM batteries====
With a light vehicle and eight 12 volt AGM batteries the performance should be substantially improved and quite suitable for short range use. Note that AGM batteries have a substantially higher peak current capacity and lower internal resistance than wet cells. The total pack battery, holddown and cabling weight will be about 8×46 = 368 lb (167 kg). This lower weight is much more suited to a lightweight vehicle than are the wet cells described above.

* Calculations based upon Optima D34/78-950 (yellow top) with two pounds allowance for cable and hold-down. Use of blue tops would result in a pack weight of about 8×62 = 496 lb (225 kg).

===120 and 128 volts===
These are configured using twenty 6-volt, ten 12-volt, or fifteen 8-volt (wet cell golf cart) batteries. These configurations were rare since other equipment (the pack to 12-volt converter) was not easily available in these input voltages, a problem now solved by some vendors. 120 volts is especially attractive since a pack may be constructed with twenty six-volt batteries. As suitable wet cell traction batteries in quantity are packaged as pallet loads of 40, two vehicle owners may purchase and divide a pallet with no leftovers. Since common controllers will typically operate between 96 and 144 volts the controller is not operating at the upper limit of its voltage range.

===144 volt===
Under similar circumstances this should enable a DC conversion to operate with the acceleration normally obtained from the ICE original. If the same battery types are used one could expect about 40 percent additional range compared to a 96 volt system. Note that if six volt wet cells are used the additional eight batteries will weigh an additional 560 pounds (250 kg), representing a substantial decrease in load carrying capacity and in economy of operation. If more advanced battery technologies are used then the performance penalties are substantially less.

Using the popular Trojan T-105 battery a pack of 24 batteries (exclusive of cabling and tie-downs) would weigh 1392 lb (672 kg).

Where this voltage is desired in a somewhat lighter and more compact wet cell pack it may be constructed using eighteen 8 volt batteries. Using the Trojan T-860 a pack would weigh 1008 lb (600 kg). As the T-105 and T-860 batteries are the same size, the total volume required by the T-860 would use considerably less volume, 75% of a pack built with the T-105 (but would have only 66% of the 5 hour rate ampere-hour capacity. The nominal capacity will be  21.6 kW·h, so this pack will have the same overall capacity as that of a 96 volt pack using 6 volt T-105s, but will  require two more battery stations. The added voltage will give an improved performance, but if used often that extra performance will have less range. As there is far less demand for eight volt batteries as compared to the common six volt golf cart battery, the cost per watt-hour stored will probably also be higher.

144 volts is also a common upper limit for voltage applied to certain commonly available mid-priced controllers such as some models of the widely used Curtis. Owing to the current limitations of that controller the main effects compared to lower voltage systems will be to increase the range and to ensure effective performance at deep discharge levels. Effective exploitation of the higher voltage to obtain increased acceleration requires the use of a specialized high-current controller, such as the ''Zilla''.

===192 volt===
This is becoming the conversion industry standard for high performance street vehicles such as sports car conversions. This voltage is not typically used with large wet cells owning to the high weight of the total battery pack (32×70 = 2240 lb, about 1000 kg), Instead usually either AGM lead acid (740 pounds or 340 kg for Optima Yellow Top) or wet cell NiCads (908 lb or 410 kg for SAFT STM).

===Higher voltages===
Higher voltages are used in specialized vehicles such as drag racers and for some AC motor conversions. Since high voltage systems use substantially less current it is possible to use gel-cell lead acid, unsuitable for higher current applications as they are subject to permanent damage at high current flows.

==Balancing circuitry==
Most performance systems use other than the &quot;flooded&quot; wet-cell golf cart batteries. Unlike the robust golf cart batteries it is not practical to rebalance the pack by overcharging as this can damage the batteries. Instead, [[w:en:Battery_balancer|additional circuits and controllers]] are added to connect batteries to distribute the charge to cells that need it. These circuits are currently (2005) available only for 12 volt batteries. Note that individual cells within the batteries are not balanced by this circuitry.

==Battery charging==
{{Main|w:Battery charger}}
A charger appropriate to the battery technology installed must be used to ensure the maximum battery life.

While a charger may be installed where the vehicle is parked, most conversions use an &quot;''on&amp;ndash;board''&quot; charger. Some chargers are &quot;transformerless&quot; and so are of light weight, but more sensitive to ''ground faults'' ( some of these may be avoided by a specialized charging circuit shown in a later section). Where a higher voltage (144 volts or more) is to be charged it may be most practical to divide the pack into two banks. These may then be charged using two 110 volt chargers, each of which uses one leg of a 220 VAC circuit (North American 220 volt circuits provide a two-way neutral that allows this).

A means of providing AC power to the charger is required. By providing an Avcon paddle port it is feasible to use power provided at malls and transit stations. Alternative methods allow the use of a long extension cord, either for home use or for &quot;opportunity charging&quot;. '''Such opportunity charging must be done using a ground fault protected circuit with a properly connected ground wire.'''

If only a single 110 volt charger is used and it is desirable to use a public charging station then the builder should include a 220 to 110 volt transformer of sufficient capacity and appropriate electrical connections. The use of properly polarized &quot;pigtails&quot; (short connectors) or disconnect methods such as switches or switching circuit breakers must be used to avoid shock hazards. '''Do not attempt to design a connection system with &quot;hot&quot; male plugs.'''

===Charging station===
A ''charging station'' is a source of AC (&quot;mains&quot;) electricity used to power the AC to DC converter (the ''charger''), which is usually installed in the vehicle. Most home conversions use a high capacity extension cord ([[w:en:AWG|U.S. wire gauge]] 10 or 12) plugged into a [[w:en:Residual-current_device|ground fault circuit interrupter]] (GFCI). Some EV owners obtain a commercial grade charging station such as is used at malls and transit stations. Some transit stations also provide four wire &quot;twist lock&quot; sockets for use by EV users.

==Motor/controller technologies==

===Series DC (direct current)===
The most common  motor and controller combinations are modifications of air cooled devices originally designed for use in electric [[w:en:Fork_lift|fork lifts]] ([http://www.curtisinst.com/ Curtis]). A system with air cooled components is simple to install and maintain but is not suitable for high power operations. Similar controller and charger designs with liquid cooling are available for street and also extreme high performance applications (up to 2000 amperes) ([http://cafeelectric.com/ 'Zilla]). Liquid cooling of components is especially suitable where liquid cooling is to be provided for NiCad batteries during charging, as multiple systems can use a common circulating pump and radiator.

====Advantages====
*Low cost
*Simplicity
*High starting torque
*Does not require particularly high battery pack voltage, enabling use of low cost flooded batteries

====Disadvantages====
*Electrical and acoustic noise from commutator.
*Relatively inefficient compared to AC technologies.
*Radio interference from controller, unless higher frequencies are used
*Regeneration (battery recharging when slowing down) requires special design of the electronics to prevent excessive arcing at the motor brushes and overcharging of the batteries (Otmar). Although Curtis has designed and produces a regenerative DC controller for use in Europe, this model is not marketed in the United States.
*Limited speed range requires the use of a multiple speed transmission, and so also (usually) a clutch, frequently eliminated in production AC motor designs.

===AC (alternating current) Induction===
The conventional alternative to DC.
====Advantages====
*Quiet.
*No wearout mechanisms (i.e.brushes).  No regular maintenance is required.
*Efficient when cruising. Overall efficiency exceeds that of Series DC.
*Effectiveness over large speed range allows elimination of transmission shifting, but with an overall performance penalty.
*Does not have the unfortunate failure mode of DC motor controllers of failing fully ON.
*Regen is very simple, usually comes at no cost.
*Use in newer commercial EVs will make this technology more easily available.

====Disadvantages====
*More expensive, largely due to increased controller costs since there are typically three sets of regulating components rather than one as is used in DC systems. Most AC systems have been built by or for large corporations for research projects with little regard for price.
*Lower startup torque due to controller limitations. Induction motors have a similar current vs torque curve to series DC motors, which would be available if the controller were built accordingly.
*If no gear shifting is available it is important that the motor be speed-limited, which will limit vehicle speed to a maximum determined by the overall gear ratio and tire size. Single speed gearing suitable for high speed will limit low speed acceleration.
*Higher voltage demands require smaller batteries which have a higher cost per Watt-hour stored, more battery box locations, and more cables and terminators

===Permanent magnet===
Permanent magnet motors are now being used for auxiliary motors, low-power motors for ultralight EV use, and as assist motor/generators in the newest hybrid vehicles such as the newest [[w:en:Lexus|Lexus]] SUV hybrid vehicle. This type of motor is expected to be used in the recently announced 2006 [[w:en:Toyota|Toyota]] Camry hybrid. The brushless type of this motor is controlled using controllers similar to those used with AC motors. With appropriate control circuitry this type of motor may be used as a generator for energy recovery during braking cycles. Conventional brushed motors use the magnets to create the stator field, with a commutator carrying current to the coils of the rotor. High performance motors for EV use will instead use the permanent magnets for the rotor, with multiple stator coils driven by the controller. This eliminates the use of brushes and the commutator, a great advantage in increasing reliability and reducing maintenance.

==Range Extenders==
===On Board or Towed Genset===
A [[w:en:Electrical generator|genset]] uses some kind of fuel to make DC or AC electricity which is wired to charge the battery pack and provide power for the car's motor. A [[w:en:Genset_trailer|genset trailer]] mounts the genset on a trailer towed behind the vehicle. Such a system is a [[w:en:Types_of_hybrid_vehicle#Series_hybrid|Series Hybrid]]. There are several practical problems building a series hybrid using a small, cheap genset:
*It requires a lot of power to push a car at highway speeds, usually in excess of 10kW. A generator big enough to give unlimited range at highway speeds must have a continuous rating greater than that required to push the car. Such a generator is usually expensive, large and heavy. A smaller generator will require periods of slower driving in order to catch up.
*Most generators have no emission controls. The pollution caused by the generator over and above the pollution caused by an alternative vehicle on the same trip may exceed the pollution saved during non-assisted trips. This obviously depends on how bad the generator is and the ratio of assisted to non-assisted driving.
*It is likely that any generator would have to meet the emission control regulations that apply to the vehicle's original engine.
*Most generators are not very efficient. If trips requiring the generator are rare, running costs may not be a concern.
*The connection between the generator and the rest of the system must prevent overcharging of the batteries and overloading of the generator.
The space, weight &amp; money used by the generator system may actually be better used adding more batteries or improving the efficiency of the vehicle in other ways. Alternatively the money spent installing a generator could be spent hiring an efficient car for long trips. There has been at least one attempt to produce a commercial generator trailer, the [[http://www.evnut.com/rav_longranger.htm Rav Long Ranger]] and a related project for the [[http://www.acpropulsion.com/tzero_pages/tzero_Gallery.htm tzero]]. It wasn't based on a cheap off the shelf generator.  A photovoltaic cell can also be used to increase the range.

===Battery Trailer===
A trailer packed with extra batteries is called a [http://wikicars.com/es/baset_trailer baset trailer].

===Pusher Trailer===
A [[w:en:Pusher_trailer|pusher trailer]] is a trailer with a motor driving its wheels, which pushes the &quot;towing&quot; car. Such devices are usually made from the driving end of a 2wd vehicle, where the donor's original motor, emission controls and efficiency are retained.

==Motor cooling==
DC motors will usually include an internal fan on the driveshaft end to move air through the motor from the commutator end. This will usually be sufficient for most vehicles. When such a motor is placed within a rear drive that is enclosed (such as a Volkswagen Type 3 with battery boxes around the motor), this can lead to overheating since the warm air is exhausted in the forward part of the motor compartment and so may be recycled through the motor. In this case, some form of partitioning and venting (perhaps using a motorized fan) is required.

As the motor is cooled by an internal fan attached to the mainshaft the motor should ''not'' be placed in neutral to coast downhill after an uphill run.

==Motor to transmission installation==

This is one of the key elements in creating a successful EV conversion. A poorly made adapter plate will quickly wear the transmission's front bearing, which will produce most of the driveline noise and which may lead to oil seal and/or gear failure.

The adaptation of the electric motor to the transmission uses two elements, a stationary adapter plate to connect the motor housing to the transmission housing and a rotating coupler to connect the motor shaft to the flywheel/clutch plate/pressure plate assembly (manual transmission) or the flex plate/torque converter assembly (automatic transmission).

===The adapter plate===
The adapter plate provides the union between the electric motor and the transmission. Some installations such as for the Volkswagen Beetle and similar use such a simple machined adapter that it is easily obtained at low cost from a commercial supplier. Adapters for more complex or less popular vehicles may be quite expensive. It is possible for the builder to construct such a plate using simple tools as outlined below, but a great precision in layout and fabrication is required. For this reason most converters purchase an adapter plate and coupling as a package from a specialty converter or have the plate fabricated by a professional machinist. If a flat plate is used, some means of properly spacing it must be employed, typically by using hollow tubular or billet stand-offs. More common will be the use of a stack of flat plates, forming an adaption between the large diameter of the flywheel and the smaller diameter of the motor, with interior volume to accommodate any projection of the flywheel forward of the face of the transmission (or bell housing if a separate unit is used).

There are only a few critical dimensions in an adapter plate. The overall length (the distance between the motor aft face and the transmission forward face should be accurate to within 0.25 millimeter. This is less critical than some other dimensions but the proper distance is required so that the clutch will operate correctly and so that the pilot shaft will enter but not bind on the pilot bearing. The most critical dimensions are those that determine the alignment of the transmission center to the electric motor/flywheel center.  The error here should be no more than 0.001 inch.
====Manufactured====

For some installations, such as an early Volkswagen or Porsche, the adapter can be made as a very simple lathe turning with a few precision holes for mounting bolts, while other vehicles such as the [[w:en:Volkswagen_Rabbit|Volkswagen Rabbit]] may use a single thickness of low cost aluminum plate.

For other more typical vehicles a more complex adapter is required A few specialty manufactures will manufacture a motor to transmission adapter plate by using a numerically controlled milling machine to carve an adapter from a thick billet of aluminum. Owing to a high materials cost and extensive milling time the purchase of a plate will be a substantial portion of the cost of materials for a conversion.

====Fabricating from scratch, using two or three flat plates with spacer blocks====
[[Image:EVAdapterOverview.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The adapter is the blue object between the motor and the transmission]]
By careful layout and simple machining an adapter plate may be fabricated at relatively low cost compared to milling a thick plate. By using multiple plates with spacers a substantial reduction in materials and milling expense can be obtained. This method is suitable for a person with machinist's layout skills and with access to a substantial drill press. As an alternative to the layout method shown below it is also possible to have a machine shop properly locate the center and to mill the motor locator hole using precision mill equipment. To do this a machine shop will require an empty transmission forepiece or bell housing.

Note: this method requires manipulation of the transmission and so it should be first drained of oil. Since residual oil will drain out through the tailshaft seal the end of the transmission should be bagged.

Some of the components may require either a lathe or mill, and this work can be performed at modest expense by a machine shop. The most difficult operations to do without a lathe are the fabrication of uniform and accurate spacer blocks and the boring of the motor locator hole. Most of the remaining tasks can be done with a drill press and a bandsaw or sabre saw, often obtainable at low cost as used equipment. If a used drill press is to be used the condition of the quill bearing will be critical to the accuracy of the machine, and so also to the accuracy of the resulting adapter plate.

The exact design will be determined by the specific bolt patterns of the motor and transmission and the distance between the motor and transmission. This latter distance will typically be in the range of 75 to 100 mm. 

[[Image:EVAdapterPlate.jpg|thumb|right|250px|close up view shows the three plates - motor locator, transfer plate, and a thin transmission dust cover plate. These are separated by simple cylindrical spacers. Rings cut from plastic buckets (metal would be better) complete the enclosure to keep gravel, mud, and water from the clutch]]

The design described below uses three plates that are spaced by simple cylindrical spacers cut from one innch (25mm) round stock. These must have parallel faces and perpendicular holes some of which carry the alignment dowels while others carry simple bolts.

Three aluminum plates are used. The material should be a high strength alloy such as 6061.
* Motor locator plate - this has a locating hole (typically about 100 mm) or so diameter and 4 mounting holes for bolts that fit into threaded holes in the motor body. A 5mm thickness is appropriate for this plate as it is not highly stressed.
*Transfer plate - this is between the motor plate and the transmission plate and has bolt patterns of both the motor plate and the transmission plate. It should be sufficiently thick to not flex under stresses between the motor and transmission, with 6mm being appropriate and this must be made from a good alloy.
*Transmission locator plate - this has the bolt pattern drilled that matches the transmission. This should be about 2.5 mm thick for stability under milling or drilling operations, and if milled (and thin) should be clamped below the transfer plate, If made from stock that is too thick then the locator dowels will not protrude enough on each side to locate the transmission and the corresponding spacer.

These plates are separated by aluminum spacer blocks milled or cut to a precise dimension from a billet of square or rectanglular solid stock. Alternatively. the sides of the adapter may built up from strips of plate but this will be more difficult to fabricate to high precision unless a &quot;sandwich&quot; of multiple cut-out plates is used - a process that can consume a great amount of material while producing a large amount of scrap.

[[Image:EVAdapterLocatorDowel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Two of the spacers between the transmission dust cover and the central transfer plate use hollow locator dowels at each end. This is the transmission end, with the dowel projecting through the dust cover to enter precision holes in the bell housing or transmission fore-piece. A similar set of locators must be used between the transfer plate and the motor plate unless other precision locating means are provided.]]
[[Image:FlushDowelMotorSide.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The motor plate dowel is flush with the plate as this will be covered by a steel washer.]]
The motor in an ICE vehicle is typically kept in precise alignment with the transmission by two hollow dowel pins through which two of the mounting bolts are passed. These are usually press fitted into the motor block. It is the accurate locations of these dowel pins and the motor locator hole that are critical to the accuracy of the motor adapter plate. New hollow dowel pins (a set of four, rather than the two usually used in the ICE vehicle) are obtained from the parts department of the automobile dealer and are used to ensure precision alignment, both when drilling the matching pieces and when the components are assembled to the transmission.

Only the turning and boring of the cylindrical spacers and the fly-cutting or CNC milling of the motor mounting hole need be done using professional shop services; the remaining work may be done using simple but accurate machinist layout methods and a substantial [[w:en:Drill_press|drill press]]. Only the brave, cautious, patient, skillful and otherwise unemployed should consider making the motor hole to conform to an accurately scribed line using basic hand tools (this is possible, but not practical for most people). 

This fabrication requires the ability to accurately lay out and drill various holes. This layout is done by coating the portion to be marked with machinist's blue, which is then scribed with a pointed tool. (If no machinist's blue is available, candle smoke or whiteboard pen may be used if the resultant powder is &quot;fixed&quot; with a light lacquer such as common hair spray. The principle layout tools required are a good quality straightedge, a scribe, a divider, and either a large divider or a trammel scribe (a bar with a fixed pivot point and an adjustable scribe. These tools need not be purchased as they may be made by the constructor. They do not require accuracy, but rather rigidity, adjustability, and the ability to hold a setting. A good machinist's scale can be useful but is not required.

[[Image:EVTransferPlateGlue-up.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Glue-up to ease assembly. Note dowel pins and cut-away spacer to clear clutch actuator hydraulic slave cylinder.]]
There are only a few critical points of layout and cutting and drilling. These are the relative distance between the dowel pin receivers and the position relative to these of the central point. This central point must be aligned with the ''design center'' of the transmission drive shaft. This shaft is an extension of the transmission mainshaft that mounts about half of the gears within the transmission. The forward extension of this shaft carries the clutch drive splines and also has a small cylindrical protrusion called the ''pilot shaft'' that normally fits into a bearing carried in a receiver hole in the ICE crankshaft.

It is often the case that with a used transmission that the transmission drive shaft will have some play or wobble due to bearing wear, which is a good reason to replace this bearing or to have it replaced if it is practical to do so, along with the front bearing seal which should always be replaced when the transmission is out of the vehicle. Note that much of the noise produced by an electric vehicle conversion will come from this front transmission bearing and the transmission gears. A newly rebuilt transmission is recommended to obtain a quiet installation.

It will be best if the three critical points are laid out using the manufacture's design dimensions. If these cannot be obtained then the following procedure may be used:

First the approximate location of the three critical points are determined. The location of these relative to the stock used to make the plate is not critical, but the locations should allow the transmission plate to have some extra material on all sides of the transmission face.

An approximate location for a clearance hole for the transmission drive shaft may be determined by simple measurement from the dowel pin holes. Using a simple hole saw a clearance hole for the shaft is made, but ''only in the plate marked for the transmission''.  If the pilot shaft extends beyond the transmission face this hole will allow the pilot shaft to protrude when the transmission plate is against the transmission face. If the pilot shaft does not extend beyond the transmission face this will allow the pilot shaft to be viewed through the hole.
[[Image:EVAdapterPlateStack.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Build-up of plates and spacers on a spare bell housing (a transmission fore-piece, actually). It is very handy to have such a part as it is light and easy to handle and can be directly measured by a machinist to obtain the critical dimensions.]]
Determine an appropriate orientation for the plate, center the pilot shaft in the hole, and securely clamp the plate to the transmission with some '''C''' clamps.

Place some scrap wood pieces on a bench (if required for clearance of the protruding pilot shaft) and place the transmission with the clamped plate tailshaft up on on the bench. Using some spray machinist's bluing, lightly spray into the holes that carry the dowels. This is now an ''approximate'' marking for these holes. After the bluing dries, unclamp the transmission and set it aside. If you have not got a reasonable impression of the location of the dowel pin holes, clean the workpiece and repeat the procedure.

Scribe a line joining and crossing the centers of the two dowel pin locations scribe a perpendicular line across the center of one of ''one'' of the holes. Centerpunch this location.

The next scribe and punch mark establish a ''critical dimension'' requiring high accuracy. If not done accurately the transmission will not fit properly on the dowel pins that are to go into the holes determined by this mark. Place the dowel pins into the transmission. These pins will usually be beveled on their rim. Determine an appropriate reference place to measure on the pins Place a machinist's scale across the pins and determine the extreme distance ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; between the outer edges of the pins and the smaller distance ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; between the pins. Be sure to use the same concentric reference line relative to the pin - these may be the extreme measurements on the inside hole of the pin for example. The average of these measurements (''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/2 is the distance between the centers of the dowel pin holes. Transfer this measurement to the workpiece and scribe the location of the second hole. Do not centerpunch at this time.

Place the two workpieces together, with the transmission side of the transmission plate upward. Clamp at several places. With the drill press drill a pilot hole for  ''one'' of the holes through ''both'' workpieces. Redrill with the proper size for a press fit of the dowel pin. Mark the outside of the second workpiece (the surface facing down) as &quot;motor side&quot;. Unclamp and separate the pieces. Carefully press the dowel into the &quot;transmission side&quot; workpiece from the transmission side, allowing it to protrude through both sides. Placing this on the bench with the spacers you may now place the transmission on the plate with the dowel mating and the pilot shaft through the hole. You may then pivot the transmission on the plate to bring the second punch mark main scribe line to the center of the second dowel pin hole. The intersection of the scribe marks should be in the exact center of this hole. If not, rescribe as necessary and recheck. Now centerpunch the second hole. Clamp the work pieces with inside faces together , being sure that the dowel pin is engaged in both pieces. Pilot and finish drill for the second dowel and insert as with the first. The joined workpieces should now mount cleanly on the transmission using the dowel pins. If not, consider re-doing the second hole with a 90 degree re-orientation of the workpiece.

Next: Laying out the center.

Blue an area along the center of the transmission plate face from edge to edge on both sides and around the pilot shaft hole on the inside face. Erect a perpendicular to the base line joining the dowel pin  holes. This may be done from reference punch marks offset the same distance from each dowel pin on the base line. Strike several sets of arcs with the trammel or a large divider. Join the intersections of these pairs with a scribed line. Transfer this scribed line to the inside face of the transmission face. Alterntatively, you could drill a small (1.6 mm or smaller) hole at each of the two punch marks and scribe only on the inside face.

The goal is to find the center for the large motor locator hole on the motor side workpiece. This will be done indirectly by layout from the inside face of the transmission plate. To do this most easily prepare a fixture to hold the transmission vertically, or place it into a large box with blocking. (The transmission should first be drained of oil.) Spray or brush machinist's blue around pilot shaft hole on the ''inside face'' of the transmission plate. Place the transmission plate, inside face up, on the transmission, aligning with the dowel pins. You should observe that the pilot pin center lies very close to  the scribed centerline. As previously noted, there will be some wobble in the transmission drive shaft, so in the following it is important that the shaft is biased consistently for each scribe by applying the same pressure in each of several appropriate directions. Note that the front oil seal (especially since it is new) may apply a spring force before the bearing limit is obtained. We want to be working against the bearing limit, and so must first override any seal force. The end of the pilot shaft will have a small conical center hole, used to align the shaft as it was initially cut on a lathe when it was manufactured and when the splines were milled or broached. This center hole will  form the reference for one leg of the dividers used to make the scribe marks. Now it may be that the point of the divider may be pushed or pulled to one side or the other of this hole. As with the wobble, it is important that all scribes be made consistently by pulling the scribe to the side of the hole toward which the pilot shaft is pulled. We will assume here that this is in the direction of the scribe line. 

Set the dividers to a fixed distance of a few centimeters.

Pressing the pilot shaft, and puling the dividers, strike an arc at each of the cardinal directions - up, down, left, and right All scribe marks must use the same setting of the dividers. Remove the workpiece from the transmission. Lightly punch the intersection of the up and down arcs with the center line.

Blue the motor face of the motor mount plate at the center and let dry.

Now we will establish the center point on the motor mount plate. This will be done with the plate order reversed but not flipping the plates. The normal order would be to have the transmission face of the transmission plate down, the motor face of the motor plate up. Orienting the plates this way with the dowel pin holes aligned, shuffle the plates, aligning on the dowel pins and secure the plates with clamps. What is now seen is the inside face of the transmission plate its centerline and the pilot shaft scribe marks made in the preceding steps. Through the central pilot shaft hole is seen the unmarked center of the motor plate, recently blued. Set the dividers a bit longer than was used to scribe from the pilot shaft but not so much as to prevent the following scribing. From each of the light punch marks on the transmission plate scribe and arc on the motor plate through the hole. Separate the plates and mark a straight line across the intersections of the arcs. Reassemble and extend this line across the transmission plate to where it intercepts the left and right pilot shaft arcs. Lightly punch the intersection of these arcs with the line and from these punch marks scribe a pair of arcs onto he motor plate. Disassemble and join these arc intersections with a straight line. The intersection of the two lines is the desired motor center. Centerpunch this location.

Quality check: The motor center location should be consistently centered on the centerline scribe marks of the transmission plate when that plate is flipped, provided the transmission line center points are accurate.

This will form the center point for a flycutter or a simple CNC milling operation. You may want to have this work done at a machine shop. The other work that you may want to have done at a machine shop is lathe cutting of the spacer blocks.

Before cutting the motor hole, layout the bolt pattern for the attachment bolts. A typical motor will use four such bolts. The holes for the bolts may be of lesser precision that that for the main motor hole but should not bind against the bolts. The bolt pattern must be aligned properly so that the motor cabling is presentable in the proper orientation. Typically a square pattern (relative to up) is used, not a diamond pattern. With this layout complete you may drill the mounting holes or this may be postponed until after the major hole is machined.

The motor mount hole must be cut to a precise diameter to fit the alignment boss on the motor. If it comes out undersize it will be necessary to enlarge it while retaining its accurate positioning, which can be diffiicult. If it comes out oversize this may be corrected by appropriate precision shims which are a nuisance to maintain in position. Obviously it is far better to get it right the first time.

Before cutting the center motor hole, it is now appropriate to drill the remaining transmission mount holes in both plates. Be sure to mate the two plates in the proper orientation, to each other. You may want to mount the plates to the transmission, bolting at the dowel pins and clamping elsewhere. You may then scribe inside the holes or use a cut and sharpened shoulder bolt, twirled to make a small circle. Removing the plates, clamp them together and through pilot drill and finish drill with the drill press. Remount and check clearance by inserting shoulder bolts in every hole.

Upon completion of the motor hole this may be used to scribe a hole mark on the transmission plate. This may then be rough cut on the outside of the line using a sabre saw. The purpose of this hole is for clearance around the coupling. You may want to make this hole substantially larger as it will facilitate access to the motor attachment bolts. The outline of the transmission face may be marked on the appropriate side of the transmission plate and the excess metal removed, largely for appearance. This removal may be required in only a few specific locations. A similar removal may be performed on the motor side plate

(More detailed procedure is to be provided here)

For this type of adapter plate there will be open space between the stand-offs. To keep gravel, water, and mud from the clutch this area is closed off by selecting plastic buckets of appropriate size and cutting rings to fit in between the plates.

Upon completion of the face plates and the spacer billets the bluing may be cleaned off and the plates assembled to the transmission using bolts. A thin adhesive such as cyanoacrilate (CA, or &quot;super glue&quot;) may be flowed between the spacers and the face plates to hold everything in place (''do not glue the transmission to the adapter''). When the bolts are removed the entire adapter will  hold together in one piece - a convenience when assembling the motor-adapter-transmission unit.

[[Image:PilotShaftGuideTool.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical pilot shaft guide tool]]
If the motor with the coupler mounted may now be mated to the adapter plate. Then the flywheel and clutch assembly is attached to the adapter. If the clutch plate has been out of the assembly it must be aligned using a pilot shaft tool to alight the plate when the pressure plate is bolted to the flywheel. This is required so that the pilot shaft and splines will  properly engage the clutch center splnes when the transmission is inserted. The transmission may now be mounted - it may be necessary still to slightly rotate the flywheel to obtain engagement of the clutch  splines. The transmission may now be bolted up against the adapter using bolts of appropriate length plane washers and lock washers on both sides.

After mounting the transmission, do not forget to replace the oil!

===The coupling and pilot bearing ===
The coupling transmits the motor torque to the flywheel or to the automatic transmission flex plate. This must be strong and accurate and is almost always purchased complete or made by a professional machinist rather than fabricated by the builder. Most couplings do not provide a pilot shaft bearing since this is usually incorporated into the flywheel. While some clutchless adapters have been designed without a transmission pilot shaft bearing, this bearing is critical to long transmission life and should always be included, either as part of the coupling or as an adapter that is part of the coupling assembly.

The pilot bearing in an ICE vehicle is usually a needle bearing, as this must take many turns as the engine idles. In the electric conversion, this bearing may be made of lubricated brass or bronze, since there is far less relative motion between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft.

===The flywheel===
[[Image:CutdownEVFlywheel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Motor side of lightened flywheel with pilot bearing installed. Angle iron is bolted on transmission side to prevent rotation while tightening coupling bolts.]]
[[Image:EVFlywheelSideView.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Edge view shows a conservative and low cost reduction for this application. Material removed with a lathe. Unused bosses on the pressure plate side could also be removed by milling.]]
[[Image:EVFlywheelTorqueSetup.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Angle iron (cut from part of a bedframe) bolted to the flywheel to prevent rotation when bolts are torqued.]]
For vehicles using a manual transmission, the motor drives a flywheel, a large disk. For the electric vehicle conversion the flywheel is needed only to mount the clutch, if a cluch is used at all. The outer rim of this disk will have a gear ring shrunk or welded on, intended to be driven by the starter gear. The after face of the flywheel mounts the clutch and forms one face of the two surfaces driving the clutch disk. The flywheel will have substantial weight to allow the ICE motor to idle smothly at low speed. Rarely, this flywheel may have been balanced as a unit with the crankshaft, in which case it may be considerably out of balance for this new application. The extra weight required for ICE smoothness reduces acceleration and the energy to spin it cannot be easily recovered, adding to brake wear. For these reasons it is appropriate to lighten and balance the flywheel, which is done with specialized tools at an automotive machine shop. This may be lighted considerably more than is the case for ICE performance enhancement. Further, the starter ring is no longer used so it may be removed for a further weight saving except where this contributes to flywheel strength. Do not remove so much material that the flywheel becomes weak. Weight removed at the periphery will be more effective in enhancing performance and will also reduce loading on the inner portion, which may be made correspondingly light. If the outer portion that contains the treads for the pressure plate mounting screws is thinned excessively it will be necessary to use nuts to secure the bolts that hold the pressure plate to the flywheel. In this case it must be possible to access these nuts in some way in order to complete the assembly of the components. An appropriate access port in the forward face of the central transfer plate should be provided, or an access from the side via a penetration of the cylindrical dust shrouds.

===The clutch===
Some electric vehicles do not use clutches with their manual transmissions. Such installations offer greater acceleration, lacking the rotational inertia of the clutch disk, pressure plate, and the flywheel mounting the pressure plate. Such systems require accurate shifting to avoid damage to the transmission and are not recommended for a casual use vehicle.

The clutch should have sufficient closing spring force to avoid slippage in normal operation. It should be practical in most cases to use a stock clutch and springs. Other considerations apply to a high performance vehicle for racing, some employing triple copper plate racing clutches.

===Using an automatic transmission===
An unmodified transmission is usually not recommended for an EV conversion owing to the inefficiencies and rotational mass associated with the torque converter and a missmatch between the normal operating speeds of an ICE engine and the replacement electric motor. Furthermore, automatic transmissions typically depend on the engine's idling rotation to maintain the transmission in a ready state. Older automatic transmissions will use a considerable amount of energy to operate the transmission's oil pump. This pump produces pressure to operate hydraulic pistons that engage the clutch bands around the planetary gearsets. Some automatic transmissions have been converted by using a properly machined splined spool to replace the torque converter, in effect forming a permanent converter lock-up condition. A particular advantage to using an automatic transmission is the presence of a parking pawl, which prevents vehicle motion when the vehicle is not operating, as a supplement to the parking brake. Shifting should be performed manually at reduced throttle since there is no longer the cushioning effect of the torque converter.

===The motor mount===
The motor must be securely fastened to the frame. Depending upon the original mounting configuration it may be possible to use or adapt the existing mount supports to the motor support band. It is not necessary to use the highly flexible mountings that were used with the ICE as the electric motor does not produce the periodic vibrations prevalent in an ICE. On the other hand, hard mounting a DC motor can transmit transmission noises to the frame which may be effectively absorbed by a softer mounting. Note that the transmission can produce high twisting forces and so some portion of the motor-transmission unit must be secured against rotation. This may require a separate torque arm or a mounting using extensions on the adapter plate.

==Separate from passenger compartment==
It is considered highly desirable to separate the traction batteries completely from the passenger compartment. As the batteries form a substantial portion of the vehicle weight it is very desirable to place the batteries as low as possible in the vehicle as this enhances stability, greatly reducing the probability of rollover. Owing to the bulk of the batteries and particularly their height, this placement can be quite inconvenient in most vehicles. This is why light trucks are strongly preferred as conversion vehicles as they can offer substantial volume around the frame rails without adversely reducing ground clearance.

==Protected from road hazards ==
For any vehicle the protection of the batteries from road contact or road debris must be carefully considered. While it is good to place the weight as low as possible the batteries should not be directly exposed to road hazards. The cases on modern batteries are relatively thin and if the plates of a cell are damaged they can overheat from the short circuit. The internal contents of most batteries are also hazardous.

Note that more than just the bottoms and sides of the batteries should be protected, since if it is possible for a conductive piece of road trash to be flipped to the terminal part of the batteries this could create a shock hazard or a short circuit and possibly a fire.

== Battery security ==
The batteries must be well-secured to the vehicle. This is very important, since a loose battery might cause contact between the terminals and some part of the vehicle, causing a dangerous short circuit and potentially a fire or battery explosion. A pull-up security factor of 4[[w:en:Standard gravity|g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] is recommended; that is, the battery mounts should withstand negative forces of four times the battery weight, for security in case the vehicle rolls over in an accident.

==Battery access==
The batteries must be accessible for testing, cleaning, replacement, tightening of connections, and periodic service where this is required (such as the addition of water to wet cells).

==Weight distribution==
Battery location is one of the most important factors determining vehicle functionality and safety. If the batteries are placed low in the vehicle it will have less tendency to tip and rollover. If too much weight is distributed to the front the vehicle will be hard to steer without power steering and the vehicle will be somewhat unresponsive. If too far to the rear the vehicle may be unstable in hard turns, tending to &quot;swap ends&quot;, although for specialty performance cars (such as are used in autocross racing) this &quot;oversteer&quot; may be an advantage when controlled by a well trained and experienced driver.

===Moment of inertia===
For purpose-built vehicles and some electric truck conversions, it is advantageous for handling to concentrate the battery mass near the center of the vehicle. This may be done by placing the batteries in a tray between the frame rails, in a center console, or in a &quot;saddlebag&quot; configuration on each side of the passenger compartment. In a custom built vehicle a center console may also contain batteries.

For conversions of most common passenger and sports cars there is insufficient centrally located volume for batteries. As it is considered undesirable to place batteries within the passenger compartment this will usually lead to a &quot;dog bone&quot; configuration. Batteries will be placed both in the front compartment and a rear compartment (the latter created sometimes by raising the floor of the trunk, using the location of the original gas tank. This configuration can be particularly effective in earlier Volkswagen models such as the original &quot;beetle&quot; and the type 3, since separate compartments are built into the vehicle for luggage storage (in the front) and the motor and its cooling fan (in the rear). Owing to the distribution of mass the vehicle will have a high polar moment of inertia. This will assist it to track well on straight line highways but will reduce its nimbleness in other road conditions.

===Height of center of mass===
It is highly desirable to place the batteries low in the vehicle while protecting them from road hazards. 

If a light truck is converted the batteries should be between the frame rails or in a dropped battery box setting atop the rails at their low point (not at the &quot;kick up&quot; over the rear axle) but with their bottoms below bed level. This is especially important if a truck with taller ride height is used. Most light trucks are available in a two wheel drive version that will sit fairly low and sometimes these are available in long frame models (such as the Mazda B-2000 &quot;Sundowner&quot;). Other examples include trucks from Mazda, Nissan, Toyota, Ford Courier  (a re-badged Mazda), the Chevrolet S-10, and the GMC S-15.  In long frame light trucks a long bed version, rather than a short bed&amp;mdash;long cab is preferred unless extensive cab modifications are to be made for isolated battery placement. Note that it is important that the batteries be protected from road hazards and that the exposed connections at the tops of the batteries are not exposed to trash flipped up from road level.

Many light truck converters install a hydraulic bed lift - intended to convert the pickup into a light dump truck. This allows easy access to battery boxes below the bed.&lt;br&gt;
:''Caution: If such a system is installed this must include a positive mechanical up lock, so that the batteries may be safely accessed without relying on the hydraulic system to keep the bed up.''

==Vehicle service electrical system==
The twelve volt system is maintained to operate the headlights and various running lights, instruments, radio, heater fan, and other components common to the ICE vehicle. This low voltage is also used to control both low and high voltage relays required by the EV conversion.

===Using an auxiliary battery===
A much smaller battery may be used as it is not necessary to crank an ICE to start it, so the large battery may be replaced with a motorcycle, garden tractor or similar battery with much less weight and capacity of that which came with the car. The additional space may be used for an EV component such as a power brake booster pump or the 12 volt converter that keeps this battery charged. The addition of a 12 volt battery of modest size greatly simplifies satisfying the basic electrical requirements of the vehicle and allows a relatively small capacity DC-DC converter to be used, since this need not supply peak current requirements. The battery should be large enough to provide several hours of emergency flasher or parking light use, a requirement that may be beyond the capabilities of a motorcycle battery. A typical installation will only charge the battery through the DC-DC converter when the vehicle is in operation. If the usage pattern for the vehicle includes long times at rest with automatic (timed) recharge you may find it desirable to activate the converter during the charge cycles. A system that is float charged for long periods could include a separate 12 volt float charge device, sold for use with vehicles that are infrequently driven.

Some means of operating the converter to recharge a dead auxiliary battery may be provided using a separate push-button for emergency bypass of the converter relays. The converter will then provide enough power to close the relays, even while the battery is being charged. As these are usually 12 volt relays, an EV with a dead service  battery will be immobile since no voltage will be available to pull in the relays - even though the traction pack is fully charged. A conventional &quot;jump start&quot; from another vehicle will solve the problem.  (It is possible to work around the situation using some wires, clamps, and a small portion of the traction pack, but that can be dangerous and/or damaging if not very carefully performed.)

===Without an auxiliary battery===
Some builders eliminate the auxiliary battery, using only a DC-DC converter to produce the required 12 volt output. For a vehicle intended for street and highway operation this will require a high capacity converter. This method has the advantage of eliminating the weight of the auxiliary battery.
*This requires the use of some relays operating at the pack voltage.
*The DC-DC converter must produce enough power to operate all electrical loads - the headlights, turn signals, horn, emergency flashers, heater fan, radio, and any other loads such as a spotlight - simultaneously and without failure.
*Power must also be provided for parking lights, turn signals, and emergency flashers without the presence of the ignition key in case the vehicle must be left alongside the road for some reason. An auxiliary switch may be provided for this emergency function but this must not be left on in normal use, so an associated warning light should be included in the installation.

==Accessories==

===Power steering===
If power steering is incorporated this is often done by driving a conventional pump with an additional small motor. The power steering pump may be driven directly from the traction motor, as can the air conditioning. Since the traction motor is stopped when the accelerator pedal is not depressed (unlike an ICE which &quot;idles&quot;) special techniques will be necessary to drive the power steering when parking. Due to the complexity and inefficiencies power steering is not usually included in a conversion if the vehicle is suitably light. Note that if the original vehicle is equipped with power steering then it should be powered owing to fact that the ratios used in power steering units will lead to rather high wheel forces when the device is not powered. For this reason, vehicles with manual (unpowered) steering units are preferred. Some recent production ICE (e .g. late models of the Saturn) and particularly [[w:en:Hybrid_vehicle|hybrid vehicles]] use electric powered steering, a solution well suited for an EV conversion, but not readily available as of 2005.

===Air conditioning===
While production electric and hybrid vehicles have been provided with electric air conditioners this modern equipment is not generally available in a converted vehicle. Some versions of propulsion motors include a front end shaft that may be used as an accessory drive, and vehicles have been converted to use the existing air conditioning pump. An alternative is to drive the pump with an auxiliary motor as described for power steering above.

===Heater===
The typical ICE heater uses waste heat from the engine cooling system. The fluid circulated through the heater may be warmed by an electric resistance heater and circulated with an auxiliary pump. It is more usual in a conversion to provide heat by replacing the water radiator (heater core) with a ceramic resistance heater. The parts and materials for this conversion are available from EV conversion suppliers although for a reasonable range of pack voltages (96 to 120 volts) a common ceramic core space heater may be adapted. As this will likely require bringing pack voltage into the passenger cab the installation must be done with care to avoid creating a fire or shock hazard. A heavy duty relay is required for power control and is typically actuated by both fan operation and an intermediate or higher heat control setting. Thermostatic control is seldom included but would be appropriate for colder climates.

===Radio===
Radios are sensitive to electrical noise from the motor controller and the service voltage (12 volt) power converter. This noise can come through the receiver as radio frequency interference (RFI) or through the power supply as noise on the 12 volt system. A satisfactory radio installation is one of the most difficult conversion tasks to complete.

==Primary safety==

===Unit body rust===
Rust problems in a vehicle can be expensive and difficult to correct. Recent vehicles have been substantially improved in their corrosion resistance, using zinc plated metal and full dip priming. Older vehicles do not have this quality of build and may be subject to rust. This is especially important in unit body construction, where thin sheet metal provides the primary structure of the vehicle. This is another reason to convert a light truck - almost all are built with a sturdy frame to which the battery load may be transferred.

===Tires and wheels===
A selection of wheel and tire combination must respect both the weight and intended use of the vehicle and its expected loads. A low rolling resistance is desirable, obtained usually by choosing an appropriate belted radial passenger car tire. For light trucks this means using a tire intended for a rather heavy sedan, rather than one designed for a light truck, assuming that the vehicle is intended to be used on improved roads. For a light vehicle it will be necessary to use wheels and tires suitable for this weight, which may not be available as standard equipment, and suitable tires may not fit the wheels that are on the vehicle. As more popular vehicles will have a wider choice of aftermarket wheels and tires this might influence the choice of vehicle to convert.

The converter should resist the urge to add a wide stance to the vehicle by selecting a wheel with a greater rim offset. As with ICE vehicles this added offset can upset the carefully designed steering geometry and imposes additional stress on spindles and axles. On top of this, the conversion will carry weight near the maximum vehicle capacity at all times, imposing additional stress on the suspension components.

===Suspension===
The additional weight of the batteries will cause compression of the springs which in most vehicles will change the suspension geometry. This will also reduce the space available for suspension travel. Such compression might be rarely encountered in an ICE vehicle as it corresponds to the maximum load. In an electric vehicle this load will be present at all times, so the suspension travel and geometry should be restored by various modifications.

====Ground clearance====
It may be desired to restore normal ground clearance, especially important if the batteries are between the frame rails of a truck or similar vehicle. Under other circumstances such as the creation of a sports electric vehicle a low ground clearance may be desirable as it can reduce aerodynamic drag and reduce rollover tendencies. A low ground clearance may also be considered as a styling element.

====Spring rate and spring force====

Spring force is the amount of force applied by the spring at is normally loaded condition. If weight is added to the vehicle the springs will compress until the necessary force is obtained or the suspension &quot;bottoms out&quot;, by resting on the &quot;snubber pads&quot; that prevent metal&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;metal contact at full travel.

Spring rate is the additional force applied by the spring for each unit measure of spring compression.
Additional spring rate is used to prevent excess compression of the suspension due to road bumps and to reduce the tendency of the vehicle to lean in turns. Additional spring rate is especially important if the suspension travel is reduced as part of the vehicle's styling and handling modifications.

Additional spring force may be obtained by several means:
* Air adjustable shock absorbers.
* Coil spring over shocks. (&quot;coilover shocks&quot;)
* Stronger coil springs.
* Air bladder within coil springs. These are adjustable with air pressure but require that the shock absorber is mounted outside of the coil.
* Additional leaf in leaf springs. This is a common modification to truck suspensions.
* Coil spring shims. This does not increase spring rate as do the methods above. Note that full suspension travel plus bump pad compression must be available, so this may not be a practical solution)

====Shock absorber damping rate====
When the spring rate is increased then the damping rate applied by the shock absorbers should also be increased. If the suspension modifications are by use of coil-over or air adjustable shocks then the appropriate damping may be obtained by proper equipment selection. Some high end shock absorbers allow the damping rate to be adjusted statically (by mechanical adjustments on the shock absorber).

====Integrated struts====
[[w:en:McPherson_strut|McPherson struts]] are commonly used in the front suspensions of lower priced modern sedans and coupes. These struts use a robust coil&amp;ndash;over shock absorber to perform four functions:

* To maintain suspension geometry by controlling camber and caster by its relationship to a single lower A&amp;ndash;arm
* To provide suspension travel
* To provide suspension damping
* To allow steering motion of the front wheels

In some suspensions the coil spring is separate from the strut and bears on the lower A&amp;ndash;arm.

A similar device, the [[w:en:Chapman_strut|Chapman strut]] is used in the rear of some sports cars (such as the [[w:en:Fiat_X1/9|Fiat X1/9]]). The ability to obtain specialty racing equipment replacements for these struts should be considered when selecting a light car for conversion. Only a limited number of performance vehicles will have high rate or adjustable struts available. Where such components are available it will likely be possible to also obtain high performance brake components.

===Brakes===

====Brake capacity====
Since the vehicle should never be driven if the total vehicle/passenger/cargo weight is above the manufacturer's GVWR, it might be considered that is no need for brake upgrades. Without energy recovery or dynamic braking there is not the retarding force of engine compression, so greater brake wear is to be expected, and brake overheating on a long downgrade is a possibility. For this reason higher performance brakes are preferred in an EV conversion, specifically the use of disk brakes at the front of the vehicle.

====Vacuum brake boost system====
With the heavy additional weight associated with the batteries it is important that heavier vehicles be equipped with [[w:en:Power_brake|power brakes]]. As these are (typically) operated by engine intake manifold [[w:en:Vacuum|vacuum]] a conversion will require a vacuum [[w:en:Pump|pump]] and a chamber to act as a reservoir.  Additional control circuitry with vacuum switch(s) and relay(s) to regulate the pump motor is also required and is documented in another section of this book. Pumps may be obtained for EV use from specialty suppliers and some older production ICE vehicles used factory installed pumps. 

For a list of production ICE vehicles with vacuum pumps see [http://www.california.com/~eagle/figs/vacpump/vac.html this site].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;''Note the presence of '''hazardous materials and conditions''' that must be approached with proper precautions and procedures to avoid damaging, injurious, or even fatal consequences.''&lt;/big&gt;

==Traction pack==

===Pack isolation===
No part of the primary traction pack should be grounded (electrically connected to the chassis). Should any portion become  grounded this is a single fault and while creating a potential hazard is not in itself damaging. By so &quot;floating&quot; the traction pack a single transient bridging event between  any portion of the pack and the body or frame will not create a danger of fire or spark (but can create shock hazards at other locations). Periodic safety testing should be performed ensure that this isolation is maintained. This is easily done by measuring the voltage to the vehicle chassis from at least two different potential points of the pack. This measurement should be zero.

===Isolation and transformerless chargers===
[[Image:WPEVCContactorCharge.png|left|thumb|200px|click for key to drawing, additional drawings, and warnings and disclaimers]]
Lightweight chargers for charging battery banks below the line voltage are not isolated from the AC source since they have no transformers - they apply AC neutral to one side of the pack through a bridge rectifier and AC ground to the chassis. Any conduction between the pack and the chassis will create a potential shock hazard that is detected by the ground fault detector on the AC side of the charger, which then triggers and stops the charge. It is not possible to properly use such a charger unless the pack is properly isolated. Since an aging DC motor can have small current leakage due to the accumulation of conductive dust from brush wear it is best if the pack is isolated from the controller and motor during charging - this is one of the reasons for using both dual contactors and switchable pre-charge resistors as shown in the diagram at left. If such a well isolated pack causes a ground fault when a charge is attempted the likely cause is some battery leakage or spilling of electrolyte causing a conductive path to the chassies, which (if the case is not perforated) may be corrected by cleaning the battery with a solution of sodium bicarbonate (for acid type batteries), or weak acetic acid (for base type batteries), followed by a water rinse and drying.

==Operating disconnect==

===The contactors===
[[Image:Contactor200AmpSealed.jpg|thumb|right|175px|200 Ampere continuous sealed contactor (suitable for medium performance applications - click for partial specifications)]]
Contactors (robust relays) make the connection between the battery pack and the controller and motor. They are powered by a 12 volt DC source provided by a &quot;run&quot; circuit and provide disconnection when the vehicle is not in use. These contactors are normally opened by a spring and are drawn closed by a solenoid operated by the vehicle's twelve volt service battery through wiring called the ''run circuit''.

By using electrically controlled contactors it becomes possible to disconnect immediately upon detection of a collision (this task is performed by routing the ignition or run circuit through an [[w:en:inertial_switch|inertial switch]] (one is shown below)). It is highly desirable to install a disconnect at each side of the pack, forming a redundant circuit. The disconnection of both sides allows the battery pack to be completely isolated from the controller and motor during charging, reducing the probabililty of ground faulting through the motor or controller on the charger AC line. (Brushed DC motors produce a fine conductive dust from brush wear which can lead to minor ground fault conditions in damp conditions sufficient to trigger an AC GFCI device.) ''Addtional isolation may be required where a contactor pre-charge is otherwise always on as shown in the preceeding section concerning charger control.''

By removing the twelve volt source the contactors will open. This should not be done while the vehicle is operating under power except in emergency as this will cause arcing and wear on the contactor. The contactor(s) are actuated by the &quot;run&quot; circuit, activated by the vehicle's ignition and start keyswitch positions. One of the contactors will be bypassed by a ''controller precharge resistor''. This resistor will charge the input capacitors of the controller to prevent a damaging inrush current that can weld the contactor closed and so making it ineffective as a safety and turn-off device. For isolation of the motor during charging these resistors should be in a circuit that is open during charging. This is simply performed by putting the resistors on the normally closed contacts of a double pole, double throw (DPDT) relay with an AC coil powered by the charger AC mains voltage. The normally open contacts of this relay may be used to apply the charger output to the battery side of the each contactor, although it is more common to permanently connect the charger to the battery pack through appropriate fuses.

At least one of the contactors should be located close to the battery pack in order to provide effective protection to the cable runs from the pack to the motor and controller should a collision be detected.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;Caution:&lt;br&gt;If a contactor is above or within the battery compartment&lt;br&gt; then the contactor must be a sealed, explosion proof type.&lt;br&gt; ''Open frame'' contactors can create a spark&lt;br&gt; which could ignite hydrogen gas.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Traction pack fuse or circuit breaker===
The pack must also be fused close to  the pack. The preferred location (and required for racing applications) is in the electrical center of the pack. This may be done also by a high quality circuit breaker, which can be advantageous as it can also perform manual switching operations to easily isolate the pack for vehicle maintenance, reducing the need for a manual disconnect.

===Traction pack switch===
A physical switch should be provided that prevents current flow through the system. For racing applications this is required by NEDRA regulations to be accessible from outside of the vehicle.

===Manual disconnect===
The conversion should have some means of manually disconnecting the pack on at least one side to make the system safe for maintenance, even if a circuit breaker is included. This may be done by providing a wing nut to attach one of the battery cables, although a circuit breaker, high currrent connector or switch is better, since an insufficiently tight battery connection can cause the lead post of the battery to overheat and melt. Alternatively, the battery connections may be opened using a wrench. Any tools used around the batteries should be well insulated and short enough to reduce the possibility of creating an accidental short circuit

===Controller pre-charge===
The controller will be seen by the battery and contactor as a large capacitor. The inrush current to charge this capacitor can cause an arc when the contactor is closed and this can in turn cause contactor point pitting and wear. In the worst case this inrush current can cause the contactor to weld in the shut position. If combined with some failure of the controller, dashpot, or accelerator pedal mechanics this could cause an uncontrollable acceleration of the vehicle. The welding of the contacts is avoided by bypassing the contactor with a resistor which allows the controller capacitance to be charged to close to the pack voltage prior to contactor closure. As the controller appears as a high series resistance in parallel with a high capacitance (and so not drawing much current after the precharge), many installations permanently bypass the contactor(s) with this resistor. Note that this is not as safe as it might otherwise be since pack voltage is present at the controller and within the passenger cab even when the contactors are open, and the controller capacitors can provide significant current for a moment.

Alternatively, the pre-charge may be applied with the ignition voltage when the key is turned to the Run position. By connecting the pack voltage meter across the controller then this pre-charge may be observed and the full charge noted on the voltmeter prior to engaging the start switch. This requires operator attention, however and so is not the best solution.

A better configuration is to make the pre-charge current from this resistor flow through a startup sequence relay. This is a sensitive relay that opens when the pre-charge current drops to some low value. In combination with a secondary contactor at the pack this ensures that the motor compartment does not present exposed any pack voltage beyond the contactors when the system is in the &quot;off&quot; state. To prevent arcing due to hasty operation (quickly turning the key from &quot;off&quot; to &quot;start&quot;) an additional sense circuit must be added to ensure that the primary contactor is not closed until the pre-charge is complete. If a secondary contactor is used then  it does not need to be bypassed for pre-charge (since it cannot carry current until the primary contactor is closed) but it must be closed directly by the ignition circuit so that the pre-charge circuit can operate.

==Collision sense==
[[Image:InertialSwitch.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Inertial switch (reset to closed by pushing through the flexible red cover)]]
A motion sensitive switch can be used to disable the ignition, which may then be manually reset to restore operation to the system. In the event of a severe bump, overturn, or collision this will disable a portion of the run circuit, removing the pull in voltage from the contactors. This will reduce  the likelihood of a high current short circuit and its consequences. The opening of the contactors will also disable other circuits using pack voltage such as the cabin heater and the 12 volt converter, providing additional protection. Contactors have a limited cycle life when breaking the circuit under load, so this system should not be subject to triggering except under severe conditions. A collision sense switch may be tested for proper operation when off throttle, however, by dismounting and directly manipulating the sensor. According to instructions provided with this sensor the sensor should be mounted on a panel that is rigid, preferably near a corner, in order to avoid false triggering from body flex when the vehicle is driven over bumps. It is also recommended that the inertial switch be located inside of the driver cabin so that it is not necessary to exit the vehicle to reset it.

==Charger ground fault detection and protection==
It is extremely important that both the charger and the mains outlet or charging station to which it is connected have proper ground fault protection. Proper mains charging connection to an EV requires at least three and sometimes four wires.  In North American wiring a supply of 110 volts to a charger requires three wire; a &quot;hot&quot; (black wire at 110 or so volts, carrying the current), &quot;neutral&quot; (white wire at zero volts but carrying the supplied current to complete the circuit) and &quot;ground&quot; (green wire, connected to the equipment supplied at one end and to both neutral and a ground rod at the supply panel but acting only as a safety). A &quot;ground fault&quot; is detected when the supplied current (&quot;hot lead&quot;) does not match the returned current &quot;neutral lead&quot;) within the tolerance of a &quot;ground fault interrupter&quot;. Note that this does not rely on the return of the fault current through the ground (green) lead - such fault can be created by a return through the earth, the ground lead being provided to cause an immediate ground fault (or to blow a fuse or trip a circuit breaker) under certain fault conditions, such as a short between the hot lead and the body on a vehicle insulated from earth by its rubber tires. Ground fault interrupters are designed to operate when the difference in current flow is less than that likely to cause a hazard to a person, triggering at about 5 miliamperes, and are designed to operate very rapidly. Similar considerations apply to 220 volt systems. 220 volt systems provide two phases, sent through red and black wires, with a balancing neutral (white). The ground safety is conducted by a green wire, forming a four wire system. While on-board chargers typically have a ground fault detector built in, this detector cannot respond to &quot;upstream&quot; faults such as one created by an exposed wire in the extension cord providing the AC power. For this reason, only a ground fault protected outlet should be used. If a long extension cord is usually carried then a ground fault protective unit may be added to the plug (male) end of the cord. It is also advantageous to include a switch or a switchable current limiting circuit breaker at this point. That allows the connection to be made to the vehicle using an unpowered extension, with the power then turned on near the AC supply point. '''Portable GFCI interrupters must be used with a grounded outlet to obtain the maximum protection.'''

==Charging station ground fault protection==
Charging stations using Avcon paddles or large or small inductive loops will have a ground fault detector built in. The Avcon units detect circuit completion by use of a resistor and diode between the neutral and ground, and so it is not practical to connect such a unit to a GFCI circuit as it will trigger the upstream fault detector during the charge start cycle. For this reason such charging stations are suitable only for permanent installation. Any non-GFCI protected wiring connecting the charging station to the AC supply panel must be in conduit or armored flexible cable.

==Pack voltage subsystem fuses==
Systems that use or provide pack voltage include:
*Charger (twenty to thirty amps or more)
*Twelve volt converter (twenty amps, more or less)
*Heater (thirty amps)
*Voltmeter (very low current)

Such systems are connected to the large main power wires at both positive and negative. Unlike conventional automotive wiring, which only fuses the positive side, safety dictates that ''both'' sides be fused. This is required since the battery system is floated from ground and a fault to the chassies on one side can bring the opposite polarity to the pack voltage relative to the chassies. A subsequent (or latent) fault the subsystem could overheat the wire if not fused. The fuse should be placed where the wire size steps down, with specific fuses (and appropriate ratings) for each device and the wire supplying power to the device. Since an EV will probably have fuses distributed physically over the vehicle the documentation should include a ''fuse map'', or subsystem component locations should be located on the appropriate circuit diagram.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;''Note the presence of '''hazardous materials and conditions''' that must be approached with proper precautions and procedures to avoid damaging, injurious, or even fatal consequences.''&lt;/big&gt;

It is possible to build an EV conversion without the safeties shown below. These safeties are intended to assist and protect the casual driver - one who may not be informed of the limitations or quirks of the conversion or a driver with long experience and ingrained habits. The goal of these safeties is to reduce the chance of improper operation by a driver and should always be included in any EV conversion.

==System ready indicator==
Some visual indication of system readyness should be provided, since there will be no noise or vibration from an idling engine. Often a converter will simply ensure that the low battery light will be illuminated whenever accessory power is available. More sophisticated systems will illuminate a ready light when the ''run circuit'' is active. If provided, this run light may be configured to illuminate at a lower brightness when running at night. The run circuit may also be routed to a dashboard voltmeter. By providing a push-button that switches this voltmeter to a constant battery circuit (e. g. the clock power), this meter may also be used to partially diagnose non-starting conditions.

==Vacuum control==
[[Image:WPEVVacuumControl.png|thumb|left|200px|Vacuum control circuit logical and physical wiring diagrams. Click for theory of operation.]]
For vehicles with vacuum operated power brakes it is necessary to include a vacuum pump and vacuum reservoir, check valve, pump, pump control, and pump power. Vacuum pumps are powered from the twelve volt vehicle service, usually provided by an auxiliary battery. The circuit illustrated is complex but of low cost. A single vacuum sense unit may be obtained from specialty suppliers which has separate on and off adjustable setpoints, eliminating the need for several relays.

==Vacuum alarm==
A separate vacuum sensing switch should be used to alert the driver of low vacuum. This should activate just below the low limit of the vacuum pump control turn-on setting. This can be connected to an existing unused warning light such the parking brake/dual brake differential alarm light or some other available indicator such as the low oil warning light (provided when no oil pressure gauge is provided and not needed in an EV) or may be directed to a newly installed indicator. Most indicator lights in modern vehicles provide power to one side of the lamp at the instrument cluster and route the other side to ground the indicator circuit at the distant sensor(s) to illuminate the warning. The addition of a low vacuum acoustic alarm enabled after the initial start pump-up is also appropriate. A vacuum gauge is essential for setting the vacuum switch control points and may be included permanently as a dashboard or underhood instrument.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Startup circuit==
[[Image:WPEVStartRun.png|thumb|left|200px|Start-Run circuit diagram, click for text and additional drawings]]
The goal is to make the vehicle operate safely and to be started using the ''Start'' keyswitch position - similar to a conventional ICE vehicle. The continuation of the run state here requires that the vehicle's ICE ignition circuit be active to operate, enabling the keyswitch to be used to reliably shut off the system. The start-run circuit should control application of pack voltage throughout the system by activating the main contactors and by applying pack voltage to the twelve volt converter. This will also control the operation of the vacuum pump, which from a cold start (zero vacuum) also offers the effect of an acoustic signal that the vehicle has started, but is not yet ready for service until the low vacuum warning is off.

The startup circuit is disabled by the charge-door-open sense, AC power-applied relay (if installed), and the off-throttle detector switch, and the clutch-depressed or transmission-neutral switch. With appropriate configuration of the startup circuit any of these error conditions should cause an alarm condition and acoustic alert if a start is attempted. Note that once running, any open start interlock will not cause the system to halt.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Charge door open sense===
The goal of this sensor is to reduce the likelihood that the vehicle will be driven off while connected to the charging source. For connectors that are locking (such as twist lock or paddle connectors) this can cause severe damage to the equipment or the structure to which it is attached. Note that if the access door circuitry is damaged in a collision it may then not be possible to move the vehicle. For this reason the door sense switch wiring should include a bypass disconnect to be used in case of emergency (this is not a switch but rather a pair of properly polarized wire connectors). This door sensor is made a part of the '''start-run''' circuit in series with other interlocks.. A magnetic reed switch (normally closed when close to an appropriate magnet) can offer simplicity in mounting. A simple, though unreliable, technique for mounting magnets and switches is to use the sticky outdoor tape used for adhering house numbers (e.g. 3M outdoor tape), backed up by a plastic &quot;zip tie&quot; through small drilled holes. The tape holds the positioning of the device and the zip tie ensures against tape failure or mechanical disturbance. This method is considerably faster and simpler than using screws or nuts and bolts. If mounting places are not conveniently located in the vehicle then a soft aluminum strip of 1/16 to 1/8 inch thickness can be formed and attached to the vehicle to make a mounting for the switch or magnet.

===AC power applied relay===
Some vendors sell an AC relay, intended to prevent operation while AC power is applied to the on-board charger. Note that if the charging station is turned off, or the power has failed or  ground faulted that this device will be completely ineffective. For this reason the charge door sense mechanism described above should be also included.

An AC voltage relay is more productively applied to the charging circuit as shown in another chapter, for it can both ensure the removal of AC ground faulting potential from the motor via the controller pre-charge resistors (a problem in older motors in damp conditions from the presence of slightly conductive brush dust) and may also be configured to remove pack voltage from the charger when not charging and so enhance underhood safety.

===Off throttle detection switch===
With an EV it is possible that it be left in gear with the clutch out while the system is activated. As it is a common habit among ICE vehicle drivers to open the throttle during start (a procedure to release the choke in older vehicles), the vehicle may accelerate. To avoid this an &quot;open throttle&quot; sense switch is included in series with the ''access door sense'' as part of the  ''start-run'' circuit. This open throttle sense is not necessary if a neutral lock out switch is included (this is part of an automatic transmission and may be found on some manual transmissions that have been imported directly from Japan) but is recommended for additional safety.

===Clutch depressed switch===
It is possible that the throttle could be pumped by an inexperienced driver (again, a habit developed from starting older vehicles in which the accelerator depression releases the choke and operates the accelerator pump in the [[w:en:carburetor|carburetor]] to &quot;prime&quot; the engine). By including a switch in the start-run circuit that ensures that the clutch is depressed an additional level of safety is provided. (Some vehicles built in the 1940's used full depression of the clutch to operate a floor mounted starter switch, so this is not a new idea.)

===Neutral safety switch===
All automatic transmissions incorporate a neutral safety switch. More rarely this switch may be found in a manual transmission, or in some cases, a provision for its installation may be incorporated, but no switch is installed (this may be found in some non-us made vehicles). If available, it should be incorporated instead of the clutch depressed switch. This switch will be closed when the transmission is in neutral so that it may be included in series with the off throttle and charge door switches.

===Service brake depressed===
The brake-light pressure switch may be used for additional startup security. In combination with the clutch depression switch this ensures that the driver's foot is likely not on the throttle pedal.

==Backup circuit==
Electric vehicles can operate at very high starting [[w:en:Torque|torque]]. Most transmissions (especially truck transmissions) use a very low  gear ratio in reverse, lower than low gear. To obtain this low ratio they use a very small diameter driving gear, subject to breakage if over torqued. A throttle restrictor should be used when reverse is engaged. This may be done by electronically limiting the effective throttle dashpot range with relays and resistors or mechanically by using a door unlock motor or a solenoid to limit the throttle motion when reverse gear is engaged. (Note that light truck conversions with four or five speed [[w:en:transmission|transmissions]] are usually operated starting in second gear, not using first gear except for uphill starts.)

==Shutdown circuit with ''lights on'' and other alarms==
[[Image:WPEVShutdownAlarms.png|thumb|left|210px|Headlight warning illustrated]]
The diagram illustrates a headlight alarm and a headlight reminder. If the system is shut down and the headlights are on an alarm will sound. If the wipers are on and the headlights are off a reminder chime will sound.

Electric vehicles using manual  transmissions require that the parking brake be applied - they are unforgiving if this is neglected as there is no compression of an ICE motor to restrict vehicle motion if it is left in gear. For this reason an additional circuit is added to the start-run latch circuit. When the vehicle is turned off with the key an alarm is sounded if the parking brake is not engaged. Power for this circuit should be on at all times so the circuit providing power to the clock and/or dome light should be tapped. While it is easy to detect &quot;off stop&quot; engagement using the existing parking brake alarm switch it is better to add a separate circuit that detects a substantial operation of the parking brake - to the point where it is effective in stopping the vehicle. (Late model vehicles using automatic transmissions will typically prevent key removal unless the transmission control is in the &quot;park&quot; position.)

It is also a good idea to curb the wheels where a curb is available (in any vehicle) and to use a wheel block in other cases where no parking pawl is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Colon Cancer Prophylactic Surgery'''

==Basic Definitions==
*Colon- the large intestine. Starts at the cecum which connects to the ileum and ends at the anus.
*Ilieum- the last section of the small intestine. It connects to the large intestine at the ileocecal opening.

==Types of surgery==
===Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA)===
*Definition:
**The removal of the colon leaving the rectum intact, and attaching the ileum to the rectum. Usually involves a temporary ileostomy (see below).
*Advantages:
**Reduces risk of developing colorectal cancer by 80%
**Maintains rectal function
*What patients can expect:
**3-hour surgery.
**7-day hospital stay.
**&gt;5 stools a day immediately following surgery. Avg. of 3-4 stools a day after adjustment.
**After surgery, you can't eat until bowel function resumes.
**Seepage (inadvertent passing of liquid through the anus)
**Incontinence (inadvertent passage of stool through the anus)
**Antidiarrhea medicine is necessary in 14%.
*Possible Complications:
**Occur in 15-20% of patients.
**Small-intestine obstructions
**Hemorrhage
**Bloating, cramping, and abdominal pains are rare
**Anastomosis may leak or fail = permanent ileostomy needed
*Disadvantages:
**Rectum is still present and risk of rectal cancer is high
**May need an IPAA later on.

===Proctocolectomy w/ ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) also called ileoanal reservoir (IAR)===
*Definition:
**The removal of the colon and rectum and creation of a pouch connected to the ileum. The pouch is then connected directly to the anal canal. ALWAYS requires a temporary ileostomy.
*Advantages:
**Reduces risk of developing colorectal cancer by ~100%.
**Removes all the large bowel mucosa and entire rectum.
*What patients can expect:
**Two separate surgeries
**Hospitalization for several weeks, discharged to go home, then return for completion.
**Stool average 5-6 times a day after adjustment
**Gas and bowel movements are more odorous
**They may feel the reservoir filling up while eating
**There may be more noticeable bowel sounds.
**Mucous discharge from the anus
*Possible Complications:
**Occur in 28-61% of cases
**Functional difficulties because of lack of mucosa
**Failure of pouch
**Anastomosis leakage or failure = formation of permanent ileostomy
*Disadvantages:
**Removes all rectal function
**Can't be done if there is a weak or damaged anal sphincter
**Requires temporary ileostomy for 2+ months

===Ileostomy===
*Definition:
**The presence of a hole in the abdomen through which the ileum is pulled through. It allows the contents of the small intestine to drain directly out of the abdomen.
*What patients can expect:
**Wearing a pouch on the outside of the body
**Discharge is continual and watery
**Skin irritation
**Passing of blood clots (sticky black tar) that smell really gross for the first few days
**Gas is noisier from a stoma
**Male erectile dysfunction (rarely)
**Lack of sexual interest
**Changes in body image, self-esteem, and social relationships
**A period of adjustment
*Good news:
**Daily activities will return to normal
**Sexual drive will increase
**No clothing restrictions
**Quality of life is reported to be good

===Colostomy===
*Definition:
**The presence of is a hole in the abdomen through which a portion of the colon is pulled through. It allows the contents of the large intestine to drain directly out of the abdomen. More colon left = more solid the discharge will be.
*What patients can expect:
**Same as for an ileostomy
**Considerations for Surgery

===Presence of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)===
*No other alternative than removal of the colon to get ride of polyps.
*Penetrance risk is ~100% for colorectal cancer
*Large risk of rectal polyps
*Cancer usually develops by late 20's-early 30's.
*Surgery should be done in late adolescence-early adulthood = dealing with young people who may not be diligent in their follow-up screening
*16% risk for desmoid tumors from the surgery

===Presence of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)===
*Lifetime risk of 80% for colorectal cancer
*Polyps in HNPCC are flat and plaque-like and can be missed during screening

===Patient specifics===
*Age
*Sphincter function
*Bowel function
*Presence and chance of other cancers

===Patient preference===
*Compliance for screening
*Cost effectiveness
**Changes in diet:
**For all surgeries listed above, the following apply:
*Eat foods high in fiber
*Increase fruit and vegetable consumption
*Avoid foods that cause a high amount of gas: beans, cucumbers, carbonated beverages
*Avoid foods that cause odors: asparagus
*Eat yogurt, applesauce, or buttermilk to manage the odor better.

===Colostomy===
*Definition:
**The presence of is a hole in the abdomen through which a portion of the colon is pulled through. It allows the contents of the large intestine to drain directly out of the abdomen. More colon left = more solid the discharge will be.
*What patients can expect:
**Same as for an ileostomy
**It looks like a red bubble - the color of the inside of your mouth.
**It does not allow water to enter = take showers and baths, swim how you want to.
**Spouses and loved ones feel depressed and scared = need to be involved in the whole process of adjustment.
**Things patients need to know about stomas:
**They may feel weakness, fragility, unattractiveness.
**People's reactions to the stoma will reflect what you tell them and how you perceive it yourself.
**You can wear any clothing you want, aside from clothes that expose your abdomen like bikins or crop tops.
**You can determine who you want to be aware of your stoma. Tell whoever you want but be aware that if you get into intimate situations, your partner may find it strange if they discover it themselves.
**Some people see the stomy as a physical mutilation, others see it as a preferable option to death.
**Perceptions of sexual function following the surgery. Some men have erectile dysfunction following surgery.
**disgust, anxiety, depression, and isolation feelings are common.
**Fear of stool leakage and odor, changes in physical appearance, changes in intimate relationships.
**There will be a period of adjustment in which the person will be having multiple stools and feel out of control.
**There can be irritation and they may want to use medicated rectal wipes to protect their skin.
**When the pouch starts to work, you will pass blood that looks like black tar and smells like rotten meat. It is basically a great big blood clot. You will get a little cramp and then this stuff comes out. It goes on for the first few days.
**Gas and bowel moevemnts stink more than you may be used to.
**They may feel the resorvoir filling after eating and there may be more noticeable bowel sounds.
**devastating, dirty, depressing and nightmare were all words that people have used as they adjust to the pouch.
**Give yourself time to heal. It takes time to adjust and they will be dealing with the care of a stomy when they are very stressed out and fatigued.
**For the first time ever, the possibility of death comes up…the surgery brings up ideas of the fact that life is not forever.
**fear of rejection, low self-esteem
**Noisier gas from the stomy.
**Greater mucous discharge from anus with the IPAA
**Some people may feel uncomfortable being seen by their parents during sex = wear a t-shirt or nightgown during sex. Wear a pair of pants with the crotch cut out.
**BUT- after adjusting, you can do anything…no physical restrictions, everything goes back to normal and you just have to go to the bathroom more often.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The classic dilemma is not a confession, but rather blaming the other prisoner

The numbers used are poor, clearly they work to create the same outcome, but both confessing, and only one confessing both result in 10 man-years being served. In order to make the outcome counterintuitive, the price of a double confession should be 6 or more, but less than 10 years each. This way, the Nash equilbrium is actually the worst possible outcome in terms of total man-years served. Further more, the idea is not to pick based on your opponent's choice being unknown and therefore using an average case, but to assume that your opponent is also selfish, and figure that he is for sure going pick assuming your selfishness as well.


I have gone through and changed Person A to Andy and Person B to Bob to make it easier for someone to read. I've also followed the suggestion above and increased the jail term for a double confession to 7 years apiece.
I suggest that the part on expected jailterm is removed, as it isn't required at all, and I think confuses the matter.
On the confession matter, from an aesthetic point of view, the problem would 'sound' better if it was plead guilty or not guilty.--[[User:MarkyParky|MarkyParky]] 23:47, 25 August 2006 (UTC)


I agree that it should definitely not be a confession. This doesn't make any sense, if one confesses to a crime one is then charged with the crime and served a correctional sentence. However, it is traditional for members of the judicial/correctional system to offer a reduced or rescinded sentence for a crime committed if he testifies against his co-conspirator codefendent. I believe that instead of person A confessing, person A should &quot;rat&quot; on person B. Perhaps narc may be another possible word.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Colorectal Cancer Chemoprevention'''

==Background==
*Colorectal Cancer
**Second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in US
***Estimated 56,000 people die annually
***Surgical resection and chemotherapy or radiation are standard treatment procedures
***Lifetime risks for colorectal cancer
****General population 5%
****Family history of adenoma or CRC 15-20%
****HNPCC 80%
****FAP approaches 100%
**Annual incidence 130,000
**When detected and treated while still localized 5 year survival exceeds 90%
**Only 40% of cancers diagnosed while still localized
**Current screening recommendations include:
***Annual fecal occult blood testing
***Flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years
***Colonoscopy every 10 years or double contrast barium enema every 5-10 years
*Chemoprevention
**Use of natural or pharmacologic agents to halt, reverse, or delay carcinogenesis
**Mechanisms to protect against mutagens
***Inhibit uptake or activation
***Enhance DNA repair of apoptosis
***Modulate cellular activities
****Signal transduction
****Growth factor activity
****Hormonal activity
****Immune response
****DNA methylation
**Development of chemotherapeutics
***Goal is to achieve an acceptable therapeutic index
****Therapeutic index is risk to benefit ratio
*****Want benefits of chemoprevention to greatly outweigh risks
*****Important for all therapeutic agents, but particularly those used for prevention

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia'''

==Definition==
*The presence of a hole in the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities) allows abdominal organs and intestines to enter the thoracic cavity.
*The most common type (36%) is on the left side of the diaphragm towards the back of the body (Bochdalek hernia). A hernia on the left side is more likely to allow organs to protrude. On the right side, the liver blocks the hole and therefore there is less chance of severe organ herniation.
*A less common hernia is located near the front of the body near the breastbone (Morgagni hernia).

==Incidence==
*1/3000- 1/5000 live births
*1/2200 including stillbirths, spontaneous miscarriages, and neonatal deaths before reaching treatment facility

==Cause==
*Multifactorial

==Maternal exposures==

THE CAUSE OF CDH IS NOT YET KNOWN.

Studies have been done on the following:
*Thalidomide
*Bendectin
*Quinine
*Anti-epileptic drugs.

==Embryological cause==
*At 9-10 weeks the peritoneal canals close creating the diaphragm and the separation between the thoracic and abdominal cavities is complete. If the closure does not occur properly, when the midgut returns to the abdomen, the abdominal viscera herniated through the opening. This causes compression on the developing lung, resulting in a decreased number of bronchial branches and mild to severe lung hypoplasia. There can also be compression on the heart causing cardiac deformities.

==Associated anomalies/conditions==
*10-20% of CDH have chromosome anomalies
*Trisomy 21, 13, 18 most common
*Tetrasomy 12p has been noted)
*Other anomalies occur in 25-57% of all cases of CDH (suspected 95% in stillborns with CDH)
*Congenital heart defects (16-23%)
*Hydronephrosis or renal agenesis
*Intestinal atresia
*Neurological defects (spina bifida, anencephaly, hydrocephalus)
*Bronchial anomalies (18-40%)
*Also seen to be associated with genetic conditions
*Fryns syndrome (RARE - 25 cases reported. Autosomal recessive condition that is usually fatal. Includes cleft palate, hypoplastic nails, cystic kidneys, genital malformations, CNS malformations, and dysmorphic features)
*Beckwith-Weidemann (usually sporadic. Macroglossia, large kidneys, macrosomia, other abnormalities)
*Pierre-Robin syndromes
*Outcome of pregnancies with CHD
*The extent of pulmonary hypoplasia at birth is the single most important factor to predict morbidity and mortality.
*Isolated CHD = 60-78% mortality rate
*Death usually caused by complications of prematurity and pulmonary hypoplasia
*Variation in outcome is dependent upon the timing, volume, and duration of the herniation
*No CHD on US at 20-38 weeks but present at birth = 100% survival
*Thought to be caused by a small herniation or &quot;sliding&quot; herniation.
*Prenatal Diagnosis
*Polyhydramnios caused by the obstruction in the herniated stomach.
*Polyhydramnios is an indication for poor prognosis (only 11% of 94 cases survived compared to 55% survival when no polyhydramnios was present)

==Ultrasound markers==
*Abdominal viscera at the level of the scapula or heart
*Liver herniation into chest area
*Herniation or misplacement the gallbladder
*Ultrasound measurements
*Lung to thorax ratio (L:T ratio) : a study found fetuses with CHD had a L:T ratio 2 SD below that in normal controls.
*Right-lung: head circumference ratio (LHR) in those with left-sided CHD: predictive of outcome
*LHR &lt;0.6 = no survival with postnatal treatment
*LHR &lt;1.0 = survival 11%
*LHR &gt;0.6 and &lt;1.35 = survival 61%
*LHR &gt;1.35 = 100% survival
*Pregnancy Management (Depends on gestational age and degree of herniation)

==All gestational ages==
*Level II ultrasound to identify any other anomalies
*Serial ultrasounds to watch progression of pregnancy
*Fetal karyotyping offered
*Fetal echocardiogram
*Large volume herniation (LHR&lt;1.35, L:T ratio&lt;0.5, dilated misplaced fetal stomach, and polyhydramnios):
*Counseling for very poor outcome and possible termination
*Option of delivery at term with conventional management
*Option of surgical repair or tracheal clip procedure in utero (&lt;26 weeks)
*Smaller volume herniation (LHR&gt;1.35, L:T ratio&gt;0.5):
*Serial ultrasounds
*Discuss options of prenatal repair (inclusion criteria specific)
*Delivery at high-risk center with postnatal repair
*Recurrence risks
*Sporadic in most cases
*Recurrence risk for siblings ~2% (Fetology)
*Females more commonly affected 3:2
*AD familial cases have been reported (higher chance of bilateral hernias)
*Fetal Treatment

==Done at the following major centers==
*Columbia University Medical Center/Children's Hospital of NY - '''1-877-THE-BABY'''
*UCSF Fetal Treatment Center 1-800-RX-FETUS
*CHOP Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment 1-800-IN-UTERO
*Florida Institute for Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy - limited no. of patients
*Complete repair of CHD (no longer done) - studies done reported no significant increase in survival rate in cases that did not involve herniation of the left liver lobe (44% survival w/ surgery, 41% w/out surgery).
*Tracheal occlusion surgery - theory behind surgery is that throughout gestation, the fetal lung produces fluid that leaves the body through the trachea. When this occurs in CHD, it causes a lung hypoplasia. However, when the trachea is blocked, the fluid becomes trapped causing a lung hyperplasia which forces the viscera back into the abdominal cavity.
*This procedure requires a postnatal surgical procedure to remove the clip and may require postnatal repair of the diaphragm.
*Studies have shown 90% mortality rate and have resulted in 50% of surviving fetuses to have vocal-cord paralysis requiring permanent tracheotomies.
*Current recommendations are to do the surgery only in those with isolated CDH, an LHR&lt;1.0 and a herniated liver.(Fetology) However, inclusion criteria at CHOP for tracheal clip is LHR&lt;1.4 and liver herniation.

==Newborn treatment==
*Immediate intubation
*Neuromuscular blockade
*Positive pressure ventilation
*Nasogastric tube to avoid dilation of the bowel
*Treatment with either high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HiFi) or traditional ventilation

==Postnatal repair==
*WAIT UNTIL INFANT HAS STABILIZED
*If necessary, place the infant on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
*65% require it.
*Increased risk for neurological difficulties later on.
*The defect is repaired primarily or by a patch
*Surgery uses muscle biopsy or foreign substance to close the diaphragm
*(If a foreign substance is used, it will not grow with the child and may require additional surgeries. When the muscles are sewn together, the diaphragm is not as flexible as normal. Can lead to respiratory dysfunction.)
*Sometimes a silo is required if there is not enough room for the bowel in the stomach cavity.
*Chest tube is inserted
*Average intubation period of 20 days (Maratore ''et al.'' 2001)
*Average length of stay in hospital of 60 days

==Long-term outcome==
*Possibility of bronchopulmonary dysplasia from long-term ventilation
*Increased risk for
*Neurological problems regardless of exposure to ECMO
*Developmental delay (20-30%)
*Sensorineural hearing loss
*Failure to thrive resulting from feeding difficulties
*Gastroesophageal reflux (50-60%)
*Musculoskeletal deformities (10-21%)
*A study of 48 infants with postnatal repair (Chu ''et al.'' 2000) showed a 73% survival rate with leading causes of death being severe respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, pneumothorax, and anomalies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cornelia de Lange Syndrome'''

==Definition==
*Cornelia de Lange Syndrome is a rare developmental malformation syndrome characterized by mental retardation, short stature, limb abnormalities, and distinctive craniofacial features.
*Within the phenotypic pattern, there is a wide range of severity (from mildly to severely affected). &quot;Classical&quot; refers to children who are severely growth retarded and &quot;mild&quot; refers to those with less severe growth problems and less developmental delay.

==Historical significance==
*In 1933, a Dutch pediatrician, Dr. Cornelia de Lange, described 2 children with similar features. The syndrome is also referred to as Brachmann-de Lange Syndrome after Dr. W. Brachmann, who described a similar patient in 1916.

==Diagnosis==
*no diagnostic biochemical, cytogenetic, or molecular abnormalities
*medical evaluation (history and physical exam showing distinctive craniofacial features)
*family history
*laboratory tests (chromosome analysis)
*X-rays

==Symptoms==
*low birthweight (under 5 lbs.) due to prenatal onset growth deficiency
*delayed growth &amp; short stature (failure to thrive) (&gt;90%)
*low-pitched, weak, growling cry in infancy
*hypertonicity (abnormally increased muscle tone)
*delayed bone age/skeletal abnormalities
*microcephaly (with possible brachycephaly)
*episodes of aspiration &amp; apnea in infancy
*synophrys (thick, arched eyebrows which meet at midline)
*long, curly eyelashes
*short, upturned nose with anteverted nares
*long, smooth philtrum
*thin, downturned lips
*micrognathnia
*late eruption of widely-spaced teeth
*low-set, malformed ears
*hirsutism (excessive body hair)
*small hands &amp; feet
*syndactyly of the 2nd and 3rd toes
*5th finger clinodactyly
*GI abnormalities (bowel obstruction)
*gastroesophageal reflux
*genitourinary malformations (horseshoe kidney, bicornate uterus)
*hypoplasia of male genitalia with undescended testes or hypospadias
*seizures (11-23%)
*congenital heart defects (20-25%)
*cleft palate or high arched palate (18-59%)
*feeding difficulties (chewing &amp; swallowing problems, regurgitation, projectile vomiting)
*developmental delay/MR (moderate to severe, usually) - IQ range 30-86 (ave. 53)
*significant speech/communication delay and psychomotor delay
*behavioral problems (acting out)
*limb abnormalities (reduction defects - missing forelimbs or portions thereof)
*myopia (60%), ptosis (45%), nystagmus, astigmatism, or strabismus
*hearing loss (&gt;90%)
*short neck with low posterior hairline
*increased susceptibility to repeated respiratory infections

==Incidence==
*congenital syndrome
*1:10,000 to 1:100,000 (most accurate study showed 1:50,000)
*males &amp; females affected equally

==Life expectancy==
*Not known with certainty. Earlier, many children died of serious medical problems due to complications of their congenital anomalies. However, many are now expected to live into adulthood.

==Genetics==
*exact cause is not known, possibly a gene located on chromosome 3 (3q26.3)
*duplication of chromosome 3q26-27 yields a similar phenotype
*sporadic; rare and random mutation
*rare cases where mildly affected individuals had children with the syndrome (suggests autosomal dominant inheritance)
*estimated 1% recurrence rate within affected families (due to possible germline mosiacism)

==Management==
*Treatment is directed toward the specific symptoms &amp; medical complications in each individual (symptomatic and supportive).
*Involves a comprehensive team of specialists (pediatricians, surgeons, orthopedists, gastroenterologists, urologists, otolaryngologists, cardiologists, dentists, speech pathologists, audiologists, optometrists, PT's, OT's, geneticists).
*Issues involve growth &amp; feeding, development (speech and motor skills) &amp; behavior, vision &amp; hearing, limb abnormalities, gastrointestinal problems, congenital heart defects, craniofacial, genitourinary, and neurological.

==Prenatal diagnosis==
Available if familial mutation is known

Level II ultrasound to detect poor fetal growth, limb abnormalities, diaphragmatic hernia, cystic hygroma, heart abnormalities, or characteristic facial profile

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Coffin-Siris Syndrome
*Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
*Ruvalcaba Syndrome
*Scott Craniodigital Syndrome with MR
*Chromosome 3, Trisomy 3q2
*Fryns Syndrome

==Resources==
*Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation
*Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation

==Contracting==
*What were you told about why you were referred?
*What would you like to learn today?
*Do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?

==Medical and Family Histories==
*[[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Breast cancer | Breast cancer]]? Endometrial cancer? Benign or malignant tumor of thyroid?
*Renal cell carcinomas, melanoma, glioblastoma?
*Hamartomas of colon, GI tract?
*[[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Macrocephaly | Macrocephaly]]? [[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Mental retardation | Mental retardation]]?
*Facial or oral mucocutaneous lesions (trichilimmomas)?
*Fibrocystic breast disease?
*Lipomas or fibromas?
*[[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Lhermitte-Duclos disease | Lhermitte-Duclos disease]] (hamartoma of cerebellum) - altered gait or seizures?

==Etiology==
*Multiple hamartoma syndrome with high risk for benign and malignant tumors of breast, thyroid, and endometrium
*Part of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS)
**Includes Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba, Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome
**Causes hamartomas and cancer due to PTEN mutations
*PTEN mutations and Cowden syndrome:
**Mutations identified in approximately 80% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis
**Located at 10q23.3
**PTEN gene is a tumor suppressor gene
**Mediates cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
**Part of subclass of dual-specificity phosphatases that remove phosphates from tyrosine, serine, and threonine
**May play a role in cell migration
**Has 9 exons
**Germline mutations have been found throughout gene except exon 9
**76% of mutations result in truncated protein, haploinsufficiency, or dysfunctional protein
*True prevalence is unknown due to underdiagnosis
**Diagnosis of Cowden sydrome difficult to establish
***Variable presentation
***Symptoms may be subtle
**Estimated to be 1 in 200,000 - probably higher

==Clinical Features==
*Multiple hamartoma syndrome
**High risk for benign and malignant tumors of thyroid breast and endometrium
**Usually presents by late 20's - over 90% of affected people have some features
**Mucocutaneous features present by 30's (99%)
***Trichilemmomas
***Papillomatous papules
***Acral and plantar keratosis
*Macrocephaly or dolichocephaly common
*Tumor risks
**25-50% lifetime risk of breast cancer
***Average age 38-46 years at diagnosis
***Up to 67% risk for benign breast disease
***Male breast cancer has been reported
**About 10% lifetime risk for thyroid cancer
***Usually follicular, sometimes papillary - never medullary
***Not clear if average age of diagnosis is same as for general population
***Benign multinodular goiter, adenomatous nodules, and follicular adenomas in up to 75% of patients
**May be 5-10% risk for endometrial cancer
***Not well defined
***Benign uterine fibroids are common
**Skin cancers, renal cell carcinomas, and brain tumors seen occasionally
**Lhermitte-Duclos disease
***Rare central nervous system tumor
***Called cerebellar dysplastic gangliocytoma
**Colorectal cancer has been observed rarely in families
==Genetic approach==
* three-generation family tree (focus on macrocephaly, breast/thyroid disease, learning disability)
* AD, 50% risk (risk of having of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba as well as Cowden)
* Mucocutaneous signs (found &gt;90%) could be the only manifestations
* 2/3 have breast and/or thyroid disorder

==Treatment/Management Options==
*Increased breast cancer screening
**Women should have monthly self exams, annual clinical exams at age 25, and annual mammograms at 30 (or 5 years before youngest age at diagnosis)
**Men should do monthly self breast exams
*Endometrial cancer screening
**Annual blind repel (suction) biopsies in premenopausal women beginning at age 35 (or 5 years before youngest age at diagnosis)
**Annual transvaginal ultrasound exam with biopsy of suspicious findings for postmenopausal women
*Comprehensive annual physical exam
**For men and women starting at age 18 (or 5 years before youngest component cancer diagnosis in family)
**Focus on skin changes and thyroid changes, including baseline ultrasound
*Follow American Cancer Society for colon cancer screening
**GI tract may have hamartomatous polyps not thought to increase cancer risk
**Baseline colonoscopy at 50 years unless symptoms arise earlier
**Annual fecal occult blood testing with sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or colonoscopy every 10 years
*Annual urinalysis to detect renal carcinoma

==Diagnosis==
*Consensus criteria for clinical diagnosis have been established (International Cowden Consortium 2000)
**Pathognomonic criteria
***Defining characteristic of Cowden syndrome
***Mucocutaneous lesions
****Trichilemmomas on face
****Acral keratoses (thickened area of skin that may be red, yellow, or brown)
****Papillomatous lesions
****Mucosal lesions
**Major criteria
***Breast cancer
***Thyroid cancer
***Macrocephaly
***[[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Lhermitte-Duclos disease | Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD)]]
***Endometrial carcinoma
**Minor criteria
***Other thyroid lesions
***Mental retardation
***Hamartomatous intestinal polyps
***Fibrocystic breast disease
***Lipomas
***Fibromas
****GU tumors or malformations (uterine fibroids and renal cell carcinoma)
**Criteria for diagnosis
***Pathognomic mucocutaneous lesions if there are:
****Six or more facial papules, with three or more trichilemmoma
****Cutaneous facual papules and oral mucosal papillomatosis
****Oral mucosal papillomatosis and acral keratoses
****Six or more palmo-plantar keratoses
***Macrocephaly or LDD with one other major criteria
***One major and three minor criteria
***Four minor criteria
**If affected family member has already been identified, diagnosis requires:
***A pathognomonic mucocutaneous lesion
***Any one major criterion with or without minor criteria
***Two minor criteria
*Pathologic review to confirm histopathology of lesions
*Molecular genetic testing
**Failure to detect mutation does not does not exclude clinical diagnosis
**Full sequencing of PTEN gene
***Available clinically
***Virtually all missense mutations believed to be deleterious
***Genotype-phenotype correlation
****Families with PTEN mutations more likely to develop breast disease than those without identified mutations
****Missense mutations and mutations 5' to or within phosophatase core are associated with more severe phenotype
**Southern blotting and monochromosomal hybrid analysis available by research

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Other PHTS syndromes
**'''Banayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba (BRR)'''
***Mutational spectra overlap, autosomal dominant (AD), PTEN mutations 60%
***Complex, highly variable disorder with much in common with Cowden (macrocephaly, association with breast, thyroid, endometrial and gut hamartomas)
***Diagnosis relies on macrocephaly, hamartomatous intestinal polyposis, vascular malformations, lipomas, and pigmented macules of glans penis
***Hypotonia, gross motor and learning-speech delay, may have seizures, mild hypertelorism.
**'''Proteus syndrome'''
***Highly variable and appears to only affect some organs or tissues
***Sporadic occurrence, progressive course, and connective tissue nevi
***Can cause disproportionate limb growth
***Recently a proteus-like syndrome has been described but is as yet undefined
*'''Juvenile polyposis syndrome'''
**Causes hamartomatous polyps in GI tract and high colorectal cancer risk
**Clinical diagnosis of exclusion
**Two susceptibility genes have been identified
*'''Peutz Jeghers syndrome'''
**High risk of intestinal carcinomas and breast cancers
**Pigmentation of peri-oral region is defining characteristic
**Polyps are often symptomatic
*Possibly also consider NF1 or Nevoid basal cell carcinoma (Gorlin) syndrome

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Anxiety surrounding new diagnosis of disorder that cannot be &quot;cured&quot;
*Requires patient compliance with screening measures - burden of many appointments
*Family thoughts on causes of cancer or other indications
*Past experiences with cancer in family and friends

there's one minor confusion in here i've spotted: this article lists VRLA as an alternative alongside gel cell and AGM etc. gel and AGM are just types of VRLA, with VRLA also being known as sealed lead acid. all SLA/VRLA batteries, of which AGM and gel are types, have the behaviour described of catalysing hydrogen and oxygen back into water. if they didn't, they wouldn't be maintenance-free and thus could not be sealed. --[[Special:Contributions/116.90.132.193|116.90.132.193]] ([[User talk:116.90.132.193|talk]]) 10:47, 19 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Additions needed? ==

Just wondering, should not we have some dwarf planets, such as Ceres, and some of the largest asteroids in the asteroid belt also?
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Воображение|Воображение]] ([[User talk:Воображение|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Воображение|contribs]]) 00:26, 9 June 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

: Interesting thought, imho.  What we have now:
:* A small section of [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Asteroid belt|Asteroid belt]] describes [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Asteroid belt#Ceres|Ceres]], and the naming and discovery of Ceres are already covered elsewhere on that page.  The intro lists the top four, and the table on the right lists the top five.
:* There's [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Pluto|Pluto]].
: I'm wondering how we might organize these expansions.
:* Would we want separate top-level sections for particular dwarf planets, or a single top-level page {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Dwarf planets&lt;/tt&gt;}}?  Would it go after [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Oort Cloud|Oort Cloud]], or perhaps before [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Comets|Comets]]?  Somewhere between?  We ''could'' put Dwarf planets right after Neptune, making Pluto a subpage.
:* We ''could'' have sections for more of the big asteroids, but other than Ceres, would there be enough to say about them to justify a whole page for each?
: At this moment, I think I favor leaving Pluto where it is and creating a page for Dwarf planets, maybe after Oort Cloud, with a link to the page on Pluto.  I'd try adding sections on the Asteroid belt page for some more of the larger asteroids, and I'd experiment with creating a separate page for Ceres.  But that's just my thoughts at this moment.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:13, 9 June 2013 (UTC)

::Well, I think that the book should be rearranged so that Pluto would be under Dwarf Planets, Ceres redirected to the dwarf planet sections (but a link to Ceres should be left for the asteroid belt, in case someone wants to know more), and maybe you are correct about individual asteroids, but under the asteroid belt, we could include other asteroid belts in the solar system, i.e. the Trojans or Greeks. Also, the universe is about 2/3 dark matter/energy, so could we have a page explaining the basics of dark matter/energy, maybe next to gravity, mass and weight?  How do you think of this? --[[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

::: Hm.  The status of Pluto is, of course, a subject on which to employ great tact.  It is traditionally viewed as one of the most significant individual bodies in the solar system, which favors listing it at the top level; that decision doesn't require us to consult the technical or political esoterica of &quot;planet&quot; status.  If, on the other hand, one ''doesn't'' list it at the top level, that comes across as making a strong political statement.  So if we don't want to make a strong political statement about the status of Pluto, it'd be good to choose an organization that keeps Pluto at the top level.  I'll have to give this some more thought.

::: Re dark matter/energy, there's all sorts of controversy surrounding those.  And I was under the impression it doesn't much come into discussion of the solar system.  Hm.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:46, 16 June 2013 (UTC)

:::: Well, tell me when you reach a neutral conclusion regarding Pluto. You did not mention any of my other ideas, and I would like to know your thoughts. About dark matter/energy, there are multiple controversies, but the basics must be explained, since most of the universe is composed of it. Just the biggest need-to-know facts like the universe is 2/3 dark matter, and all sorts of facts that I am too novice to know. Also, I had a small epiphany; about your comment starting with &quot;Hm&quot;. I do not think that it would be actually that politically offensive to anybody, as this does not really involve politics. Sure, it is traditional to think Pluto as important as a planet, but this association, in my opinion, will eventually drop until Pluto is regarded as an inconsequential dwarf planet in the farthest reaches of the solar system. However, that is my opinion and it may be wrong, but would it really be a political statement to say that Pluto is a dwarf planet and should be regarded as such? [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

::::: Perhaps I wasn't clear.  I don't agree that the basics of dark matter/energy have to be explained.  This is a book about the solar system, not a book about the universe, cosmology, or physics.  It doesn't matter how much of the universe is dark matter if dark matter doesn't factor into describing the solar system, and my impression from what I've heard is, it ''doesn't'' factor into describing the solar system.  It's therefore something of a digression to note that the &quot;2/3&quot; proportion is subject to controversy, or that, personally, I'd give about 30% odds that dark matter/energy are fictions we've imagined due to something seriously wrong with our understanding of physics.

::::: I've already explained why I believe Pluto should occur at the top level.  I thought I was quite clear that it's got nothing to do with the definition of ''planet'' versus ''dwarf planet'', though I get the feeling you're missing the politics behind those definitions.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:30, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

::::::Ok, dark energy/matter could be omitted since it is highly controversial. About Pluto, your explanation is saying that Pluto is traditionally held at the top level. Why would it be held at the top level? Because it is traditionally a planet. What would be so politically biased about classifying it as what it is, a dwarf planet? Maybe it would go against traditions, but I would rather be correct and organised rather than keep the nostalgia of Pluto being a planet. 
:::::: Again, your thoughts on the asteroid families? [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

== Does this really deserve 4 green squares? ==

I made an average of the whole book on how many squares were complete in the whole article. It was about 2.3, so this book obviously has a long way to go, and if my suggestions above are taken, it will bring down the average even lower. Don't be pessimist, though! The longer this book takes to type, the more experienced and more proud all of us contributors will be. 
I am just asking for the OK to downgrade it to 2 squares. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

: My instinct is that downgrading to two squares would be too much; and I'd want to think carefully about downgrading before doing it, to understand the principles followed in general and in this particular case.  I hope to take a closer look at these things when I get a chance.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:35, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

::Well, at least a 3 square would be more true than calling it a 4 square book. When you will take a closer look at things, you will see for yourself that there is a lot under development, even if we omit the 6 additional sections. Most of the moons have very limited information. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

== Could we rename this... ==

...to ''Solar System: It, Its Properties, and Its contents''? That sounds much more interesting than just the solar system. Does anybody concur? [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

: Wikijunior books (and books in general, but especially Wikijunior ones) should have short, simply, pithy titles.  Imo the current title is excellent; there's no reason to change it.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:14, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

:: What does Imo mean? Otherwise, I have nothing more to say. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

== Confusion exclusion/inclusion? ==

Since Pluto is deemed as a dwarf planet, could someone do some advanced photoshopping to either include the other 3 dwarf planets or to exclude Pluto? This may seem quite trivial, but here is my way of thinking in the mind of an 8-12 year-old.

: Ooh, a cool picture. Let's make it full size. Ok, there's the Uranus, Neptune, wait, huh? I thought Pluto was a dwarf planet? I suppose I was incorrect.

First I want a confirmation before any photoshoppers step up that this is a good idea. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

[[File:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|right|100px]]
: Is this the picture you're talking about?  Because if this's the picture you're talking about, I see no rational reason to change it.  Perhaps you're talking about some other picture?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:46, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

:: Look closely at it. There are 9 planets. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

::: I did look closely at it.  There is the sun, nine discrete things within frame that are orbiting it, an asteroid belt, and a comet.  Its inclusion in the picture (like its position in the outline of the book, above) has nothing to do with technical labels like &quot;planet&quot; or &quot;dwarf planet&quot;.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:08, 17 June 2013 (UTC)
::: Oh, perhaps to be thorough I should mention it also shows the Moon, and the rings of Saturn.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:11, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

:::: Well, what I meant was that it should only  include the 8 planets, the moon of the Earth, and the rings of every planet.[[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

::::: The asteroid belt is an interesting thing.  Pluto is an interesting thing.  I don't see a reason to exclude either.  Nor do I see a reason to awkwardly add dwarf planets that are much further out &amp;mdash; though I'd be interested to hear if you have a notion how to do that unawkwardly.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:01, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

:::::: The picture is already vastly out of proportion; what would 3 more orbits outside Pluto do? Ceres is not actually that far out; it is in the asteroid belt, and I prefer the removal of Pluto anyway. Anyhow, the reason I want Pluto removed (or have its friends added) is to avoid confusion as labeling it as an actual planet. Agreed, Pluto is an interesting thing, but the last thing I want is confusion. However, since I am the only one working on this project as of now (as stated by my survey of who is working on this project), it could not matter as I have poor photoshop skills. --[[User:Воображение|Воображение]] ([[User talk:Воображение|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Воображение|contribs]]) 23:29, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

== This may sound like a silly question but... ==

who is still working on this besides me? It seems to me that everyone got bored of contributing to this book around 2008. If there are as much people working on this in 2013 as I think there are(2-4 people) then we are in need of serious collaboration. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

: It's not a matter of &quot;still&quot; working on it.  Wikibook contributors come and go, over time.  Often one finds oneself collaborating with others who aren't around at the moment.  I'm glad to see you working on it, since it can use some upgrading, and I'm happy to provide a second perspective to help things come out better.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 03:51, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

:: Well, it just seems like Wikibooks promotes teamwork, yet it seems that I am working alone here. Also, look at the entire review log. You will see that the book is practically the same as it was in 2008. I am not sure that coming and going takes five years. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

::: Oh, I am sorry. I depreciated you.I didn't see your offer for a second perspective. Well, if you are willing, could you brush up Deimos so that it would be 4-square worthy? It seems like right now its a 3.8 square. But before you do that, could you please answer my multiple questions? Merci beaucoup. --[[User:Воображение|Воображение]] ([[User talk:Воображение|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Воображение|contribs]]) 01:05, 18 June 2013 (UTC)

== Blurb? ==

I saw a discussion in 2005 which supported having a blurb for this book. I think that is a good idea, so I want to make sure that everyone else agrees, before I make a page for that. [[User:Воображение|Воображение]]

== Going off a previous conversation... ==

...in Jupiter's discussion, Pi zero, could we actually have an exploration section for all the planets? P.S., I moved the discussion to here since it is now more relevant to the entire book.

: I think an exploration section as a standard question/section would be a great idea.  On pages where there is also a discovery section, perhaps exploration would go after discovery.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:05, 18 June 2013 (UTC)

== Where to put a funny fact? ==

Did you know that people can not burp in space? In the stomach, gravity is needed to separate the gases (the cause of the burp) and liquid.
I can not find a good home for this fact though. This would go in a miscellaneous section, but gravity, mass, and weight has no funboxes, same with Solar System.

== Main image ==

The image was discussed in a less direct way in another section, above, but since a specific proposal has been floated for a replacement, I'm starting this thread explicitly addressing the matter.

I don't like the proposed replacement, for two reasons &amp;mdash; one about presentation, and one about content.  My presentation concern is that the proposed replacement seems to me less dynamic, drier,  than the long-established one; this is Wikijunior, we want ''exciting'' pictures.  The content problem is that it's a picture of the planets.  This book isn't '''Wikijunior:Planets''', it's '''Wikijunior:Solar System'''.  The objection raised to the current picture was that it shows Pluto, and honestly this objection doesn't scan for me.  The existing image also shows the asteroid belt &amp;mdash;which the proposed replacement ''does not'' (to me, that's a fatal flaw for the proposed replacement regardless of the issue of Pluto).  It also shows a comet.  That's what the solar system is &amp;mdash; not just the planets, but all the interesting objects in local space surrounding Sol.  I wouldn't be opposed to an image that also somehow incorporates the Oort cloud, though that seems artistically difficult and I see no great need for it.

That said, as a less overriding concern, I have a ''preference'' to include Pluto, which is, to quote the current revision on Wikipedia, &quot;the second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System (after Eris) and the tenth-most-massive body observed directly orbiting the Sun.&quot;  Eris is further out than Pluto (most of the time, though its perihelion is apparently closer than Pluto's aphelion), making it more challenging to incorporate &amp;ndash; though, as with the Oort cloud, I wouldn't oppose doing so.  I don't think Haumea or Makemake are worth bothering with, and Ceres (the smallest of the five) is already covered since the picture includes the asteroid belt.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:36, 22 June 2013 (UTC)

Add blurb- what this is good for etc.

Heres a mini tutorial

* Find a variable that you can not access from BPython
* Look for a button that modifies the value in the user inteface
* Write down the buttons tooltip
* Use a find tool to find the Tooltip for the button in the source code (There are some source code searching tools you can get)
* The line with the tooltip will also reference a variable. Now you know what the variable name is for the button.
* Go into Python code folder and open the relevant C file (Lamp.c, Material.c etc.)
* Find a similar exististing variable in the c file- (e.g., if your setting a flag, then find another BPy function that sets a flag)
* Look for every instance of this variable, under each instance, copy it and replace the name with your new one. make the obvious modifications.

make sure to add the setattr and getattr values for class variable names.
You don't have to do this, but you probably should eventually.

Recompile and test!

Voila

''Note''
Sometimes not all variables are seen directly from the UI.&lt;br&gt;
As fas as I know all blender datatypes are structs internally.&lt;br&gt;
To find all the variables used by this DataType-&lt;br&gt;
Look through the files in- Blender/source/blender/makesdna/...&lt;br&gt;
They are named well and you can see all the variables. &lt;br&gt;

==TI 83 Plus Assembly Programming==

This book teaches TI-83 Plus Assembly Programming, an advanced programming language for TI-83+ and 84+ calculators.

==Table of Contents==

===Getting Started===

The TI-83 and TI-84 use a ZiLOG Z80 microprocessor. (The TI-89 uses a 68000 family processor and the TI-Nspire uses an ARM9 processor&lt;sup&gt;[http://hackspire.unsads.com/wiki/index.php/Hardware#CPU]&lt;/sup&gt;).
The TI-Nspire features an emulator by Texas Instruments for the TI-84+ SE.  It can be used for z80 programming, but it does not support undocumented commands and is not recommended.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You need a few basic things to begin programming.

#[http://education.ti.com/us/product/main.html Calculator]. A TI 83 Plus, TI 83 Plus Silver Edition, TI 84 Plus or TI 84 Plus Silver Edition is needed.
#[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/15/1504.html TASM]. This program &quot;assembles&quot; the assembly code you will write to code that the computer understands. Tasm did not work with enclosed examples. Downloading executable files via the internet is always risky. Does not work for Turbo Assembler 5 code.
#[http://www.ticalc.org/pub/win/asm/includes/ti83plusinc.zip TI 83 Plus Include File]. This text file assists TASM by giving it necessary information when assembling. Does not recognize instructions.
#[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/129/12922.html DevPac8x]. This program changes the code that TASM has assembled into a file that you can transfer to your calculator.
#[http://education.ti.com/us/resources/developer/83/hilight/hilight.html TI SDK] (Software Development Kit). Also  known as the TI 83 Plus Flash Debugger, this program allows programs to be tested on the computer for errors without having to transfer them to the calculator.
#[http://education.ti.com/us/product/accessory/connectivity/features/cables.html Linking cable]. A linking cable will allow you to transfer your programs to the calculator from the computer.

Now that you have everything, you will need to set everything up. I highly recommended that you follow the examples I give.

#Make a folder where you will put all your ASM (assembly) files (e.g. C:\ASM).
#Unzip the TASM folder into a subfolder in your ASM folder titled &quot;TASM&quot; (e.g. C:\ASM\TASM).
#Put the ti83plus.inc file into your TASM folder.
#Unzip the DevPac8x folder into a subfolder titled &quot;devpac8x&quot; (e.g. C:\ASM\devpac8x).
#Make another subfolder titled &quot;Programs&quot; (e.g. C:\ASM\Programs). This folder will be where you put all your programs in.
#Install the TI SDK. 
#You need to open Notepad and type the following text in:

 @echo off
 echo Compiling...
 move %1.z80 ..\tasm
 cd ..\tasm
 tasm -t80 -i -b %1.z80 %1.bin
 move %1.z80 ..\programs
 move %1.bin ..\devpac8x
 cd ..\devpac8x
 devpac8x %1
 move %1.bin ..\programs
 move %1.8xp ..\programs

== z80 ==

This article doesn't say how TI83+ assembly differs (or doesn't differ) from the z80 used in many TI models including vanilla TI83 and TI82. z80 doesn't even appear on the entry article. --[[User:83.67.100.171|83.67.100.171]] 22:28, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

== Orginizational stuff ==

I think that registers should go before flow control. JP and CALL might be simpler, but it's more important to talk about binary and memory and addressing than calling subroutines, especially since simple programs (like Hello World) don't use them. But that's just what I think, and, you know, I like to think a lot. —[[User:Dr Dnar|Dr Dnar]] 00:39, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Which votes to count ==

The recent discussion on [[Cookbook:Special brownies]] has caused a problem.  Several wikipedians have come over here to vote, yet they have no history at this project and are voting based on Wikipedia procedures/policies.  However, [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks is not|Wikibooks is not]] Wikipedia.  I'm inclined not to count the votes of users with no history here. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:14, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:This is not fair, as said policy was unilaterally formulated, voted for, and put into place by, guess who, Gentgeen. Just as (in many cases, at least) a contributor from de.wikipedia with no edits on en.wikipedia will sometimes be allowed to vote on en.wikipedia, en.wikibooks, which is not only a closely-allied project of the same organisation as en.wikipedia but also is in the same language as en.wikipedia, should allow Wikipedians with a reasonable number of non-vandalism contributions to any project to vote on issues. If you are concerned because they do not seem to have a grasp of Wikibooks policy differences from Wikipedia (which you have in the past and continue to greatly exaggerate), then why not tell them? And even if I voted on en.wikipedia for the deletion of a page, giving the justification &quot;I don't like it&quot;, it would still count as a vote. In fact, no justification is nessecary on either project. --[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 23:06, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::In fact, the &quot;keep&quot; votes for &quot;Special brownies&quot; greatly outnumbered the votes for &quot;delete&quot;, 9-4. It was extremely irresponsible of Gentgeen to 1. remove it from this page and 2. delete the article, without further discussion of which votes should be counted, and which should not, especially since he himself had voted &quot;delete&quot;. --[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 23:13, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::Wikibooks isn't Wikipedia. We have different domain names, main pages, software, goals, users, and pages for things like this. If VfD, VfU, Main Page, etc. were all the same page for all projects, we could count users from all different languages and projects. But we aren't the same. For one, anyone can create an account with the same name as a user on another project/language. This should be the deciding factor. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 23:36, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:::No shit, it isn't. Are you a sockpuppet of Gentgeen? And as I noted before, en.wikipedia often lets well-established users from other Wikipedias vote. Each Wikipedia is essentially a different project, and it definitely has a different main page, users, pages for &quot;things like this&quot;, goals, etc. However, you are wrong about different software: Both use MediaWiki software.
:::Now, as to being able to create another account: If a Wikipedian has over 1000 edits, there's a very good chance they already have a Wikibooks account, even if they don't use it. If they haven't, there is no good reason for somebody to create an account using the user name of an existing Wikipedian: it would be very easy to find out, and there's a good chance they would be caught in the act. Plus, how do we know that Gentgeen isn't an evil impersonator of the Gentgeen from Wikipedia? He used his sysop status on Wikipedia to make his request for sysop permissions on Wikibooks seem less objectionable, what if he's not really the same person? Does this mean I can register a new account under the name of a well known, well-respected sysop from Wikipedia, and then after contributing just a tad, put a page up for votes which, depending on when and where it was posted, could get only a vote from me (and potential sockpuppets I created, even, with over 100 contribs each; ie contrib distribution), and then go to Angela when I won in that way and ask for sysophood.
:::Going back to what you said about this not being Wikipedia: we share a lot with Wikipedia, more than what we don't share: a large portion of our users, some parts of our content, our software, our licence, the fact that we both have &quot;wiki&quot; in our names, a commitment to quality and to be neutral (or in the case of Wikibooks, at least to some degree), the fact that things change quickly, the fact that the number of Wikibooksians is growing rather than staying the same, a large portion of our policies (where do you think &quot;What Wikibooks is not&quot; came from? it's obviously not an original idea for a policy page), and most importantly, the fact that ANYONE CAN EDIT AN ARTICLE (with some exceptions)! --[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 04:48, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::::In fact, en.wikipedia let a Wikibooksian that was mostly new to Wikipedia vote once, at least that I can remember. --[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 04:50, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::::Well, for one, I'm not a sockpuppet of Gentgeen as I work on totally unrelated stuff and have edited things at the same time as him many times. Wikipedia and Wikibooks use different software in that Wikipedia uses a different version of MediaWiki. One example is that articles that say &quot;Wikipedia:&quot; get a blue background on Wikipedia, but articles like this one on Wikibooks are still white. I'm not saying that impersonating someone else is a smart thing to do, or that anyone's doing it. I'm just saying that that should be the deciding factor for VfD and VfU. For example, if [[Wikiversity]] becomes a major section of Wikibooks, with its own policies and VfD, but is on the same site name and domain of Wikibooks, then Wikiversitians should be able to vote on Wikibooks and vice versa.
::::Before, you complained that What Wikibooks is not isn't a valid policy, and now you're saying it comes from Wikipedia. Let me give you some advice: Stop contradicting yourself! - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 02:04, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Be careful what you say, it may be used against you.  Hyprocracy is an ugly thing. From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America#Comments]
::Uhh... no shit I deleted votes. Were some of them from non-sockpuppets? Yes. Were any of them from users who had made any other contributions other than to here (with the exception of users who made one or two other contributions, or who made quite a few other contributions but they were all vandalism)? No, with the exception of Nohat and one other (forgot who it was), who I replaced IMMEDIATELY. In short: I have only removed fraudulent votes. If &quot;some&quot; of them were by legit users, why not just add back the ones by legit users and leave the rest deleted? --Node 05:24, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)
[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 17:05, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:Oh, come on. That was a massive VfD where both sides were plagued by tens of obvious sockpuppets. Most had no userpages, had just been created, and did not exist on any other projects. I have never done this on any other VfD. Current Wikimedia policy regarding votes is that you leave them be - even if they're from anonymous users - unless you have reason to suspect bad intentions beyond just &quot;Oh, it's /possible/ that this person is a sockpuppet&quot;. That means that in massive votes that are especially ugly, restrictions are generally more stringent, but in smaller-scale votes like all those which occur on Wikibooks, without obvious evidence of sockpuppetry or other voting irregularities, you are supposed to ask a developer to check for you or just let it be. --Node

I believe a special factor here is whether or not there is a conflict of interest. Did the vote-counter have a position on the deletion of the article? If so, is it one that would benefit by eliminating the votes in question? If they hold the opposite point of view and stand to lose support for their opinion, then there's no problem. But I believe at Wikipedia (and it should be the same here, too) administrators are prohibited from using their administrative powers in cases they are personally involved with. Thus, it's OK to delete vandalism, but if you are involved in a content dispute or the like you may not use your admin powers to trump the other user. Gentgeen has done this to me in the past, and has done it on here, too. He has an obvious and strong opinion in a VfD case, then when it comes time to judge whether or not consensus was reached, he often decides it has been if the majority are in favor of his opinion and that it has not been if the majority are in favor of the opposing opinion. In addition, his vote-counting seems to suffer from the same problem. If it's to his benefit, he keeps questionable votes, but if they are votes against his viewpoint that push the opposition into the majority, he doesn't count them. --Node

: '''Update''': I have re-worded the page to indicate that each registered user should be considered equal, and should have one vote, to give the impression that the system is fair. In reality, the admins can do what the hell they like until policy dictates otherwise. If anyone can think of a better policy which is easy to enforce, suggest it here. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

::: The #1 problem I see is when something '''here''' is unpopular on Wikipedia... at least to a sizable group on Wikipedia, they come storming over to Wikibooks and vote ''en masse'', which in effect overwhelms the typical Wikibookian user base.  On the positive side they probabally aren't going to be voting on general policy issues, but they will be arguing for specific Wikibooks or pet projects.  The issue with Wikiversity is similar only it got a big storm of support from Meta.  I don't think this is completely avoidable, but policy decisions should be made by the rank and file ordinary Wikibookians and not some group that comes over, smashes up policy for a single &quot;party&quot; or cause, and then leaves.  On the other hand, if we can treat those visiting with a little respect we may be able to get them to help contribute over a longer term.  The question is how to do that and still protect Wikibooks to keep a consistant policy and organization outlook. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:26, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

This page whilst fulfilling a useful and required role is also responsible for some decisions which are stifling creativity. I would therefore suggest that it becomes the object of a wiki research project to ensure creativity and reviewers are suitably encouraged and accomodated [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 16:13, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Both the VfD and speedy deletion pages appear on this page, which causes the page itself to be listed as VfD. Is there a way to include the templates without this happening? Should we just copy and paste the contents instead of including the templates? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:08, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I added these templates yesterday because it helps newbies understand what's going on with the templates.  In answer to question on surpressing the categories, no, there is no way, and the demonstration of the candidates for speedy deletion template requires the use of the template because of the |reason thing.  But it's not a big problem, they've done it on Wikipedia for a long time and I thought it wouldn't hurt us here.  If you'll notice, I mentioned on the categories pages that neither of these are actually being considered for deletion- as I hope any admin would know anyway.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 20:01, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Hmm, it still seems a little sloppy. Why can't we just copy and paste the contents instead of actually using the templates themselves? (Also, remember it's just HTML generated in the end, the |reason thing is a red herring-- perhaps you don't know what I'm getting at?) The only disadvantage of copy and paste (which would *look* exactly the same as it does now) would be that if one changes, the other will need to change too. This seems far less of a problem than having the page actually be listed for deletion. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:22, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::Fixed. The categories will still contain the templates, but there's no reasonable way around this - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

There are more than 500 orphaned pages, and many of them should be deleted. Some are not in English, so I can't judge. I deleted all pages in French among them. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 14:49, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

'''Keep, keep keeeeep! Your list is bogus!''' I see 3 copies of the perfectly-good [[Cookbook:Egg_Roll|Egg_Roll]] recipe in that list. Something is '''not''' right about that list. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:20, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I spotted something that appears 5 times, all identical. Soppose there are 6 copies in the database, 5 of which are counted as orphans. So you delete 5... but in doing so, wipe out the copy with the most recent history. Maybe you even corrupt the database worse than it is already. As for the egg roll, that may be partly my doing, caused by the wiki telling me that the page is empty when I save it for the first time. So of course I hit the back button and try again, figuring that some database connection somewhere got dropped the first time. So that's at least 2 serious bugs right there, falsly (?) reporting that a fresh module has no data and allowing the addition of multiple modules with the same name. It would be very unwise to touch this mess without first investigating what is going wrong with the wiki database and other code. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:46, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Why is this even listed here? It's not a specific page or book to be deleted.
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:38, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: Read what Yann said. &quot;many of them should be deleted&quot;. Some of them may be speedy deletes, which needs to be brought to immediate attention. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:08, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Sorry, I'm confused about one thing.. should candidates for speedy deletion be listed on this page or is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Delete|reason..}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; enough? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 04:20, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

:It's always helpful to list it on this page too, so there can be a discussion (if neccessary). Also, this page is read more than the page that lists all pages with the Delete template. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:05, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

::I've changed policy to remove this requirement. There's no need to list speedies on this page, since the whole point of them is for deletions which don't require a vote. Should an admin be uncertain as to whether or not to delete a speedy, they should personally add it to the VfD list, and change the 'delete' template inclusion to a 'vfd' one. It's probably wiser to use a speedy deletion tag even if the page doesn't break policy, but that you suspect it would be unilaterally voted to be deleted. An admin can easily promote it to a full VfD if they think you're wrong. This should save a lot of time. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Transwiki and votes ==

'''Note''': This section moved from [[Wikibooks talk:Votes for deletion]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:00, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm a bit confused on the &quot;Pages to be transwikied.&quot; I don't see anybody voting on them? And neither any one of them seems to be signed? There is a lot of pages listed under the different languages, are there no administrators working on them? Or are there just a lot of books written in other languages(?) It's hard to get an idear on how long the different books has been listed there, because they are not signed. [[User:RoceKiller|RoceKiller]] 22:43, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

:That's just an open note that tells users that these articles are written in other languages, and thus must be moved out of the English wikibooks and into the ones for the approprate languages, as per the transwiki policy set out on meta (I think it's at [[m:Transwiki]]).  The reason that little work has been done is that we are patiently waiting for MediaWiki 1.5 where new features will make the transwiki process will be largely painless (currently it's a cut-and-paste job, and legal restrictions make moving page histories more difficult to deal with).  If you want to do transwiki, you are of course more than welcome. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 01:49, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

::There's no real need to debate these for any length of time.  Stuff that isn't in English should be moved to the appropriate place, and that list is just a simple way to keep track of which ones need to be moved where. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:11, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::Sorry to beat a dead horse, but the transwiki list is starting to be a nuisance. :) I'm not familiar enough with other languages and other languages' Wikis to help, so I can only bug people to ask if there is any progress in this area. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 7 July 2005 06:46 (UTC)

: These entries seem to be beyond the scope of VfD, so I've moved them all to [[Wikibooks:Pages to be transwikied]], and linked from here. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Deletion of images ==

I've listed a few images for speedy deletion. The actual image has been removed form the image page (this is the big step, because it's not undoable), but the image page has remained intact. So, does the image page get deleted eventually, or does it remain forever? If they are never deleted, then I'll simpy remove them from the speedy deletion list. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 05:03, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: After watching the same images for a few days, I've come to the conclusion that it does no harm. One, any image uploads in the future with the same name will simply override whatever's inside there with no warning, so no big issue there.. (well there is, but still.) Two, if nothing is linked to it, it becomes orphaned and nobody but us ghosts will know of it. 

: Given the lack of response to this query, I'll housekeep this next week (after you have a chance to read this), to keep the Talk Page manageable. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 7 July 2005 06:49 (UTC)</text>

'''Newton's Method''' (also called the Newton-Raphson method) is a recursive algorithm for approximating the root of a differentiable function. We know simple formulas for finding the roots of linear and quadratic equations, and there are also more complicated formulae for cubic and quartic equations. At one time it was hoped that there would be formulas found for equations of quintic and higher-degree, though it was later shown by [[w:Niels Henrik Abel|Neils Henrik Abel]] that no such equations exist. The Newton-Raphson method is a method for approximating the roots of polynomial equations of any order. In fact the method works for any equation, polynomial or not, as long as the function is differentiable in a desired interval.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em; margin: 0px auto;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Newton's Method&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; be a differentiable function. Select a point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; based on a first approximation to the root, arbitrarily close to the function's root. To approximate the root you then recursively calculate using:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f\left(x_n\right)}{f'\left(x_n\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

As you recursively calculate, the &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;'s often become increasingly better approximations of the function's root.
&lt;/table&gt;

In order to explain Newton's method, imagine that &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is already very close to a zero of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;. We know that if we only look at points very close to &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; looks like its tangent line. If &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; was already close to the place where &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; was zero, and near &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; looks like its tangent line, then we hope the zero of the tangent line at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a better approximation then &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; itself.

The equation for the tangent line to &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;y=f'\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+f\left(x_0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Now we set &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;0=f'\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)+f\left(x_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-f\left(x_0\right)=f'\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-f\left(x_0\right)}{f'\left(x_0\right)}=\left(x-x_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-f\left(x_0\right)}{f'\left(x_0\right)}+x_0&lt;/math&gt;

This value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we feel should be a better guess for the value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt; We choose to call this value of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, and a little algebra we have

:&lt;math&gt;x_1=x_0-\frac{f\left(x_0\right)}{f'\left(x_0\right)}.&lt;/math&gt; 

If our intuition was correct and &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is in fact a better approximation for the root of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then our logic should apply equally well at &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;. We could look to the place where the tangent line at &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is zero. We call &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, following the algebra above we arrive at the formula

:&lt;math&gt;x_2=x_1-\frac{f\left(x_1\right)}{f'\left(x_1\right)}.&lt;/math&gt; 

And we can continue in this way as long as we wish. At each step, if your current approximation is &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; our new approximation will be
&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f\left(x_n\right)}{f'\left(x_n\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;


==Examples==

 Find the root of the function &lt;math&gt; f\left(x\right) = x^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;.
[[Image:Newtons_method_x2.png|frame|Figure 1: A few iterations of Newton's method applied to y=&lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; starting with &lt;math&gt;x_0=4&lt;/math&gt;. The blue curve is &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The other solid lines are the tangents at the various iteration points.]]
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x_{0}&amp;=&amp;4\\
x_{1}&amp;=&amp;x_{0}-\frac{f\left(x_{0}\right)}{f'\left(x_{0}\right)}=4-\frac{16}{8}=2\\
x_{2}&amp;=&amp;x_{1}-\frac{f\left(x_{1}\right)}{f'\left(x_{1}\right)}=2-\frac{4}{4}=1\\
x_{3}&amp;=&amp;x_{2}-\frac{f\left(x_{2}\right)}{f'\left(x_{2}\right)}=1-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}\\
x_{4}&amp;=&amp;x_{3}-\frac{f\left(x_{3}\right)}{f'\left(x_{3}\right)}=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1/4}{1}=\frac{1}{4}\\
x_{5}&amp;=&amp;x_{4}-\frac{f\left(x_{4}\right)}{f'\left(x_{4}\right)}=\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1/16}{1/2}=\frac{1}{8}\\
x_{6}&amp;=&amp;x_{5}-\frac{f\left(x_{5}\right)}{f'\left(x_{5}\right)}=\frac{1}{8}-\frac{1/64}{1/4}=\frac{1}{16}\\
x_{7}&amp;=&amp;x_{6}-\frac{f\left(x_{6}\right)}{f'\left(x_{6}\right)}=\frac{1/256}{1/8}=\frac{1}{32}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As you can see &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is gradually approaching zero (which we know is the root of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;). One can approach the function's root with arbitrary accuracy.

 Answer: &lt;math&gt; f\left(x\right) = x^2 \ &lt;/math&gt; has a root at &lt;math&gt; x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

==Notes==
[[Image:Newtons_method_failure.png|300px|thumb|Figure 2: Newton's method applied to the function&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = \begin{cases} \sqrt{x-4}, &amp; \mbox{for}\,\,x \ge 4 \\ -\sqrt{4-x}, &amp; \mbox{for}\,\,x &lt; 4 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;starting with &lt;math&gt;x_0=2&lt;/math&gt;.]]
This method fails when &lt;math&gt;f'\left(x\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, one should choose a new starting place. Occasionally it may happen that &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'\left(x\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt; have a common root. To detect whether this is true, we should first find the solutions of &lt;math&gt;f'\left(x\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and then check the value of &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; at these places.

Newton's method also may not converge for every function, take as an example:

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = \begin{cases} \sqrt{x-r}, &amp; \mbox{for}\,\,x \ge r \\ -\sqrt{r-x}, &amp; \mbox{for}\,\,x &lt; r \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For this function choosing any &lt;math&gt;x_1 = r - h&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x_2 = r + h&lt;/math&gt; would cause successive approximations to alternate back and forth, so no amount of iteration would get us any closer to the root than our first guess.

[[Image:Newtons_method_local_min.png|300px|thumb|left|Figure 3: Newton's method, when applied to the function &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)=x^5-x+1&lt;/math&gt; with initial guess &lt;math&gt;x_0=0&lt;/math&gt;, eventually iterates between the three points shown above.]]

Newton's method may also fail to converge on a root if the function has a local maximum or minimum that does not cross the x-axis. As an example, consider &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)=x^5-x+1&lt;/math&gt; with initial guess &lt;math&gt;x_0=0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, Newton's method will be fooled by the function, which dips toward the x-axis but never crosses it in the vicinity of the initial guess.

      <text xml:space="preserve">KANSAIBEN (関西弁 - kansai dialect)

Kansai-ben takes up a large slice of even the Tokyo resident's mind. The comedians on TV speak it incessantly, three large cities (Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe) speak it, and most Japanese accept the differences as quaint and interesting, just as most Americans think of Southern accents, and Londoners think of Northern accents. 

Kansai-ben has many different variations (there are the lowly country variations like southern Wakayama Kansai-ben, and almost elitist, ultra-polite Kyoto-ben) as well as many different levels of depth. Some Kansai residents from Nara speak very little Kansai-ben, while people from Amagasaki speak a very strong and distinct Kansai-ben.

== Grammatical Differences ==

Kansai-ben varies from one part of Kansai to another, but here are some of the more common features.

The most noticeable difference is the substitution of the negatives -hen / -n or -mahen for -nai or -masen. (Sometimes only one of &quot;-hen&quot; or &quot;-n&quot; is acceptable in a particular grammar construction. For example, kawande mo ee (kawanakute mo ii) cannot be replaced by &quot;kawahende mo ee&quot;.)

Hyojungo (Standard Japanese): Wakaranai. (I don't know) 
Kansai-ben: wakarahen / wakarehen / wakaran (note that when attaching -hen, the conjugation does not always follow that for -nai).

Also, while hyojungo uses &quot;yo&quot; for emphasis, many times Kansai-ben uses either an elongated &quot;na&quot; or &quot;de&quot;. 

Hyojungo: Natto wa tabenai yo. (I don't eat natto.)
Kansai-ben: Natto wa tabehen de~. 

Furthermore, when using &quot;da&quot;, &quot;datte&quot;, or &quot;daro&quot;, many times Kansai people will substitute &quot;ya&quot; for &quot;da&quot;. &quot;Metcha&quot; or &quot;mutcha&quot; is also substituted for words like very emphatic words like &quot;cho&quot; (Yokohama/Tokyo-ben) and &quot;sugoi&quot;.

Hyojungo: Natto wa sugoku kusai, daro? (Natto is very smelly, isn't it?)
Kansai-ben: Natto wa metcha kusai, yaro?

Many of the grammatical constructions have a classical feel to it; one can find many traces from older Japanese pronunciation: sabui (samui), hayo (hayaku), yuuta (itta)...

== Vocabulary Differences ==

Maybe there could be an article on how to make extensions.  There's a good tutorial at http://roachfiend.com/archives/2004/12/08/how-to-create-firefox-extensions/
:Good idea, there's now an Developer page elsewhere on it. [[User:Gflores|Gflores]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User Talk:Gflores|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:34, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

== idea ==
I think there should be a &quot;If you only get 5 extensions, get these,&quot; like [http://extend.flock.com/ Flock] (a derivative of Firefox) has this. Instead of 5, there could be 10? It could also be separated into New Users/Advanced users. Some example extensions could be IE View (new) and Greasemonkey (advanced).  I don't know. Just throwing out an idea.

[[Image:Lionessnala.jpg|thumb|right|An African lioness surveys her domain]]
In Africa, they say that a male lion roars ''Hii inchi na ya nani?  Ni yangu, yangu, yangu!''  (Whose land is this?  It is mine, mine, mine!).  It is hard to listen to this ancient challenge without edging a little closer to the campfire.  But what is behind that remarkable call?  Certainly, to some degree, all cats are cats, everywhere you look.  When you see one of the neighborhood tabbies stalking a squirrel, you can see a miniature tiger stalking deer on the meadows of Rhanthambore.  

==Superb Predators==

Tigers and lions are among nature's grandest predators.  A grizzly bear may be larger than a Siberian tiger, but the tiger is much quicker.  A wolf may have a better sense of smell than a jaguar, but a jaguar can handle large prey alone while wolves hunt in packs. Dogs rival cats (from domestic cats to any but lions and tigers) of like size in strength and power, but they don't have as big teeth and claws; having to behave well around people to survive and being well fed by humans, they rarely get to show their ability as killers unless hunting with people.  Cats have excellent night vision, sharp hearing and enormous physical strength.  They sneak up on their prey; the camouflage patterns in their fur and their graceful, quiet movements make the cats difficult to notice.

There are cats for every job.  Each continent except Antarctica has its cat king.  Africa is ruled by the lion, Asia by the tiger (although the Himalayas are too high for tigers; there the snow leopard is king.)  In South and Central America the monarch is certainly the jaguar.  North America is the domain of the puma. Australia has no big cats, but it has many small cats that descend from tame cats but have since gone wild. Like their giant relatives, these cats have become keen predators even if they are much the same as the pet cats that you have met. Some of them, though, are so much larger than most domestic house cats that they have been mistaken for larger species like pumas.

The natural order is carefully balanced. There are a few big predators. Under them are more medium sized cats that eat medium sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer. Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.  The secret to their success is the concept of the ''niche'', a special job each cat holds that keeps it from competing with others.  A shopping mall with nothing but music stores would see a lot of fighting over customers.  Like a shopping mall, a natural environment keeps order by having a variety of different plants, prey species, and hunters.  The field mice that don't interest the tiger keep the wild cat happy, and the cheetah zooms after a small antelope while leaving the buffalo for the stronger lions.

==Meat on the Menu==

Cats hunt because they need meat to survive.  Animals that eat grass and leaves have special stomachs that allow bacteria to break down complex plant sugars into the simpler sugars animals can digest.  Cats have a very short digestive tract that quickly breaks down meat and absorbs its energy and building materials.  Cats cannot survive on a diet of grass, therefore they live from the meat they can get from other plant-eating animals. That is how the food chain works.

==Intelligence==

Cats are among the most intelligent species on Earth.  They are ranked just behind primates (monkeys and apes), cetaceans (whales and dolphins), elephants, pigs, and seals.  Lions hunt in groups when they tackle large and dangerous prey.  All cats are very curious and can learn quickly.  Large predators need to be extra smart in order to be successful as hunters.  Mother cats spend a long time (one to two years) teaching their offspring the many things they need to know in order to survive. You may also consider this time of their life as their school time, where they learn how to deal with the world they live in.

==Found Everywhere But Safe Nowhere==

Cats are native to all continents but Australia and Antarctica. In Australia, the only cats are small ones &amp;mdash; domestic cats and their feral (domesticated animals gone wild) descendants that kill small animals as effectively as the great cats kill larger animals.    Unfortunately, many of these wonderful creatures face extinction or are critically endangered. (There are about 700 million domestic or feral domestic cats worldwide, roughly one for every ten humans &amp;mdash; and those cats are in no danger of extinction).   Wild large cats are often hunted for their fur or meat. In Asia, thousands of tigers are killed each year just for their body parts.  They are also killed by people who want the animals that cats hunt all to themselves.  Still other people hunt cats for sport.  Worse, the healthy environment that cats need to survive is not being treated with the respect it deserves. 

Fortunately, more and more people now think of cats as companions to be admired rather than enemies to be destroyed.  Learn more about these great cats and their remarkable world and share what you learn with your family and friends.  After all, when we understand something, we can appreciate its value much better.  Valuable things, including the marvelous cats, large and small, are worth protecting. To keep these superb predators in the world our children and grandchildren will live in, we must learn to make room for other living things to use Earth's limited resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== If ==

The If statement is a simple instruction that directs the program to perform certain functions if the stated criteria is met.

=== Input ===

&lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt;, '''PRGM:CTL:1''', requires a criteria argument to be stated immediately afterwards which will allow the program to determine whether the following instructions are to be executed.  The argument or arguments are boolean results, meaning that they will be true (resulting in a value of 1) or false (resulting in a value of 0).  For example, 8&gt;3 is true, therefore a value of 1, while 1&gt;5 is false, therefore a value of 0.  The program will only execute the instructions following the &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; statement if the value of the argument is anything other than 0.

Note: an argument of simply &quot;3&quot; is untestable since there is no criteria to compare it to (ie. &gt;1), therefore the resulting value will remain 3 and the program will still execute the following instructions.  This may be useful for when used as [[TI-Basic Z80 Programming/Tips, Tricks and Optimizations|tricks and for optimizations]].

The criteria following the &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; statement can be written in several forms:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:If 1
:Disp &quot;Hello World!&quot;
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will simply display &quot;Hello World!&quot; since the criteria's value is 1.


&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:If 0
:Disp &quot;Hello World!&quot;
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will skip the instructions to display &quot;Hello World!&quot; since the criteria's value is 0.


&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Prompt X
:If X&gt;3
:Disp &quot;Hello World!&quot;
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The user enters a number via the [[../Prompt|&lt;tt&gt;Prompt&lt;/tt&gt;]] instruction and will only display the text if X (the user's input) is greater than 3.


When using &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; to regulate the execution of more than one instruction, [[../Then|&lt;tt&gt;Then&lt;/tt&gt;]]  is needed.  (See the next section.)  Without the &lt;tt&gt;Then&lt;/tt&gt;, only the instruction immediately following the &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; statement will be regulated while the rest will be executed indifferent to the value of the criteria.

For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
::If X&gt;3
:Disp &quot;Hello World!&quot;
:Disp &quot;My Name is Seth&quot;
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

will display &quot;Hello World!&quot; followed by &quot;My name is Seth&quot; if X (the user's input) is greater than 3, and will display only &quot;My name is Seth&quot; if X is less than 3.  This is because &lt;tt&gt;:Disp &quot;My Name is Seth&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is executed regardless what the value of X is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spilling over into the beginning of the 18th century were the last remnants of Baroque art. Baroque interior design, in particular, is distinctly ornate and rich in ceiling decor. 

Following Baroque art, a similar movement, called Rococo, developed. Initially, it thrived in interior design as Baroque had previously done, but in comparison to interior design done in the Baroque style, the Rococo style could be described as softer and more refined. 

The main proponents of Rococo style painting were Antoine Watteau, Francois Boucher, and Jean-Honore Fragonard. Rococo painting has a very distinct style. Light, mint greens and soft pinks and blues were some of the most popularly used colors. In general, the color palette consisted of soft, yet intense, colors. Also, distinct to Rococo painting was the light subject matter; generally paintings in this style depicted the leisure of the upper class. Jean-Honore Fragonard's ''The Swing'' exemplifies the Rococo style, as seen in painting.

[[File:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb|David - Oath of the Horatii - 1784]]

The Rococo movement came to an end with the onset of the Enlightenment, which ushered in the next major artistic movement-Neoclassicism. As the name suggest, a revival of the influence of classic art from ancient Greece and Rome ensued. In painting, Jaques-Louis David was the leading painter of this style. His works, such as the ''Oath of the Horatii'' exemplified Neoclassicism with its logical order and stately, even heroic, subject matter. In architecture, one of the greatest influences was Palladio's ''Villa Rotunda'', a Renaissance building, itself, inspired by classic order and symmetry.

As demonstrated by the shift from Rococo to Neoclassicism, two starkly contrasting art styles, many successive art movements are reactions to previous styles. The very formal, stately Neoclassical style was a direct reaction to that of the previous light and airy Rococo style.

I feel so alone on this one. Somebody help me. [[User:Lotusduck|Lotusduck]] 18:07, 20 November 2005 (UTC)lotusduck

I'm trying to learn this stuff, it's interesting to me, but is anybody going to put more lessons on? Also would it be possible to have some kind of pronunciation key so I know how to say this stuff too? --[[User:Just.blaze|just.blaze]] 16:12, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
:I added a pronunciation of the basic alphabet and diphthongs &amp; di/trigraphs on the alphabet page. It's all in IPA. [[User:68.110.119.132|68.110.119.132]] 04:57, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
Okay, so. I added accent marks as best I could and I changed out the layout ''slightly''. I'm basing this information off of &quot;Basic Tagalog&quot;, a nice book that I have handy. It doesn't have all of the vocabulary, however, so it would be nice if the missing accents would be added. Also, the book states that pô is used for both male and female formal addressing, which conflicts with this page's pô/hô discussion. Could someone look into this and address this? Also, the book's accentuation of &quot;paalam&quot; conflicts with the original accentuation in this and conflicts with the wiki article on Tagalog. Is it paalám na, as my book states, or paálam?&lt;br /&gt;And yes, while a native Tagalog should be making these edits ideally, I would think that it's best that this information be here at all to edit. At any rate, thanks. [[User:68.110.119.132|68.110.119.132]] 05:48, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
::I'm going to correct some accentuation on this page and the rest of the pages as well. By the way, I'm a native Tagalog speaker. And yes, it should be '''paálam na''', but I will write it as '''paalam na''' without any accent marks, because the default accent is on the second to the last syllable (of a multisyllable word, of course). -- [[User:Perryv|Perryv]] 16:40, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
:::And may I add, pô/hô is used to address a person (male or female, gender doesn't matter) who is older than the speaker. It's used especially to address the elderly, and to make it even more polite, all '''second-person singular pronouns''' are turned into '''third-person plural pronouns''' (i.e., '''ikáw''' becomes '''silá''', '''mo''' becomes '''nilá''', &quot;Anó ang pangalan mo?&quot; (What is your name?) becomes &quot;Anó pó ang pangalan nilá?&quot;, etc.). -- [[User:Perryv|Perryv]] 16:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
:Oh, another thing. I realise that my layout conflicts with the layout as stated in the how-to-use section. Is it more logical, perhaps? If not, I or someone else could revert this.[[User:68.110.119.132|68.110.119.132]] 05:57, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

== mga ==

It would be useful to let us know how to pronounce ''mga''. I happened to remember the Wikipedia Tagalog article that it was an abbreviation; otherwise I would have assumed it's pronounced like it's spelled. -- a learner

== Saan and Nasaan ==

Isn't the Tagalog word for where, ''nasaan'', and not ''saan''? The response to &quot;Nasaan ang [[:w:Metasyntactic variable|foo]]?&quot; is &quot;Nasa [[:W:Metasyntactic variable|bar]] ang foo.&quot;, right? --[[Special:Contributions/68.224.117.152|68.224.117.152]] ([[User talk:68.224.117.152|talk]]) 08:06, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

== Pasko ==

Are you sure that &quot;Pasko&quot; is Christmas? Not Easter? [[User:Bruised|Bruised]] ([[User talk:Bruised|talk]]) 22:29, 4 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Important things to know about Glass==
*Glass will not look transparent (outside of the materials panel) while you're looking at it in Blender! It will only look like glass when you render (ray trace) the model.
*Glass needs light coming from different directions, in order to look transparent, start with 4 lamps equally spaced around the glass area in order to fully see the effect, then add/remove lamps to get the effect you are looking for.
*In versions of Blender 2.37 and lower, don't forget to enable raytracing on the render tab (Press '''F10''' in the buttons window, then go to render tab within that window and click the button '''Ray''' which will enable the raytracing). (This setting only applies on rendering while using Blender Internal, not suitable for others like Yafray, etc.)

==Simple Glass==

'''Material'''&lt;br&gt;
Alpha: .2&lt;br&gt;
Color: a color of your choice ( try and keep the S(aturation) below .6, for best results ) 

'''Mirror Tran'''&lt;br&gt;
Ray Transparency: enabled


==Realistic Glass==
[[Image:Blender-Glass.pNg|thumb|Glass (Click to enlarge)]]
'''Material'''&lt;br /&gt;
Alpha: 0.1&lt;br /&gt;
Color: White (hex code: FFFFFF)&lt;br /&gt;


'''Shaders'''&lt;br /&gt;
Reflectivity: 0.2&lt;br /&gt;
Specularity: 1.5&lt;br /&gt;
Hardness: 511&lt;br /&gt;
Translucency: 0.5&lt;br /&gt;
Ambient: 0.5&lt;br /&gt;
Emit: 0&lt;br /&gt;


'''Mirror Trasp'''&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Mirror: enabled&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Mirror: 0.2&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Transparency: enabled&lt;br /&gt;
IOR (angular index of refraction): 1.37&lt;br /&gt;
'''NOTE:''' it is suggested to play with the Fresnel for transparency.&lt;br /&gt;

''Note: Don't forget to enable raytracing on the render tab (Press '''F10''' in the buttons window, then go to render tab within that window and click the button '''Ray''' which will enable the raytracing). '''Raytracing is enabled by default in Blender 2.37 and higher.'''
(This setting only applies on rendering while using Blender Internal, not suitable for others like Yafray.)''



==Mirror Glass==

Here is an example of some glass that is less transparent and more reflective, almost a mirror. Just play with the &quot;Alpha&quot; setting until you get the effect you want. &lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Blender_3D_Glass.JPG|thumb|Glass: Click to enlarge]]

'''Material'''&lt;br /&gt;
Alpha: .2&lt;br /&gt;
Diffuse Color: R .74, G .776, B .818&lt;br /&gt;
Speclular Color: R .676, G .732, B .798&lt;br /&gt;


'''Shaders'''&lt;br /&gt;
Diffuse Shader: Oren-Nayar&lt;br /&gt;
Reflection (Oren-Nayar): .959&lt;br /&gt;
Roughness (Oren-Nayar): .818&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Specular Shader: Blinn&lt;br /&gt;
Specularity (Blinn): .731&lt;br /&gt;
Hardness(Blinn): 179&lt;br /&gt;
Refraction (Blinn): 10&lt;br /&gt;


'''Mirror Trasp'''&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Mirror: enabled&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Mirror: .56&lt;br /&gt;
Ztransp: enabled (this is very important, otherwise when you set your alpha value, only your background color will show through, not the object behind the alphaed object)&lt;br /&gt;


All the rules for raytracing apply as written above.

==Plate Glass with green edges==

Another glass setting. This one even has green edges by having different materials for them.
[[Image:EckieGlassShowoff.jpg|thumb|Glass with green edges: Click to enlarge]]
[[Image:Eckie Glass shader settings.PNG]]

The Ztransp button should also be enabled, to allow the glass to show the material behind it.

Apply the green edges by using this material for the edges:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Gold 1 ====
One of the gold formulas.

[[Image:Blender 3D Gold.png|thumb|Gold]]

Alpha: 1.0&lt;br /&gt;
Color: R=1.0 G=0.836 B=0.386&lt;br /&gt;
Reflectivity: 1.0&lt;br /&gt;
Specularity: 0.75&lt;br /&gt;
Hardness: 180&lt;br /&gt;
Translucency: 0.50&lt;br /&gt;
Ambient: 0.50&lt;br /&gt;
Emit: 0.300&lt;br /&gt;
'''Raytracing'''&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Mirror: 0.20&lt;br /&gt;
Depth: 2&lt;br /&gt;
Fresnel: 0.5&lt;br /&gt;
Fac(tor): 2.20&lt;br /&gt;

==== Gold 2 ====
After several hours of experimenting, a beginner alchemist created this better alternative formula:

[[Image:Blender3D-Gold.png|thumb|197px|Gold]]

'''Material'''&lt;br/&gt;
Col: R=1.00 G=0.88 B=0.25&lt;br/&gt;
Spe: R=1.00 G=1.00 B=1.00&lt;br/&gt;
Mir: R=1.00 G=0.88 B=0.25&lt;br/&gt;

A: 1.0&lt;br/&gt;


'''Mirror Transp'''&lt;br/&gt;
Ray Mirror: On&lt;br/&gt;
RayMir: 0.50&lt;br/&gt;


'''Shaders'''&lt;br/&gt;
[Lambert] Ref: 1.0&lt;br/&gt;

[Phong] Spec: 2.0&lt;br/&gt;
Hard: 75&lt;br/&gt;

Amb: 0.043&lt;br/&gt;


Make sure you have &quot;'''Ray'''&quot; enabled (Scene ('''F10''') &gt; &quot;Render&quot; box &gt; Ray) or else it won't reflect light.&lt;br/&gt;

Looks good with a '''Sun''' lamp as a light source

====Gold 3====
Gold 3 was mentioned as looking more like &quot;Polished Brass&quot; and was moved to the &quot;Brass&quot; Section.

====Gold 4====

This is also kind of like brass, somewhat old and worn. To tweak it more you could add a brownish color or make the specularity more reddish.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Blender_3D_Gold.JPG|thumb|Gold: Click to enlarge]]
'''&quot;Material&quot;''' tab&lt;br /&gt;
Color: R 1, G .954, B .392&lt;br /&gt;

'''&quot;Shaders&quot;''' tab&lt;br /&gt;
Reflectivity (Lambert): .843&lt;br /&gt;
Specularity (Blinn): .5&lt;br /&gt;
Hardness(Blinn): 16&lt;br /&gt;
Refr (I think this value is &quot;refraction&quot;) (Blinn): 5.575&lt;br /&gt;
Translucency: .26&lt;br /&gt;
Ambience: .183&lt;br /&gt;
Emit .072&lt;br /&gt;

'''&quot;Mirror Transp&quot;'''' Options:&lt;br /&gt;
Raymir: enabled, .07&lt;br /&gt;


'''&quot;Map To&quot;''' tab&lt;br /&gt;
Nor: enabled, .50&lt;br /&gt;

'''&quot;Texture&quot;''' Window&lt;br /&gt;
Texture Type: Clouds&lt;br /&gt;

'''&quot;Color&quot;''' tab&lt;br /&gt;
Right Side Color: R .915, G .876, B .394&lt;br /&gt;
Left Side Color: Black&lt;br /&gt;
Left Side Alpha: 0&lt;br /&gt;

By left/rightside I mean the colors and alpha located on these two parts of the nodes window. Image shown here:
[[Image:toolbar.jpg]]

====Gold 5====
Based on material &quot;Gold 3&quot; with some tweaks to be done to make this material look more goldish. Base setup is taken from the release Notes ([http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Procedurals_Gallery.279.0.html]).

[[Image:Blender3D Gold ReleaseNotes.jpg|thumb|197px|Gold]]

You should to take this material as a base and study thoroughly how textures are set up, because without them it loses 50 percent of its convincing look.

'''Material'''&lt;br/&gt;
Col: R=0.912 G=0.782 B=0.082&lt;br/&gt;
Spe: R=1.00 G=0.913 B=0.8&lt;br/&gt;
Mir: R=0.857 G=0.90 B=0.70&lt;br/&gt;

A: 1.0&lt;br/&gt;


'''Mirror Transp'''&lt;br/&gt;
Ray Mirror: On&lt;br/&gt;
RayMir: 0.40&lt;br/&gt;

[[Image:GoldBarz.jpg|thumb|right|Blender 3D rendering of gold ingots using the Gold 5 method.]]

'''Shaders'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Diffuse Shader:'''&lt;br/&gt;
[Oren Nayar] Ref: 0.8&lt;br/&gt;
Rough: 0.9&lt;br /&gt;
'''Specular Shader:'''&lt;br/&gt;
[Phong] Spec: 1.4&lt;br/&gt;
Hard: 20&lt;br/&gt;

From those structure textures (voronoi) I suggest to suppress normal-mapped to the range 0.1-0.3.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Gold 6'''&lt;br /&gt;
This is a nice gold material I found online.

'''Material'''&lt;br/&gt;
Diffuse Color: Red=.286; Green=.263; Blue=.136&lt;br/&gt;
Specular Color: Red=1; Green=.96; Blue=.656&lt;br/&gt;
Mirror Color: Red=.751; Green=.664; Blue=.289&lt;br/&gt;
Alpha: 1

'''Mirror/Transparency'''&lt;br/&gt;
Ray Mirror is on and is set to 1.00.&lt;br/&gt;

[[Image:Gold.jpg|thumb|right|Golden orb using the Gold 6 method]]

'''Shaders'''&lt;br/&gt;
Diffuse (Lambert): .54&lt;br/&gt;
Specular (CookTorr): 1.86&lt;br/&gt;
Specular Hardness is 356.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
====Gold 7====

Using Blender 2.62 and the Cycles Render, I built this image showing the different settings
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Fixed gold color:''' E5BF65
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Material Surface:''' Glossy, Transparent Glossy, Translucent Glossy, Velvet Glossy, Diffuse Glossy, Diffuse
&lt;br/&gt;

Mirrors can add an extra level of realism and beauty to your work. They can be applied to any surface, flat or round.

To texture a mirror, keep all settings as default except:

'''Mirror Transp'''

Ray Mirror: On&lt;br /&gt;
RayMir: 0.7&lt;br /&gt;
Fresnel: 1&lt;br /&gt;

To compile your first C# application, you will need a copy of a .NET Framework SDK installed on your PC.

There are two .NET frameworks available: Microsoft's and Mono's.
== Microsoft .NET ==
For Windows, the .NET Framework SDK can be downloaded from Microsoft's [http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/ .NET Framework Developer Center]. If the default Windows directory (the directory where Windows or WinNT is installed) is &lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS&lt;/code&gt;, the .Net Framework SDK installation places the Visual C# .NET compiler (csc) in the

&lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.0.3705 &lt;/code&gt; directory for version 1.0, the 

&lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322&lt;/code&gt; directory for version 1.1, the 

&lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727&lt;/code&gt; directory for version 2.0, the

&lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.0 &lt;/code&gt; directory for version 3.0, the

&lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5 &lt;/code&gt; directory for version 3.5, '''or''' the

&lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 &lt;/code&gt; directory for version 4.0.

== Mono ==
For Windows, Linux, or other Operating Systems, an installer can be downloaded from the [http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads Mono website]. For Linux, a good compiler is cscc that can be downloaded for free from [http://dotgnu.org/pnet.html the DotGNU Portable.Net project] page. The compiled programs can then be run with ilrun.

=== Linux ===
In Linux you can use the MonoDevelop IDE, and either download from their website at: [http://monodevelop.com/Download MonoDevelop Downloads], or install via apt-get or your distro's installer.

* Debian-based distros:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install monodevelop&lt;/pre&gt;

* Arch Linux:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo pacman -S mono monodevelop&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Windows ===
You can download MonoDevelop from their website at: [http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads Mono website]. Click the Windows icon, and follow the installation instructions.

If you are working on Windows it is a good idea to add the path to the folders that contain cs.exe or mcs.exe to the Path environment variable so that you do not need to type the full path each time you want to compile.

For writing C#.NET code, there are plenty of editors that are available.  It's entirely possible to write C#.NET programs with a simple text editor, but it should be noted that this requires you to compile the code yourself.  Microsoft offers a wide range of code editing programs under the Visual Studio line that offer syntax highlighting as well as compiling and debugging capabilities.   Currently C#.NET can be compiled in Visual Studio 2002 and 2003 (only supports the .NET Framework version 1.0 and 1.1) and Visual Studio 2005 (supports the .NET Framework 2.0 and earlier versions with some tweaking).  Microsoft offers [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zcbsd3cz(VS.80).aspx five Visual Studio editions], four of which are sold commercially.  The Visual Studio C# Express Edition can be downloaded and used for free from [http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7653518 Microsoft's website].

== Hello, World! ==

The code below will demonstrate a C# program written in a simple text editor.  Start by saving the following code to a text file called &lt;code&gt;hello.cs&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

namespace MyConsoleApplication
{
	class MyFirstClass
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello,&quot;);
			Console.WriteLine(&quot;World!&quot;);
			Console.ReadLine();
		}
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To compile &lt;code&gt;hello.cs&lt;/code&gt;, run the following from the command line:
* For standard Microsoft installations of .NET 2.0, run &lt;code&gt;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc.exe hello.cs&lt;/code&gt;
* For Mono run &lt;code&gt;mcs hello.cs&lt;/code&gt;.
* For users of cscc, compile with &lt;code&gt;cscc hello.cs -o hello.exe&lt;/code&gt;. 

Doing so will produce &lt;code&gt;hello.exe&lt;/code&gt;. The following command will run &lt;code&gt;hello.exe&lt;/code&gt;:
* On Windows, use &lt;code&gt;hello.exe&lt;/code&gt;.
* On Linux, use &lt;code&gt;mono hello.exe&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ilrun hello.exe&lt;/code&gt;. 

Alternatively, in Visual C# express, you could just hit F5 or the green play button to run the code. If you want to run without debugging, press CTRL-F5. 

Running &lt;code&gt;hello.exe&lt;/code&gt; will produce the following output:
 Hello,
 World!
The program will then wait for you to strike 'enter' before returning to the command prompt.

Note that the example above includes the {{C sharp|System}} namespace via the {{C sharp|using}} keyword. That inclusion allows direct references to any member of the {{C sharp|System}} namespace without specifying its fully qualified name.

The first call to the {{C sharp|WriteLine}} method of the {{C sharp|Console}} class uses a fully qualified reference.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello,&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

The second call to that method shortens the reference to the {{C sharp|Console}} class by taking advantage of the fact that the {{C sharp|System}} namespace is included (with {{C sharp|using System}}).

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Console.WriteLine(&quot;World!&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

C# is a fully object-oriented language. The following sections explain the syntax of the C# language as a beginner's course for programming in the language. Note that much of the power of the language comes from the classes provided with the .NET framework, which are not part of the C# language syntax ''per se''.

C# operators and their precedence closely resemble the operators in other languages of the C family.

Similar to C++, classes can ''overload'' most operators, defining or redefining the behavior of the operators in contexts where the first argument of that operator is an instance of that class, but doing so is often discouraged for clarity.

Operators can be grouped by their [[:w:Arity|arity]] as [[:w:unary operator|unary]], [[:w:binary operator|binary]].

Following are the built-in behaviors of C# operators.

==Arithmetic==
The following arithmetic operators operate on numeric operands (arguments {{C sharp|a}} and {{C sharp|b}} in the &quot;sample usage&quot; below).
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Sample usage || Read || Type || Explanation
|-
|{{C sharp|a + b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''plus'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|+}} returns the [[w:en:addition|sum]] of its arguments.
|-
|{{C sharp|a - b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''minus'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|-}} returns the [[w:en:subtraction|difference]] between its arguments.
|-
|{{C sharp|a*b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''times'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|*}} returns the [[w:en:multiplication|multiplicative product]] of its arguments.
|-
|{{C sharp|a/b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''divided by'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|/}} returns the [[w:en:division (mathematics)|quotient]] of its arguments. If both of its operators are integers, it obtains that quotient using ''integer division'' (i.e. it drops any resulting remainder).
|-
|{{C sharp|a%b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''mod'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|%}} operates only on integer arguments. It returns the [[w:en:remainder|remainder]] of ''integer division'' of those arguments. ''(See [[w:en:modular arithmetic|modular arithmetic]].)''
|-
|{{C sharp|a++}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''plus plus'' or ''Postincrement'' {{C sharp|a}} || unary || {{C sharp|++}} operates only on arguments that have an ''l-value''. When placed '''after''' its argument, it increments that argument by 1 and returns the value of that argument before it was incremented.
|-

==Logical==
The following logical operators operate on boolean or integral operands, as noted.

|-
|{{C sharp|a&amp;b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''bitwise and'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|&amp;}} evaluates both of its operands and returns the [[w:en:Logical conjunction|logical conjunction]] (&quot;AND&quot;) of their results. If the operands are integral, the logical conjunction is performed bitwise.
|-
|{{C sharp|a&amp;&amp;b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''and'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|&amp;&amp;}} operates on boolean operands only. It evaluates its first operand. If the result is ''false'', it returns ''false''. Otherwise, it evaluates and returns the results of the second operand. Note that, if evaluating the second operand would hypothetically have no side effects, the results are identical to the logical conjunction performed by the {{C sharp|&amp;}} operator.  This is an example of [[w:en:Short-circuit_evaluation|Short Circuit Evaluation]].
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''bitwise or'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; evaluates both of its operands and returns the [[w:en:Logical disjunction|logical disjunction]] (&quot;OR&quot;) of their results. If the operands are integral, the logical disjunction is performed bitwise.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a &lt;nowiki&gt; || &lt;/nowiki&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''or'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; || &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operates on boolean operands only. It evaluates the first operand. If the result is ''true'', it returns ''true''. Otherwise, it evaluates and returns the results of the second operand. Note that, if evaluating the second operand would hypothetically have no side effects, the results are identical to the logical disjunction performed by the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator.  This is an example of [[w:en:Short-circuit_evaluation|Short Circuit Evaluation]].
|-
|{{C sharp|a ^ b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''x-or'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; returns the [[w:en:exclusive or|exclusive or]] (&quot;XOR&quot;) of their results. If the operands are integral, the exclusive or is performed bitwise.
|-
|{{C sharp|!a}} || ''not'' {{C sharp|a}} || unary || {{C sharp|!}} operates on a boolean operand only. It evaluates its operand and returns the [[w:en:negation|negation]] (&quot;NOT&quot;) of the result. That is, it returns ''true'' if {{C sharp|a}} evaluates to ''false'' and it returns ''false'' if {{C sharp|a}} evaluates to ''true''.
|-
|{{C sharp|~a}} || ''bitwise not'' {{C sharp|a}} || unary || {{C sharp|~}} operates on integral operands only. It evaluates its operand and returns the bitwise negation of the result. That is, {{C sharp|~a}} returns a value where each bit is the negation of the corresponding bit in the result of evaluating {{C sharp|a}}.

==Bitwise shifting==

!Sample usage || Read || Type || Explanation
|-
|{{C sharp|a &lt;&lt; b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''left shift'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|&lt;&lt;}} evaluates its operands and returns the resulting first argument left-shifted by the number of bits specified by the second argument. It discards high-order bits that shift beyond the size of its first argument and sets new low-order bits to zero.
|-
|{{C sharp|a &gt;&gt; b}} || {{C sharp|a}} ''right shift'' {{C sharp|b}} || binary || {{C sharp|&gt;&gt;}} evaluates its operands and returns the resulting first argument right-shifted by the number of bits specified by the second argument. It discards low-order bits that are shifted beyond the size of its first argument and sets new high-order bits to the sign bit of the first argument, or to zero if the first argument is unsigned.
|}

== Relational ==
The binary relational operators &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;, {{C sharp|&lt;}}, {{C sharp|&gt;}}, &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; are used for relational operations and for type comparisons.

{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!Sample usage || Read || Explanation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a == b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''is equal to'' {{C sharp|b}} || For arguments of ''value'' type, the operator &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; returns ''true'', if its operands have the same value, false otherwise. For the ''string'' type, it returns ''true'', if the strings' character sequences match. For other ''reference'' types (types derived from {{C sharp|System.Object}}), however, &lt;code&gt;a == b&lt;/code&gt; returns ''true'' only if {{C sharp|a}} and {{C sharp|b}} reference the same object.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a != b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''is not equal to'' &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; || The operator &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; returns the logical negation of the operator &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, it returns ''true'', if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not equal to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and ''false'', if they are equal.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''is less than'' {{C sharp|b}} || The operator {{C sharp|&lt;}} operates on integral types. It returns ''true'', if {{C sharp|a}} is less than &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, ''false'' otherwise.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a &gt; b&lt;/code&gt; ||  {{C sharp|a}} ''is greater than'' {{C sharp|b}} || The operator {{C sharp|&gt;}} operates on integral types. It returns ''true'', if {{C sharp|a}} is greater than {{C sharp|b}}, ''false'' otherwise.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a &lt;= b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''is less than or equal to'' {{C sharp|b}} || The operator &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; operates on integral types. It returns ''true'', if {{C sharp|a}} is less than or equal to {{C sharp|b}}, ''false'' otherwise.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a &gt;= b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''is greater than or equal to'' {{C sharp|b}} || The operator &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; operates on integral types. It returns ''true'', if {{C sharp|a}} is greater than or equal to {{C sharp|b}}, ''false'' otherwise.
|}

==Assignment==
The assignment operators are binary. The most basic is the operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;. Not surprisingly, it assigns the value (or reference) of its second argument to its first argument.

(More technically, the operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; requires for its first (''left'') argument an expression to which a value can be assigned (an ''l-value'') and for its second (''right'') argument an expression that can be evaluated (an ''r-value''). That requirement of an ''assignable'' expression to its left and a ''bound'' expression to its right is the origin of the terms ''l-value'' and ''r-value''.)

The first argument of the assignment operator (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;) is typically a variable. When that argument has a ''value'' type, the assignment operation changes the argument's underlying value. When the first argument is a ''reference'' type, the assignment operation changes the reference, so the first argument typically just refers to a different object, but the object that it originally referenced does not change (except that it may no longer be referenced and may thus be a candidate for ''garbage collection'').

!Sample usage || Read || Explanation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a = b&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|a}} ''equals'' (or ''set to'') {{C sharp|b}} || The operator &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; evaluates its second argument and then assigns the results to (the ''l-value'' indicated by) its first argument.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;a = b = c&lt;/code&gt; || {{C sharp|b}} ''set to'' {{C sharp|c}}, and then {{C sharp|a}} ''set to'' {{C sharp|b}} || Equivalent to &lt;code&gt;a = (b = c)&lt;/code&gt;. When there are consecutive assignments, the right-most assignment is evaluated first, proceeding from right to left. In this example, both variables {{C sharp|a}} and {{C sharp|b}} have the value of {{C sharp|c}}.
|}

==Short-hand Assignment==
The short-hand assignment operators shortens the common assignment operation of &lt;code&gt;a = a ''operator'' b&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;a ''operator''= b&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in less typing and neater syntax.

== Pointer manipulation ==
''NOTE: Most C# developers agree that direct manipulation and use of pointers is not recommended in C#. The language has many built-in classes to allow you to do almost any operation you want. C# was built with memory-management in mind and the creation and use of pointers is greatly disruptive to this end. This speaks to the declaration of pointers and the use of pointer notation, not arrays. In fact, a program may only be compiled in &quot;unsafe mode&quot;, if it uses pointers.

Conditional, iteration, jump, and exception handling statements control a program's flow of execution.

A conditional statement can decide something using keywords such as {{C sharp|if}}, {{C sharp|switch}}.

An iteration statement can create a loop using keywords such as {{C sharp|do}}, {{C sharp|while}}, {{C sharp|for}}, {{C sharp|foreach}}, and {{C sharp|in}}.

A jump statement can be used to transfer program control using keywords such as {{C sharp|break}}, {{C sharp|continue}}, {{C sharp|return}}, and {{C sharp|yield}}.

==Conditional statements==
A conditional statement decides whether to execute code based on conditions. The {{C sharp|if}} statement and the {{C sharp|switch}} statement are the two types of conditional statements in C#.

==={{C sharp|if}} statement===
As with most of C#, the {{C sharp|if}} statement has the same syntax as in C, C++, and Java. Thus, it is written in the following form:
:''if-statement'' ::= &quot;if&quot; &quot;(&quot; ''condition'' &quot;)&quot; ''if-body'' [&quot;else&quot; ''else-body'']
:''condition'' ::= ''boolean-expression''
:''if-body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''
:''else-body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''
The {{C sharp|if}} statement evaluates its ''condition'' expression to determine whether to execute the ''if-body''. Optionally, an {{C sharp|else}} clause can immediately follow the ''if body'', providing code to execute when the ''condition'' is ''false''. Making the ''else-body'' another {{C sharp|if}} statement creates the common ''cascade'' of {{C sharp|if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else}} statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

public class IfStatementSample
{
    public void IfMyNumberIs()
    {
        int myNumber = 5;

        if ( myNumber == 4 )
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not 4.&quot;);
        else if( myNumber &lt; 0 )
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not negative.&quot;);
        }
        else if( myNumber % 2 == 0 )
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not even.&quot;);
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;myNumber does not match the coded conditions, so this sentence will be shown!&quot;);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==={{C sharp|switch}} statement===
The {{C sharp|switch}} statement is similar to the statement from C, C++ and Java.

Unlike C, each {{C sharp|case}} statement must finish with a jump statement (that can be {{C sharp|break}} or {{C sharp|goto}} or {{C sharp|return}}). In other words, C# does not support &quot;fall through&quot; from one {{C sharp|case}} statement to the next (thereby eliminating a common source of unexpected behaviour in C programs). However &quot;stacking&quot; of cases is allowed, as in the example below. If {{C sharp|goto}} is used, it may refer to a case label or the default case (e.g. {{C sharp|goto case 0}} or {{C sharp|goto default}}).

The {{C sharp|default}} label is optional. If no default case is defined, then the default behaviour is to do nothing. 

A simple example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
switch (nCPU)
{
    case 0:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;You don't have a CPU! :-)&quot;);
        break;
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Single processor computer&quot;);
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Dual processor computer&quot;);
        break;
        // Stacked cases
    case 3:
        // falls through
    case 4:
        // falls through
    case 5:
        // falls through
    case 6:
        // falls through
    case 7:
        // falls through
    case 8:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;A multi processor computer&quot;);
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;A seriously parallel computer&quot;);
        break;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A nice improvement over the C switch statement is that the switch variable can be a string. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
switch (aircraftIdent)
{
    case &quot;C-FESO&quot;:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Rans S6S Coyote&quot;);
        break;
    case &quot;C-GJIS&quot;:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Rans S12XL Airaile&quot;);
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Unknown aircraft&quot;);
        break;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Iteration statements==
An iteration statement creates a ''loop'' of code to execute a variable number of times. The {{C sharp|for}} loop, the {{C sharp|do}} loop, the {{C sharp|while}} loop, and the {{C sharp|foreach}} loop are the iteration statements in C#.

==={{C sharp|do ... while}} loop===
The {{C sharp|do...while}} loop likewise has the same syntax as in other languages derived from C. It is written in the following form:
:''do...while-loop'' ::= &quot;do&quot; ''body'' &quot;while&quot; &quot;(&quot; ''condition'' &quot;)&quot;
:''condition'' ::= ''boolean-expression''
:''body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''

The {{C sharp|do...while}} loop always runs its ''body'' once. After its first run, it evaluates its ''condition'' to determine whether to run its ''body'' again. If the ''condition'' is ''true'', the ''body'' executes. If the ''condition'' evaluates to ''true'' again after the ''body'' has ran, the ''body'' executes again. When the ''condition'' evaluates to ''false'', the {{C sharp|do...while}} loop ends.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

public class DoWhileLoopSample
{
    public void PrintValuesFromZeroToTen()
    {
        int number = 0;

        do
        {
            Console.WriteLine(number++.ToString());
        } while(number &lt;= 10);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code writes the integers from 0 to 10 to the console.

==={{C sharp|for}} loop===
The {{C sharp|for}} loop likewise has the same syntax as in other languages derived from C. It is written in the following form:
:''for-loop'' ::= &quot;for&quot; &quot;(&quot; ''initialization'' &quot;;&quot; ''condition'' &quot;;&quot; ''iteration'' &quot;)&quot; ''body''
:''initialization'' ::= ''variable-declaration'' | ''list-of-statements''
:''condition'' ::= ''boolean-expression''
:''iteration'' ::= ''list-of-statements''
:''body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''
The ''initialization'' variable declaration or statements are executed the first time through the {{C sharp|for}} loop, typically to declare and initialize an index variable. The ''condition'' expression is evaluated before each pass through the ''body'' to determine whether to execute the body. It is often used to test an index variable against some limit. If the ''condition'' evaluates to ''true'', the ''body'' is executed. The ''iteration'' statements are executed after each pass through the ''body'', typically to increment or decrement an index variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class ForLoopSample
{
    public void ForFirst100NaturalNumbers()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(i.ToString());
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code writes the integers from 0 to 99 to the console.

==={{C sharp|foreach}} loop===
The {{C sharp|foreach}} statement is similar to the {{C sharp|for}} statement in that both allow code to iterate over the items of collections, but the {{C sharp|foreach}} statement lacks an iteration index, so it works even with collections that lack indices altogether. It is written in the following form:
:''foreach-loop'' ::= &quot;foreach&quot; &quot;(&quot; ''variable-declaration'' &quot;in&quot; ''enumerable-expression'' &quot;)&quot; ''body''
:''body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''
The ''enumerable-expression'' is an expression of a type that implements {{C sharp|'''IEnumerable'''}}, so it can be an array or a ''collection''. The ''variable-declaration'' declares a variable that will be set to the successive elements of the ''enumerable-expression'' for each pass through the ''body''. The {{C sharp|foreach}} loop exits when there are no more elements of the ''enumerable-expression'' to assign to the variable of the ''variable-declaration''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class ForEachSample
{
    public void DoSomethingForEachItem()
    {
        string[] itemsToWrite = {&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;};

        foreach (string item in itemsToWrite)
        System.Console.WriteLine(item);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above code, the {{C sharp|foreach}} statement iterates over the elements of the string array to write &quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, and &quot;Charlie&quot; to the console.

==={{C sharp|while}} loop===
The {{C sharp|while}} loop has the same syntax as in other languages derived from C. It is written in the following form:
:''while-loop'' ::= &quot;while&quot; &quot;(&quot; ''condition'' &quot;)&quot; ''body''
:''condition'' ::= ''boolean-expression''
:''body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''

The {{C sharp|while}} loop evaluates its ''condition'' to determine whether to run its ''body''. If the ''condition'' is ''true'', the ''body'' executes. If the ''condition'' then evaluates to ''true'' again, the ''body'' executes again. When the ''condition'' evaluates to ''false'', the {{C sharp|while}} loop ends.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

public class WhileLoopSample
{
    public void RunForAWhile()
    {
        TimeSpan durationToRun = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 30);
        DateTime start = DateTime.Now;

        while (DateTime.Now - start &lt; durationToRun)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;not finished yet&quot;);
        }
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;finished&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Jump statements ==
A jump statement can be used to transfer program control using keywords such as {{C sharp|break}}, {{C sharp|continue}}, {{C sharp|return}}, {{C sharp|yield}}, and {{C sharp|throw}}.

==={{C sharp|break}}===
A break statement is used to exit from a case in a switch statement and also used to exit from for, foreach, while, do .. while loops that will switch the control to the statement immediately after the end of the loop.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;

namespace JumpSample
{
    public class Entry
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int i;
 
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) // see the comparison, i &lt; 10
            {
                if (i &gt;= 3)
                {
                    break; 
                    // Not run over the code, and get out of loop.
                    // Note: The rest of code will not be executed,
                    //       &amp; it leaves the loop instantly
                }
            }
            // Here check the value of i, it will be 3, not 10.
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;The value of OneExternCounter: {0}&quot;, i);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==={{C sharp|continue}}===

The {{C sharp|continue}} keyword transfers program control just before the end of a loop. The condition for the loop is then checked, and if it is met, the loop performs another iteration.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;

namespace JumpSample
{
    public class Entry
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int OneExternCounter = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
            {
                if (i &gt;= 5)
                {
                    continue;   // Not run over the code, and return to the beginning 
                                // of the scope as if it had completed the loop
                }
                OneExternCounter += 1;
            }
            // Here check the value of OneExternCounter, it will be 5, not 10.
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;The value of OneExternCounter: {0}&quot;, OneExternCounter);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==={{C sharp|return}}===

The {{C sharp|return}} keyword identifies the return value for the function or method (if any), and transfers control to the end of the function.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
namespace JumpSample
{
    public class Entry
    {
        static int Fun()
        {
            int a = 3;
            return a; // the code terminates here from this function
            a = 9;    // here is a block that will not be executed
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int OnNumber = Fun();
            // the value of OnNumber is 3, not 9...
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==={{C sharp|yield}}===
The {{C sharp|yield}} keyword is used to define an iterator block that produces values for an enumerator. It is typically used within a method
implementation of the {{C sharp|IEnumerable}} interface as an easy way to create an iterator.
It is written in the following forms:
:''yield'' ::= &quot;yield&quot; &quot;return&quot; ''expression''
:''yield'' ::= &quot;yield&quot; &quot;break&quot;

The following example shows the usage of the yield keyword inside the method {{C sharp|MyCounter}}. This method defines an iterator block, and will return an enumerator object that generates the value of a counter from zero to {{C sharp|stop}}, incrementing by {{C sharp|step}} for each value generated.

&lt;source lang=csharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Collections;

public class YieldSample
{
    public static IEnumerable MyCounter(int stop, int step)
    {
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; stop; i += step)
        {
            yield return i;
        }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        foreach (int j in MyCounter(10, 2))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} &quot;, j);
        }
        // Will display 0 2 4 6 8
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==={{C sharp|throw}}===

The {{C sharp|throw}} keyword throws an exception. If it is located within a try block, it will transfer the control to a catch block that matches the exception - otherwise, it will check if any calling functions are contained within the matching catch block and transfer execution there. If no functions contain a catch block, the program may terminate because of an unhandled exception. 

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
namespace ExceptionSample
{
    public class Warrior
    {
        private string Name { get; set; }

        public Warrior(string name)
        {
            if (name == &quot;Piccolo&quot;)
            {
                throw new Exception(&quot;Piccolo can't battle!&quot;);
            }
        }
    }

    public class Entry
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                Warrior a = new Warrior(&quot;Goku&quot;);
                Warrior b = new Warrior(&quot;Vegeta&quot;);
                Warrior c = new Warrior(&quot;Piccolo&quot;); // exception here!
            }
            catch(Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Exceptions and the throw statement are described in greater detail in the [[C_Sharp_Programming/Exceptions|Exceptions]] chapter.

'''[[w:variable#Computer programming|Variables]]''' are used to store values. More technically, a variable [[w:Name binding|binds]] an [[w:object (computer science)|object]] (in the general sense of the term, i.e. a specific value) to an identifier (the variable's name) so that the object can be accessed later. Variables can, for example, store a value for later use:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
string name = &quot;Dr. Jones&quot;;
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Good morning &quot; + name);
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example &quot;name&quot; is the identifier and &quot;Dr. Jones&quot; is the value that we bound to it. Also, each variable is declared with an explicit ''type''. Only values whose types are compatible with the variable's declared type can be bound to (stored in) the variable. In the above example we stored &quot;Dr. Jones&quot; into a variable of the type {{C sharp|string}}. This is a legal statement. However, if we had said {{C sharp|int name}} = {{C sharp|&quot;Dr. Jones&quot;}}, the compiler would have thrown an error telling us that you cannot implicitly convert between {{C sharp|int}} and {{C sharp|string}}. There are methods for doing this, but we will talk about them later.

==Fields, local variables, and parameters==

C# supports several program elements corresponding to the general programming concept of ''variable'': ''fields'', ''parameters'', and ''local variables''.

===Fields===

'''Fields''', sometimes called class-level variables, are variables associated with classes or structures. An ''instance variable'' is a field associated with an instance of the class or structure, while a ''static variable'', declared with the {{C sharp/kw|static}} keyword, is a field associated with the type itself. Fields can also be associated with their class by making them ''constants'' ({{C sharp/kw|const}}), which requires a declaration assignment of a constant value and prevents subsequent changes to the field.

Each field has a visibility of ''public'', ''protected'', ''internal'', ''protected internal'', or ''private'' (from most visible to least visible).

===Local variables===

Like fields, local variables can optionally be ''constant'' ({{C sharp/kw|const}}). Constant local variables are stored in the assembly data region, while non-constant local variables are stored on (or referenced from) the stack. They thus have both a scope and an extent of the method or statement block that declares them.

===Parameter===

'''Parameters''' are variables associated with a method.

An ''in'' parameter may either have its value passed in from the caller to the method's environment, so that changes to the parameter by the method do not affect the value of the caller's variable, or passed in by reference, so that changes to the variables will affect the value of the caller's variable.  Value types (int, double, string) are passed in &quot;by value&quot; while reference types (objects) are passed in &quot;by reference.&quot; Since this is the default for the C# compiler, it is not necessary to use &lt;!-- use what?  ..i think it's &amp;, like c++ --&gt;.

An ''out'' parameter does not have its value copied, thus changes to the variable's value within the method's environment directly affect the value from the caller's environment. Such a variable is considered by the compiler to be ''unbound'' upon method entry, thus it is illegal to reference an ''out'' parameter before assigning it a value. It also '''must''' be assigned by the method in each valid (non-exceptional) code path through the method in order for the method to compile.

A ''reference'' parameter is similar to an ''out'' parameter, except that it is ''bound'' before the method call and it need not be assigned by the method.

A ''params'' parameter represents a variable number of parameters. If a method signature includes one, the ''params'' argument must be the last argument in the signature.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// Each pair of lines is what the definition of a method and a call of a 
//   method with each of the parameters types would look like.
// In param:
void MethodOne(int param1)    // definition
MethodOne(variable);          // call

// Out param:
void MethodTwo(out string message)  // definition
MethodTwo(out variable);            // call

// Reference param;
void MethodThree(ref int someFlag)  // definition
MethodThree(ref theFlag)            // call

// Params
void MethodFour(params string[] names)           // definition
MethodFour(&quot;Matthew&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Luke&quot;, &quot;John&quot;);   // call
&lt;/source&gt;

==Types==

Each '''type''' in C# is either a ''value type'' or a ''reference type''. C# has several predefined (&quot;built-in&quot;) types and allows for declaration of custom value types and reference types.

There is a fundamental difference between value types and reference types: Value types are allocated on the stack, whereas reference types are allocated on the heap.

===Value types===

The value types in the .NET framework are usually small, frequently used types. The benefit of using them is that the type requires very little resources to get up and running by the CLR. Value types do not require memory to be allocated on the heap and therefore will not cause garbage collection. However, in order to be useful, the value types (or types derived from it) should remain small - ideally below 16 bytes of data. If you choose to make your value type bigger, it is recommended that you do not pass it to methods (which can require a copy of all its fields), or return it from methods.

Although this sounds like a useful type to have, it does have some flaws, which need to be understood when using it.

* Value types are always copied (intrinsically) before being passed to a method. Changes to this new object will not be reflected back in the original object passed into the method.
* Value types do not /need/ you to call their constructor. They are automatically initialized.
* Value types always initialize their fields to 0 or null. 
* Value types can NEVER be assigned a value of null (but can using Nullable types)
* Value types sometimes need to be ''boxed'' (wrapped inside an object), allowing their values to be used like objects.

===Reference types===

Reference types are managed very differently by the CLR. All reference types consist of two parts: A pointer to the heap (which contains the object), and the object itself. Reference types are slightly heavier weight because of the management behind the scenes needed to keep track of them. However, this is a minor price to pay for the flexibility and speed gains from passing a pointer around, rather than copying values to/from methods. 

When an object is initialized, by use of the constructor, and is of a reference type, the CLR must perform four operations:

#The CLR calculates the amount of memory required to hold the object on the heap.
#The CLR inserts the data into the newly created memory space.
#The CLR marks where the end of the space lies, so that the next object can be placed there.
#The CLR returns a reference to the newly created space.

This occurs every single time an object is created. However the assumption is that there is infinite memory, therefore some maintenance needs to take place - and that's where the garbage collector comes in.

===Integral types===

Because the type system in C# is unified with other languages that are CLI-compliant, each integral C# type is actually an alias for a corresponding type in the .NET framework. Although the names of the aliases vary between .NET languages, the underlying types in the .NET framework remain the same. Thus, objects created in assemblies written in other languages of the .NET Framework can be bound to C# variables of any type to which the value can be converted, per the conversion rules below. The following illustrates the cross-language compatibility of types by comparing C# code with the equivalent Visual Basic .NET code:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
// C#
public void UsingCSharpTypeAlias()
{
  int i = 42;
}

public void EquivalentCodeWithoutAlias()
{
  System.Int32 i = 42;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=VB&gt;
 ' Visual Basic .NET
 Public Sub UsingVisualBasicTypeAlias()
   Dim i As Integer = 42
 End Sub

 Public Sub EquivalentCodeWithoutAlias()
   Dim i As System.Int32 = 42
 End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Using the language-specific type aliases is often considered more readable than using the fully-qualified .NET Framework type names.

The fact that each C# type corresponds to a type in the unified type system gives each ''value type'' a consistent size across platforms and compilers. That consistency is an important distinction from other languages such as C, where, e.g. a {{C sharp|long}} is only guaranteed to be at ''least as large as an {{C sharp|int}}'', and is implemented with different sizes by different compilers. As ''reference'' types, variables of types derived from {{C sharp|object}} (i.e. any {{C sharp|class}}) are exempt from the consistent size requirement. That is, the size of ''reference'' types like {{C sharp|System.IntPtr}}, as opposed to ''value'' types like {{C sharp|System.Int32}}, may vary by platform. Fortunately, there is rarely a need to know the actual size of a ''reference'' type.

There are two predefined ''reference types'': {{C sharp|object}}, an alias for the {{C sharp|System.Object}} class, from which all other reference types derive; and {{C sharp|string}}, an alias for the {{C sharp|System.String}} class. C# likewise has several integral value types, each an alias to a corresponding value type in the {{C sharp|System}} namespace of the .NET Framework. The predefined C# type aliases expose the methods of the underlying .NET Framework types. For example, since the .NET Framework's {{C sharp|System.Int32}} type implements a {{C sharp|ToString()}} method to convert the value of an integer to its string representation, C#'s {{C sharp|int}} type exposes that method:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int i = 97;
string s = i.ToString();  // The value of s is now the string &quot;97&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise, the {{C sharp|System.Int32}} type implements the {{C sharp|Parse()}} method, which can therefore be accessed via C#'s {{C sharp|int}} type:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
string s = &quot;97&quot;;
int i = int.Parse(s); // The value of i is now the integer 97.
&lt;/source&gt;

The unified type system is enhanced by the ability to convert value types to reference types (''boxing'') and likewise to convert certain reference types to their corresponding value types (''unboxing''). This is also known as ''casting''.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
object boxedInteger = 97;
int unboxedInteger = (int) boxedInteger;
&lt;/source&gt;

Boxing and casting are, however, not type-safe: the compiler won't generate an error if the programmer mixes up the types. In the following short example the mistake is quite obvious, but in complex programs it may be very difficult to spot. Avoid boxing, if possible.
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
object getInteger = &quot;97&quot;;
int anInteger = (int) getInteger; // No compile-time error. The program will crash, however.
&lt;/source&gt;

The built-in C# type aliases and their equivalent .NET Framework types follow:

|-
|{{C sharp/kw|string}} || System.String || 16*length || A unicode string with no special upper bound.
|}

===Custom types===

The predefined types can be aggregated and extended into custom types.

Custom ''value types'' are declared with the {{C sharp/kw|struct}} or {{C sharp/kw|enum}} keyword. Likewise, [[C Sharp Programming/Classes|custom reference types]] are declared with the {{C sharp/kw|class}} keyword.

====Arrays====

Although the number of dimensions is included in array declarations, the size of each dimension is not:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
string[] a_str;
&lt;/source&gt;

Assignments to an array variable (prior to the variable's usage), however, specify the size of each dimension:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
a_str = new string[5];
&lt;/source&gt;

As with other variable types, the declaration and the initialization can be combined:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
string[] a_str = new string[5];
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also important to note that like in Java, arrays are passed by reference, and not passed by value. For example, the following code snippet successfully swaps two elements in an integer array:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
static void swap (int[] a_iArray, int iI, int iJ)
{
    int iTemp = a_iArray[iI];

    a_iArray[iI] = a_iArray[iJ];
    a_iArray[iJ] = iTemp;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It is possible to determine the array size during runtime. The following example assigns the loop counter to the unsigned short array elements:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
    ushort[] a_usNumbers = new ushort[234];
    [...]
    for (ushort us = 0; us &lt; a_usNumbers.Length; us++)
    {
        a_usNumbers[us] = us;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Since C# 2.0, it is possible to have arrays also inside of [[C_Sharp_Programming/Classes#Structures|structures]].

==Text &amp; variable example==

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;

namespace Login
{
  class Username_Password
  {
    public static void Main()
    {
      string username,password;
      Console.Write(&quot;Enter username: &quot;);
      username = Console.ReadLine();
      Console.Write(&quot;Enter password: &quot;);
      password = Console.ReadLine();

      if (username == &quot;SomePerson&quot; &amp;&amp; password == &quot;SomePassword&quot;)
      {
      	Console.WriteLine(&quot;Access Granted.&quot;);
      }
      else if (username != &quot;SomePerson&quot; &amp;&amp; password == &quot;SomePassword&quot;)
      {
      	Console.WriteLine(&quot;The username is wrong.&quot;);
      }
      else if (username == &quot;SomePerson&quot; &amp;&amp; password != &quot;SomePassword&quot;)
      {
      	Console.WriteLine(&quot;The password is wrong.&quot;);
      }
      else
      {
      	Console.WriteLine(&quot;Access Denied.&quot;);
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Conversion===
Values of a given type may or may not be explicitly or implicitly convertible to other types depending on predefined conversion rules, inheritance structure, and explicit cast definitions.

====Predefined conversions====
Many predefined value types have predefined conversions to other predefined value types.  If the type conversion is guaranteed not to lose information, the conversion can be ''implicit'' (i.e. an explicit ''cast'' is not required).

====Inheritance polymorphism====
A value can be implicitly converted to any class from which it inherits or interface that it implements. To convert a base class to a class that inherits from it, the conversion must be explicit in order for the conversion statement to compile. Similarly, to convert an interface instance to a class that implements it, the conversion must be explicit in order for the conversion statement to compile. In either case, the runtime environment throws a conversion exception if the value to convert is not an instance of the target type or any of its derived types.

==Scope and extent==
The scope and extent of variables is based on their declaration. The scope of parameters and local variables corresponds to the declaring method or statement block, while the scope of fields is associated with the instance or class and is potentially further restricted by the field's access modifiers.

The extent of variables is determined by the runtime environment using implicit reference counting and a complex garbage collection algorithm.

C# syntax looks quite similar to the syntax of Java because both inherit much of their syntax from C and C++. The '''object-oriented''' nature of C# requires the high-level structure of a C# program to be defined in terms of [[C Sharp Programming/Classes|classes]], whose detailed behaviors are defined by their ''statements''.

==Statements==
The basic unit of execution in a C# program is the ''statement''. A statement can declare a variable, define an expression, perform a simple action by calling a method, [[C Sharp Programming/Control|control the flow of execution]] of other statements, create an object, or assign a value to a variable, property, or field. Statements are usually terminated by a semicolon.

Statements can be grouped into comma-separated statement lists or brace-enclosed statement blocks.

Examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
int sampleVariable;                           // declaring a variable
sampleVariable = 5;                           // assigning a value
Method();                                     // calling an instance method
SampleClass sampleObject = new SampleClass(); // creating a new instance of an object
sampleObject.ObjectMethod();                  // calling a member function of an object

// executing a &quot;for&quot; loop with an embedded &quot;if&quot; statement 
for (int i = 0; i &lt; upperLimit; i++)
{
    if (SampleClass.SampleStaticMethodReturningBoolean(i))
    {
        sum += sampleObject.SampleMethodReturningInteger(i);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Statement blocks==
A series of statements surrounded by curly braces form a ''block'' of code. Among other purposes, code blocks serve to limit '''scope''', or the range in which a variable can be used. A variable is only accessible in the block in which it is defined. Code blocks can be nested and often appear as the bodies of methods.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
private void MyMethod(int integerValue)
{  // This block of code is the body of &quot;MyMethod()&quot;

   // The 'integerValue' integer parameter is accessible to everything in the method

   int methodLevelVariable; // This variable is accessible to everything in the method

   if (integerValue == 2)
   {
      // methodLevelVariable is still accessible here     
  
      int limitedVariable; // This variable is only accessible to code in the, if block

      DoSomeWork(limitedVariable);
   }
   
   // limitedVariable is no longer accessible here
    
}  // Here ends the code block for the body of &quot;MyMethod()&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comments==
''Comments'' allow inline documentation of source code. The C# compiler ignores comments. These styles of comments are allowed in C#:
;Single-line comments: The {{C sharp|//}} character sequence marks the following text as a single-line comment. Single-line comments, as one would expect, end at the first end-of-line following the {{C sharp|//}} comment marker.
;Multiple-line comments: Comments can span multiple lines by using the multiple-line comment style. Such comments start with {{C sharp|/*}} and end with {{C sharp|*/}}. The text between those multi-line comment markers is the comment.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// This style of a comment is restricted to one line.
/* 
   This is another style of a comment.
   It allows multiple lines.
*/
&lt;/source&gt;

;XML Documentation-line comments: These comments are used to generate XML documentation. Single-line and multiple-line styles can be used. The single-line style, where each line of the comment begins with {{C sharp|//}}, is more common than the multiple-line style delimited by {{C sharp|/**}} and {{C sharp|*/}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// &lt;summary&gt; documentation here &lt;/summary&gt;
// &lt;remarks&gt;
//     This uses single-line style XML Documentation comments.
// &lt;/remarks&gt;


/** 
 * &lt;summary&gt; documentation here &lt;/summary&gt;
 * &lt;remarks&gt;
 *     This uses multiple-line style XML Documentation comments.
 * &lt;/remarks&gt;
 */
&lt;/source&gt;

==Case sensitivity==
C# is [[w:case-sensitive|case-sensitive]], including its variable and method names.

The variables {{C sharp|myInteger}} and {{C sharp|MyInteger}} of type {{C sharp/kw|int}} below are distinct because C# is case-sensitive:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 int myInteger = 3;
 int MyInteger = 5;

&lt;/source&gt;
For example, C# defines a class {{C sharp|Console}} to handle most operations with the console window. Writing the following code would result in a compiler error unless an object named {{C sharp|console}} had been previously defined.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 // Compiler error!
 console.writeline(&quot;Hello&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

The following corrected code compiles as expected because it uses the correct case:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strange Blue Material ==
[[Image:Blender3D_SomeStrangeBlue.jpg|thumb|320px|A fairly transparent blue Sphere.]] 
Three things are important with this material:
# Fresnel Transparency (no Raytracing)
# A Clouds Texture for Displacement, so the sphere has Subdivision Surfaces Level 3 for the render.
# Lots of Emit with the usual ''Nor'' and Z/-/- settings on the ''Map Input'' panel for a radial blend.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
In fact I've used three textures. So let's have a look a the material settings first:
[[Image:Blender-strange-blue-1.png|framed|none|Material Settings]]

The Texture Mappings are:
[[Image:Blender-strange-blue-2.png|framed|none|First Texture: Displacement]] 
[[Image:Blender-strange-blue-3.png|framed|none|Second Texture: Ref and Emit]]

This is not optimized, Spec is too strong, Emit would better have gone to another texture.
[[Image:Blender-strange-blue-4.png|framed|none|Third Texture: Spec and Emit]]

The Textures: 

The Clouds Texture is made pretty much with the Default Values.
[[Image:Blender-strange-blue-5.png|framed|none|]]

The first Blend Texture uses a colorband with a very sharp falloff. 
[[Image:Blender-strange-blue-6.png|framed|none|]]

The second Blend Texture uses a normal Sphere Blend, so it's not necessary to show it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book discusses the art of '''mixing and mastering''' sound recordings. Currently, there are a vast number of articles about this subject, but there is no unified source for all of these, and it is difficult to find every single piece of information. Fairly regularly, articles pop up on forums or forum users lift the veil on what is usually seen as an arcane art. Forums get pruned and websites may lose their content, and therefore having a single editable persistent resource would be ideal to refer people to.

==Introduction==
In this section I am going to be using some harsh words about the realities of sound engineering and some of the things that beginner engineers and even magazines say. If you are offended by these... good, I hope it gets you offended enough to sit up and think about what you are doing, how you are doing it and to realize that there is no magical piece of equipment or plugin that will make your music sound terrific.

I've thought long and hard about writing this article because none of us want to give away our 'secrets' and believe me when I tell you that if you want to make your dance music sound stunning then this is THE secret. You will need to know much more than just this but without this knowledge you are going nowhere.

===Why am I doing this?===

There are two reasons: Firstly over the past year there has been so much badly produced crap thrust onto the market that it has become saturated to the point where distributors around the world won't touch certain styles with a barge pole. They know that only one release in twenty will be any good so they don't want ANY of it. So rule number one, if you genuinely care about the music you are making don't let your ego take over, &quot;I'm the best producer in the world because I've got a record out, my mates all think I'm fantastic&quot;. Yes, but no one in the industry does, they think you are a joke because you are killing the music that we all love with your garbage and you don't even realise it. Please, please, please do not even THINK about releasing something yourself or trying to get it released with a label until you are absolutely sure (and be honest with yourself!) that you are good enough and ready to produce the goods time and time again. Don't be desperate to get a record out, learn your craft, pay your dues and be patient. After all you want a reputation for releasing great music and not the other kind, don't you?

The second reason is this and again it is to do with ego. After a while, it could be six months, it could be five years: who cares? No one is counting. You will be writing music that is good enough for release if you have the talent for it, without a doubt but you may not have handle on the mixdown. In other words you can program great drum tracks, brilliant bass and synth lines and arrange it all perfectly but when you listen to your recordings they don't sound right. They lack volume and punch, the clarity isn't there, the bass doesn't cut through; they sound right but they don't sound right: that professional 'sheen' isn't there.

I'm sure everyone has seen on letters pages in magazines and on web forums a query where someone says something along the lines of:

''&quot;My track needs to be louder and kick more, it's nothing to do with compressors, EQ or limiters as my mix is perfect. It's just that the sounds need to stand out more. Should I use a different keyboard for my bass sounds? I was thinking of buying that WalNord Super Lead. I've mastered the track using the Super-Thrasher Maximiser. That may be the problem - if I only had the newer version with the tweeter fryer add-on my music might sound how I want it to&quot;''

The reply will follow saying that the WalNord is indeed superb (they advertise in that magazine) and yes the tweeter fryer is great (they've just given it a superb review) and you could also try to compress the life out of every single track separately, buy the new YamiRolorg super expander, put cheese in your ears etc. etc.

'''ALL WRONG AND ALL UTTER UTTER GARBAGE.'''

The ''mixdown'' isn't good enough. End of story. No amount mastering, Eqing or whatever other post-mix trickery will make a terrible mix sound good. You cannot polish a turd. The person that asked the question will be making the same mistakes over and over because he isn't asking questions of himself - he already stated that his mixes are nigh on perfect - how can you improve on that? Whatever anyone makes, even top professionals, it is never perfect. There is always something that can be improved. Also, always remember that while magazines can indeed be very informative, they are also there to sell you things.

It can take years to learn to perform a mixdown properly - you may not have the time or the inclination, in which case I recommend that you hire a studio to mix your tracks down for you. There are several well-known producers and engineers that supply this service, myself included. Yes, even this article is trying to sell you something but at least it is something worth buying if you really care about your music and want it to be the best that it can be.

If you ever get the opportunity, get yourself in a studio with someone that knows what they are doing - you will learn more in one afternoon than you will learn from reading twenty articles like this because you will see what is being done and you will, more importantly, hear the results.

Whatever kind of music you are making, any mixdown should have ''punch'', ''depth'', ''width'' and ''space''. It cannot have any of these if the bass end (bottom end) isn't mixed correctly. The bottom end is the foundation on which the rest of the mix sits, get it wrong and you are on very shaky ground.

This article assumes that you are making dance music, in particular hard dance music (four on the floor kick, heavy bass line). The principles work just the same for any other kind of music but some of the ingredients and proportions may be a little different.

== Starting out ==

The first step in getting your bass mix right comes from choosing the right sounds to use in the first place, don't be tempted to try and fix it in the mix. If you want more bass in your track it isn't simply a case of turning up the bass EQ but if you want to make a pigs-ear of it then by all means do.

=== The Kick ===
Years ago the 909 kick[http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/samplesViewSingle.php?id=3724] was de-rigueur but these days one of those straight out of the box sounds weedier than a gnats fart. Hard dance music is just that, HARD. The kicks need to be huge. How do you go about getting a huge kick? One way is to simply sample somebody else's (naughty) but that isn't being very creative. Over the years there have been literally thousands of different kick drums made and the sound is constantly being refined and reinvented. Whenever you buy a new record or get a new CD, always sample the kick drums to store in your library for later use.

Some may need cleaning up - random noise or cymbals may need to be removed. I'm not going to tell you how to do that because I want to make you think but I will give you a pointer: noise reduction is not the answer on a single kick, it will ruin the sound.

When you come to start writing a new track the first thing you will need to do is create a NEW kick. You already have your huge library of kicks to hand so you can start by getting several kicks that you like the sound of and that you think will fit together and then start experimenting layering those kicks together in various amounts. You may only need to use two or three kicks to get the sound you want. The sound can then be further refined with the use of compression, EQ and distortion or any other effect (careful!).

At this point you are using EQ creatively to alter the sound's character significantly. Extreme boosts don't tend to work well in the bass area, as you will find that you have problems when it comes to the mixdown. Compression can be used to tighten the kick, lengthen the decay or to add pop to the attack; again this is using compression as a creative tool. Always save your layered kicks and make new kicks with those too - your library will constantly grow and your 'depth of sound' will get greater.

=== The Bass ===
You've got your kick, now you need a bass to go with it. It's a good idea to just sit in the studio for an afternoon every now and again and program bass sounds on whatever synthesisers you have available, sample them off and store them away for later use - it is much easier to have a library of bass sounds to hand than to try and program a sound that will fit with your kick drum. Again your bass sounds can be layered together to create new ones. You can also significantly change the character of your bass sounds with EQ and/or filtering. Again we are being creative at this point and trying to make the character of the sound how we want it so anything goes.

== Mixing the two together ==
The mixdown is usually the last thing that gets done to a track, after all the programming, writing, arranging etc. Mute everything apart from the kick and the bass (which incidentally must have their own separate mixer channels). Don't be tempted to try and mix anything else in your track until you have your foundations in place, you will be wasting your time.

There is a minimum of facilities that are required to be able to get that pro sound in the bass on every track that you mix. It can be done with less equipment but much more time needs to be spent when you create the kick and bass sound in the first place (as will become apparent).

An absolute must is a decent pair of monitor speakers, positioned correctly and with you sitting in the correct position. Your room needs to be well damped and you will find from time to time, if you are in a small control room or project studio, that depending on what frequencies are in the sounds you are using different items in the room will buzz or vibrate - you need to damp or shield these so you can hear what is coming from the speakers and nothing else.

Also required is a mixing desk or facility (could be in your PC) where you can group tracks together, a compressor and decent EQ. If you are using an analogue desk you will probably not have enough EQ to do the job and will need to insert extra parametric (preferably) or graphic EQ on both the kick and bass channels.

So, first things first - listen to any hard dance records and you notice that the kick and the bass are at roughly the same volume level. So, presuming that your desk is normalised, solo the kick and adjust the volume so that it is peaking at around +3 to +6 DB on the main output meter (if your mixer goes to +15). You want the maximum amount of volume coming from the kick channel (if you are in software you can set this to slightly below maximum) while leaving enough headroom on the main outputs to fit the rest of your mix in. Why is the kick so loud? We want to get the best signal to noise ratio possible and to use the full bandwidth available on the mixer.

The same process is then done with the bass, solo it and set it to the same (or just slightly less) level on the main meters.

Listen to the two sounds together and note what the main meter is now doing - depending on what parts you have written the output will be moving around somewhat. Ideally you want the volume level in the bass end to be fairly constant otherwise headroom will be used up for no reason and bass 'power' will be lost. Compression needs to be used to smooth the levels out. This has the effect of increasing the average volume whilst using no more headroom. Both the kick and the bass need to be compressed together so the two channels need to be grouped and a compressor placed on the insert of the group. How the compressor is set very much depends on the material and there are several articles on compression out there. A good starting point would be to use 6:1 compression with a fast attack (to let the peaks on the kick to come through) and a release of around 150ms. The amount of gain reduction again depends on the source material.

Depending on the speed of the track the compressor's release setting can cause 'pumping' - that is where the overall volume pumps up and down in time with the track. You may want this effect or you may not. If you are going to make the mix pump be very subtle otherwise it just sounds naff. The compressor type will affect the character in the bass end so use the right one - you might want to use a fairly transparent compressor or you might choose to go with a very hard compressor for a more noticeable and aggressive effect. One thing to notice is that on notes where both kick and bass coincide, the volume of the kick will lessen if too much processing is applied.

Volume and compression are now set. Already the bass mix will seem to have much more energy than when you started out. Now comes the difficult part...

== EQ'ing the bass ==
Previously creative EQ has been used to make new sounds (art). Now EQ is going to be used in a much more technical way to perfect the bass mix (craft).

A couple of notes before we start, if the bass sound is bass light don't try to simply boost the low end EQ - it makes for a muddy mix. Always remember that if you cut one end of the frequency spectrum comparatively you are boosting the other end. So to boost that bottom end you would roll off the top end and increase the volume level back to where it was previously. EQ cuts sound much better than boosts when mixing down, especially in digital systems.

To get a tight mix you need to be very accurate with your Eqing so be warned, this is going to take time, especially for a start. If it means spending a couple of hours just to EQ the bass then put the work in, the results will be worth it.

Every kick and bass you mix together will be different so there is no point in having or using the same 'magical' EQ settings unless you use the exact same sounds every time. I would recommend sitting down and listening to the bass end in some really well produced tracks. What do you notice? The kick and the bass don't interfere with each other, they sound 'tight' and they don't bloat out the whole mix. They 'sit' right.

Now we are going to get our bass to sound like that. This is where the decent monitors come in, without them you will really struggle to do the job.

=== Crank up the volume ===
That's right, really crank it up! If you are using near-fields you should be around 3- 4 feet away from the speakers, you need to be monitoring loud enough so that you are really 'inside' the sound. Don't monitor so loud that your ears start to hurt, go numb or ring - if you do you are monitoring too loud to be able to hear things properly and you will be doing yourself some damage. Don't try and mix the bass by monitoring quietly - what you have already probably sounds great when listened to at those volumes. It isn't! This is heavy music that is played loudly in clubs, not on tiny home stereos.

'''A quick note on 'harmonics'.'''
''All sounds are made from a combination of sine waves. If you want to see the maths behind this look on the web for 'Fourier Analysis'. In any sound there is a fundamental (or root) pitch plus a combination of harmonics. A harmonic is simply a multiple of the root pitch, i.e. the second harmonic is a sine wave at twice the pitch of the fundamental. So a square wave for example is made from a root sine wav plus every odd-(integer)numbered harmonic going upwards in diminishing amounts.''

Listen carefully to the bass. If it sounds bass light in comparison to the kick, use a high cut EQ (or the lo pass filter in your sampler) to reduce the high frequencies and thus boost the bass. The frequency to cut to depends very much on the bass sound itself. If it is almost pure bass you could get rid of everything above 500-750 HZ. If the bass has a clanky attack you may want to keep that clank in and cut at a higher frequency - 1000 to 2000 Hz maybe. It's all relative to the sounds you are using.

After each EQ change check the volume of the bass on its own again to make sure it is still at the correct level. If it has changed alter the volume accordingly.

You will notice that as you progressively EQ the bass that it will start to sound very different to the sound you started with, this is normal and nothing to worry about, you've just got used to hearing the sound in its' unaltered state. Don't get into the mindset where you can't EQ the sound in a certain way because it makes it different to how it 'should' sound. It has got to sound that way to work with the kick.

Listen very carefully at the lower end of the frequency spectrum. Does it sound like there is a constant hum or note down there that runs through the notes that are being played. If there is then that is a 'ringing' harmonic - in other word one that isn't needed, all it is doing is using up valuable headroom and bloating the mix out. If you listen again you will also perhaps note that it makes the mix sound too fat and interferes with the kick, frequencies around 110-115 Hz are the usual culprits.

The frequency needs to be isolated and reduced until things sharpen up. The best EQ to use for this is a parametric as specific frequencies can be isolated but a graphic can be used at a pinch. The results will never be as sharp though. You now need to listen elsewhere for harmonics that ring out or whistle - these can be anywhere in the frequency spectrum. You might want to keep one or two of them in there if they are in tune with the bass notes playing (a-la Klub bass) but be careful what you leave. If you leave the wrong harmonics, especially as you start to move into the 200Hz region they will start to interfere with the lower-mids of the sounds in the rest of your mix. Again when you get a handle on where the 'bad' harmonics are, isolate them with a band of parametric EQ and reduce them until they no longer ring out.

So that's the bass EQed. Well, not quite. The sub end of things needs to be looked at, if there is too much sub in there the mix may sound great on your small speakers but when you play it on something larger you could max out the amps or blow the cones out. A nice little check is to listen to the mix through headphones. For a few seconds crank the headphone volume right up and listen to the kick drum - it will be making the headphones buzz quite a lot. Now listen to the bass, if it's making the headphones buzz about the same amount then things are OK in the sub department. If it's REALLY making the headphones buzz then you have too much sub on the bass. Another check is to look and see how much the bass sound makes your speaker cones flap in comparison to the kick - if it looks like your cones are about to blow with the power then, again there is too much sub in there. If your speakers are larger or you have a sub box then you are laughing. I bet the neighbours love you! A low shelf at 49Hz with about 2-3 DB of reduction will suffice if you have too much energy in that region.

It's almost there now. It's now a good idea to add an open hi hat, set a rough volume level for it and then listen to see if there are any harmonics that shouldn't be there between the 'real' bass and the hats. If there is, again, using parametric, get hold of those frequencies in the bass and EQ them out. That's the bass EQed.

Now go back to listening to just the kick and the bass. Listen with more of an emphasis on the kick. Mostly you don't need to do any EQ work on the kick but sometimes there will be just the odd harmonic that seems to 'ring' out on top of the kick and the bass. If it's too much and clouds things up, reduce it, again with a parametric.

And that is it. Job done. The track should now have a tight and punchy bottom end that will rock on any sound system. There are now just the other 50 sounds to sort out.

Come on super engineers, collaborate! This is a good start.

NOTES
- Mastering is a separate process from mixing. A Mastering Engineer will want 3 or 4 db of headroom to work with. So do not mix to 0db on your DAW, mix to an output of 3 to 4 db below unity. Also, do not compress your master output bus too severely - if at all. The Mastering Engineer will add compression also.

- This is obviously not a definitive article and you will never find one when it comes to mixing, too many variables to take everything into account. Hopefully it will give you some basic understanding about the frequency range and what to cut or boost to bring instruments out of the mix.

- Most EQ should be subtractive - try to achieve a good sound and then sculpt away any problems using EQ, rather than trying to use EQ to &quot;fix&quot; a problem. This is a firm rule for acoustic and vocal music, obviously Dubstep etc is a special case.

Each  instrument has a space in the frequency spectrum, so talking about the kick and bass, you enhance the kick and cut that freq in the bass. That way they don't fight for space in the mix. You do the same with the rest of the mix, leaving room for an instruments scope.

== EQ Settings ==
===General===
* 20 Hz and below - impossible to detect, remove as it only adds unnecessary energy to the total sound, thereby most probably holding down the overall volume of the track 
* 60 Hz and below - sub bass (feel only) 
* 80(-100) Hz - feel AND hear bass 
* 100-120 Hz - the &quot;club sound system punch&quot; resides here 
* 200 Hz and below - bottom 
* 250 Hz - notch filter here can add thump to a kick drum 
* 150-400 Hz - boxiness 
* 200 Hz-1.5 KHz - punch, fatness, impact 
* 800 Hz-4 KHz - edge, clarity, harshness, defines timbre 
* 4500 Hz - exteremly tiring to the ears, add a slight notch here 
* 5-7 KHz - de-essing is done here 
* 4-9 KHz - brightness, presence, definition, sibilance, high frequency distortion 
* 6-15 KHz - air and presence 
* 9-15 KHz - adding will give sparkle, shimmer, bring out details - cutting will smooth out harshness and darken the mix

===General EQ Reference===
* 50Hz 
** Boost: To thicken up bass drums and sub-bass parts. 
** Cut: Below this frequency on all vocal tracks. This should reduce the effect of any microphone 'pops'. 

* 70-100Hz 
** Boost: For bass lines and bass drums. 
** Cut: For vocals. 
** General: Be wary of boosting the bass of too many tracks. Low frequency sounds are particularly vulnerable to phase cancellation between sounds of similar frequency. This can result in a net 'cut of the bass frequencies. 

* 200-400Hz 
** Boost: To add warmth to vocals or to thicken a guitar sound. 
** Cut: To bring more clarity to vocals or to thin cymbals and higher frequency percussion. 
** Boost or Cut: to control the 'woody' sound of a snare. 

* 400-800Hz 
** Boost: To add warmth to toms. 
** Boost or Cut: To control bass clarity, or to thicken or thin guitar sounds. 
** General: In can be worthwhile applying cut to some of the instruments in the mix to bring more clarity to the bass within the overall mix. 

* 800Hz-1KHz 
** Boost: To thicken vocal tracks. At 1 KHz apply boost to add knock to a bass drum. 

* 1-3KHz 
** Boost: To make a piano more aggressive. Applying boost between 1KHz and 5KHz will also make guitars and basslines more cutting. 
** Cut: Apply cut between 2 KHz and 3KHz to smooth a harsh sounding vocal part. 
** General: This frequency range is often used to make instruments stand out in a mix. 

* 3-6KHz 
** Boost: For a more 'plucked' sounding bass part. Apply boost at around 6KHz to add some definition to vocal parts and distorted guitars. 
** Cut: Apply cut at about 3KHz to remove the hard edge of piercing vocals. Apply cut between 5KHZ and 6KHz to dull down some parts in a mix. 

* 6-10KHz 
** Boost: To sweeten vocals. The higher the frequency you boost the more 'airy/breathy' the result will be. Also boost to add definition to the sound of acoustic guitars or to add edge to synth sounds or strings or to enhance the sound of a variety of percussion sounds. 
For example boost this range to: 
*** Bring out cymbals. 
*** Add ring to a snare. 
*** Add edge to a bass drum. 

* 10-16KHz 
** Boost: To make vocals more 'airy' or for crisp cymbals and percussion. Also boost this frequency to add sparkle to pads, but only if the frequency is present in the original.

Achieve a balance of the sound as you would like to hear it. 

YOU MUST USE AND TRUST YOUR EARS.
Use your software to save channel strip presets of each instrument for future reference.
Important - use near-field monitors and a good pair of headphones to have a clear picture of the sound image. If you do not have a properly acoustically-treated room it is likely it will sound good in your room but not outside. By using headphones as well as near field monitors you can appreciate frequencies you might be loosing in the room. For headphones, I use AKG 702 (superb) and SONY MDRV 900 (very good) so you can have different sound and hopefully you will educate your ears for your room.

Now you can set your channel panning and begin mixing.


NOTE - not everybody has a 909 and a tubetech. If you are working on plugins play your drums then compress it at a ratio of 4:1 soft knee. Set the threshold until you achieve gain reduction until 4 db and set output to 4 db to compensate. Now for EQ. Set attack to 11 o'clock so the sound has time to build before it is compressed - and the release to 11 o'clock.

You must not apply hard compression on plugins otherwise you will destroy the sound. Better off applying a little compression to each track, then a  little in the buses.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Yoozer. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Yoozer~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
There are various ways of grouping sets of data together in C#.

==Enumerations==
An ''[[w:enumeration|enumeration]]'' is a data type that ''enumerates'' a set of items by assigning to each of them an identifier (a name), while exposing an underlying base type for ordering the elements of the enumeration. The underlying type is {{C sharp|int}} by default, but can be any one of the integral types except for {{C sharp|char}}.

Enumerations are declared as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 enum Weekday { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday };
&lt;/source&gt;

The elements in the above enumeration are then available as constants:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 Weekday day = Weekday.Monday;

 if (day == Weekday.Tuesday)
 {
     Console.WriteLine(&quot;Time sure flies by when you program in C#!&quot;);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

If no explicit values are assigned to the enumerated items as the example above, the first element has the value 0, and the successive values are assigned to each subsequent element. However, specific values from the underlying integral type can be assigned to any of the enumerated elements (note that the variable must be [[C_Sharp_Programming/Variables#Types|type cast]] in order to access the base type):
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 enum Age { Infant = 0, Teenager = 13, Adult = 18 };
 
 Age myAge = Age.Teenager;
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;You become a teenager at an age of {0}.&quot;, (int)myAge);
&lt;/source&gt;

The underlying values of enumerated elements may go unused when the purpose of an enumeration is simply to group a set of items together, e.g., to represent a nation, state, or geographical territory in a more meaningful way than an integer could. Rather than define a group of logically related constants, it is often more readable to use an enumeration.

It may be desirable to create an enumeration with a base type other than {{C sharp|int}}. To do so, specify any integral type besides {{C sharp|char}} as with base class ''extension'' syntax after the name of the enumeration, as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 enum CardSuit : byte { Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs };
&lt;/source&gt;

The enumeration type is also helpful, if you need to output the value. By calling the {{C sharp|.ToString()}} method on the enumeration, will output the enumerations name (e.g. {{C sharp|CardSuit.Hearts.ToString()}} will output &quot;Hearts&quot;).

==Structs==
Structures (keyword {{C sharp/kw|struct}}) are light-weight objects. They are mostly used when only a data container is required for a collection of value type variables.  ''Structs'' are similar to ''classes'' in that they can have constructors, methods, and even implement interfaces, but there are important differences.

*''Structs'' are value types while ''classes'' are reference types, which means they behave differently when passed into methods as parameters.  
*''Structs'' cannot support inheritance.  While ''structs'' may appear to be limited with their use, they require less memory and can be less expensive, if used in the proper way.
*''Structs'' always have a default constructor, even if you don't want one. Classes allow you to hide the constructor away by using the &quot;private&quot; modifier, whereas structures &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; have one.

A {{C sharp|struct}} can, for example, be declared like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 struct Person
 {
     public string name;
     public System.DateTime birthDate;
     public int heightInCm;
     public int weightInKg;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The {{C sharp|Person}} ''struct'' can then be used like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 Person dana = new Person();
 dana.name = &quot;Dana Developer&quot;;
 dana.birthDate = new DateTime(1974, 7, 18);
 dana.heightInCm = 178;
 dana.weightInKg = 50;
 
 if (dana.birthDate &lt; DateTime.Now)
 {
     Console.WriteLine(&quot;Thank goodness! Dana Developer isn't from the future!&quot;);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to provide ''constructors'' to {{C sharp|struct}}s to make it easier to initialize them:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 using System;
 struct Person
 {
     string name;
     DateTime birthDate;
     int heightInCm;
     int weightInKg;
 
     public Person(string name, DateTime birthDate, int heightInCm, int weightInKg)
     {
         this.name = name;
         this.birthDate = birthDate;
         this.heightInCm = heightInCm;
         this.weightInKg = weightInKg;
     }
 }
 
 public class StructWikiBookSample
 {
     public static void Main()
     {
         Person dana = new Person(&quot;Dana Developer&quot;, new DateTime(1974, 7, 18), 178, 50);
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also an alternative syntax for initializing structs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
struct Person
{
    public string Name;
    public int Height;
    public string Occupation;
}

public class StructWikiBookSample2
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Person john = new Person { Name = &quot;John&quot;, Height = 182, Occupation = &quot;Programmer&quot; };
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

''Structs'' are really only used for performance reasons or, if you intend to reference it by value. Structs work best when holding a total equal to or less than 16 bytes of data. If in doubt, use classes.
[[Category:C Sharp Programming|Data structures]]

==Arrays==
Arrays represent a set of items all belonging to the same type. The declaration itself may use a variable or a constant to define the length of the array. However, an array has a set length and it cannot be changed after declaration.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// an array whose length is defined with a constant
int[] integers = new int[20];

int length = 0;
System.Console.Write(&quot;How long should the array be? &quot;);
length = int.Parse(System.Console.ReadLine());
// an array whose length is defined with a variable
// this array still can't change length after declaration
double[] doubles = new double[length];
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

Namespaces are used to provide a &quot;named space&quot; in which your application resides. They're used especially to provide the C# compiler a context for all the named information in your program, such as variable names. Without namespaces, you wouldn't be able to make, e.g., a class named Console, as .NET already uses one in its System namespace. The purpose of namespaces is to solve this problem, and release thousands of names defined in the .NET Framework for your applications to use, along with making it so your application doesn't occupy names for other applications, if your application is intended to be used in conjunction with another. So namespaces exist to resolve ambiguities a compiler wouldn't otherwise be able to do.

Namespaces are easily defined in this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 namespace MyApplication
 {
     // The content to reside in the MyApplication namespace is placed here.
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

There is an entire hierarchy of namespaces provided to you by the .NET Framework, with the System namespace usually being by far the most commonly seen one. Data in a namespace is referred to by using the {{C sharp|.}} operator, such as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
This will call the {{C sharp|WriteLine}} method that is a member of the {{C sharp|Console}} class within the {{C sharp|System}} namespace.

By using the {{C sharp|using}} keyword, you explicitly tell the compiler that you'll be using a certain namespace in your program. Since the compiler would then know that, it no longer requires you to type the namespace name(s) for such declared namespaces, as you told it which namespaces it should look in, if it couldn't find the data in your application.

So one can then type like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 using System;
 
 namespace MyApplication
 {
   class MyClass
   {
     void ShowGreeting()
     {
         Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // note how System is now not required
     }
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Namespaces are global, so a namespace in one C# source file, and another with the same name in another source file, will cause the compiler to treat the different named information in these two source files as residing in the same namespace.

==Nested namespaces==
Normally, your entire application resides under its own special namespace, often named after your application or project name. Sometimes, companies with an entire product series decide to use nested namespaces though, where the &quot;root&quot; namespace can share the name of the company, and the nested namespaces the respective project names. This can be especially convenient, if you're a developer who has made a library with some usual functionality that can be shared across programs. If both the library and your program shared a parent namespace, that one would then not have to be explicitly declared with the {{C sharp|using}} keyword, and still not have to be completely typed out. If your code was open for others to use, third party developers that may use your code would additionally then see that the same company had developed the library and the program. The developer of the library and program would finally also separate all the named information in their product source codes, for fewer headaches especially, if common names are used.

To make your application reside in a nested namespace, you can show this in two ways. Either like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 namespace CodeWorks
 {
     namespace MyApplication
     {
         // Do stuff
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
... or like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 namespace CodeWorks.MyApplication
 {
     // Do stuff
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
Both methods are accepted, and are identical in what they do.

==Properties==
'''Properties''' encapsulate the control of an object's ''state''.

For example, the following &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; class encapsulates a customer's name:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|class}} Customer
 { 
   // &quot;private&quot; prevents access of _name outside the Customer class:
   {{C sharp/kw|private}} {{C sharp/kw|string}} _name;   
 ''
   // The following property allows programmatic changes to _name:
   {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|string}} Name
   {
       {{C sharp/kw|set}} { {{C sharp/kw|this}}._name = {{C sharp/kw|value}}; }
       {{C sharp/kw|get}} { {{C sharp/kw|return}} {{C sharp/kw|this}}._name; }
   }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

The above &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; property has three important parts: the declaration, the ''set accessor'', and the ''get accessor''.

=== Property declaration ===

&lt;code&gt;
 &lt;access modifier&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;property name&gt; 
 {{C sharp/kw|public}}            {{C sharp/kw|string}} Name&lt;/code&gt;

The ''access modifier'' determines who can manipulate this data. Properties can be scoped as {{C sharp/kw|public}}, {{C sharp/kw|private}}, {{C sharp/kw|protected}}, or {{C sharp/kw|internal}}.

The ''type'' determines what kind of type it can accept or return.

The ''property name'' declares the name used to access the property.

=== Accessors ===

Setting the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; property for the &lt;code&gt;Customer&lt;/code&gt; class is done through the ''set accessor'', defined using the {{C sharp/kw|set}} keyword.

Similarly, the {{C sharp/kw|get}} keyword creates a ''get accessor'' to encapsulate the logic to perform when clients retrieve the value of the property.

Above, the simple ''set accessor'' and ''get accessor'' make property behave very much like a simple field.  That may not be the desired behavior.  If not, we can add logic to check the value passed into the {{C sharp/kw|set}} accessor:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|string}} Name
        {
            {{C sharp/kw|set}} { 
                  {{C sharp/kw|if}} ({{C sharp/kw|value}} != null)
                     {{C sharp/kw|this}}._name = {{C sharp/kw|value}};
                }
            {{C sharp/kw|get}} {                   
                  {{C sharp/kw|if}} ({{C sharp/kw|this}}._name != null)
                     {{C sharp/kw|return}} {{C sharp/kw|this}}._name;
                  {{C sharp/kw|else}}
                     {{C sharp/kw|return}} &quot;John Doe&quot;;
                }
        }
&lt;/code&gt;

Above, if the client requests to set the value to {{C sharp/kw|null}}, the ''set accessor'' does not change the field.  Also, if the &lt;code&gt;_name&lt;/code&gt; field hasn't yet been set, the ''get accessor'' returns a default value.

=== Using properties ===

Clients can use property much like they use simple class fields:

&lt;code&gt;
 Customer customer = {{C sharp/kw|new}} Customer();
 ''
 // this will not set the data.
 customer.Name = &quot;&quot;;
 ''
 // since the field is not yet set, this will print out: &quot;John Doe&quot;
 System.Console.WriteLine(customer.Name);
 ''
 customer.Name = &quot;Marissa&quot;;
 System.Console.WriteLine(customer.Name);
&lt;/code&gt;

The above code prints the following:

 John Doe
 Marissa

==Accessibility levels==
The various accessibility levels C# provides are, from most public to least:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Accessibility||Usage restriction
|-
|public||None.
|-
|internal||The containing assembly.
|-
|protected internal||The containing assembly or types derived from the containing class.
|-
|protected||The containing class or types derived from it.
|-
|private||The containing type.
|}
If no accessibility level is specified, a default level is used. They are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Type||Default accessibility
|-
|namespace||public (and the only allowed)
|-
|enum||public
|-
|class||private
|-
|interface||public
|-
|struct||private
|-
|(others)||internal
|}

Note: namespace-level elements (e.g. a class declared directly under a namespace) cannot be declared as stricter than internal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Craniosynostosis'''

==Overview==
*Craniosynostosis refers to the premature fusion of the cranial sutures (growth centers between the bones of the skull)
*The skull is made up of a number of bones and when those bones fuse together too soon it doesn't allow the head to grow in the usual fashion and can lead to changes in head shape
*Usually cranial sutures do not fuse completely until the fourth decade

==Primary vs. secondary craniosynostosis==
*Primary
*suture growth is altered
*head frequently assymmetric
*the brain continues to grow in areas where sutures are open
*most individuals are normal neurologically
*benefit from surgery
*Secondary
*growth of brain is impaired
*neurologically abnormal usually

==Isolated vs. Syndromic==
*Isolated
*usually presents during first year of life
*usually involves only one cranial suture (may involve more than one though)
*no other associated abnormalities except those produced secondarily as a result of premature fusion of suture
*sagittal suture is most common site for isolated craniosynostosis
*suture that runs from front to back and separates parietal bones
*results in head elongated from front to back due to limited growth laterally (scaphocephaly)
*intracranial pressure is usually in the normal range
*cranial surgery usually recommended to give a more usual head shape
*usually babies with isolated craniosynostosis grow and develop normally
*Syndromic
*Other characteristic features present
*over 60 syndromes described with craniosynostosis as a feature
*bicoronal synostosis is the type present in the most common syndromes
*Most follow AD inheritance
*Most individuals with a craniosynostosis syndrome have normal intelligence
*Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is the most common
*characterized by facial asymmetry, low frontal hairline, ptosis, deviated nasal septum, brachydactyly, and partial cutaneous syndactyly of the toes
*Crouzon - next most common (1 in 25,000 live births)
*characterized by maxillary hypoplasia, shallow orbits, and ocular proptosis
*Apert syndrome
*characterized by strabismus, maxillary hypoplasia
*complete symmetrical syndactyly of hands and feet
*associated with risk for developmental delay (unlike most of the other AD craniosynostosis syndromes)
*Pfeiffer syndrome
*maxillary hypoplasia
*broad thumbs and big toes
*mild cutaneous syndactyly

==Incidence of isolated nonsyndromic craniosynostosis==
*0.4-0.6 per 1000 births
*so about 1 in 2000 births (Fetology, 2000)

==Recurrence risks for isolated nonsyndromic craniosynostosis==
*usually sporadic
*genetic basis not discovered except for certain cases of unicoronal synostosis
*In study of 125 patients with craniosynostosis only 2.5% of those with isolated synostosis had positive family history
*patients with isolated craniosynostosis and a negative family history are not believed to have an increased incidence of recurrence above the background

==Ultrasound detection of craniosynostosis==
*difficult to detect on ultrasound
*when it is detected it is often not until 3rd trimester
*sometimes features associated with syndrome are detected on ultrasound (fused digits etc.)
Surgery
*objective is to allow adequate brain growth and improve appearance
*Surgery for isolated craniosynostosis is usually a single operation and produces excellent cosmetic results in 93%

==Introduction==
*Myself, GC, Doc
*What have you been told in the past?

==Contracting==
*Medical History
*Family History
*Physical exam
*Answer any questions you have

==Medical History/Pregnancy history==
*Progress since the surgery
*Breathing difficulties when he was younger?/ Now? Did he require a trach?
*How's his feeding before? / Now?
*What does he currently eat? / How much?
*How was the delivery? / vaginal?
*When did you first suspect something was different?

==Family History==
*Any people with funny shaped heads?
*Basics : birth defects, cancer at an early age, MR, miscarriages, etc.

==Craniosynostosis==
*Definition
**Premature closure of the cranial sutures (joints between the bones of the skull)
**The severity and type depend upon which of the four sutures fuse together too early: sagittal, coronal, metopic, or lambdoid.
**The shape of the head is dependant upon which of the sutures is closed early.
**Six disorders called the FGFR-related craniosynostosis - most are related to those coronal craniosynostosis, NOT SAGITTAL!!!!! (probably do not apply in this case)
*Incidence
**Overall = 1/2000 - 1/2500 live births
*Characteristics of the FGFR-related ones
**Normal intelligence in many cases/DD and MR in others
**Hypertelorism
**Midface hypoplasia
**Small beaked nose
**Prognathism
**High arched palate
**Choanal atresia or stenosis
**Fusion of fingers or toes
*Genetics
**Autosomal dominant for the FGFR related (fibroblast growth factor receptors)
**Sporadic in most cases
**A mutation in the FGFR3 gene which is responsible for keeping things from getting too long (inhibits growth usually). When mutated, it seems to be over expressed = failure of things to grow completely causing early fusion of the skull and fingers/toes.
*Recurrence risks (empirical -isolated cases)
**Risk to siblings with two unaffected parents = coronal 5%
**Risk to siblings with two unaffected parents = sagittal 1%

==Sagittal synostosis==
*Definition: when the sagittal suture fuses prematurely. It runs from the front of the head to the back and creates a boat-like head because the front and back of the skull bulge outwards to allow the brain to grow.
*Surgery repairs it by removing the sutures and widening the skull by opening both the lambdoid and coronal sutures on either side. Bone grafts may be placed inside to keep the skull wide enough.
*The most common of the craniosynostoses = 1/5250 incidence
*Typically isolated conditions/ not related to a syndrome.

==Ingredients==
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 cup firmly packed [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 3/4 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]]
* 20-ounce can of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] slices, drained, reserving 5 tablespoons juice
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], separated
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Cherry|maraschino cherries]]

==Procedure==
# Preheat oven to 350° F.
# Melt the butter in a 9-inch cast iron skillet. Add the brown sugar and pecans; stir well to thoroughly combine, then turn off the heat -- don't cook it. Arrange 8 pineapple slices in a single layer over the brown sugar mixture (your 9-inch skillet should accommodate 8 slices without overlapping). Set the skillet aside.
# Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl; set aside.
# Beat the egg yolks at medium speed until they are thick and lemon colored. Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat. Add the flour mixture to the yolk mixture, and stir in the reserved pineapple juice.
# Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the whites into the cake batter. Pour or spoon the batter evenly over the pineapple slices.
# Bake at 350°F for 40 to 45 minutes. Cool the cake in the skillet for 30 minutes; then invert it onto a serving plate. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring.

Do you have an RRS feed or blog that I could subscibe to?  I am very interest and I am sure that all wikipedia users would be interested in keep in touch with the [[IMO]] of [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]].

(67.163.33.24) NEVER posted these words.  These words are owned by [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] &lt;b&gt;&quot;hey, man, I'm a guru, listen to me, and you all are just stupid and don't uderstand anything&quot;&lt;/b&gt;.   Thank you for the praise.  [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 's understoods that &quot;I'm saying you biased?&quot;  No,  [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] is correct, the entire posting was all just gibberish, meaningless nonsense that couldn't get by an keen moderator.  Thank you for putting things back in order.</text>

(very much work in progress - feel free to contribute)

Financial markets serve several purposes:
# Allowing investors to shift consumption in time
# Allowing the transfer of risk between different investors
# Moving capital from those who have it to those who can use it productively

Asset pricing is the study of how financial assets are priced. 

Financial assets include several varieties:
# Debt
# Equities
# Hybrids
# Derivatives

Whatever the particular variety, we can think of financial assets simply as the right to a future cash flow stream and/or physical asset. All types of asset, e.g., debt, equity, etc., can be reduced to a stream of cash flows that can be valued.

When valuing a stream of cash flows we need to consider these things:
* Time value of money
* Riskiness of the cash flows
* Expected value of the cash flows

For debt, asset pricing is relatively simple, as cash flows to the owner are contractually fixed. For example, the holder of a 20-year US government bond with a face value of $100 and a coupon of 5% paid annual can expect (with high certainty) to be paid $5 a year for the next 20 years, with $100 to be returned at the end of 20 years. The value of the bond is the present value of the future cash flows. If the required rate of return is r=3% a year, then the value is: $5*(1-(1+r)^-20)/r + 100*(1+r)^-20 = $129.75.

Although debt security can have predictable cash flow in the future (e.g., assuming we are talking about fixed rate debt security) there still is an element of uncertainty because expected rate of return is likely to change over the above mentioned 20 years time period. This would change the present value of the debt security depending on the assumption or derivation of the rate of return that applies to each individual time period. This adds '''interest rate risk''' component to the debt security valuation.

If the debt issuer is not a &quot;AAA&quot; rated sovereign state then we cannot assume the cash flow is guaranteed. This adds a '''credit risk''' component. Debt securities issued by all entities are rated by investment grade rating services (e.g.,. Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's) and this can be used to determine the required rate of return to account for the risk, which will the impact the valuation of the debt security.

For equities, asset pricing is more difficult as future cash flows are uncertain, and vary with both economic conditions and the fortune of the company. We need to project future expected cash flows, and also determine the expected return of the stock. The estimated expected return of the stock is based on an estimate of how risky the cash flows are. We can decompose risk into a) common factor risk and b) idiosyncratic risk. The latter can be diversified away in a portfolio, so earns no return premium. The former cannot be diversified away, so earns a risk premium.

When programming an embedded system, it is important to meet the time deadlines of the system, and to perform all the tasks of the system in a reasonable amount of time, but also in a good order. This page will talk about a common program architecture called the '''Super-Loop Architecture''', that is very useful in meeting these requirements

== Definition ==

A super loop is a program structure comprised of an infinite loop, with all the tasks of the system contained in that loop. Here is a general pseudocode for a superloop implementation:

 Function Main_Function()
 {
   Initialization();
   Do_Forever
   {
     Check_Status();
     Do_Calculations();
     Output_Response();
   }
 }

We perform the initialization routines before we enter the super loop, because we only want to initialize the system once. Once the infinite loop begins, we don't want to reset the values, because we need to maintain persistent state in the embedded system.

The loop is in fact a variant of the classic &quot;batch processing&quot; control flow: Read input, calculate some values, write out values. Do it until you run out of input data &quot;cards&quot;. So, embedded systems software is not the only type of software which uses this kind of architecture. For example, computer games often use a similar loop. There the loop is called &lt;i&gt;(tight) (main) game loop&lt;/i&gt;.

== Power-Save Super Loop ==

Let's say we have an embedded system which has an average loop time of 1ms, and needs only to check a certain input once per second. It seems a waste to continue looping the program, especially when we don't need to do anything most of the time. In this situation, the program will loop 1000 times before it needs to read the input, and the other 999 loops of the program will just be a countdown to the next read. In this case, it is sorely inefficient to have the processor chugging away at 100% capacity all the time. We will now implement an expanded superloop to build in a delay:

 Function Main_Function()
 {
   Initialization();
   Do_Forever
   {
     Check_Status();
     Do_Calculations();
     Output_Response();
     Delay_For_Next_Loop();
   }
 }

Notice how we added a delay at the end of the super loop? If we build this delay to delay for 999ms, we don't need to loop 1000 times, we can read the input on every loop.

Also, it is important to note that many microcontrollers have power-save modes, where they will require less electrical power, which can be especially good if the system is running off a battery.

== Power Use Calculations ==

Let's say that we have a microcontroller that uses 20mA of current in &quot;normal mode&quot;, but only needs 5mA of power in &quot;Low-Power Mode&quot;. Let's also say that we are using the example superloop above, which is in &quot;Low-Power Mode&quot; 99.9% of the time (1ms of calculations every second), and is only in normal mode 0.1% of the time:

&lt;math&gt; Power = \frac{(99.9% \times 5mA)+(0.1% \times 20mA)}{100%} = 5.015mA \quad Average&lt;/math&gt;

Notice how we can cut down our power consumption by adding in a substantial delay? This is especially important because few embedded applications will require 100% of processor resources. Most embedded systems are able to just sit and wait in a low-power state until needed.</text>

This page looks really useful, but shouldn't it be called 'Word endings' or something similar as it includes nouns and other types of words as well as verbs?

:Makes sense, i'll change it --[[User:65.3.234.59|65.3.234.59]] 01:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

Well things like -ant and -ot are not word endings, these would have a -o or -a after them.  Should these not be -ant- and -ot- and so on?  Just a thought.  Maybe I'll alter it myself.  Kiu scias? [[User:Stevebritgimp|Stevebritgimp]] 19:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC).  Another thought - if the noun endings are given in accusative and plural forms, should not the adjective endings be given the same way?

'''Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikibooks.''' Comment on content, not on the contributor. Personal attacks damage the community and deter users.  Nobody likes abuse.

==Consequences==
Some Wikibookians remove personal attacks on third parties on sight. Users of other Wikimedia projects have been banned for repeatedly engaging in personal attacks, and if necessary it would happen here too. If you are subjected to persistent personal attacks and want help in getting them stopped, email an [[WB:ADMIN|active Administrator]], leave a message on their [[Help:Talk page|talk page]], or note what is happening in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance|assistance reading room]]. 

Any personal attack, whether it is a snide comment or a direct personal insult, is covered by this policy. Personal attacks are not acceptable on Wikibooks and this policy imposes a duty on all Wikibookians to stop such attacks should they occur.

Remember that disputes on talk pages are accessible to everyone on the Internet. The way in which you conduct yourself on Wikibooks reflects on Wikibooks and on you. Stay cool.

==Being reasonable==
Contributors may not agree on a module and could reasonably wish to express their views. Comment with content in mind, not those writing it, and remember that we are ''all'' part of the '''same community''', working towards the '''same goal''': Quality books.

Never suggest a person's view is invalid simply because of who they are. Discuss the issues in dispute, not people's attributes or character. This does ''not'' mean that you have to agree with other people, but that you must not let disputes become personal. Explore issues in a less public forum like email if a debate threatens to become personal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Long overdue policy adapted from en.wiki. Poll started below to determine consensus. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:51, 21 November 2005 (UTC) 

:&quot;No personal attacks, and move personal debates to email&quot; is currently a ''guideline'' at [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]]. An example of a personal attack is at [[Talk:A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]] (and [[User talk:AlbertCahalan]]). &lt;s&gt;I think that a good step would be to label this page as a ''guideline'' in lieu of a ''policy''.&lt;/s&gt;

:Before I joined Wikibooks, I read English Wikipedia. However I made no edits to Wikipedia, today I have an account but make few edits. Though I became aware of major policies like &quot;neutral point of view&quot; (because of those NPOV dispute markers), I never became familiar with, and still am not familiar with, most of the English Wikipedia policies.

:&lt;s&gt;If we do have a &quot;no personal attacks&quot; policy, then I would prefer that it start as a small part of some existing policy.&lt;/s&gt; --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:14, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:I change my position. We should get a &quot;no personal attacks&quot; policy ''now''; we might need it later. I still oppose the current version because it has references to things which exist not on Wikibooks, such as the arbitration committee. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:32, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

::Ummm... it is an important policy. Personal attacks make editors feel bad, and drive people away from the project. Overall they create an atmosphere where no one wants to edit. This needs to be an '''enforced policy''', not just some little addendum somewhere. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

::Okay, so it has some extra stuff... but that stuff will come later too. Maybe not ArbCom, but some of the other stuff. I'll go remove that, and you can change your vote. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:56, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:To clarify, I do not think that red links are a problem in an enforced policy. The problem is if the enforced policy references a red link as if it already exists. The policy should not instruct me to read the &quot;dispute resolution process&quot; when that is a red link. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:31, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

:Is there anything else that can be said about NPOV when editing? A lot of book-related material needs to encompass multiple points of view and I think disagreement over POV is what brings about the largest amount of personal attacks. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:58, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

#::I realize that it isn't set in stone, but i'm not the person who is going to fix this policy, or to rewrite it to be more clear, etc. I would rather put up a conditional vote now, as opposed to putting up a &quot;no&quot; immediately, and then forgetting to ever come back and change my vote. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:34, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

#Personal attacks ''are'' '''not acceptable''', but the policy can still use some work.  I agree with Kernigh that the policy should not reference things that do not yet exist.

#It's never a good idea to phrase suggestions in terms of &quot;don't do this&quot;. One of the easiest ways to get people to think about something is to tell them not to think about it.

#Before we make ourselves little dictators of our virtual domain, perhaps we ought to think about the ramifications. Systems of '''''crime and punishment''''' are a ''failure state''. They are an admission that we weren't able to work congenially as co-editors on a common project — that our little [[w:Animal Farm|Animal Farm]] couldn't exist without making some of us &quot;more equal.&quot; Do we really want to duplicate the system of punishment and vandalism that exists at Wikipedia? Is their instruction creep working for them? Perhaps we could learn something from our founder. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 03:53, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The problem we are seeing, again and again, is this attitude that some poor victim of a biased rant in Wikipedia ought to not get pissed and take us up on our offer of &quot;anyone can edit&quot; but should rather immerse themselves in our arcane internal culture until they understand the right way to get things done. I do not know what is going to change, but something BIG has got to happen and SOON about this issue, because the amount of time it is consuming for some of our best editors is getting way out of control.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::You have added identical text to other policy votes. The vote here is about whether this policy should be enforced rather than whether &quot;policies&quot; are a good idea. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:37, 17 May 2006 (UTC)


'''Comments'''

Okay, a guideline is just that, something that guides people on a certain issue. It is not set in stone, it is merely a strong suggestion. A policy is something much more concrete. It can be cited as policy and should never, ''never'' be violated. That's why it's a policy and not a ''guide''line. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:29, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

: Exactly. Ideas are what should be critisised, never the person personally. I think the policy should include the &quot;fine line&quot; area. Most of us know the difference between a personal attack and critisism of the idea, but the page doesn't state that precisely right now, a potentially dangerous situation. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:46, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

===Implementing poll===

The poll is clearly in favour of enforcement. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:19, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:So how does the enforcement policy happen, exactly? we have a solid majority, let's do whatever we need to do, slap a {{tl|enforced}} on there, and call it a day. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:35, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

: Perhaps you've forgotten that WP/WB are not a democracy and we don't implement things based upon # of votes. I am tending towards casting my vote against, and you may have just convinced me to do so. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

::Is it right to vote NO on this issue because you disagree with another issue? Please notice that the poll has not been implemented and the issue has been reopened. Also notice that the possibility of implementation was raised on the Staff lounge before implementation and the implementation rolled back because of the desire of Jguk to debate it further. 

::What is the point of a poll? If  you disagree with polls why not open this separate debate at the Staff Lounge? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:53, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

::: If I were to vote no, it would be because I was convinced by the opposition. We're not suffering from lack of policies here; people can and are banned because they are disruptive, make personal attacks, etc regardless of whether this is tagged as enforced or proposed. 
::: The point of a poll is to gauge consensus. What you have here is 3 of 12 people opposed (25%), one of them an admin. That shows that the community has not truly come to consensus about this policy. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:26, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::The problem with consensus, in its normal meaning, is that it entails 100% agreement. In a large group this is impossible. We need a measure of consensus such as a voting procedure and a policy that accepts that n% is sufficient consensus (See [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]]). Those who disagree with the 'sufficient consensus' would then attempt to respect it, despite their disagreement.  If we use 100% consensus as the agreement required for any action then no actions will occur on issues that involve more than a few users. 100% consensus also means that one dissident, disturbed or insane person could prevent any action. For instance, suppose the vote here was 14:1, the one person could simply block this policy for ever by demanding 100% consensus, even if the vote became 100:1. Would this be right or good for Wikibooks? If not then what is the acceptable 'sufficient consensus'? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:10, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
:::::: I cover this in my recent reply in [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:20, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
:::: To be fair, it appears that [[User:Rs2]] hasn't edited since last November, so perhaps his position no longer carries as much weight. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:28, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

==Zero tolerance==

This policy is critical for the maintenance of a pleasant working atmosphere. I would like to propose that this policy has a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; clause. Contributors should be warned on a first offence, suspended on a second offence and banned on a third.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:06, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
:That may be a ''bit'' harsh. We should be stern, but three times is not bannable material, IMO. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 01:32, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

::We do need a definite statement of how often this behaviour might be permitted otherwise determined individuals will just take the micky. What would you suggest? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:19, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

::: I agree with Lord Voldemort. Stern, but not &quot;instant ban&quot; after 3 offences. When we get into stuff like that, there will be flame wars whether or not something should be interpreted as a flame or not, because the stakes will be so high. I suggest we do things as usual here; talk it over with both parties and try to find a resolution, or at least take the flames off Wikibooks. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:59, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

==Definition of a personal attack==

Direct attacks

1 subject is a (derogatory term) - derogatory terms consist of terms such as &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;insane&quot;, including types of insanity and diagnosis, &quot;genocidal maniac&quot; etc.

2 relations or associates of subject are a (derogatory term)

Snide attacks

3 Anyone who had (any type of ability) would not produce the subject's work. ie: Anyone who had an intellect would not produce the subject's work. Anyone who had a (qualification in...) would not produce such substandard text.

4 The (article/part of article) could only have been produced by someone with (derogatory term). ie: The article could only have been produced by someone who is brain dead.

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:33, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

== Supporting pages ==

[[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] is little more than a stub, and there is also a red link to [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]]. These are the only links in the &quot;Alternatives&quot; and &quot;Remedies&quot; section, something that gives the policy as a whole a bit less &quot;teeth&quot;, and is something that should be expanded to support the policy as a whole. Probably the closest thing to a &quot;Blocking policy&quot; I've seen is [[Wikibooks:Dealing with vandalism#Blocking vandals|on this page]] (which, by the way, isn't even linked to by [[WB:VIP]], even though it has more information on VIP than VIP itself), and there's extensive discussion in Staff Lounge as far as dispute resolution goes, so it's not as if the material isn't there, it simply needs to be implemented in the proper areas. --[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 16:57, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:This has been discussed in the Staff Lounge. I initially suggested something not far short of an Arbitration Committee but, given the lack of bad behaviour and the small size of the Wikibooks community, support [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]]. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:08, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

== Enforced from 14 April to 23 April 2006 ==

The policy was set {{tl|enforced}} by Robin H at 14 April 2006, but set {{tl|proposed}} again by Jguk at 23 April 2006.

The poll above suggests that this policy should now be {{tl|enforced}}. Did I miss something? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:26, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:What happened was that RobinH made this move, which I accept was entirely in good faith, despite Rob Horning's pertinent comments on [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge#Policy Review]]. In the past, my understanding is that on Wikibooks we operate by consensus, and at the very least that would anticipate that there was some discussion about the points raised by the two (one of them was me) who had voted against this proposal. Neither of the &quot;no&quot; votes is advocating that wikibooks should tolerate personal attacks, but there are concerns that should be addressed about the wording before it (or any alternative) goes live.

:I agree with Rob's comment on the Staff Lounge that before any proposed policy becomes &quot;enforced&quot; it should be preceded by a well publicised discussion and a well publicised approval process, as we say with the Naming Convention policy.

:I have seen this type of policy become a welcome refuge for editors who harrass (ie they drive dedicated editors to breaking point, the dedicated editor makes some personal attack in the heat of the moment after being subjected to many personal attacks on themselves, and then leave the dedicated editor to face punitive sanctions if the matter ever comes before ArbCom). I know that is not the intention of those who support this proposal, but I have serious concerns that, as written, it benefits the long-term harrasser over the harrassed. Even if you disagree with me here, I would suggest the point is worth discussion before the text becomes &quot;enforced&quot;, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:23, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

::You archived the discussion of this item on the 24th then changed the policy to proposed again! See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archive_17 Archived discussion] where no one demurred from the policy being enforced. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:19, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Benefits the Long-term harrasser over the harrassed ==

Jguk said this in the previous section. I do not follow, sorry. Perhaps you can offer an explanation here? Basically; I see it like this:
 
The only time a personal attack is warrented, is if there was a personal attack from some time before. Fortunatly, this policy prevents that as now no one can give a personal attack in the first place. Heck, my definition of a long-term harrasser is someone who gives personal attacks in the long term. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:33, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

:I don't think anyone is saying that making a personal attacks is acceptable etiquette. The question is really whether we need to say more as a policy than that message that appears every time you try to edit a talk page: &quot;Please respect Etiquette, assume good faith and be nice.&quot; I'm not sure we do. After all, if someone doesn't do that, what will happen? Do they make one solitary personal attack and that's the end of it? If so, then we let sleeping dogs lie. Do they continue? In which case someone will probably give them some friendly advice to calm down. Do they then continue despite friendly warnings? I've never seen it get this bad on Wikibooks - but if it did get this far I imagine an admin would give a warning together with a note that there would be some short block to allow matters to calm down. Continue then? Well, something sensible would happen - maybe an indefinite block accompanied with an undertaking to unblock if the user gives a guarantee not to repeat the offending behaviour. Or to put it another way, something sensible woud happen.

:What's the benefit of being explicit, and also giving people lots of ideas of nasty things to do? Would those here to cause trouble necessarily think about doing all the bad behaviour listed under &quot;Examples&quot; if you don't put the ideas in their heads? Do we really want to highlight lots of possibilities for disciplinary actions, whereas really Wikibooks is quite a friendly place, not plagued by the problems we've probably all seen in various wikis?

:Maybe we do need a behaviour policy for the record, and let's face it we have many, many current candidate policies covering behaviour: [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]], [[Wikibooks:No legal threats]], [[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames]], [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]], [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]], [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]]. Whereas really how much more than &quot;Please respect Etiquette, assume good faith and be nice&quot; do we need? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:41, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

::I think we need enforced policies and an enforcement policy.  At the moment there are few cases of serious disputes but they can happen. Laying down clear guidelines is the best way to stop them happening. The vote was clearly for this policy to be '''enforced'''. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]], you are one of the two dissenters, should you really stand in the way of it becoming an enforced policy? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 22:50, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

I'm one of two who has raised questions about this approach, and I do think our concerns should at the very least be addressed before any move to &quot;enforced&quot;. You say that laying down clear guidelines is the best way to stop serious disputes happening - but I don't believe there's any evidence to support it. Compare Wikipedia, which has plenty of guidelines, but which is riddled by disputes. Also, you do not say why a simple policy of &quot;Please respect Etiquette, assume good faith and be nice&quot; is insufficient, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 05:10, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

:We have a good example here of why being nice is not always good enough. A vote has been taken on &quot;No personal attacks&quot; over several months that has shown a 4:1 majority in favour of enforcement. Yet one of the two dissenters from that vote has insisted that we should open the issue again to determine whether the vote should be enacted. Surely votes work on the basis that those taking part respect them, that they act in good faith once the vote has been taken. Is what you are doing good faith? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:48, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

::[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] wrote about the process of dealing with attacks: &quot;Do they then continue despite friendly warnings? I've never seen it get this bad on Wikibooks - but if it did get this far I imagine an admin would give a warning together with a note that there would be some short block to allow matters to calm down. Continue then? Well, something sensible would happen - maybe an indefinite block accompanied with an undertaking to unblock if the user gives a guarantee not to repeat the offending behaviour. Or to put it another way, something sensible woud happen.&quot; 

::There are two main points here. 

::* How bad can it get? I suggest that we look at Wikipedia. On Wikipedia some users make a habit of always starting comments with &quot;It would take a moron to...&quot; and continue to &quot;wind up&quot; the opposition with &quot;Only a fool would...&quot; finishing with flourishes such as &quot;This whole article is (...)&quot;. Personal attacks of this level go uncorrected. Users must advance to &quot;You nazi (....)&quot; or similar before the process of correction may or may not be activated.

::* Who gives the friendly warnings?  As far as I can see there is no enforcement apparatus in Wikibooks except the Staff Lounge. If a vote is taken at the Staff Lounge one of the admins could simply archive the discussion before any move for enforcement is introduced. We need enforced policies and an enforcement apparatus such as [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]].

::[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:35, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

RobinH, Wikibooks, like [[w:WP:WIW#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy|Wikipedia]], is ruled by discussion (except when our benevelent dictator visits us once in a blue moon :) ). A comment against an action being taken should have more weight than a simple vote of &quot;support.&quot; Jguk's comments at the very minimum deserve to be adressed before enacting a policy. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 11:18, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

:I agree that discussion is important but it looked to me like this proposal had been decided by a vote over several months. That said, I am happy to go with the discussion, see above. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

== Avoid having too many policies ==

Here again are the &quot;policies&quot; that [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] enumerated: [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]], [[Wikibooks:No legal threats]], [[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames]], [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]], [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]], [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]]. There is an 8th proposal, [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]].

I supported enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] because I thought that it would be a good idea, and that we could always write a better policy later. I prefer that we have only one policy to deal with user behaviour (limiting insults against users, implementing consistent voting rules, resolving various disputes) instead of creating so many pages. I think that I would vote &quot;no&quot; concerning the other seven policies, but I might support a policy that merges the eight. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:26, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:I would whole-heartedly agree with that statement. No sense having too many separate policies, especially when there are a number that deal directly with the topic of user behavior. Most users (myself included) aren't going to take the time to read 8 different pages about the do's and don'ts of behavior, before we go out into the wiki-world with our keyboards blazing, making all sorts of mistakes. I don't have the time this week (or in most upcoming weeks) to write a unified policy of this nature, but if somebody else does, i will certainly cast my measly vote towards it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:47, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
::PS. I think that [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]] is not similar enough to be merged with the other policies, and that it is an important policy in it's own right. enough so that we should keep it separate. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:::Although it may be a good idea to develop a merged policy this should constitute a separate project. The introduction of such a project now seems premature, lets get this policy enforced and progress from there. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 17:05, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

I certainly do think that we only need one merged behaviour policy. However, as an interim measure and to help resolve the impasse, I will look to get to a version of this formulation of the idea of &quot;being nice&quot; (and rephrase this to something better if you want).

I have edited out the bits that I found most problematic, namely:

*The over-emphasis on not doing negative behaviour (I believe we should concentrate on encouraging positive, respectful behaviour)
*The repetition of similar points by looking at the same points from ever so slightly different angles
*The length (after all, the underlying idea is very simple - it can be expressed in just three words after all)

The changes I have made can be seen [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ANo_personal_attacks&amp;diff=462070&amp;oldid=435885 here]. I am willing to agree with enforcing the policy post my amendments - although I note (1) a single merged behaviour policy should still be our aim, and (2) others will no doubt wish to comment on the revised draft and may have their our suggested amendments, and time should be allowed for this to happen before this proposal gets &quot;enforced&quot; status, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:25, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

:Jg, you gave me one of those moments. I thought &quot;No! how the hell can he just change a text that is undergoing a vote!&quot; and reverted it. I then had a cup of tea and put it back again. 

:What am I doing trying to push a policy review? Three things, firstly ascertaining which policies are key policies, secondly establishing a bare bones constitution for Wikibooks so that it can never be the place where gangs hang out, thirdly tidying up.

:I have left your amendments in place but have restored the examples of personal attacks as an appendix and have added a sentence that stresses how enforced policies impose duties on administrators. The added sentence also transmits some of the force of the original policy before your changes - personal attacks are simply not acceptable.

:I am happy with the wider project of developing a single behaviour policy but feel that this could take a long time to get consensus support. The wider project will be much easier if there are some policies that are clearly accepted. These can serve as the kernel of your wider plan.

:Your change to the text looked like a delaying tactic which was why I was so irritated. I will contact all those who have voted for the policy to note that the text has changed and to invite them to comment - it might change their vote to a &quot;no&quot;. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:58, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

:: I object to the addition of a &quot;remove personal attacks&quot; section to this policy. RPAing does nothing productive; it is better to let the record stand and take people to task for their actions rather than trying to mask them. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:32, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
::::The paragraph has been changed to address your concern (see below). [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
:::I think I'd agree. As long as it wasn't too egregious, it should stand (with obvious exception that the atackee can remove it if they want). --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:34, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

(reset indent) A &quot;No personal attacks&quot; policy is essential in a Wikimedia environment. I fouled up my response to Jg's change by loading the policy with yet another contentious issue. I have replaced the paragraph with:

 Personal attacks are not acceptable on Wikibooks and this 
 policy imposes a duty on  Administrators and Users to stop 
 such attacks should they occur.

This is just emphasising the fact that this is a '''policy'''. It is not something that administrators and users can just ignore. Jg's re-write took the bite out of the policy; my intention in putting in this paragraph is purely emphasis. It does not change the policy. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)



:'''If no-one objects then the policy should be moved to enforced by 1st June 2006.''' [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:00, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

== Move to Enforce by June 1, 2006 ==

I agree with [[User:RobinH]] that this policy should become enforced by June 1st, barring any serious objections. [[User:Jguk]] made some changes to the policy recently that seem to keep the same spirit, but attempt to use better, &quot;more positive&quot; language. This section can be used for expressing concerns or objects. Barring any such objections, I agree with [[User:RobinH]]'s motion that this policy should become enforced by June 1st. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:44, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

:First, can we slow down. I have just proposed a significant amendment to the policy and Robin has suggested an amendment to the amendment which, as far as I'm aware, for the first time sets out an actual obligation for Administrators (so that if an Admin did not, for any reason, make a positive action, then they would be in breach of this policy). Additionally, Kellen, with LV in support, has raised a new objection to the bit about &quot;removing personal attacks&quot; (which admittedly has been in the draft a long time). All these points merit discussion. By all means encourage the discussion along, but let's not have a fixed cut-off date - after all, if we're all talking to resolve any differences, 1 July (just one month later than your proposal) is not an unreasonable target date.

:I do find myself largely agreeing with Kellen and LV. Except in a situation where the personal attack was extreme (eg possibly libellous or plainly outrageous), I see no harm in keeping the personal attacks. I would add to this that I do believe that a user has the right to edit his userspace largely how he likes it, and I'd have no difficulty with a user removing a personal attack from his own talk page (as long as in so doing he did not leave a message that misrepresents the views of the original poster - removing an edit in its entirety would always be acceptable).

:I then find myself again getting worried about having a rules-based policy. OK, we maybe can agree a rule that works reasonably in almost all cases (eg do not remove personal attacks), but then I quickly see that there are exceptions to that general rule which take us on to further objections. In fact, staying totally silent on the matter is better here - silence is an invitation to do something reasonable in the circumstances. We should not get too hung up about which reasonable reaction out of a whole gamut of possible reasonable reactions we have.

:I do think that Robin's addition (&quot;This policy imposes a responsibility on Administrators to assist in the removal of text containing personal attacks wherever it appears in Wikibooks and to explain to offenders that such text is not acceptable&quot;) needs amending. The first part, as noted above I do not think appropriate (and it seems Kellen and LV are of the same view). As far as the second part is concerned, I do not like the idea of forcing a duty on Admins to explain to offenders that such text is not acceptable. Any reader can explain this. But you should also use your judgment. If someone has used bad language once two weeks ago, just let it pass. Only if it seems a wikibookian is persisting in objectionable behaviour, or if you feel it would be useful to explain the situation in a currently active dispute, is it really appropriate to intervene.

:As far as the appendix is concerned. I do not think we need examples of what constitutes a personal attack. Would anyone really argue that a death threat is not a personal attack? Also, I believe it indicates that some behaviour that I would not find acceptable is acceptable - for example, the phrase &quot;Spurious threats of legal action&quot; implies that we would have no problem at all if there was an actual threat of legal action (or an writ actually being issued because of what has happened on wikibooks). Again, silence is best here - either the person making the comment knows they are doing so in a negative spirit or they have made a comment which they do not mean to be taken with offence that has inadvertently caused offence. We don't need a list of what this may be - and we certainly don't need to offer suggestions to those who might want to disrupt Wikibooks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:52, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

::I was just motioning for haste, I certainly can't inforce it myself. I think that wikibooks is lacking because we don't have the policy base that wikipedia does. Because we have fewer definate policies to ground our actions, wikibooks feels more like a free-for-all, and less like a community. I agree in spirit that [[User:RobinH]]'s addition of a duty for admins is not necessary, but I do not beleive that a small detail such as that is grounds not to instate a general behavior policy. '''It should be known officially that personal attacks and bad behavior are not acceptable here at wikibooks.''' The specific measures that should be taken in the event of a policy breach are inconsequential in comparison to the statement of expectations. Maybe we don't need to enforce ''any stated punishment or recourse'' because we can leave it to admins and general users to deal with innappropriateness themselves, so long as we have a solid policy stating that it should be dealt with in some fashion. We can still make all sorts of changes now or in the future, but small details should not be an excuse not to enforce this policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:12, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

:::In the interests of preventing yet further delay to the implementation of this policy I have changed the offending paragraph to a paragraph that simply emphasises that policies impose duties on the whole community. This should answer [[User:Jguk|Jguk]]'s first point. On the second point, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] might note that it waters down the original text that most users approved. In the original text it stated that &quot;Threats of legal action&quot; were not acceptable. If someone is really breaking the law then a threat of legal action is appropriate, it is '''spurious''' threats that are no more than personal attacks. 

:::As [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] says, we need some basic policies or we are wide open to abuse. I feel exposed as a contributor to Wikibooks because, as things stand, anyone can come in, be insulting, uncooperative and deconstruct any book without any defined process for preventing or even disapproving of their actions. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] says that enlightened admins will prevent this from occurring but without guidance in the form of policy the admins cannot know just how severely a particular case should be treated. A list of what constitutes a personal attack was always part of this policy until [[User:Jguk|Jguk]]'s re-write of a couple of days ago and it helps to provide guidance.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:48, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

I have made a minor change (from &quot;Administrators and Users&quot; to &quot;Wikibookians&quot;), which I trust is not controversial. It seems the remaining live issue (subject to new ones arising) is whether the Appendix stays or goes. Please let me know whether you wish to aim to make this &quot;enforced&quot; policy without the Appendix (in which case publicise it everywhere and then promote it in a fortnight if there are no objections) and then later argue for the Appendix should be included. Alternatively we can have the &quot;include or exclude&quot; the Appendix discussion now, which would delay making the policy &quot;enforced&quot;, but would make the policy more complete when it eventually does become &quot;enforced&quot;, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:43, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

:The advantage of the appendix, and the reason why the original authors included the list, is that it makes it clear that any sort of personal attack is not allowed. Anything from &quot;anyone with half a brain..&quot; to &quot;you nigger jew&quot; is not allowed. Wikibooks is about content, not personalities. Without the appendix anyone intervening might be in some doubt about whether a given personal attack is severe enough for action; the appendix shows that '''any''' personal attack is not allowed and must be withdrawn. It also shows that insulting a person's religion etc. is encompassed by the policy.[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:32, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
::Does an appendix really matter. I think people can figure out what is a personal attack or not. If they complain, a neutral admin can step in and decide how severe it is (if it even is one) and take the appropriate action. So it doesn't really matter to me if it's in there or not. Thoughts? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:26, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

::: I think it's unnecessary and an artifact of how the WP policy developed. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:00, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

::::I briefly toyed with the idea of replacing the list with a sentence such as &quot;Any personal attack, whether it is a snide comment or a direct personal insult is covered by this policy.&quot; But then I noticed that in the list it included racial attacks, religious attacks and political attacks. For instance, &quot;Jews are all fools&quot; is not obviously a personal attack - the other person may or may not be a Jew. It is however totally inappropriate for Wikibooks and would be a personal attack upon a jewish reader. The list makes it clear for admins and users that '''any''' personal attack is not allowed. Without the list there would be debate about whether an attack was really &quot;personal&quot; or really severe enough to be covered by the policy. 

::::That said, in the interests of compromise, I have inserted my sentence and removed the list. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:27, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

==Move to enforce==

The new, compromise wording has been in place for a week without objection. I propose to move this policy to &quot;enforced&quot; tomorrow. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:48, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:Although I myself do not object to the new wording becoming &quot;enforced&quot;, I do think that this move should be republicised on the staff lounge with a note that the wording has changed, and only moved to &quot;enforced&quot; once any comments raised in response to that have been dealt with, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 15:11, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

=== New Move to Enforce ===

Actually, this is the same move, I am just bumping this page to the top of the RC list, in hopes that this movement will draw more attention then the last. It is my intention, as per the previous community discussion, to move this proposal to {{tl|policy}} within the week. If there are no dissenting opinions on the matter, I will do it soon. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:12, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

: I'd like to object on the grounds that [[Wikibooks:Be civil]] covers this adequately (along with [[Wikibooks:Profanity]]). I'd like to see this proposal '''rejected'''. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

:This policy is central to creating an atmosphere of congenial behaviour at Wikibooks. The move to enforce was indeed publicised on the staff lounge and not opposed. As far as I was aware it was already accepted for enforcement after protracted discussion. [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] says &quot;Actually, this is the same move&quot; ie: it was already accepted as enforced and tagged as enforced. Why has [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] reopened the debate? Do we have to go over every policy endlessly? Perhaps there should be a moratorium of at least 1 year between debates otherwise determined individuals can slowly dismantle any constitutional structure. If Swift thinks the policy is part of &quot;Be civil&quot; and acceptable in this context then there is no objection to the policy as such and it should be left in place. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 22:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

::Well shoot, i must have mixed up my pages. This one already is enforced, and this new nomination is unneeded. Sorry. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:45, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

:::Cheers. Sorry I got a bit aerated but this was almost the only policy that was finally accepted back in May! [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 22:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

:: Well, this may actually be my fault. When preparing this weeks Proposal of the Week, I looked through the list on [[Wikibooks talk:Be civil#Purpose of this policy]] to see the status of each and thought that this was still a proposal, so I put it up on the week's plan for rejection. That may have been what shaded Whiteknight's memory.
:: Sorry about that guys. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Graphs==
A '''graph''' is a generalization of the tree structure, where instead of a strict parent/child relationship between tree nodes, any kind of complex relationships between the nodes can be represented. A graph (''G'') is a collection of ''vertices'' (V) that are linked by ''edges'' (E). Each edge, sometimes called an arc, consists of a pair of vertices, which are adjacent to one another. Typically, a graph is shown as a set of circles for the vertices, appropriately labelled, which are joined by lines (edges). The two most common representations of graphs are directed and undirected graphs are the two most common representations of graphs.

We will begin with directed graphs, also known as digraphs, which have the easiest to understand representation, and then undirected graphs and finally weighted graphs.

===Graph Terminology===
Before continuing, some knowledge of graph terms is necessary. The order of a graph is the number of its edges, i.e. |''V''(G)|. A common problem is trying to find the length from one vertex to another. This is called finding the path between two vertices. A ''path'' is a sequence of vertices in a graph where each vertex has an edge from it to the next vertex until reaching the final vertex. The ''length'' of a path is the number of edges used. A simple path is similar to a path, except it cannot visit the same vertex twice. A graph ''cycle'' is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, thus it cycles back. &lt;!-- Example? --&gt;

Graphs are an essential part of Computer Science and play a significant role in real-world applications. For example, a graph can be used to describe the airport system. For example, what is best flight, in terms of total distance, from one city to another? One can use vertices to represent airports and edges to represent the connections between any two airports. In this case, one would most likely use directed graphs with a weight or cost assigned to each edge. Weighted graphs will be explained at the end of this chapter. 

==Graph Representations==
[TODO: picture of directed graph]
===Directed Graphs===
The number of edges with one endpoint on a given vertex is called that vertex's '''degree'''. In a directed graph, the number of edges that point ''to'' a given vertex is called its '''in-degree''', and the number that point ''from'' it is called its '''out-degree'''.  Often, we may want to be able to distinguish between different nodes and edges. We can associate labels with either. We call such a graph '''labeled'''.

'''Directed Graph Operations'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-graph'''(): graph&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create a new graph, initially with no nodes or edges.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-vertex'''(graph ''G'', element ''value''): vertex&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create a new vertex, with the given value.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-edge'''(vertex ''u'', vertex ''v''): edge&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create an edge between ''u'' and ''v''. In a directed graph, the edge will flow from ''u'' to ''v''.

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''get-edges'''(vertex ''v''): edge-set&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the set of edges flowing from ''v''

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''get-neighbors'''(vertex ''v''): vertex-set&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the set of vertexes connected to ''v''
&lt;/dl&gt;

[TODO: also need undirected graph abstraction in that section, and also find a better set of operations-- the key to finding good operations is seeing what the algorithms that ''use'' graphs actually ''need'']
&lt;/div&gt;

We can use graphs to represent relationships between objects. For example, the popular game ''Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'' can be modeled by a graph, in particular, a labeled undirected graph. Each actor becomes a node, labeled by the actor's name. Nodes are connected by an edge when the two actors appeared together in some movie. We can label this edge by the name of the movie. Then the problem of finding a path from any actor to Kevin Bacon in six or less steps easily reduces to the Single Source Shortest Path problem found in the companion [[Computer_Science:Algorithms|Algorithms]] book. The Oracle of Bacon at the University of Virginia has actually implemented this algorithm and can tell you the path from any actor to Kevin Bacon in a few clicks[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/].

==== Adjacency Matrix Representation ====
An '''adjacency matrix''' is one of the two common ways to represent a graph.  The adjacency matrix shows which nodes are '''adjacent''' to one another.  Two nodes are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.  In the case of a directed graph, if node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, there is an edge from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, if &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you can get from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; by traversing one edge.  For a given graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes, the adjacency matrix will have dimensions of &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;.  For an unweighted graph, the adjacency matrix will be populated with boolean values.

For any given node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you can determine its adjacent nodes by looking at row &lt;math&gt;\left( i , \left[ 1..n \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt; of the adjacency matrix.  A value of true at &lt;math&gt;\left( i , j \right)&lt;/math&gt; indicates that there is an edge from node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and false indicating no edge.  In an undirected graph, the values of &lt;math&gt;\left( i, j \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left( j, i \right)&lt;/math&gt; will be equal.  In a weighted graph, the boolean values will be replaced by the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes, with a value of zero indicating no edge.

The memory use of an adjacency matrix is &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

 // nodes listed in 'visited' which have already been tested.
 GraphNode depth_first_search(GraphNode node, Predicate criteria, VisitedSet visited) {

===Undirected Graphs===
In a directed graph, the edges point from one vertex to another, while in an '''undirected graph''', they merely connect two vertices.

===Weighted Graphs===
We may also want to associate some cost or weight to the traversal of an edge. When we add this information, the graph is called '''weighted'''.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a '''how to''' guide for converting (transcoding) Windows [[w:AVI|AVI]] video files into high-quality DVD-compliant MPEG-2/AC3]format with  AviSynth and TMPGEnc Xpress. Resulting MPEG-2/AC3 format files can be readily authored]and &quot;burned&quot; to DVD recordable. Founded by John Navas.
* '''TMPGEnc Xpress can be a very good choice''' for transcoding, because:
** It produces '''high quality MPEG-2 video''' output (''e.g.,'' smoother than NeroVision Express with 23.97 fps]video).
** TMPGEnc Xpress supports '''high-quality AC3 audio''' encoding (2-channel as of this writing) as an optional plug-in for version 3, built-in to version 4.
*** AC3 (Dolby Digital) is a more compact and efficient audio format than the alternatives of Linear PCM (WAV) or MPEG-1 Audio Layer 2 (MP2) format (leaving more room for higher-quality video at a given file size).
*** Transcoding of audio into AC3 with other MPEG-2 encoders usually involves demultiplexing, separate transcoding, and remultiplexing, which can be a painful and problematic process.
* However, '''TMPGEnc Xpress alone can be problematic''':
** It chokes on certain input formats; ''e.g.,''
*** It incorrectly detects [http://xvid.org XviD] video at 23.97 fps (and at 29.97 fps) as 30 fps, resulting in transcoding problems.
** Its filters aren't as plentiful, powerful, good, and flexible as those for AviSynth and [http://VirtualDub.org/ VirtualDub].
* '''AviSynth [[w:frameserving|frameserving]]''' of source material, with optional assistance from VirtualDub, can overcome these problems.
* Note: TMPGEnc Xpress is a relatively slow encoder.

== Frameserving with AviSynth ==

=== What Is Frameserving and Why Use It? ===
:Frameserving is using one program (the server) to decode (read) a video file and then sending it (serving) to another program to encode (write) a new video file. The program doing the 'serving' will typically generate a small (usually only one or two frames) dummy .avi file which is then loaded as the video input of the encoding program. The server sends the decoded frames one at a time to the dummy .avi file, essentially making the encoder think it's working with the original video file.

:For example, we could decode a DVD Vob file using Flask Mpeg and then use AVISynth to 'frameserve' it to another utility such as TMPGEnc Xpress and convert it to an SVCD or a VCD. Or we could frameserve it to VirtualDub and add filters and effects before we encoded it into another format such as DivX. Frameserving is the holy grail of video converting because it allows the user to choose what encoder to use without the need to convert their video file into a huge uncompressed AVI format first!

=== Why Not Use VirtualDub Alone? ===

:GUI-based VirtualDub is easier to use than script-based AviSynth, but normally isn't able to frameserve directly to TMPGEnc Xpress -- although TMPGEnc Xpress previewing works, TMPGEnc Xpress transcoding (conversion) fails with an error (although there may be a way to solve that problem - see [http://www.videohelp.com/forum/archive/t246002.html this forum thread], particularly posts by bunyip).

:On the other hand, VirtualDub is able to frameserve to AviSynth, which can in turn frameserve to TMPGEnc Xpress, so it is possible to use VirtualDub with TMPGEnc Xpress thus:

| &amp;rarr;
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| bgcolor=&quot;silver&quot; | ''&amp;nbsp;MPG&amp;nbsp;''
|}
|}

==== Cleanup of Noisy Video ====

:VirtualDub can be particularly useful for cleanup of noisy source video files (''e.g.,'' VHS video). Two VirtualDub filters that are both easy to use and effective on cleaning up noise (when used in this order) are:

:# '''[http://www.shdon.com/view?cat=vid&amp;doc=vid_dnr Dynamic Noise Reduction]''' by Steven Don (MMX version)&lt;br&gt;Try the Noise Threshold as high as 24 (or more) on really noisy sources.
:# '''[http://neuron2.net/hiq/smoothhiq.html Smart Smoother High Quality]''' by Klaus Post&lt;br&gt;Try a Threshold of 100-140 on really noisy sources.

=== Basics ===

: Sample AviSynth script:
:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
# source XviD AVI file
file = &quot;SampleXviD.avi&quot; # use actual filename
# open AVI video-only to get correct frame rate
AVISource(file, audio = false)
# save correct frame rate for DirectShowSource
frate = Framerate()
# reopen in DirectShow for better audio compatibility
DirectShowSource(file, fps = frate)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

=== Optional ===

==== [[w:Audio normalization|Normalize]] audio ====

:To ensure that audio volume isn't too low and/or to roughly match the audio volume of different clips, add the following to the [[#Basics|Basics]] script:
:{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
Normalize(0.98)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

==== Correct Audio Sync Errors ====

:Audio can be out of sync with video if:

:* The audio starts '''too early or too late'''.  To fix this (''e.g.,'' delay audio by 0.25 seconds):
::{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
DelayAudio(0.25) # float seconds; negative is earlier
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
:* The audio '''playback speed''' doesn't exactly match the frame rate of the video.  To fix this (''e.g.,'' stretch audio by 0.01%):
::{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
# less than 100.0 slows/stretches
# more than 100.0 speeds/shortens
TimeStretch(tempo = 100.015)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
: '''Troubleshooting Audio Sync'''
::If AviSynth complains about source audio compression, or if audio is difficult to sync, especially when source audio is in AC3 format, it may first be necessary to decompress (and possibly fix) source audio. Options:
::* '''VirtualDub''', either frame serve to AviSynth (see [[#Why Not Use VirtualDub Alone?|Why Not Use VirtualDub Alone?]]) or write a new (proper and much larger) AVI file (''File &amp;rarr; Save as AVI'') with ''direct stream copy'' of video and ''full processing mode'' of audio. Note that you must have an appropriate codec installed or VirutalDub will complain about not being able to decompress the audio.
::** ''Audio skew'' (audio early or late) can be adjusted (under ''Audio &amp;rarr; Interleaving'') if necessary.
::** ''Advanced filtering'' may be needed for more difficult audio problems.
::* '''[http://home.cogeco.ca/~avi2vcd/ decompress]''' (part of [http://home.cogeco.ca/~avi2vcd/ avi2vcd]). Simple and easy, but not as effective as VirtualDub.

==== Extracting WAV audio ====

:To solve difficult audio sync or other audio problems, particularly with AC3 audio, it can be helpful to extract WAV audio from the AVI, which can then be multiplexed with the video using AviSynth or VirtualDub. Note that the WAV file will be relatively large due to decompression.

:'''Extracting WAV audio with VLC media player'''

::One way to extract WAV audio is with VLC media player, which does a good job of handling difficult audio streams. The downside to using VLC is that it only works in real time (i.e., slowly). Sample commandline:
:::&lt;code&gt;vlc ''INPUTFILE.AVI'' --aout=aout_file  --audiofile-file=''OUTPUTFILE.WAV'' --novideo&lt;/code&gt;

:'''Extracting WAV audio with VirtualDub'''

::A faster but less universal way to extract WAV audio is with VirtualDub:
::#Load the AVI video (File &amp;rarr; Open Video File)
::#Under the Audio Menu select Full Processing Mode (Audio &amp;rarr; Full Processing Mode)
::#Under the File menu select Save WAV... (File &amp;rarr; Save WAV...), and choose a name and location for the WAV file.
::VirtualDub will pop up a status window as the audio track is rapidly extracted and converted to a WAV file. Note that you must have an appropriate codec installed or VirutalDub will complain about not being able to decompress the audio.

==== Adding Subtitles (Permanent) ====
:Adding permanent subtitles to output MPEG-2 video can be done by merging the .AVI video with text subtitles from a separate file in [[wikipedia:SubRip | .SRT]], [[wikipedia:SubStation_Alpha | .SSA]], or other subtitle format. This can be done with the '''TextSub plugin''' (named VSFilter.dll) for AviSynth; ''e.g.,''

::{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
LoadPlugin(&quot;C:\Program Files\VobSub\VSFilter.dll&quot;)  # program location
TextSub(&quot;subtitles.ssa&quot;)  # merge subtitles
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

:'''Notes:'''
:*'''Subtitle sync errors''' can be fixed with the included '''SubResync''' utility. (It may be necessary to separately install VobSub in the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli/ standalone VSFilter package] for SubResync to work.) To '''modify on-screen formatting''' (''e.g.,'' font, text size, color) of subtitles, use SubResync to ''Edit...'' as desired.
:*More serious '''subtitle editing''' is best done with ''free'' [http://www.urusoft.net/products.php?cat=sw&amp;lang=1 Subtitle Workshop].
:*When '''[[#Convert PAL to NTSC | converting PAL to NTSC]]''' (as described below) with subtitles, place TextSub ''before'' AssumeFPS to ensure that subtitles stay in sync.

==== Convert PAL to NTSC ====
:Any conversion of PAL framerate to NTSC framerate will inevitably result in loss of motion smoothness (jerkiness). However, smoothness can be preserved by playing 25 fps PAL video at the NTSC film framerate of 23.976 fps by means of AssumeFPS(), slowing action by about 4%, a difference so small as to be unnoticeable, and using [[wikipedia:Telecine#3:2 pulldown (technically, 2:3 pulldown)|3:2 pulldown]] to achieve an NTSC playback framerate of 29.97 fps. Use audio_sync ''true'' on AssumeFPS() to keep the audio in sync. That will slightly change (lower) the pitch of the audio, but again the difference is so small as to be unnoticeable, although you can correct that with TimeStretch() as shown in the following example:
:* '''Method 1'''
::{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
# Play PAL 25 fps video at NTSC 23.976 fps WITH audio sync
AssumeFPS(23.976, true)

# Restore correct pitch (OPTIONAL)
TimeStretch(pitch = (100.0*25.0)/23.976)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
:* '''Method 2'''
::{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
# Play PAL 25 fps video at NTSC 23.976 fps WITHOUT audio sync
AssumeFPS(23.976)

# Restore audio sync (ESSENTIAL)
TimeStretch((100.0*23.976)/25.0)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

==== Transcode MPEG formats ====
:To frameserve various MPEG formats with AviSynth, use the DGMPGDec package, which includes the '''DGDecode plugin''' for AviSynth. (Supported formats include elementary streams, program streams, VOBs, VCDs, SVCDs, PVA files, and transport streams.)

:Before frameserving, run '''DGIndex''' (also included in the DGMPGDec package), and use File&amp;rarr;Open and File&amp;rarr;Save Project to extract audio to a file (.wav, .mpa, ''etc.'') and create a .d2v video index file. Then load video and audio in AviSynth, and dub them together. For example, for AVSEQ01.DAT (VideoCD MPEG1 file), processed with DGIndex:
::{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
LoadPlugin(&quot;C:\Program Files\DGMPGDec\DGDecode.dll&quot;)  # Location of DGMPGDec package
video = MPEG2Source(&quot;AVSEQ01.d2v&quot;)  # video index file from DGIndex
audio = MPASource(&quot;AVSEQ01 T01 DELAY 21ms.mpa&quot;)  # audio file extracted by DGIndex
AudioDub(video,audio)  # Dub video and audio together
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
:'''Notes:'''
:#MPEG2Source() is used even for MPEG1 formats.
:#For .wav audio, WAVSource() would be used instead of MPASource(). Other forms of audio must be handled with AviSynth plugins.
:#To [[#Convert PAL to NTSC|convert PAL to NTSC]], the above method can be used:
:::{|
| &lt;pre&gt;
AssumeFPS(23.976, true)  # play PAL at NTSC frame rate with audio sync
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

=== Testing ===

:A good way to test an AviSynth script is to play it with Media Player Classic.

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
::2.4.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Ground Water Policy in Georgia]]

===Policy Issues===

*Limit total allowed withdrawal (from all users)
*Manage aquifer recharge
*Consider ground water pumping effects on spring flow

===Example policy from other states===

*Idaho -- &quot;It is the policy of Idaho that average withdrawals from an aquifer should not exceed the reasonably anticipated rate of future recharge to that aquifer.&quot; [http://www.idwr.idaho.gov/waterboard/planning/State%20Water%20Plan/state_plan.pdf| (p.3)]
*Idaho -- &quot;It is the policy of Idaho that managed recharge be encouraged, pursuant to state law. Comment: Managed aquifer recharge may enhance spring flows and maintain desirable aquifer levels.&quot; [http://www.idwr.idaho.gov/waterboard/planning/State%20Water%20Plan/state_plan.pdf| (p.4)]
*Idaho -- &quot;It is the policy of Idaho that the hydrogeologic relationships between ground water supplies and spring flows continue to be quantified to allow for the determination of optimal development of the water resources.  Comment: Spring flow is part of the natural discharge from an aquifer. Pumped ground water withdrawals from an aquifer change the original recharge-discharge relationship and affect spring flows. Where this relationship exists, it must be sufficiently quantified to allow for optimal utilization of the ground water supply while protecting established senior rights which depend on spring flows discharging from the aquifer.&quot; [http://www.idwr.idaho.gov/waterboard/planning/State%20Water%20Plan/state_plan.pdf| (p.4)]</text>

== [[Water Resources Planning and Management in Georgia]] book ==

The [[Water Resources Planning and Management in Georgia]] book has a bad naming convention, and I am going to go through and fix it, eventually. We usually require that all pages in a given book have the same prefix, such as &quot;Georgia Water&quot;, or &quot;Georgia Water Management&quot;, or something like that. Then, every subpage of the book would be named &quot;Georgia Water/Georgia Water Law&quot;. I'll go through and do all the dirty work for you to make this book more acceptable under current policy, if you would like. Feel free to give me any suggestions/requirements that you might have for this process, so that I don't make you unhappy with it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:I've gone though tonight and added [[:Category:Water Resources Directory]] and [[:Category:Water Resources Planning and Management in Georgia]] designations to a number of pages in your book, but wasn't able to tag them all tonight. I will go through and try to finish the job tomorrow or next week. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:22, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

Thank you for the quick reply! I don't think the VfD issue is going to be a problem, it's based off the conception that because the word &quot;directory&quot; is in the title, that it isn't a &quot;textbook&quot;. As a civil engineer, I think that you should be well aware that books of that nature can be used as textbooks in CE classrooms. If you can use this project to attract other contributors to wikibooks--especially expert contributors--I can't imagine anybody turning that down. Also, I would like to point out that the [[Wikibooks:Engineering bookshelf|Engineering bookshelf]] is in bad shape, and could use additional help from a team of professional engineers (should they have some time to spare). Come down to [[WB:VFD|the VfD vote]], and cast a vote for '''keep''', and possibly explain what you explained to me about this book, so that other people understand. Good luck, and I'll talk to you later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Water Resources Directory]] ==

I've gone one better and closed the discussion. Whilst one user, hagindaz, has concerns about its suitability, it is clear that no-one shares them (or at least no-one has chosen to declare that they share them). As the last comments on that nomination were some time ago, and as, I confess, I agree with you that the proposed content is suitable for wikibooks, I thought closing the debate was the best way to go. Good luck with it! [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

== Water Resources ==

I came across water resources for georgia while trying to fix double redirects and making sure they really were redirects. I goofed and moved pages to Georgia Water instead of Water Resources Directory when I decided to also try to fix the remaining issues with the wikibook name as I saw on one of the pages. So everything else I could find that hadn't already been moved to '''Georgia Water''' got moved there. I goofed because I didn't see until I had finished moving pages, the new suggested name for the wikibook. For that I apologies for any additional trouble that may have caused.

Luckly nothing within '''Water Resources Directory''' was moved in the process of my moving pages. I moved some pages from '''Georgia Water Laws''' into '''Water Resources Directory/USA/Georgia/Laws''' as that was all I could follow of the book structure. I'm willing to help finish what I started in moving twords having the entire book listed under one bookname with flat / tree structure, if you need/want it and if you can tell me where things should go.

Since I notice you are still actively contributing to the wikibook, could you double check my changed? I've fixed broken links on pages, but perhaps not all. I might of moved laws that may not have been state specific and so may of been better off placed in '''Water Resources Directory/USA/Laws/'''. I've also requested speedy deletion on a ton of pages that were turned into redirects that are no longer refered to from my fixing links to refer directly to the correct page. There are still however pleanty of pages under '''Georgia Water''' and '''Georgia Water Law''' that probably need to be moved to '''Water Resources Directory/USA/Georgia''', because I'm uncertain if the current structure of '''Georgia Water''' is meant to be used there or not.

I don't know anything about water resources, so other then trying to help move parts of the wikibook under the one name and (hopefully) correct book structure, I can't be of much help with this wikibook. Let me know on my talk page, if I was helpful, unhelpful, any other critisism you may have or if you would like my help to finish what I tried to start. :)  --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 18:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

== Water Resources page moves and [[Georgia Water Law]] ==

Thank you for your note on my talkpage to explain the page moves.  The [[Georgia Water Law]] book just needed to be added to the new book list, not put under a subsubsubpagename.   The intention is to invite attorneys to contribute material for the individual laws which are listed under the Georgia Water Law book title.  I think that the attorneys might be less willing to contribute to a sub-subsubsubpagename (Water Resources Directory/USA/Georgia/Law/NameOfLaw), but might be willing to contribute to a book called Georgia Water Law.  Also, the two law school students who organized the [[Georgia Water Law]] book might like to cite it on their resumes with the title used to create the book, rather than citing it as a subsubsubpagename.  So it would help if you could please put everything back as it was.  Then OK to list the Georgia Water Law book on the bookshelf.  Thanks very much.  I notice on your userpage that you have programming skills, and hope that you might help me with some page and table layout questions in the future. I appreciate your help.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 13:25, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

Ok. I might of misunderstood what [[User:SBJohnny|SBJohnny]] was saying about it needed more work done and tied together. The only pages concerning '''Georgia Water Law''' I've marked for speedy deletion are ones that look like they might of been created by accident and had been fixed. '''Georgia Water Law/ LawName''' moved to '''Georgia Water Law/LawName'''. I may have also moved some pages from '''Georgia Water/Policy''' that looked like laws (I don't remember).

I may have incorrectly assumed that '''Water Resources in Georgia''' and names simular to it, '''Georgia Water''' and '''Georgia Water Law''' were all meant to be part of the same wikibook from issues with naming policy, decisions regarding what was needed to prevent deletion as was decided as part of its Votes for Deletion and comments left here by other people. There seems to be a bit of an overlap between them all which probably added to my own confusion. Like '''Georgia Water Law''' looks like it is/was a chapter within '''Georgia Water''' which in turn looks like it is/was part of '''Water Resources Directory/USA/Georgia'''. Sorry about that. Have you mentioned these differences on [[User:SBJohnny|SBJohnny]]'s talk page in addition to repling to him on my talk page? He may not notice your reply on my talk page.

Am I correct in assuming you don't have a problem with '''Georgia Water''' being moved as subpages of '''Water Resources Directory/USA/Georgia''', just with '''Georgia Water Law'''? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:06, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

Having looked at some of the work you did on these pages the same day. It would appear these are all meant to serve as redirects for the same book, more or less. Is that correct? I'm a bit confused on what all you need me to undo to put things right. Just undo my moves on Georgia Water Laws and fix links on Water Resources Directory? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:51, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== Can you please make a comment also... txs ==

We are discussing GFDL and wikibooks and book communities, rights and what nots in &quot;[[:User_talk:Panic2k4#call_for_comment|Call for comments]]&quot; a future policy could and probably should emerge from that discussion in not only to clarify things to all users.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

== Where is everything supposed to be, actually? ==

I've been ignoring the speedy deletion requests surrounding this book, as I'm not sure what you actually want done. Are they supposed to be under &quot;Georgia Water&quot;? 

I'm not sure darklama can undo what was done (admin tools might be needed, and he's not an admin). Currently I'm not even sure where everything is, but let me know if there's anything we can do to get it back on track. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:51, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Futurology''' (or [[w:Futures Studies|''Futures studies'']]) is the analysis of ''cause and effect'' trends for the purpose of predicting possible, probable, and [[w:prescriptive|prescriptive]] outcomes to present day scenarios.  While industry and liberal arts have the luxury of dividing historical perspectives into distinct disciplines, Futurology examines the necessary intertwining of advancements and expectations in [[w:economics|economics]], [[w:sociology|sociology]], [[w:engineering|engineering]], [[w:mathematics|mathematics]], [[w:biology|biology]], [[w:pedagogy|pedagogy]], and many other disciplines.
==Possible Effects==

Futurology can be used to warn society of a possible undesirable future for the purpose of avoiding it.  In regard to predictions of widespread chaos associated with the [[w:Year_2000_problem|Millennium bug]], for instance, futurologists claim that society heeded the evidence presented and took steps to avoid the catastrophe.  Yet in cases of successful futurology ''warnings'', it is impossible to prove through direct evidence the difference between a catastrophe averted and an incorrect prediction, even after the fact.

By the same token, popular futurologists like [[w:Raymond_Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil]] ([[w:The_Singularity_Is_Near|''The Singularity Is Near'']]) predict futures that exceed our expectations.  In doing so, they are often accused of creating self-fulfilling prophecies.  Kurzweil's books generally review predictions from previous writings to show their accuracy, and then make forecasts for the future.  Since the popularity of these books cannot help but raise people's expectations, they are sure to create a demand for the technology that is prophesied.  As a result, to some extent Kurzweil is not only predicting the future, but also creating it.

==Nature of the Future==
[[Image:Faroe stamp 367 stampin' the future.jpg|thumb|one idea of future devices]]
Even if we knew everything about our current universe, even if the future didn't also depend on the quantum random element, and even if technology didn't change the future ramifications of historic events, predictions only have a practical effect if they somehow alter our actions in the present.  Of course, any differing action in the present will also change the future, thus affecting the prediction.  For these reasons, ''futurology'' uses a unique set of theoretical models and deductive methods for describing the ''likelihood'' of an event and the ''conditions'' under which it is prone to occur.  This textbook investigates these models and methods, and explores the practical applications for their use.

Don't make legal threats against other users of Wikibooks. Apart from being [[Wikibooks:Civility|incivil]], doing so causes a number of serious problems:

* It severely inhibits free editing of pages, a concept that is absolutely necessary to ensure that Wikibooks remains neutral. Without this freedom, we risk one side of a dispute intimidating the other, thus causing a systematic bias in our modules.

* It causes bad feelings and a lack of trust amongst the Wikibooks community, damaging our ability to proceed quickly and efficiently and with an assumption of mutual good faith.

* The Wikimedia Foundation has had bad experiences with users who have made legal threats in the past, and by making legal threats, you may damage your reputation on Wikibooks.

*A legal threat may lead to you being blocked from editing (on a case by case basis), so as not to exacerbate the problem through other than legal channels.

'''Instead''', first attempt to resolve disputes using the [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes|dispute resolution]] procedures. This will oftentimes lead to a solution without resorting to the blunt tool of the law. If the dispute resolution procedures do not resolve your problem then you can use the law in the knowledge that you have taken all reasonable steps to resolve the situation amicably.

'''But''', if you really feel the need to take legal action, we cannot prevent you from doing so. However, we ask that if you do so then you do not edit Wikibooks until the matter of law is settled, one way or the other, to ensure that all legal processes happen via proper legal channels.

If you do decide to proceed with legal action, you should deal with it privately with the user by e-mail. Do not thrash out the issue in a Wikibooks forum or talk page; you may find that other users take the side of the other party. (Would you really want to sue a group of users if that happened?) If your issue involves Wikibooks itself, you should contact Wikibook's parent organization, the [http://wikimediafoundation.org/ Wikimedia Foundation].

'''NOTE''': &quot;No legal threats&quot; does not mean, of course, that claims of [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|copyright infringement]] are not to be made. If you are the owner of copyrighted material which is on Wikibooks, a clear statement about whether it is licensed for such use is welcome and appropriate. Copyrighted material not licensed for Wikibooks (with very limited fair-use exception) is not welcome on Wikibooks. 

Similarly, slander, libel, or defamation of character is not to be tolerated on Wikibooks; true instances of such writing, that might legitimately expose Wikibooks, or its parent organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, to legal sanction, should immediately be called to the attention of an administrator and/or the community at large. Disagreements as to the identity of a person, their motivations for a given action, opinions of third parties about them, ''etc''. do not fall under slander, however, and legal threats cannot be used to have points of view enshrined in an module.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adapted from en.wiki. In an effort to protect Wikibooks or the Wikimedia Foundation, I propose this policy be enforced ASAP. A poll to determine consensus is below. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:46, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:First off, you absolutely need to change references from &quot;wikipedia&quot; to say &quot;wikibooks&quot;. How can we vote on a policy that doesnt even reference this project? Next, while i understand what you are saying about threats ruining the whole atmosphere, at wikibooks, we need some threats, because we can't have users violating copyright to post information here. In fact, we should never need legal threats, because everybody should always perfectly follow all applicable laws. Of course, this isnt the case. If a contributer here posts copyrighted information, the entire wikibooks project could land in hot water for hosting it. I vote '''no''' to this policy, for those reasons. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:47, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

::Good call on the Wikipedia references. Not really sure what I was thinking. As to your other point, did you not even see the big &quot;'''Note:'''&quot; on the policy page? It specifically allows for people to claim copyvios.

::::Threatening to sue Wikibooks or the Wikimedia Foundation for modules or remarks made about a certain person or thing. Or a threat of legal action if a module is not removed from the project. Or between editors threatening to take another editor to court for something they have written. There are quite a few possibilities, and like I said, it might be more for liability protection than for actual deflection of legal threats. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:01, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

Should the proposed policy, [[Wikibooks:No legal threats]], be an enforced policy?

'''Yes'''

'''No'''

# People can take legal action if they want to and they should be able to warn people if they are considering it.  Otherwise you get people out of the blue suing people.[[User:Dolive21|Dolive21]] 17:08, 30 November 2005 (UTC) (adding on to my previous comments from here) Peoples the world over have decided to allow people to seek legal redress for their greivances.  Such a system exists in just about every country of the world.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 11:21, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
# I guess I'm weighing in on this matter now.  To have this page as a guideline, I would support.  This is more common sense than something that could be used as justification to ban a user... presumably the reason this should become an enforced policy.  If we need this as liability protection, we should add to or modify [[Wikibooks:General disclaimer]] instead.  If you make a legal threat and don't follow through, it is illegal and you can be sued for barrity as a counter-claim against you.  In other words, if you try to pull legal manuverings and threaten all kinds of legal action, you had better be prepared to put your money where your mouth is, and make sure you have actually read the applicable laws to make sure you have a reasonable chance to succeed.  You could in theory also have criminal charges pressed against you if you make a legal threat improperly.  In other words, making legal threats has legal consequences and there is no need to make a disclaimer policy that is likely to screw things up further if you have to go to court.  In addition, I don't know of a specific instance on Wikibooks where this is needed, although this is famous last words and the last time I made a comment like that I found myself eating my own words.  I just don't know why a policy like this is needed on Wikibooks at this time.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:06, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
#This isn't Wikipedia, and hopefully will never become as divisive and abrasive as Wikipedia. I don't think we should be looking to copy our policies from there. That's not to say I would welcome someone coming here and making lots of legal threats, it's just I don't think we should have a policy that gives people ideas. One of the easiest ways to get people to think of something is to tell them not to think about it! [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 23:49, 13 February 2006 (UTC)
#Before we make ourselves little dictators of our virtual domain, perhaps we ought to think about the ramifications. Systems of '''''crime and punishment''''' are a ''failure state''.

Is their instruction creep working for them? Perhaps we could learn something from our founder. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 03:55, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The problem we are seeing, again and again, is this attitude that some poor victim of a biased rant in Wikipedia ought to not get pissed and take us up on our offer of &quot;anyone can edit&quot; but should rather immerse themselves in our arcane internal culture until they understand the right way to get things done. I do not know what is going to change, but something BIG has got to happen and SOON about this issue, because the amount of time it is consuming for some of our best editors is getting way out of control.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Argus Filch''''' is the caretaker at Hogwarts. He has a pet cat called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]] who is usually on the prowl, keeping an eye out for him. He is bitter, cruel and seems to hate the students. He seems to work well with oppressors, seeing their use of rules as only natural and correct; he would be a perfect tool for a totalitarian regime.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] get off on the wrong foot with Filch on the very first day of classes when he catches them trying to enter the forbidden corridor. They had not meant to visit that corridor; they had simply gotten lost on the way to Transfiguration class. They are saved from being locked in the dungeons by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]], who happens to be passing by.

At tea with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on the Friday of their first week, Harry is pleased that Hagrid refers to Filch as &quot;that old git&quot;. Hagrid also says that he can't abide [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]], and that Filch has apparently instructed Mrs. Norris to follow Hagrid around.

Shortly after this, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] challenges Harry to a Wizard's Duel. Harry and his second, Ron, followed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], go to the Trophy Room, the designated site for the duel, but instead of finding Draco there, they hear Filch approaching. Trying to escape, Neville knocks over a suit of armour, and in the ensuing mad dash to escape they end up in the forbidden third floor corridor. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] has followed them as far as the door, but decides in the end that it would be more fun to taunt Filch than it would be to lead him to the four, thus allowing them to escape.

Trying to retrieve the copy of ''Quidditch Through the Ages'' that Harry had taken out of the library, and that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] had confiscated, Harry looks into the staff room, where he finds Filch binding up a wound on Snape's leg. Snape is incensed that Harry has seen this injury.

Harry receives an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] for Christmas, and trying it out that night, opens a book in the Restricted Section of the library. The book starts screaming, and Harry runs, ducking under Filch's arm as Filch, wild-eyed, enters the Library. When Harry pauses for breath, he is alarmed to realize that, despite the distance he has traveled, Filch is approaching, saying that someone had been in the Restricted section. Harry is further dismayed to discover that the person Filch is talking to is Snape. The corridor is so narrow that the two of them won't be able to get past Harry, so Harry retreats though an open doorway, finding himself in a disused classroom containing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|mirror of Erised]].

When Hagrid's baby dragon, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Norbert|Norbert]], is sent away, Hermione and Harry forget the Invisibility Cloak at the top of the tower. Filch catches them as they descend back into the school. Some time later, Filch escorts them, with Neville and Draco, who have also received detentions, over to Hagrid's, where they will be assisting Hagrid in searching for something that is killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|unicorns]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

At the Entrance Feast, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] mentions that &quot;our caretaker, Mr. Filch&quot;, has banned certain items; the full list of banned items is posted on his door.

Harry and Ron have received detention for driving a flying car into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]]; at the end of the first week of classes, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] tells them that Ron's detention will be served with Filch, polishing the trophies, while Harry will be helping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]] answer his fan mail. Ron later says that he had a recurrence of the jinx he had tried to cast at Malfoy, and belched up a great lot of slugs on a Special Award for Services to the School, which he had then had to polish about ten times to get the slug slime off.

The Autumn weather is dismal and wet, and Harry, coming in from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] practice, is sodden and muddy. Stopping to talk with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]], he is surprised by Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, and, before he can make his escape, Filch himself. Filch, enraged, hauls Harry off to his office, where he begins writing him up for &quot;befouling the castle&quot;. He is interrupted, however, by a loud crash from upstairs; shouting &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]]!&quot; he rushes off. Harry, left on his own, finds a letter from a company called &quot;Kwikspell&quot; on Filch's desk; looking at it, he sees that it is full of testimonials from people who say that the Kwikspell course had taught them magic when they had been unable to do any before. Harry, hearing Filch returning, puts the letter back on his desk. Filch returns, apparently pleased; apparently Peeves has dropped a very valuable [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]], and Filch seems to feel that this will compel Dumbledore to evict Peeves. Filch notices that the Kwikspell letter has been moved; he quickly shuffles it out of sight, then, looking embarrassed, tells Harry that he's free to go.

At Hallowe'en, Mrs. Norris is found Petrified and hanging from a torch bracket, near words scrawled on the wall: &quot;''The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware!''&quot;. Enraged, Filch says that Potter has something to do with it, because he was in the vicinity at the time. Professor Dumbledore, arriving, takes Mrs. Norris off the torch bracket, and in company with Filch, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], Professor McGonagall, Gilderoy Lockhart, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, carries her to Lockhart's office where he examines her. While it turns out that she is not dead, Dumbledore is unable to suggest how she was Petrified. Filch says that Harry must be involved, because he knows that Filch is... a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]]. Filch demands that someone be punished; Snape suggests that Harry must know more about things than he is telling, and suggests suspending him from the Quidditch team, a suggestion which McGonagall immediately resists. Professor Dumbledore reminds everyone that Harry is innocent until proven guilty, and tells Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they are free to go. Ron later explains why Filch was so upset; a Squib is a child of magical parents who is unable to do magic himself.

Over the next several months, we often see Filch wandering the hall trying to give students detention for &quot;acting cheerful&quot; or &quot;breathing too loudly&quot;, sitting in a chair immediately under the torch bracket where Mrs. Norris was found, or trying to scrub the writing off the wall. Shortly after Christmas, Harry and Ron hear an outburst from Filch; peering around the corner, they find that he has abandoned his usual station, which turns out to be right outside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s bathroom, because Myrtle has turned on all the water and is flooding the hall. Investigating, Harry and Ron discover that someone has thrown a diary down a lavatory, and Myrtle is upset because it went through her head.

Filch does not play much more of a role in this book, but we do see him briefly at the end of the book when he is re-united with Mrs. Norris.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

We don't see a lot of Filch in this book. At the first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade weekend]], Filch is checking people against a long list of names to see if they have permission to visit the village; Harry, not having permission, watches Ron and Hermione pass him, and then returns to Gryffindor tower. On the way, he is intercepted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]], who show him the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], a magical map that shows where everyone is in the castle. They say that they had stolen it from Filch's files once when they were being written up for setting off Dungbombs in the halls, but seeing how much greater Harry's need is than theirs, they give it to him, with instructions how to use it. This map is Harry's ticket to Hogsmeade, as it shows secret passages out of the school.

Filch is also present at Christmas dinner, and apparently it is rather ghastly watching him try to have a good time.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Filch's role in this book is again minor. Harry notes that he is setting out extra chairs at head table at the feast celebrating the arrival of the two additional schools for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Tournament]]; Ron wonders why four chairs, as the only two guests that they know about are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madam Maxime]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]. Ron's question is answered when Professor Dumbledore introduces the other two judges for the Triwizard Tournament, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]]. Shortly afterwards, Dumbledore asks Filch to bring out the casket that holds the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]].

When Harry, acting on a hint given to him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], visits the Prefects' Bathroom to try to decipher the clue in the Egg, he uses the Marauder's Map to see where Filch and Peeves are before venturing into the hallways. He checks again before heading back to Gryffindor Tower, and as he is doing so, he sees Bartemius Crouch in Snape's office. He chooses to investigate; getting his foot caught in a trick step, he drops the egg which immediately starts wailing. This summons Filch and, shortly, Snape. Filch believes that Peeves has stolen the Egg from one of the Champions and dropped it. Snape dismisses this concern, saying that someone has been in his office, and it must have been a wizard because of the charm he put on his door. The presence of the egg convinces Snape that Harry is there under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]'s arrival prevents Snape from finding Harry, and Moody sends both Snape and Filch on their separate ways before rescuing Harry from the trap he has gotten himself into.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Harry's scar pains him at the end of one of his sessions of detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], and he feels a need to write to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], his godfather, to tell him about this. As he heads for the Owlery to mail the letter, he is spotted by Mrs. Norris. He is joined in the Owlery by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]], who is mailing off a birthday present for her mother. As they are talking, Filch bursts in, accusing Harry of preparing to mail off an order for Dungbombs. He demands to search Harry's pockets, but Cho defends him, saying that whatever it is, Harry had already sent it, she saw him. 

When Harry heads to Hogsmeade for the next Hogsmeade weekend, Filch sniffs at him suspiciously; evidently he is carrying through on his threat in the Owlery that he will be watching for any scent of dungbombs on Harry. Harry mentions the episode in the Owlery to Ron and Hermione, wondering why Filch would have though that he would order Dungbombs. Hermione wonders who had tipped Filch off, and suggests that it might have been a ploy to get a look at Harry's mail.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] returns with Sirius' answer, she has been attacked, and possibly the message that she carries has been read. This seems to confirm Hermione's suspicion that Filch had been instructed to try and read Harry's mail.

Shortly after Dumbledore leaves and Umbridge is appointed Headmistress, she asks Filch to summon Harry to her office. Filch is ecstatic, talking about how things will change now she's in charge. Umbridge has apparently told Filch that she is in favour of corporal punishment, and will be arranging to have Peeves evicted. Having told Harry all this, he announces Harry at Umbridge's door and then departs.

As Harry's interview with Umbridge is about to end, a series of explosions sounds in the main stairs. Umbridge and Filch run to investigate, but are powerless to handle the fireworks which Fred and George have set off. Having unsuccessfully tried to charm one of the fireworks away, Umbridge instructs Filch not to use magic against them; Harry is amused by this as he recalls that Filch, being a Squib, can't use magic anyway. Filch's attempt to dispose of a firework by hitting it with a broom is also unproductive, resulting only in a burning broom.

After Easter break, Fred and George become aware that Harry has need of Umbridge's fireplace, which is the only safe route he knows of to contact Sirius. They tell Harry that they are going to set off a diversion at 5PM. Though Hermione repeatedly advises against it, Harry decides to make use of the diversion to talk to Sirius. As he is speaking with Sirius, Harry hears someone entering Umbridge's office; hiding under his Invisibility Cloak, he watches as Filch enters the office and locates the forms to authorize whipping. Following Filch, Harry finds the twins, trapped by Umbridge in the Entrance Hall. Filch presents Umbridge with the necessary paperwork, and the twins, saying that they have had enough formal education, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summon]] their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|brooms]] and depart Hogwarts.

The diversion turns out to be a swamp, which now fills an entire corridor. Umbridge is unable to remove it, and the other teachers seem disinclined to try, so Filch is given the additional duty of taking students to their classes by punt. Additionally, in Fred and George's absence, many students are trying out for the role of chief troublemaker, and the halls are overwhelmingly redolent of dungbombs and stink pellets. Filch, along with Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad, are run ragged trying to catch troublemakers.

Presumably, Filch's life gets somewhat easier once Umbridge is fired, however, we don't hear of him again in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Filch's role in this book is again diminished. We do hear from him that he feels that Umbridge is the best head Hogwarts has ever had; he seems to have forgotten the little matters of the swamp in the fifth floor corridor and the epidemic of dungbombs and stink pellets.

We hear that Filch has imposed a blanket ban on all products of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], and is scanning everyone who goes in and out of the school with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Secrecy Sensor|Secrecy Sensors]]. He scans the Trio as they depart for their first Hogsmeade weekend. As they return, they are following behind [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]], when she is Jinxed by a necklace she is carrying for someone at the school. Harry finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] to help get Katie back to school where she can be helped, and, carrying the necklace, follows. Meeting them at the school entrance, Professor McGonagall relieves Harry of the necklace, giving it to Filch to carry to Professor Snape.

Discussing this later, the Trio wonder exactly what was intended. With Filch scanning everything with his Secrecy Sensor, it is very unlikely that the package would have made it into Hogwarts, much less reached its eventual destination.

As Christmas, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]]'s Christmas Slug Club Party, approach, Harry is the target of a large number of girls angling for invitations to the party from Harry. Hermione warns him to be careful of girls offering him things, they might well conceal [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Love Potion|love potions]]. Harry asks how they could get through Filch's secrecy sensors? Hermione points out that there isn't anything particularly Dark about love potions, and simply concealing them in perfume bottles, a service offered by Fred and George, would be sufficient to hide them.

Harry attends Slughorn's party with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. Halfway through the party, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is dragged in by Filch. Filch had caught him wandering the halls; Slughorn assumes that he was trying to gatecrash his party, and magnanimously invites him to join, to Filch's evident dismay. Draco and Snape, who is also present, very shortly manage to leave the party for a private discussion.

After Ron's birthday, at which he was first dosed with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]]'s love potion, and then poisoned, Harry and Hermione leave the Hospital Wing with Hagrid to allow Ron's family to be with him. Hagrid mentions an angry conversation between Snape and Dumbledore which he had overheard, and Harry and Hermione are pressing him for more information when they are interrupted by the arrival of Filch, who is annoyed at students being out of bed at midnight. Hagrid angrily says that they are with him, a teacher, and as the quarrel starts to get loud, Harry and Hermione escape.

Harry interrupts Draco Malfoy when he is talking to Moaning Myrtle, and Draco retaliates by trying to hit Harry with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus curse]]. Harry, in self defence, casts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]]. He is given detention for using Dark magic, and his detention is to recopy Filch's files that are beginning to deteriorate. These files have been specifically selected by Snape so that they include details of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]]'s wrongdoings.

We do not see Filch again in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

As almost none of the action in this book occurs in Hogwarts, we do not see very much of Filch. His appearance seems to be limited to a single cameo immediately before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|first Battle at Hogwarts]], where, much to his dismay, he is ordered to find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] and bring him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. We are told that he will be supervising the evacuation of the under-age students from Hogwarts, however.

== Strengths ==

Through long residence in the castle, Filch knows pretty nearly everything there is to know about the physical layout of Hogwarts, and he is able to reach any location in the castle, from anywhere, almost immediately. Between himself and Mrs. Norris, Filch seems to be aware of everything going on in the castle, particularly if it is something forbidden.

== Weaknesses ==

Argus Filch is a Squib, a child of wizard parents who has the inability to use magic. Harry discovers this in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] when he spies Filch's &quot;Kwikspell&quot; letter, although he does not understand what that means until Filch says in front of him and Ron, &quot;He knows I'm... I'm a Squib!&quot; Even then, it is only when Ron explains what a Squib is that Harry understands the true significance of the Kwikspell letter and why Filch was so sensitive about it.

His lack of magical ability has made Filch singularly unsuited for almost any work available in the wizarding world; the caretaker position at Hogwarts is likely the only occupation available to him. Seeing this endless parade of wizarding children entering, gaining the skills he will never have, and leaving for a life he can only dream of, has left him bitter. This bitterness expresses itself in the endless restrictions he places upon the students and the powerful desire he has to torture them.

The author has stated that the Kwikspell course does not work for Filch; he is doomed to remain a Squib for all his life.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Argus Filch has a lieutenant, his cat. ''Mrs. Norris'' is described as almost skeletally thin and dust-colored, and is apparently able to detect wrong-doing and report back to Filch, whereupon he appears on the scene to deal with the wrong-doer. She may be a magical cat-like animal known as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]], or like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] she may be a cat / Kneazle crossbreed. While many of the students have expressed a desire to harm Mrs. Norris for reporting their actions to Filch, she has never yet come to harm  by a student. However, she was petrified by the monster from the Chamber of Secrets. Filch was desolated by her absence for the seven months before she was restored.

Filch is perpetually in a bad temper, and many of the deeds that he prosecutes students for are quite minor: he attempts to &quot;write up&quot; Harry for the unforgivable crime of dripping mud on the floor. This over-authoritative adherence to rules, many of which he makes up himself, has made Argus Filch an object of mild derision among the teachers, and widely disliked by the students. 

In Dolores Umbridge, Filch seems to find a kindred spirit: it seems they both hate the students equally, and once she becomes Headmistress, Umbridge seems to be willing to allow Filch to start torturing the students. Filch seldom seems happier than when he is doing Umbridge's bidding.

It has been suggested that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Irma Pince|Irma Pince]] and Argus Filch have a relationship, by many fans, and in fact by Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] in conversation. There is no evidence supporting this relationship anywhere else in the series (other than their standing together at Dumbledore's funeral), though they do seem to share a similar outlook on life and the students.

== Analysis ==

As is so often the case, the author is playing to a certain extent with classical mythology. In this case, the name &quot;Argus&quot; is likely selected from the mythical guardian with a thousand eyes. Given Filch's apparent awareness of all &quot;malfeasance&quot; within the school, this seems quite a reasonable parallel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Real Networking Interfaces''' are the actual physical network connections on a computer. For example, an Ethernet wire or wireless card is a real networking interface.

If an interface is only a tunnel through another interface, then it is a [[../Fake Networking Interface]].

Normally, there is somewhere in the [[../Boot Process/]] that configures network connections. Use the '''ifconfig''' command as root, though some Unix variants have a different command. A common configuration is to do DHCP with '''dhclient''' or '''pump''' command.

It is also possible to route packets between interfaces. This requires configuring the interfaces correctly and making a routing table. A firewall is a good idea.

== Pipes and Redirects ==
{{wikipedia|Pipeline (Unix)}}
{{wikipedia|Redirection (computing)}}
We can connect standard input, output, and error of commands to other commands or to files.

The &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; character is called a ''pipe'' and allows for the output of the command which precedes it to be redirected to the command which follows it (instead of being displayed as standard output).

The &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; character is a &quot;shell redirection feature&quot; and it redirects the output of the command which precedes it to the file whose name follows the said character.  If the file already exists, then the &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; character will cause the file's contents to be wiped out by the new ones being redirected to it.  An alternative is to use the &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &gt;&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; pair of characters which will append the redirected contents to the file instead of wiping out the file's previous contents.

{{-}}

== Job Control ==
You can run multiple commands at once, but only one can be in the foreground. The other commands can be in running at the background or suspended.

Create the shell script &quot;date_loop.sh&quot;
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
while :
do
    date &gt; datefile
    sleep 10
done
&lt;/pre&gt;

(''Note:'' the shell script can be created with Emacs: run '''&lt;tt&gt;emacs date_loop.sh&lt;/tt&gt;''', type in the above script, then press CONTROL-X CONTROL-S to save the script, then CONTROL-X CONTROL-C to quit Emacs.)

Make '''date_loop.sh''' executable:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ chmod +x date_loop.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

Run the command in foreground:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ./date_loop.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wait a while (about 30 seconds) then use CONTROL-Z to 
send '''SIGTSTP''' signal to the process:
&lt;pre&gt;
^Z[2] + Stopped (SIGTSTP)        date_loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Look at the last line of '''datefile''':
&lt;pre&gt;
$ tail -1 datefile; sleep 10; tail -1 datefile
Thu Apr 27 10:46:06 BST 2006
Thu Apr 27 10:46:06 BST 2006
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note, that while the process was ''runnable'', it
was suspended, thus new &quot;times&quot; were not appended
to the file in the 10 second interval between
respective '''tail''' commands.

Put the process into background:
&lt;pre&gt; 
$ bg
[2]     date_loop.sh&amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The process is resumed and '''datefile''' is being
updated again:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ tail -1 datefile; sleep 10 ; tail -1 datefile
Thu Apr 27 10:48:34 BST 2006
Thu Apr 27 10:58:54 BST 2006
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that you can type commands at the command
prompt.

Put the process back into foreground:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ fg
date_loop.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

Send a '''SIGINT'' to the process by typing
&quot;control-C&quot;. This terminates the process.
We confirm that '''datefile''' is not
being updated anymore:

&lt;pre&gt;
^C
$ tail -1 datefile; sleep 20; tail -1 datefile
Thu Apr 27 10:59:55 BST 2006
Thu Apr 27 10:59:55 BST 2006
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Choice of shell==

===Bourne-compatible shells===
All Unix shells are similar, but they have different features. If you are beginning, and you are not aware of the differences between shells, then you probably want to start with a Bourne-compatible, POSIX-compatible shell such as '''bash''' or '''ksh'''.

These are the Bourne-compatible shells:
* '''sh''' is the original ''Bourne shell''. On many non-Linux systems, this is an old shell without the POSIX features. Thus bash and ksh (or even csh and tcsh) are better choices than sh. On some systems though, sh is really the same as bash or ksh.
* '''bash''' is the ''GNU Bourne-again shell''. It is mostly Bourne-compatible, mostly POSIX-compatible, and has other useful extensions. It is the default on most Linux systems. If it is not the default, it is probably installed on Linux, and can also be installed on non-Linux systems.
* '''ksh''' is one of the three:
** ''Public domain ksh'' (pdksh) is Bourne-compatible &lt;ref&gt; pdksh Version 5.2.9 http://www.cs.mun.ca/~michael/pdksh/NEWS &quot;can compile as sh again (--enable-shell=sh).&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; and mostly POSIX-compatible.
** ''AT&amp;T ksh'' was a commercial shell. It has all of the features of pdksh, plus the ksh93 version has several interesting extensions, different from bash. It is licensed under an opensource license since 2005; Mac OS X 10.4 includes it.
** ''mksh'' is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh)
* '''dash''' is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than bash.

===C shell===
BSD introduced the C shell, which sometimes resembles slightly the C programming language. This shell is '''csh'''. The shell '''tcsh''' is csh with more features. These shells are NOT Bourne-compatible. Many of the features were later added to the Bourne-compatible shells (except old copies of sh). When these features work differently in C shell and Bourne-compatible shells, this guide will describe the Bourne-compatible shells.

If csh or tcsh is your default shell, you might benefit by using bash or ksh to get Bourne-compatibility and POSIX features. Some users still prefer the C shell.

===zsh===
There are alternative shells such as '''zsh''', the Z shell. The Z shell boasts extra and unusual features that make it the preferred shell of many. (For example, it has a builtin ftp client!) Though the Z shell is almost Bourne-compatible, it differs in enough ways that its default behaivour is not Bourne-compatible, though zsh is capable of masquerading as a Bourne shell when so instructed.  It can also emulate ksh.

===Temporarily using a different shell===
If you do not like the shell that you are using, you might want to use a different shell such as '''ksh''' or '''bash'''. Shells are normal programs, and can be run easily. The SHELL environment variable will still contain the default shell. The '''exit''' command will return you to the first shell.
 tcsh&gt; '''printenv SHELL'''
 /bin/tcsh
 tcsh&gt; '''bash'''
 bash$ '''printenv SHELL'''
 /bin/tcsh
 bash$ '''exit'''
 exit
 tcsh&gt;

===Permanently changing the default shell===
Find list of shells by looking at &lt;tt&gt;/etc/shells&lt;/tt&gt; (which can be done by executing '''&lt;tt&gt;more /etc/shells&lt;/tt&gt;''').  The command &lt;code&gt;[[w:en:Passwd (command)|passwd -e]]&lt;/code&gt;, on some systems &lt;tt&gt;[[w:en:Chsh|chsh]]&lt;/tt&gt; will prompt for a new shell. To change from &lt;tt&gt;bash&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;tcsh&lt;/tt&gt; one can simply execute &lt;tt&gt;chsh&lt;/tt&gt; which will query the user to enter the [[w:en:Absolute path|absolute path]] to a new shell: 

 $ '''chsh'''
 Password: 
 Changing the login shell for baldur
 Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Login Shell [/bin/bash]: '''/bin/tcsh'''

or the user can specify the shell:

 $ '''chsh -s /bin/tcsh'''
 Password: 

The shell must be specified using its absolute path, which may be found using &lt;tt&gt;which tcsh&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Advanced Bourne shell topics==
There are some important features in the Bourne-compatible shell. This guide does not describe them because the Wikibook for [[Bourne Shell Scripting]] already has several useful chapters:
* [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Redirection]] describes redirection and piping. With redirection, one can connect the standard input and output of commands to files. With piping, one can connect commands into useful chains. '''This is one of the main strengths of Unix. If you only read one chapter, read this one.'''
* [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Substitution]] shows how the special character &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; allows one to embed the values of parameters or the results of commands into the arguments of commands.
* Bourne Shell Scripting/Loops has a useful section on &quot;for loops&quot; which allow the same commands to run repeatedly with different arguments each time.

      <comment>&quot;saved typing&quot; was unclear wording</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Special characters and substitution==
The shell recognizes several special characters. The following are the special characters:
*\ (backslash)
*&quot; (double quote)
*' (single quote)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt; {number sign, pound sign, or hash)
*$ (dollar sign)
*` (tick)
*~ (tilde)
*{ and } (braces or curly brackets)
*( and ) (parentheses)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; (asterisk, star or splat)
*? (question mark)
*&lt; (less than sign)
*&gt; (greater than sign)
*&amp; (ampersand)
*| (pipe)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; (semicolon)
*! (exclamation point or bang)

They are all special characters in the Bourne shell, except for the [[Wiktionary:exclamation|exclamation]] point. However, many Bourne and non-Bourne shells also make special the exclamation point. When the shell sees special characters, it does something more complex than simply running the command that you typed.

Some special characters trigger ''substitution'', when parts of the command are replaced with other text. One common form of substitution is ''filename expansion'', which saves you work when typing longer filenames and lists of filenames.

To test substitution, we need the '''echo''' command. This command simply echoes its arguments (including any changes made to the arguments by the shell). All options except &quot;-n&quot; are ignored.
 $ '''echo -lnQ arg1 arg2 arg3'''
 -lnQ arg1 arg2 arg3

==Quoting==
Quoting is used to preserve the literal meaning of special characters.

Here is an example of several types of quoting, which will be referred to in the rest of this section (there are many unnecessary things in this which you should find after reading this section, but are used for the sake of example):

 $ echo There is \&quot;a small possibility\&quot; that '/etc/*tab' are &quot; not &quot; text and a backslash will not be printed after this. \\
 There is &quot;a small possibility&quot; that /etc/*tab are  not  text and a backslash will not be printed after this. \
===Backslash===
A backslash (\) simply stops the shell from thinking that certain characters are special. In the example above, it was used to print literally the doublequote character.

To print a backslash, use two backslashes in a row.

Now commands that want special shell characters for input will work.

===Paired quoting characters===
Paired characters affect whatever is between them.
====Single quotes====
Single quotes preserve the literal meaning of everything except single quotes.

In the example, single quotes were used to prevent the * from expanding.

Note single quotes can't be within single quotes, even with a preceding backslash.

====Double quotes====
Double quotes are like single quotes, but don't preserve the literal meaning of $, \ when followed by a dollar sign, tick, double quote, or backslash, and `.

In the example, double quotes were used to preserve the literal meaning of spaces.

==Filename expansion==
The ''filename expansion'' is used in avoiding the typing of long lists of files. These characters are used for filename expansion:
 * ? { }

===* and ?===
The ''shell globbing characters'' of * and ? are used to form ''patterns''. The shell searches for existing files that match the patterns and does a subsitution.
* &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; matches 0 or more characters, except /
* &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; matches any 1 character except /

When more than one file is matched, the files are separated by spaces, as separate arguments.

For example, &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ss*&lt;/tt&gt; means all of the files inside the &lt;tt&gt;/etc&lt;/tt&gt; directory which begin with the letters &lt;tt&gt;ss&lt;/tt&gt;. The echo command demonstrates the substitution. The results may differ on your system, depending on what files you have.
 $ '''echo /etc/ss*'''
 /etc/ssh /etc/ssl

The echo command did this because it thinks that you ran &lt;tt&gt;'''echo /etc/ssh /etc/ssl'''&lt;/tt&gt;. The shell ''substituted'' those names for &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ss*&lt;/tt&gt;. Though &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ssh/ssh_config&lt;/tt&gt; exists on many systems, it appeared not above, because &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; never matches &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;.

Now here is something more useful. We will use substitution with a command other than &quot;echo&quot;. We will combine filename expansion with the ls command.
 $ '''ls /etc/ss*'''
 /etc/ssh:
 ssh_config                 ssh_host_key               ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
 ssh_host_dsa_key           ssh_host_key.pub           sshd_config
 ssh_host_dsa_key.pub       ssh_host_rsa_key
 
 /etc/ssl:
 lib          openssl.cnf  private      x509v3.cnf

Notice how the * reduced extra typing. If we did &lt;tt&gt;'''ls /etc/s*'''&lt;/tt&gt;, we would probably further reduce the amount the user needs to type.

Here is an example of the ? character at work:
 $ '''ls /etc/ssh/ssh_host_???_key'''
 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

===When expansion fails===
Sometimes, when using * or ?, no files are found. In this case, the shell does not give an error; it simply does no substitution. Suppose that in the machine on the example above, we make a mistake and typed &lt;tt&gt;/etc/sss*&lt;/tt&gt; which matches nothing. Then the shell would do no substitution:
 $ '''echo /etc/sss*'''
 /etc/sss*

===Curly brackets expansion===
The curly brackets help when typing several similar arguments, especially filenames. The filenames do not need to actually exist. Example:
 $ '''echo /etc/ss{h,l,ssnakes}'''
 /etc/ssh /etc/ssl /etc/ssssnakes

They are very useful for long lists of files in the same directories:
 $ '''echo /bin/{ls,mv,cp} /sbin/{halt,reboot}'''
 /bin/ls /bin/mv /bin/cp /sbin/halt /sbin/reboot

You can also use them to print the alphabet (or numbers):
 $ '''echo {z..a}'''
 z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a

==Contracting==
*Introduction
*Ask about what their main concerns are
*Explain that we will update medical and developmental history since her last visit to genetics
*Doctor will perform physical examination
*We will discuss your concerns and any recommendations we have

==Interim History==
(Follow form, but specifically ask about list of potential health problems located below
Overview)
*Cri du chat is a syndrome that is associated with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5
*French for &quot;cat's cry&quot;
*incidence is 1:50,000 (Van Buggenout ''et al.'', 2000 ) may be as high as 1:20,000 (OMIM)

==Characteristic features==
*usually suspected at birth based on characteristic monochromatic, high-pitched cry
*poor suck, vomiting, failure to thrive, respiratory distress and jaundice present in 60-92%
*microcephaly
*round face
*hypertelorism
*epicanthal folds
*down-slanting palpebral fissures
*low-set ears
*micrognathia
*psychomotor retardation
*high arched palate
**as individuals with 5p deletion get older change of phenotype is noted and it is less striking and harder to diagnose (face lengthens, face becomes &quot;coarse&quot;, prominent supra-orbital ridges, deep-set eyes, hypoplastic nasal bridge, severe dental malocclusion, relatively large mouth, and full lower lip)

==Potential health problems==
*several cardiac anomalies described in a small number of patients (ASD, VSD, tetralogy of fallot and PDA)
*cleft palate (rare)
*gastrointestinal abnormalities include malrotation and Hirschprung disease
*teeth abnormally erupted
*Apnea
*Strabismus
*Minor vision problems
*Gastric reflux
*Chronic constipation (well managed in most cases)
*Colic
*Frequent ear and upper respiratory infections
*Scoliosis
*Sleep disorders
*Saliva control problems (if not resolved during childhood surgery can help correct)
*Minor hearing impairment

==Growth==
*compared with the standard population, most children with cri-du-chat syndrome are small at birth
*as they grow most have significant microcephaly
*weight compromised for age
*slow growth frequently observed
*may be evidence of intrauterine growth retardation

==Life expectancy==
*Difficult to predict
*10% mortality in first year due to respiratory or cardiac complications
*Believed that if no major health problems present life span would be in normal range

==Learning==
*study of 26 children ages 6 yr. 4 mths and 15 yr 5 mths
**moderate to severe learning difficulties and developmental delay are usually observed
**24 were in severe learning disability range
**better receptive than expressive language
*study of seven patients
**6 severe or profound MR
**1 mild MR
*Language comprehension may not be as impaired as language production
*Clear benefit shown in those children that received early intervention services compared to those that did not
**Developed many self-care skills
**Communicate through short sentences, words, signs, or gestures

==Behavior==
*study examined the range, distinctiveness, and correlates of maladaptive behavior in 146 subjects using the Aberrant *Behavior Checklist as a standardized measure
**Hyperactivity was the most significant and frequent problem in the sample
**Subjects also showed aggression, tantrums, self-injurious behavior
**some of these problems were more pronounced in individuals with lower cognitive-adaptive levels, as well as in those with histories of previous medication trials
**Autistic-like features and social withdrawal were more characteristic of individuals with translocations as opposed to deletions, even when controlling for the lower adaptive level of the translocation group
**head banging, hitting the head against body parts, self-biting and rumination are the most frequently occurring behaviours in CCS
**Aggressive behaviour was reported for 88%, with a statistically significant negative correlation between age and the number of aggressive behaviors reported
*Study of 7 older patients most had periods of destructive behavior, self mutilation and aggression
*Other reported behaviors include:
**Repetitive movements
**Obsessive attachment to objects
**Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli
**Feeding and sleeping problems
**Mood disorders

==Genetics==
*85% are sporadic deletions *10-15% are familial (usually parental translocation rarely a familial inversion)
*PARENTAL CHROMOSOMES SHOULD BE DONE SO ACCURATE RECURRANCE RISKS CAN BE CALCULATED
*Gene that makes Delta-catenin (an adherens junction protein involved in cell motility and expressed early in neuronal development)
*delta-catenin maps to a specific region in 5p15.2 that has been implicated in the mental retardation phenotype
*strong correlation between the hemizygous loss of delta-catenin and severe mental retardation

==Genotype-phenotype correlation==
*Patients show phenotypic and cytogenetic variability
*Genotype-phenotype correlation in 62 patients with terminal deletions highlighted a progressive severity of clinical manifestation and psychomotor retardation related to the size of the deletion (Mainardi ''et al.'', 2001). Whereas other study reported no correlation with size of deletion and severity in 50 patients (Marinescu ''et al.'', 1999).
*The analysis of seven patients with interstitial deletions and one with a small terminal deletion confirmed the existence of two critical regions, one for dysmorphism and mental retardation in p15.2 and the other for the cat cry in p15.3
*study lends support to the hypothesis of a separate region in p15.3 for the speech delay
*One family with deletion 5p where breaking point is slightly distal to 15.3 showed only

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cystic Fibrosis'''

==What is CF?==
*Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common inherited diseases, affecting about 1 in 3300 live births in the United States.
*It is most common in Caucasians.
*CF is a complex multisystem disease that affects the respiratory tract, pancreas, intestine, reproductive tract, and hepatobiliary system.
*CF causes many parts of the body to produce thick mucus leading to pneumonia, diarrhea, poor growth, and infertility. This is due to the faulty transport of sodium and chloride within cells lining certain organs.

==Diagnosis==
*The median age at diagnosis is 6 to 8 months; nearly two-thirds of individuals are diagnosed before 1 year of age.
*The diagnosis of CF is established in individuals with one or more characteristic phenotypic features of CF plus evidence of an abnormality in CFTR function based upon ONE of the following:
**Presence of two disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene
**Two abnormal quantitative sweat chloride values
**An abnormal value for the transepithelial nasal potential difference (NPD)
*The sweat test has been the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing CF for more than 40 years.
**It is a diagnostic procedure that determines the amount of sodium and chloride (salt) in the sweat.
**It is painless, relatively inexpensive, and gives definitive answers.
**The test can be performed on individuals of any age.
**A colorless, odorless chemical known to cause sweating is applied to a small area on the arm or leg.
**An electrode is attached to stimulate a weak electrical current to the area. Patients may feel a tingling sensation in the area or a feeling or warmth. This lasts approximately 5 minutes.
**The stimulated area is then cleaned, and sweat is collected on filter paper or in a plastic coil. This is analyzed for increased amounts of sodium and chloride.
*The diagnosis of CF may be made in the absence of phenotypic features of CF in the following circumstances:
**Confirmed diagnosis of CF in a sibling and an abnormal sweat chloride value or presence of the same two disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene as identified in the affected sibling.
**Diagnosis in a newborn screening program.
***As of November 2001, Colorado, Wisconsin and Wyoming offer CF in the newborn screen.
***Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Montana either test in a select population, have a pilot program, or are planning to begin CF newborn screening.
**In utero diagnosis by CFTR mutational analysis.
***10.3% of newly diagnosed patients in 1999 were diagnosed by newborn screening or prenatal diagnosis.

==Prognosis==
*Median survival has increased from 18 years in 1976 to 30.1 years in 1995. Current approximation is 36.5 years (geneclinics.org).
*Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Patients have lower airway inflammation and chronic endobronchial infection, which often progresses to end stage lung disease characterized by extensive airway damage.
*Patients with pancreatic sufficiency (&lt;10%) have a milder clinical course with greater median survival (56 years according to 1995 CFF Patient Registry) as compared to those with pancreatic insufficiency.
*There is a wide variability of disease expression from death in early childhood to patients presenting as young adults with a history of recurrent sinusitis and bronchitis or male infertility.

==Features of CF==
*Intelligence is normal.
*Phenotypic feature of CF may include:
**Chronic sino-pulmonary disease
***Including chronic cough, sputum production, chronic wheeze, obstructive lung disease on lung function test, chronic chest radiograph abnormalities, and digital clubbing.
**Gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormalities
***Such as malabsorption/pancreatic insufficiency, distal intestinal obstructive syndrome, rectal prolapse, recurrent pancreatitis, chronic hepatobiliary disease, failure to thrive, hypoproteinemia, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.
**Infertility
***More than 95% of males with CF are infertile due to azoospermia resulting from altered Wolffian duct structures.
***Most women with CF are fertile, although some have abnormal cervical mucus which may contribute to infertility
**Salt-loss syndrome

==Management==
*Referral to a regional CF center is strongly recommended for individuals with CF.
*Epidemiological data show that patients followed on a regular basis in accredited CF centers have improved clinical outcome.
*Respiratory:
**Patients are regularly followed with pulmonary function studies, chest radiographs, and specific blood and urine tests.
**Intervention to treat or prevent pulmonary complications may include oral, inhaled or I*antibiotics, bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory agents, mucolytic agents, and chest physiotherapy (postural drainage with chest percussion).
*Gastrointestinal:
**Nutritional therapy may include special formulas for infants to enhance weight gain, supplemental feeding to increase caloric intake, and additional fat-soluble vitamins to prevent vitamin deficiencies.
**Pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement.
*Pregnancy:
**With increasingly better pulmonary treatment and improved nutrition, pregnancies today are well tolerated, especially in women with mild to moderate disease.
**The risk for congenital anomalies in the fetus has not been seen to be increased.
**Breastfeeding is possible.
*Gene therapy is in a research phase only and is not able to control or treat the symptoms related to CF at this time.
**U.S. Congress appropriated $40 million to the NIH to establish nine CF gene therapy centers, which will run clinical trials for the development of gene therapy technology.
**Pilot and feasibility studies are currently active at the following gene therapy centers:
***Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York
***Institute for Human Gene Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
***Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland
***University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
***University of Washington, Seattle
***University of Iowa, Iowa City
***University of Alabama at Birmingham.

==Inheritance==
*CFTR gene mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
*Parents of a proband are obligate carriers.
*Carriers are asymptomatic. They have no biochemical or physiologic alterations by which they could be readily identified.
*Siblings of a proband have a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an unaffected carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

==Molecular Study==
*CF's causative gene, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), and its mutations were characterized in 1989.
*The normal gene product of the CFTR gene is a 1,480 amino acid integral membrane protein that functions as a regulated chloride channel in epithelial cells.
**The CFTR gene is 230 kilobases, contains 27 exons, and produces a 6.5 kilobase mRNA product.
*There are over 900 mutations known; almost all are point mutations or small (1-84 bp) deletions and are specific to an affected family.
**The most common mutation is delta F508, which accounts for about 30-80% of mutant alleles depending on the ethnic group.
**There is a panel of 25 CFTR alleles recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics for general population CF carrier screening.
*Mutations in CFTR can affect the CFTR protein quantitatively and/or qualitatively.
*The best correlation between genotype and phenotype occurs in the area of pancreatic sufficiency. The most common mutations have been classified as pancreatic-sufficient (PS) or pancreatic-insufficient (PI).
**Patients with pancreatic sufficiency usually have either one or two PS alleles.
*In contrast, genotype-phenotype correlation is generally poor for pulmonary disease in CF.
*Many mutations are sufficiently rare that genotype-phenotype predictions cannot be made on the basis of empirical studies of populations of patients.

==Population Genetics==
*The CFTR mutation detection rate varies with ethnic background.
*The following chart approximates incidence and carrier frequency by ethnicity:
**Group Incidence Carrier Frequency
**Caucasian 1/3,300 1/28
**Hispanics 1/8-9,000 1/46
**African American 1/15,300 1/61
**Asian Americans 1/32,100 1/90

==Genetic Testing==
*Molecular genetic testing for disease causing mutations in the CFTR gene (7q31) is used:
**To establish or confirm the diagnosis of CF in symptomatic individuals.
**For carrier detection in population screening programs, in at-risk relatives, and their reproductive partners.
**In prenatal testing of at-risk pregnancies and for pregnancies in which fetal echogenic bowel has been identified.
*The GeneTests-GeneClinics Laboratory Directory lists 64 worldwide labs that offer clinical testing for CF.
**This list is not comprehensive because laboratory participation is voluntary.
**There are additional laboratory sites that offer research testing for CF.
*Genzyme Genetics: http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/cf-plus.aspx
**Genzyme has a mutation panel containing 97 of the most common mutations, including those found in diverse ethnic populations or associated with mild disease.
**Many commercial testing facilities offer only the recommended panel of 25 mutations.
**Specimen Requirements:
***1. Blood: ACD-A (yellow-top) or EDTA (lavender-top) tube. Adult: 10 ml whole blood; 30 ml whole blood if ordering multiple tests.
***2. Dried Blood Spot: Dried blood spots collected on Genzyme provided filter paper/test requisition. Fill a minimum of three circles completely with blood. Please Note: If prenatal carrier screening for cystic fibrosis is ordered in conjunction with first trimester screening all six circles should be filled.
***3. Mouthwash: Please Note: Patient should not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum for at least one hour prior to collection. (See specimen kit for detailed instructions). Mouthwash samples can be sent when ordering up to two tests. When ordering more than two tests, blood samples are required. 10 ml of Scope® mouthwash that has been swished vigorously for at least 1 minute. Collect in orange-top 50 ml polypropylene tube. 
***4. Prenatal: Please Note: Call a laboratory genetic coordinator prior to obtaining any specimens. In some circumstances, specimens from other family members may be required. All prenatal specimens (including cord blood) must be accompanied by a maternal blood or mouthwash specimen for analysis of possible maternal cell contamination. Discard first 2 ml; then 15 ml amniotic fluid in 15 ml orange-top polypropylene tube, 10-15 mg chorionic villi in laboratory-provided screw-top tubes with sterile transport medium or 1 T-25 flask of confluent cells. Additional sample must be obtained for back-up culture at one of our cytogenetics laboratories or another facility. If additional testing is desired, more amniotic fluid is needed. For example, chromosome analysis requires an additional 15-25 ml (see Cytogenetics – Amniotic Fluid Chromosome Analysis test page: http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/amniotic-fluid-testing.aspx) and AFAFP requires an additional 2 ml (see Amniotic Fluid Alpha-Fetoprotein - AFAFP test page: http://www.genzymegenetics.com/Our-Services/Reproductive-Testing/afafp-test.aspx).
**Genzyme provides a brief informed consent for DNA testing for the patient: http://www.genzymegenetics.com/For-Clients/informed-consent-forms-reproductive.aspx
*Ambry Genetics Corporation
**On 10/17/01, a press release from Ambry Genetics reported the development of &quot;The Ambry Test: CF, the most comprehensive genetic test analyzing the CF gene.&quot;
**This test is a PCR based assay analyzing exonic and surrounding intronic regions of the patient's genomic DNA.
**Sequence analysis of the full CFTR gene allow for detection of novel mutations.
**As of 01/20/02 Ambry reports having found 64 different mutations, and seven of those are novel variants found in patients with CF.
**The cost is $285, and results are available in 1-4 weeks.
**This test may be useful for patients diagnosed with CF who have received a negative test result from the Genzyme panel analysis.
*CHMCC
**The Children's Hospital has a contract agreement with Genzyme; so standard CF testing is done with them.
**The cost of the blood test is $270, but 60% of that cost is in added charges from the CHMCC laboratory. Genzyme offers the test for $110.
**Blood specimens are typically used for carrier testing; 20 cc of blood in a purple top (EDTA) tube is sent at room temperature.
**Patients can be sent to the test referral center with the Genzyme test requisition form: http://www.genzymegenetics.com/For-Clients/test-requisitions.aspx, and the test referral center will take care of all processing.
**Samples should be drawn on Monday through Wednesday or Thursday before noon.
**Results typically take 2 weeks and are faxed to the lab unless you write in the fax number for the Human Genetics Department.
**The original report is mailed to the referring physician, and the patient is typically phoned with the results.
**Don't forget that the referring physician MUST sign the test requisition form!

==Prenatal Diagnosis==
*Prenatal testing is available for pregnancies at 25% risk in which the disease-causing mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified in both parents.
*It is also available for pregnancies in which fetal echogenic bowel and/or dilated bowel is observed on ultrasound examination.

==NIH Consensus Statement==
*A NIH Consensus Development Conference was held in 1997 to address the issue of genetic testing for CF.
*The conclusion was that genetic testing for CF should be offered to adults with a positive family history of CF, to partners of people with CF, to couples currently planning a pregnancy, and to couples seeking prenatal care.
*The panel did not recommend offering CF genetic testing to the general population or newborn infants.
*They felt that the offering of CF carrier testing should be phased in over a period of time to ensure that adequate education and appropriate genetic testing and counseling services are available to all people being tested.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cystic Fibrosis - Prenatal Diagnosis'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*What are your main reasons for seeking genetic counseling?
*Do you have any particular questions or concerns you would like to discuss?
*Address any immediate concerns or indicate that they will be addressed later during the discussion
*Outline the session including the information they want to know
*First I'll obtain more information about medical and family history to determine if there is anything else that we may want to discuss today
*Then we can discuss cystic fibrosis and answer any questions you have

==Obtain Medical and Family History==

==Review Genes and Chromosomes==
*Sometimes it is helpful to review some basic genetics principles because it is not something most people think about every day.
*Review genes and chromosomes and explain autosomal recessive inheritance
FACTS ABOUT CF

==CF Overview==
*CF is one of the most common inherited diseases (affects 1 in 3300 live births in US)
*occurs in individuals of all races and ethnicities, but is most common in Caucasians
*Due to changes in both copies of a gene that instructs the body about how to make a protein channel that transports sodium and chloride into cells that line certain organs
*These channels are either not made or don't work properly
*This leads to production of thick mucus in the lungs which then leads to an increased risk of infections and pneumonia that may require periods of hospitalization
*It can also cause interference with digestion, which can lead to diarrhea and poor growth
*It also often causes infertility in males and may cause decreased fertility in females

==Features of CF==
*normal intelligence
*features may include
*chronic sino-pulmonary disease: cough, sputum production, wheezing, obstructive lung disease, chronic chest radiograph abnormalities, digital clubbing
*gastrointestinal/ nutritional abnormalities: malabsorption/ pancreatic insufficiency (foul, bulky, fatty stools) distal intestinal obstructive syndrome, rectal prolapse, recurrent pancreatitis, chronic hepatobiliary disease, failure to thrive, hypoproteinemia, fat soluble vitamin deficiencies
*infertility: 98% of males with CF infertile due to unilateral or bilateral agenesis of vas deferens
decreased fertility in females due to abnormal cervical mucus that can contribute to infertility

==Diagnosis==
*median age diagnosed is 6-8 months (2/3 dx before age 1)
*diagnoses established in people with one or more phenotypic features and one of following
*presence of 2 disease-causing mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) gene
*two abnormal quantitative sweat chloride values (the &quot;gold standard&quot;)
*painless, relatively inexpensive, definitive answer)
*abnormal value for the transepithelial nasal potential difference (NPD)
*diagnosis established in absence of phenotypic characteristics when
*confirmed dx of sibling and abnormal sweat chloride value or presence of same two mutations as in the sibling

==Prognosis==
*survival increased from 18 years 1976 to 30.1 years 1995 currently approximated at 33 yrs (geneclinics)
*pulmonary disease major cause morbidity and mortality
*patients with pancreatic sufficiency (&lt;10%) have milder course and greater survival (56 yrs 1995 CFF Patient Registry
*wide variability in disease expression

==Incidence==
*Caucasians 1/2,500
*African-Americans 1/18,000
*Asian Americans 1/90,000
*30,000 affected in US 8,000,000 carriers in US
*carrier rates see chart in visual aids

==CF gene and common mutations==
*located on 7q
*250,000 bp, 27 exons and 1,480 aa's
*functions as a regulated chloride channel in epithelial cells
*over 900 known mutations (most point mut. or small del.)
*genotype/phenotype correlation (both severe and mild mutations)
*delta F508 most common (30-80% of mutations)

==CF Carrier Screening==
*As mentioned CF occurs more frequently in Caucasians than other ethnicities (one in 25,000 Caucasians affected and 1 in 28 are carriers)
*AR inheritance, both parents must be carriers to have child with CF
*a blood test is offered that can determine if an individual is a carrier of CF
*assess whether interested in this testing
*testing at CHMC now offered and screens for 25 of most common mutations
*now CHMC does the panel for ________????
*GENZYME panel of 87
*carrier detection rate with the panel is 90% if of Northern European Descent and 70% if of Southern European descent.
*The 87 mutation analysis by genzyme detects 85-90% of carriers if Caucasian
*cost was $265 when done through CHMC, but sent to genzyme CHMC added on a lab fee
Results take about 2 weeks according to genzyme

==Options for Pregnancy and Future Pregnancies if Both Were Carriers==
*Testing can determine if a fetus is affected before they are born
*Amnio can be performed to test and see if fetus has CF and it is greater than 99% accurate if the mutations that parents carry are known
*Future pregnancies also have option of CVS performed earlier than amnio 10-12 weeks
*Describe if interested
*preimplantation genetic diagnosis-Where they perform genetic testing on embryos obtained using in vitro fertilization techniques. Then only implant those that don't have CVS
*If interested would be important to review costs and success rates

==Review==
*Assess if there are any questions or other concerns throughout the session
*Assess how they feel about carrier testing
*Offer patient literature on CF

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*May be nervous about pregnancy due to earlier loss
*Normalize early losses
*May not know much about partner's history
*Check to determine who she has for support family friends
*Assess their experience with CF and make certain to explain that the symptoms and how affected someone is varies even among family members with same mutation
*May think risk is higher than it is for CF so get a feel for how likely she thinks it is

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cystic Fibrosis - Prenatal Diagnosis'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*Acknowledge any prior contact
*Ask them what they hope to gain from the session
*Do you have any particular questions you would like to discuss?
*Address any immediate concerns or indicate that they will be addressed later during the discussion
*First I'll obtain more information about medical and family history
*Then review CF and discuss family planning options including prenatal testing and PGD

==Obtain Medical and Family History==
*Ask them to describe their experience with receiving a diagnosis of CF in their daughter
*What type of testing did your daughter receive to confirm diagnosis?
*Were the mutations identified?
*Were there any complications with the pregnancy?
*Have you had any other pregnancies?
*I'm going to take a family medical history. Some of the questions I will ask will help us determine if there are any other hereditary disorders that we may want to discuss

==CF==
*You seem to have a lot of experience with CF how do you feel about your chances of having another child with CF?
*Get them to explain their understanding of their risks
*AR inheritance (1 in 4 of having CF and ½ or 50% chance they will be a carrier)
*Any questions about the genetics or biological cause of CF?

==Facts About CF==
(I don't think it will be necessary to review all of this because they probably know more than I do about CF, but this is for my benefit)

==What is it?==
*CF is one of the most common inherited diseases (affects 1 in 3300 live births in US)
*most common in Caucasians
*multisystem disease affects resp. tract, pancreas, intestine, reproductive tract, hepatobiliary system
*causes body to produce thick mucus lead to pneumonia, diarrhea, poor growth, and infertility
*due to faulty transport of sodium and chloride within cells lining certain organs

==Features of CF==
*normal intelligence
*features may include
*chronic sino-pulmonary disease: cough, sputum production, wheezing, obstructive lung disease, chronic chest radiograph abnormalities, digital clubbing
*gastrointestinal/ nutritional abnormalities: malabsorption/ pancreatic insufficiency (foul, bulky, fatty stools) distal intestinal obstructive syndrome, rectal prolapse, recurrent pancreatitis, chronic hepatobiliary disease, failure to thrive, hypoproteinemia, fat soluble vitamin deficiencies
*infertility: 98% of males with CF infertile due to unilateral or bilateral agenesis of vas deferens
decreased fertility in females due to abnormal cervical mucus that can contribute to infertility

==Diagnosis==
*median age diagnosed = 6-8 months (2/3 dx before age 1)
*diagnoses established in people with one or more phenotypic features and one of following
*presence of 2 disease-causing mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) gene
*two abnormal quantitative sweat chloride values (the &quot;gold standard&quot;)
*painless, relatively inexpensive, definitive answer)
*abnormal value for the transepithelial nasal potential difference (NPD)
*diagnosis established in absence of phenotypic characteristics when
*confirmed dx of sibling and abnormal sweat chloride value or presence of same two mutations as in the sibling

==Prognosis==
*survival increased from 18 years 1976 to 30.1 years 1995 currently approximated at 33 yrs (geneclinics)
*pulmonary disease major cause morbidity and mortality
*patients with pancreatic sufficiency (&lt;10%) have milder course and greater survival (56 yrs 1995 CFF Patient Registry
*wide variability in disease expression

==Incidence==
*Caucasians 1/2,500
*African-Americans 1/18,000
*Asian Americans 1/90,000
*30,000 affected in US 8,000,000 carriers in US
*carrier rates see chart in visual aids

==CF gene and common mutations==
*located on 7q
*250,000 bp, 27 exons and 1,480 aa's
*functions as a regulated chloride channel in epithelial cells
*over 900 known mutations (most point mut. or small del.)
*genotype/phenotype correlation (both severe and mild mutations)
*delta F508 most common (30-80% of mutations)
**Later on we will be discussing what testing is available for family planning and CF testing. This same prenatal testing can detect some birth defects and chromosomal abnormalities also.

==Explanation of Advanced Maternal Age==
*As women get older their risk for having a baby with a change in chromosome number increases. There is no magic age at which a woman goes from no risk to high risk. However, at age 35 the risk is considered high enough to offer some standard testing options that we will discuss today.
*Explain chromosomes and genes
*Explain nondisjunction
*Briefly describe the common trisomies (21 (Down Syndrome), 18, 13, 47XXY)
*Chance of having a baby with one of these chromosomal changes increases with maternal age

==Chromosome abnormalities==
(Details I won't go into very much again fro my benefit) 
*Explain nondisjunction
*This mistake that occurs in cell division is a random chance event that does not run in families
*Although it is a random event, it does occur more often as a woman gets older
*When there is an extra copy we call it trisomy because there are three copies instead of the usual two copies
*Any time there is extra genetic material there are changes in the way the fetus grows and develops

==Down Syndrome==
*The most common type of trisomy is called Down Syndrome or trisomy 21 because it is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21
*You mentioned a distant cousin with Down syndrome-- how familiar are you with this condition?
*Children with Down syndrome are all unique, but often have distinguishable physical characteristics that you might recognize.
*They are all mentally retarded and this is most often mild to moderate
*They also often have heart defects and are at an increased risk for some other specific medical concerns

==Trisomy 18, 13==
*Two of the other common trisomies are trisomy 18 and 13.
*Children with these conditions are more severely affected than those with Down Syndrome.
*They usually have a variety of birth defects and are severely mentally retarded.
*Many miscarry and those that are born often do not live past 1 year of age

==Other chromosome abnormalities involving the sex chromosomes==
*Other chromosome abnormalities that you may be at an increased risk for involve the sex chromosomes
*Babies can have an extra copy of one of the sex chromosomes and sometimes you can't even tell
*They may have learning disabilities.
*They don't have increased risks for severe medical complications, but may be infertile.

==Age Related Risks==
*Age related risks (refer to chart in visual aids)
**Age 38 risks
**Live born baby with Down Syndrome 1 in 189 or 0.53%
**Live born with chromosomal abnormality 1 in103 or 0.97%
**chance of having a liveborn child with normal chromosomes is 99.03%

==Prenatal Testing Options==
*2 are diagnostic tests (CVS and amniocentesis) which will tell you with nearly 99.7% certainty if the fetus has one of the chromosomal changes discussed and almost 100% certainty whether the fetus has CF
*Ultrasound will help in determining the overall development of the major organs and can show some birth defects (may show fetal echogenic bowel and/or dilated bowel which can be an indication of CF)

==Chorionic Villus Sampling Overview==
*Often referred to simply as CVS
*CVS is a technique in which a sample of placental tissue is obtained
*The little fingerlike projections of the placenta that are sampled are called chorionic villi
*The villi are derived from the same original cells as the fetus so these cells should have the same genes and chromosomes as the fetus and we can look at the chromosomes in these cells and detect the chromosomal abnormalities discussed earlier
*CVS is performed between 10 and 12 weeks gestation
*CVS has been around since 1983 in US

==Amniocentesis Overview==
*Have you heard about amniocentesis?
*It is a simple medical procedure that is usually performed after 15 weeks gestation that is used to rule out many chromosomal abnormalities including the ones we just discussed that you are at increased risk for
*A small sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby is taken
*Within the fluid are skin cells that have been sloughed off by the baby.
*These cells can be grown in a lab and then the chromosomes can be looked at

==Amniocentesis VS. CVS==
*Review visual aid that compares the two procedures on timing, risk, accuracy etc.

==What Information These Procedures Can Provide==
*determine if the fetus has one of the chromosomal abnormalities we discussed with &gt;99% accuracy for amnio and 98-99% accuracy for CVS
*DNA obtained from the sample can also be used to test for CF with almost 100 % accuracy
*determine the babies sex if you would like to know.
*The fluid obtained during an amnio also used to test for open neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida, but CVS can't (should have blood test)
**Spina bifida is where the spinal cord didn't form properly and nervous tissue is exposed
**It can cause motor impairments along with other health concerns
**Risks for these do not increase with age, but it is tested for at the same time and the test is able to detect 99% of ONTD's (if measuring AFP and acetylcholinesterase)
*CVS does not test for NTD's Therefore it is recommended that a woman has a blood test at about 16 weeks to determine if the fetus is at increased risk for a neural tube defect

==Limitations==
*Most birth defects cannot be detected by amnio or CVS. (Amnio can detect about 10% of birth defects including the ones we discussed).
*For example cleft lip, cleft palate, congental heart defects, small chromosomal abnormalities, and many types of mental retardation will not be detected.
*Doesn't routinely test for other heritable disorders unless ordered specifically
*Most women tested receive news that their child doesn't have chromosomal abnormalities but it doesn't guarantee a healthy baby. (3-5 out of every hundred babies has a birth defect).

==There are some risks associated with the procedures==
*.5% additional risk for pregnancy loss with amnio (1 out of every 200 women who have an amnio will have a miscarriage that is due directly to the procedure) 1% with CVS These risks are above the baseline risk of miscarriage that all women have.
*Life threatening problems to the mother are extremely rare
*Infection can occur but rare (less than 1 in 1,000 women)
*Blood group sensitization (Rh - mothers will receive RhoGam following procedure)
*Routine amnio is not associated with increased risks of birth defects in the fetus
*Scarring of the baby is possible but is thought to be very uncommon
*Extremely low risk of uterine infection
*Some studies reported a possible risk of limb defects with CVS while other studies have not. Most of the defects were noted if the procedure was performed before 10 weeks because the limbs develop between 4-10 wks. If there is an increased risk it is about 1 in 3000.
*Risks are lower if the physician is highly experienced
*There is a very small chance of lab error and the need to repeat the procedure
*CVS has higher risk of error 1-2%

==Reasons some women choose CVS==
(This is a personal decision and each woman places different emphasis on the things that are important to her)
*Permits termination at earlier gestational age
*1st trimester and people often don't know that she is pregnant
*Early termination has been reported to be easier emotionally and physically
*Allows treatment for a fetus with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (CAH) autosomal recessive condition in which shots of dexamethosone can be given
*They want reassurance that the fetus does not have a chromosomal abnormality

==Reasons some women choose amniocentesis==
*Lower risk of pregnancy loss 0.5% instead of 1%
*Results are slightly more accurate &gt;99% compared to 98-99%
*Offers detection of open neural tube defects (90-96%)
*However, a maternal blood test (MSAFP) can be performed later in pregnancy (14-22 wks) and will detect 85% of open NTD's
*Procedure is easier and more hospitals perform it
*With CVS there is a greater likelihood of needing further testing due to
**Laboratory failure
**Maternal cell contamination
***Frequency 1.9%
***Not problematic for cytogenetics, can be for DNA or biochemical testing
***Can be detected by DNA analysis using a maternal blood sample
**Mosaic or ambiguous results
***Presence of two or more groups of cells that differ in their chromosome make up
***Occurs in 1-2% of CVS samples
***less concerning in CVS than amnio because the placental cells are more distantly related they split off from the cells in the embryo early on so fetus might not share same genetic make up
**Insufficient sample
*They want reassurance that the fetus does not have a chromosomal abnormality

==Reasons some women choose not to undergo either procedure==
*They don't want to take that added risk of miscarriage
*They are more anxious about the procedure than they are about having a child with a chromosomal abnormality
*They feel comfortable not knowing if there is one of these problems until they deliver the child
*They don't feel a need for reassurance and would not abort the fetus regardless of the result
*Moral or religious views

==Detailed description of the amnio procedure==
(I WON'T go into this much detail)
*Spend more time on the procedure details if she is interested or if needed to make an informed decision
**The entire procedure from when you arrive to when you leave will last about 20-45 minutes and you can return home after it is completed
**Some physicians require you to have a full bladder
**Abdomen is cleaned and sterilized
**A local anesthetic is often given to numb the outer layers of skin (this is similar to the shot your dentist uses)
**Ultrasound is used before and during the procedure to visualize where the baby is and find a pocket of fluid.
**A needle about the width of a needle used to draw blood, but longer (3&quot;) is inserted through the abdomen into the uterus and amniotic sac.
**The needle may seem long but it is the width that is felt
**The needle is only in for one or two minutes while amniotic fluid is drawn up through it.
**Most women report that the needle insertion is not as painful as they had expected, but that there is some discomfort.
**Some report a stinging sensation when the needle first enters the skin
**Some report that they feel a sharp pain or a contraction as the needle enters the uterus.
**Others describe it as feeing similar to blood draw.
**Some experience a sensation of pressure in their lower abdomen as the fluid is drawn up through the needle.
**It is also common for women to report some minor uterine cramping (similar to menstrual cramps) during and/or after the procedure.
**Usually the first little bit of fluid is discarded because it might have some of your cells mixed in.
**The sample will be about 20cc or 1-2 tablespoons. This fluid is quickly replaced by the baby.
**The babies heart is monitored by U/S after the procedure

==What to expect and do after the amnio==
*Mild cramping is common
*Spotting occurs in a small percentage of women
*After the test avoid strenuous activities for 24 hours
*Call the doctor immediately if you experience any of the following:
**severe and persistent abdominal pain and cramps
**vaginal bleeding
**vaginal leakage of amniotic fluid
**anything that seems unusual
*The results will be available in about 1.5 to 2 weeks

==Description of CVS==
*There are two ways the procedure can be performed: Transcervical and Transabdominal
*Contraindications for both types include:
**Active vaginal bleeding (must have stopped at least 1 week ago)
**Rh sensitization (if already sensitized) if not sensitized Rhogam given to Rh negative women to prevent sensitization
**Maternal bleeding disorder
**Fibroids not avoidable
**Multiple gestation? (usually not attempted)
*Transcervical
**Procedure is similar to a pap smear
**Vagina and cervix are cleaned
**Under the visual guidance of ultrasound, a thin tube (catheter) inserted through the vagina, cervix, and into the placenta
**Once the catheter is in place a syringe is attached
**Suction is applied to remove the villi while the catheter is removed
**After the sample is obtained it is viewed under a microscope to be sure the size and quality is sufficient and another sample is not needed
**Sample is placed in a tube of tissue culture medium and sent to a lab for testing
**Most women report minimal discomfort during the procedure although it varies
**The actual procedure only takes about 5 minutes
**The baby's heart beat will be monitored
**Bleeding occurs in up to 10% of women
**(Easiest to perform with posterior placenta close to cervix)
**(Contraindications for transcervical CVS include: cervical polyps, overly curved sampling pathway, active genital herpes or other infections)
**(Large sample is obtained including whole villi)
*Transabdominal
**Abdomen is cleansed and xylocaine injection is given to numb the upper layers (similar to shot given at the dentist)
**Using ultrasound as visual guidance, spinal needle is guided through the abdominal wall, uterine wall, and into the placenta
**Once in place a syringe is attached to supply suction
**While suction is supplied the needle is moved back and forth through the placenta
**After sample is obtained it is viewed to make sure there is enough and another sample is not required
**Sample is then placed in a tube of tissue culture medium and sent to a lab for testing
**There is a wide range of responses when it comes to how women report the procedure felt. When the needle is inserted it may burn for a few seconds. Women report everything from mild cramping to painful, heavy cramping.
**The actual procedure takes about 5 minutes
**The heartbeat of the fetus will be monitored
**Bleeding is rare
**Contraindications for transabdominal CVS include: interceding bowel, the placenta is too far from the maternal abdominal surface (obesity)
**(Easiest to perform with anterior or fundal placenta)
**(Smaller sample size (pieces of the villi) obtained)
**(Can be performed after 12 weeks, but usually only if there is not enough amniotic fluid for an amniocentesis)

==Recommendations for after the procedure==
*No exercise or strenuous activity for 24 hours
*No sexual intercourse, douching, tub baths, or tampon use for 72 hours
*Notify the OB in any of the following occur:
**Fever greater than 100.4 degrees F
**Heavy bleeding or cramping
**Amniotic fluid leakage
*Return for follow up ultrasound (if that is standard practice)
*Blood test (MSAFP) at 16-18 weeks to check for NTD's
*Ultrasound is recommended at 18-20 weeks

==Test Results==
*Results will be available anywhere between 1-2 weeks depending on which lab it is sent to (Genzyme 7 days, CHMC about 2 weeks)
*More than 95% of women receive reassuring news
*Remind them that sometimes further follow-up testing is needed
*Ask them how they would like to receive their results and if they want to know the sex of the fetus

==Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis==
*Performed at only few centers in US
*Closest is Regional Genetic Institute in Chicago
*First attempt in 1989
*Can be used to detect any genetic condition for which there is a sufficient sequence information
*Can detect common aneuploidies and translocations
*As many as 40 PGD centers have been established in 17 countries
*By this time, these centers performed approximately 3,000 clinical cycles, resulting in more than 500 pregnancies (over 20% pregnancy rate), and the birth of nearly 300 healthy children.
*More than two thirds of these clinical cycles were performed in USA, from which the largest number (1,200 cycles) was contributed by RGI. This resulted in 250 pregnancies and birth of approximately 200 healthy children
*At present, RGI (Chicago) is the only center in the world offering Preimplantation Diagnosis by sampling the first and second polar bodies.
*he first polar body is discarded during oocyte maturation, prior to fertilization and contains one set of duplicated chromosomes
*the second polar body is discarded after fertilization and contains one set of chromatids
*test the polar bodies for genetic disease to determine if egg has mutation
*offered to couples who are known carriers of genetic diseases detectable by DNA analysis
*RGI physicians have already performed over 100 clinical cycles involving preimplantation diagnosis many genetic diseases including CF
*diagnosis of Down syndrome and other common aneuploidies
*analysis of the chromosome number (13, 16, 18, 21) in both the first and second polar body by FISH
*Only embryos resulting from the fertilization of eggs with normal number of these particular are transferred
*patients may choose which embryos they wish to be transferred or frozen. The procedure has been offered to over 600 IVF couples
*resulted in 131 births of healthy children and dozens ongoing pregnancies confirmed to be unaffected by CVS or amniocentesis
*Preimplantation diagnosis via blastomere biopsy is also performed for other specific disorders involving paternal genes or sex selection for X-linked disorders and if doing IVF cycle outside of
*Cost (probe development $1,000, PGD for one cycle $3,000, IVF one cycle $7,500 IVF meds $2,000-$4,000, cost to send embryologist to your IVF center $2,000 Total $13,500-$17,500 per cycle

==Review==
*Assess if there are any questions or other concerns throughout the session
*Assess again how she feels about the test options
*Offer patient literature (already sent according to chart note)

      <text xml:space="preserve">added a section about the reverse predicate. hopefully I will add an alternative and much better implementation later.
-sgt

Other exercises that could be added: 
* sorting a list (many possible solutions, of course)
* finding permutations of a list
* finding the highest or lowest value in a list of numbers
* flattening a list (i.e. turning [[1,2],[3,[4]]] into [1,2,3,4]
I'll do some of these soon if I have time... -[[User:MatrixFrog|MatrixFrog]] ([[User talk:MatrixFrog|talk]]) 07:32, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
: While these would be great exercises, we should remember that this is a very early chapter and most readers will not be comfortable enough with prolog to do all of these. We haven't even explained cuts yet. I think most of these would be better suited to a later section of the book. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 21:33, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

== Length ==
The definition of length is horribly wrong. ''(by 83.104.248.190, [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]))''

== Changes by 83.104 ==
I've reverted the rewrite of ''11:13, 6 September 2008'' by ''83.104.248.190'', as I disagreed with nearly all of it. It removes a lot of essential explanation of structure and terminology, necessary to read other texts about prolog. As an example. A list in prolog isn't just a list like java's list, it's  the primary way of dealing with collections of objects (rather more like java's array, other collections are constructed from it). Just saying &quot;this is how you do a list&quot; neglects the point of what lists are and why they're necessary. If you explain don't that you need them, starting to talk about lists as if the reader should already know about it will confuse people. I have similar reservations about most of the other changes. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 21:29, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

I've reverted your revert because the article was made considerably worse by doing so. If you want to add or clarify explanation do so. Do not revert to a definition of length/2 that uses is/2 because this is not acceptable Prolog code. Prolog lists are not like java, drawing an analogue with java is unhelpful.

:It was harsh of me to simply revert your edits. Sorry about that. I have now edited some specific points. Regarding the first line;  you say &quot;prolog lists are not like java&quot;, I say the exact same thing in my comment (seriously, read it again). What I mean is that there are certain things that you want from a language when you come into it fresh. You want to do arithmatic, you want to control flow, you want to store values, and you want to store collections of values. Prolog may turn all these things completely on their head, but these are the expectations that users have when they start learning prolog. We need to say this is how you store multiple values. &quot;This is how you do lists&quot; just suggests that it's some functionality for handling ordered collections of values, but it is in fact, the only way to handle collections fo values. Wether you want sets, or maps or dictionaries, you'll have to use lists. That's the analogy to java's array's
:I would also ask you to keep in mind (I do hope you'll continue editing the book) that we're writing for people new to prolog and possibly new to the world of computer science as a whole. Using words like &quot;nondeterminism&quot; and &quot;base case&quot; will confuse anybody without some sort of academic background, unless we've explained them properly. On that note, your definition of length, using succ may be technically better, but the succ predicate hasn't been introduced yet. In fact no builtin predicates have been introduced at this point, and the reader who's just started learning prolog three days ago can hardly be expected to know about succ. (Granted, the math behind L is L1 + 1 hasn't been introduced yet either, so maybe it should be moved to the next chapter). Could you perhaps show the original answer first, then explain why it's not perfect and why the reader should use succ instead? Thanks. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 14:53, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

::Indeed. &quot;succ&quot; has not been introduced yet. I solved the excercise as follows:
       &lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
       mylength([],0).
       mylength([_|Xs], CplusOne) :- mylength(Xs, C), CplusOne is (C+1).
       &lt;/source&gt;

== Is listsplit still a valid rule? ==

I'm running through this tutorial right now. When I tried the listsplit command, I got an &quot;Undefined procedure&quot; error on SWI Prolog. Is listsplit still a standard Prolog command? (I'd remove it myself, but as I'm just learning, I'm not completely sure that listsplit is wrong, and I wouldn't know what to replace it with ): ) [[Special:Contributions/129.93.5.129|129.93.5.129]] ([[User talk:129.93.5.129|discuss]]) 05:26, 8 December 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Developmental Delay and Mental Retardation'''

==Etiology==
*Cause unknown in about 50% of cases
**Often multifactorial with genetic and environmental components
**Low birth weight, prematurity, and perinatal complications may be associated - not known if they cause mental retardation or if factor causing these problems also caused MR
*Approximately 2000 known genetic causes
**Chromosomal abnormalities
**Metabolic or endocrine disorders
**Hereditary degenerative disorders
**Hormonal deficiency
**Hereditary syndromes or malformations
*Acquired causes
**Prenatal: infection, irradiation, or exposure to toxins
**Perinatal: prematurity, anoxia, cerebral damage, or infection
**Postnatal: brain injuries, anoxia, poisons, hormonal deficiencies, metabolic dysfunction, postimmunization encephalopathy, sociocultural, kernicterus, epilepsy
*In United States, 1-3% of people meet cognitive and functional criteria

==Clinical Features==
*It is a, medical and mental, developmental disorder
*Affects developmental and cognitive abilities
**Substantial limitations in functioning
**IQ scores below 70
***Mild MR: IQ range 50-55 to 70
***Moderate MR: IQ range 35-40 to 50-55
***Severe MR: 20-25 to 35-40

I am willing to help a bit on this book. But you just gotta double-check the things I write :)
--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:39, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

:In general, I hate to &quot;write for the test&quot;, but in this particular case I would like to know what the specific curriculum requirements are for an AP Computer Science course.  If you (or somebody else) can help dig these up, it would go quite a bit further to try and put something like this together.  I've had my own thoughts on the subject about what a high school AP class on Computer Science ought to have in it, but the testing requirments for the AP exam would also require a certain &quot;standarization&quot; of what should be taught as well.

:In addition to the specific requirements of the AP exam, it should also be something like a CS 101 class, or more like a CS 150 (intro to Computer Science for CS major freshmen... the 101 class is usually abused as a general-education &quot;Here is a computer&quot; class).  This is something I would be not only willing to fact check, but add content to as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:03, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Good Idea.

Here is the PDF file for the syllabus
http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_compscia.html?compscia

Quite Frankly, when I took this exam I learned totally from researching online and checking the syllabus to see what I needed to learn. School System sucks... my class was 2 classes at once, one for CompSci A and the other was CompSci AB... basically, the teacher taught enough for the CompSci A students but I was planning on AB so he just gave me the syllabus and some online material to teach myself. IMO, too much to expect a teacher to teach 2 classes in 1 period o.O. Anyway, it is possible to learn without a book on this subject; but it probably would have been a great help if I had one :)

I suggest taking the outline directly from the syllabus, and appending the AB section to the end of chapters.
--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 07:07, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

:I took a look at the PDF file.  I forgot that AP Computer Science uses Java.  Yuck.  I think Java stinks as an introductory language, and encourages sloppy programming styles that would have to be later unlearned in the work environment.  Java has its strong points, but it is not a teaching language.  Still, if it the &quot;language of choice&quot; on the AP exam I guess it is going to have to be used.  Once you learn one programming langauge the others are fairly easy to pick up as well, although if '''I were the one''' to design the cirriculum I would perhaps encourage some time to explore other programming languages as well like LISP or LOGO (to name a language ''designed'' to be an introductory learning langauge).  BASIC is a better language environment, but is unfortunately too non-standard in all of its current dialects to be useful.  C# is a better compromise for an introductory langauge, but I can see the political motivations behind not using it as well.

:Enough of my own opinions on the choice of language.  We need now to establish an outline for the textbook and to try and come up with a chapter structure for this book.  Another issue to debate is the tone of the book and the &quot;point of view&quot; from a literary sense.  One of the best &quot;textbooks&quot; on computer science I ever read was written from a 1st person point of view, where the author talked to you like a casual chat but going over the course in a step-by-step fashion with plenty of examples.  This is surprisingly very difficult to accomplish, which is why it isn't often done.  I also think that a de-emphasis of the language features should occur with a stronger emphasis on programming concepts instead.

:I also think that GUI design should be introduced very early, perhaps even from the start.  This requires a strong well written GUI-IDE, and in this case it should also be &quot;free&quot; as in GPL'd if possible that we are working from.  Here is the reasoning for this approach:  Almost all programming done today is through using graphical interfaces.  It is a very rare programmer that '''in the Real World&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt; tm&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''' actually writes a command-line interface program.  A good IDE makes writing the traditional &quot;Hello World&quot; applet as a GUI application just as easy (or even easier than) writing the same program as a command-line application, at least for a beginner.  All of the current students are familiar with GUI programs anyway, so why not simply let them be creative and let them experiment with check boxes, lists, buttons, and graphical images and logos.  Working from a command line is an alien experience and something that they are not going to be used to using at all.  Generally speaking the command-line first approach is used because the author of the books that cover it don't understand GUI programming and are old-school programmers who hate modern IDEs.  All of this is of course my opinion and you can have any other opinion on the matter as well.

:I also think that the typical examples are incredibly lame.  Using the &quot;traditional&quot; object called &quot;point&quot; is something that needs to be thrown out completely.  These are kids we are talking about, not some engineer who is building an embedded system for a trans-continental pipeline.  Use examples that at least somewhat relate to current teen culture, or at least teen geek culture.  Yes, they may be on the AP exam, and we need to throw some lame stuff there as well just to not throw them for a loop when the exam takes place, but let's keep it exciting and something the kids can associate with as well.

:These are some initial thoughts.  I'll add more later.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:32, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

:: Slightly off topic: Was that book from 1st person perspective ''C++: A Dialog'' ? Yeah, that was an awesome book.

:: I agree, we need some serious examples of polymorphism... not the good old animal tree where Dog is Mamal is vertabrate is blah blah blah... Heck, I'd consider that bad programming right there. (IMO, long inheritance chains are poor programming practice... granted, &quot;long&quot; is ambiguous definition but whatever). Additionally, I see many beginners make the giant mistake of using classes for everything. (There was this one case where my friend attempted to create a different class for every single &quot;Magic the Gathering&quot; card). I feel that bad examples should complement the good examples; every good example should have a bad example next to it.

:: A good example of inheritance I found is from playing video games. Class Gun, subclass AK47... Provide examples where you can pickup any kind of gun, and you can only hold 2 &quot;guns&quot; at a time. Etc. Etc. My friends seem to understand video games much more, and it would be more interesting to have a book aimed at creating a very basic video game than it is for a classic CS book. Several books that I liked involved creating a program slowly with the knowledge you build up... I'd prefer that perspective over a Dialog Perspective.

:: Additionally, I say we explain the algorithms with pictures. Beginner programmers need to learn the logic of programming more than syntax; additionally, they think 20 lines of code is enormous. Additionally, I never was a fan of Java myself :)

:: Specific ideas for the &quot;project&quot; perspective:
*** Robocode robots-- although, we'd spend more time saying wtf an AI is rather than programming algorithms.
*** Shoot them Up galaga style-- Reletivly simple game, and should have an example of all data structures and stuff required to create the game.
*** MBCS-- use the project that supposed to be explained in the course :-/ Trust me on this, the designers of the course messed up big time here. Who cares about fishes?? Too bad 25% of the test is dedicated to it.

::: Actually, Now I think this should be in the [[Wikiversity]], computer science section. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

::::I do want to clarify a little bit about Wikiversity.  The mission and scope of Wikiversity are being redefined at the moment, and while getting a community together about a topic is part of that mission, the actual textbooks should be kept here on Wikibooks.  At least that is the current direction that seems to be happening.  That we should have this Wikibook listed with Wikiversity is of no doubt, and feel free to '''be bold''' and add it there, even in the current state of this book. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:51, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

I think I like the direction this books is going, and we certainly can work together.  I love the idea of using &quot;robocode&quot; in somewhere.  Variations of something like C-robots, or writing a plug-in class that controls I/O signals of a robot is a really cool idea, where we supply the GUI interface and the student merely needs to write the AI for the robots.  Good game AI writing is something that can teach a whole bunch of valuable programming techniques, has &quot;instant&quot; feedback to the student including bragging rights (&quot;my robot is better than yours&quot;), and can be done both by rank amature programmers and can still be a challenge for advanced students that perhaps shouldn't even be in the AP class at all.

The same goes for designing a game.  I actually taught a class where I taught classes by implementing a simple tiled graphic game like Final Fantasy or Elfland, where a group of objects like weapons, monsters, and terrain types were set up as classes.  One of the interesting aspects of that session was not so much the game itself (that was a fun topic and attracted the interest of the students), but the process that all software design teams have to go through when designing more than a simple example program.

I went through and actually started writing a software architechture document together with the students, trying to specify what in fact the game would do.  We debated various concepts for the game, strategies for putting the software together, and in abstract even what kinds of objects we would be working with.  In short, it turned out just like the dozens of software design meetings I've had with real developers, including donuts, lame jokes, and strong opinions coming from sometimes unusual participants to include or exclude a certain idea.  We spent about 6 hours not actually doing any programming, but doing software design from a planning perspective.  This is something that is very rarely if ever actually taught in any programming class except by a very good Software Engineering professor, and that is an upper-division college class at that.  I think you can spend a chapter going over the concept in a high school textbook in a simplified form, and it teaches good habits from the beginning.  Even for students who don't become CS majors nor programmers later on in life, it would be good for them to see what real life engineering meetings can be like and what the difference is between a mere hacker and a real engineer, and why engineering design matters.  Classic engineering horror stories like the &quot;Galloping Girdy&quot; Tacoma-Narrows bridge in Washington state, the Ford design of the 1970's Pinto that killed thousands of people, or even the design of the Space Shuttle Challenger; could be brought up as examples of how lousy engineering design does affect even ordinary people and some of the real world headaches that come from lack of planning.  I can think of many software projects in particular where millions or even billions of dollars get spent and the project is eventually written off.

I also know from experience that if you are learning a programming language, it really helps to focus your attention if you have a need for the programming concepts you are learning.  This is where I think having a large major project that is expected to be written by the students during the term together with a series of short traditional program stubs to experiment with programming concepts should be used together.  The large project should be collaboratively written as well, so introducing concepts like version control, signing up for modules, bug reports, module stubbing, and software testing concepts could also be dealt with.  Particularly for the AP Computer Science AB course this should be implemented.  To help assist teachers new to this concept, several different kinds of suggested projects should be offered.

I know this is a huge project I am recommending.  This can be, I think, a very good survey course for computer science.  High School students can be taught how to do more than just balance their checkbook with their computer (a lousy application of computers if I ever saw it), but can be given a glimpse into real software engineering to whet their tastes or convince them that there is much more involved than what is demonstrated poorly by Hollywood movies of what programmers in real life do.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:51, 29 November 2005 (UTC)


: I agree with all that you said. I know for a fact that I'm struggling trying to keep hold a project. As said before, I'm still a student... I know the theory but no practical &quot;engineering&quot; aspect of programming. I would love to have had engineering straight at the beginning of my CS course. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

: I also think that this book/course could be a good jump start on the Wikiversity. Easily, it is one practical goal that an E-community can actually aim for. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

== Nice Job on the outline ==

But it isn't AP computer science :) This is more and more feeling like the ideal course for wikiversity, and maybe we shouldn't be aiming at AP computer science. Lets ditch the title and go for just simply &quot;Into to Computer Science&quot; and use whatever language we want. How bout that? We need such a book in the wikiversity anyway--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

Oh, and I'm not saying &quot;stop the book&quot;, I'm saying, lets change titles, change direction, and aim at that big picutre you want. But we need to start from the beginning, change everything to what we need idealy.

I say ditch Java, go for Python or (Dr.) Scheme. Both have GUIs avaliable in some sort of way. Python has more applicable software engineering stuff in it (it is OOP, Scheme is functional, so we can't teach OOP in scheme as well as in Python). Both seem to be cleaner than Java however, so its a toss up on the CS side of things.

Again, we need a textbook on Computer Science before starting wikiversity, so this should probably be the starting place. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

:Interesting thought.  I'm not as conversant in using Python as other languages, but from what I've seen it may be a much better intro language.  If you don't mind the plug and tie in with Microsoft, [http://www.sharpdevelop.com/ Sharp Develop] (or #Develop as it is called) is a very nice tool that is also a nice GPL'd GUI interface.  This is also the framework that Monodevelop is being modeled after and I think is an outstanding IDE for beginners.

:As for ditching the AP aspect, I think it would still be useful to follow it somewhat as a guide, and try to make sure that we at least include all of the topics that the AP test recommends.  We could also try to dig up the ACM/IEEE Computer Science ciriculum recommendations to make sure this &quot;course&quot; will at least meet those basic objectives.

:Most high quality AP courses that I've been privileged to be associated with (I spent a little bit of time recently as a substitute High School teacher) usually used college-level textbooks anyway.  As I said earlier, I want to de-emphasis the language issue anyway, and we can even have multiple (computer) langauge versions available as well through transclusion of text and some very minor rewrites where language specific features are emphasized.  Just for kicks it would be fun to have an intro to Computer Science...Intercal version. (I'm not being too serious here though).  Most intro classes are very heavy into teaching syntax, and I think that is a huge mistake.  We are teaching theory about computers, not just how to be a junior programmer for the rest of your life.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:51, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:: That would be fine. How about sticking with a language angostic textbook, akin to TAOcp? Algorithms can be easily described through pictures/animation, words, and simple english sentences. Such a class is being discussed in the wikiversity right now; it would be too hard to stop edit wars for &quot;my pet language&quot;, and if we are making a general CS textbook, we shouldn't need a language anyway. We just beef up the prerequisites to &quot;Know at least 1 programming language&quot; and volia. Examples can be written in different languages as people go in. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

::: Ahh, scratch that. I don't see it possible :) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 12:21, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== Development Environments ==

I'm now looking for some base development environments that new CS students could use.  You ([[User:Dragontamer]]) suggested that Python had some reasonable GUI development environments.  I'm game to try some out if you have some suggestions.  The idea of using Python as an introductory langauge really does intregue me in some weird perverted way.  It offers many of the benefits that BASIC offered back in days of yesteryear, but being a little more up to date in terms of modern programming concepts.  Like I said, I don't know Python other than some demonstrations I saw from a Python guru that I knew, but I've been programming long enough to know that sticking to one language is going to keep you in a rut as a programmer as well.

I want to stick to one single programming language... at least to start with.  The multiple computer programming language version will have to come later, although I may try it out with C# as an experiment as well.  Java just doesn't inspire me, but I'm willing to give it a try.  An intro text using Python might also get some support from the larger Python community as well, which will be likely to help out here on Wikibooks.  I just don't see that with the larger Java community happening.  Python users tend to be evangelical in their language usage and would love this forum.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:29, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

: I'm not very good at Python myself; though if you want something somewhat GUI but everyone will love, we probably should use pyGame. It is easy enough to be taught to a beginner programmer. From there, we can probably create a game? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:00, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

:: Ideally I would love a GUI design environment like Visual Basic/Delphi/Visual Studio that allows you do to design forms and windows without having to touch actual programming right away.  If one doesn't exist with Python, I may even be tempted to write it myself.  I've worked on similar projects in the past.  I know there are class libraries to work with many GUI frameworks, so I don't think this would be that complicated of a project to accomplish.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:50, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

::: You mean like http://glc.sourceforge.net/ and http://glade.gnome.org/ ?? GTK+ is the library for that GUI design environment, supposedly it isn't very mature on Windows but works great in Linux/Unix based systems. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:59, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:::: GTK has matured quite a bit on Windows... mainly driven by the GIMP for Windows software.  It is still clumsy and has a few problems, mainly from being so different in look and feel from the standard Windows API libraries.  [http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/ Lazarus (Free Pascal GUI editor)] uses GTK as well.  I'll have to see what the current state is right now, but this is a good place to start.  Thanks for the heads up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Speaking in generalities instead of code ==

Ideas in Computer Science should be able to be applied to any language that will support it. Computer Science isn't the study of languages themselves, but the techniques used to implement them. So why not just include the least amount of code as possible? You could still show an example here or there in a fairly common and portable language like C or Java.

I have an entire study packet of the Marine Biology Case Study which is a standard project that students are expected to know the ins and outs of by the end of the year. I also have a textbook that is hundreds of pages of sample questions for the test. Plus tons of knowledge on the topic. We used Java in our class. I'll throw in whatever info I see fit once this gets started. [[User:Themikeflynn|Themikeflynn]] 06:54, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

: Also, I don't think this should get too into creating a game, reverse engineering or disassembly. They are great Computer Science topics but I've never seen them mentioned in any AP Computer Science AB related information. Keep this simple, remember that many kids taking the class aren't computer science degree seeking students but rather high school students looking for some other AP class to put on a college application. [[User:Themikeflynn|Themikeflynn]] 07:01, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

I understand to a point what you are saying here, but the fact is a computer science class simply must get into programming, and gobs of it.  And (unfortuntely) you have to select a language of some sort to start with in the first place.  This is an eternal debate that was started originally by Dartmouth College when they invented BASIC (yes, it was not Wm. Gates III who invented that language).  Due to political reasons alone and not because of any technical purposes, early computer programming languages have shifted around from one language to another to the point it is now just the flavor of the month, with Java being the hot language of the moment a couple of years ago.

Students can only learn about programming computers by actually programming computers and doing experiments and trying new things.  

As far as creating a game is concerned, it is some very lousy teachers who don't understand the typical high-school aged hacker and something they may be interested in.  There is no student who is interested in setting up a tax calculation program or a workbook that keeps track of grades.  Those may be of interest to the instructor, but students would be completely turned off from even having to use software like this.  Simple games can be created with relatively little actual software code behind them (especially when using plug-in components and standard libraries).

The point here is that you can have one large project that is more of an application of the concepts that you are learning.  I know this seems like requiring a 1st grader who is just beginning to learn how to write to be able to come up with a 30 page research paper with citations and endnotes, but I don't think it is that much of a leap as it may seem.  Far too many people have taken a class like basic CS 101 (which is exactly what the AP Computer Science curriculum is duplicating on a high school level) and assume that most computer software is like the one or two page assignments they had to turn in.  There is a very different way that you have to look at developing a larger piece of software compared to a typical quick and dirty assignment handed in for a CS 101 class.  Perhaps having to debug a 3000 line piece of software will give some students the appreciation of why many software engineering projects (like the Denver Stapleton Airport baggage handling equipment software or many Y2K issues) seem to go on forever and don't seem to be solved, even after millions of dollars worth of effort being poured into them.

In addition, students in school need to learn that they can't simply be working alone and need to cooperate in a team development environment.  That is true not only for software development, but for just about any sort of work experience that they are going to be dealing with in the future.  By having a medium (3000 to 10,000 lines of code) piece of software that is developed jointly by several students, this is an ideal way to demonstrate the need for cooperation and negotiation that makes up the modern work environment.  I don't know how you can test for that sort of experience through standarized testing, but this is a critical skill that many high school and even college graduates are seriously lacking.  Students who cooperate and pull together are going to have a simply outstanding &quot;final project&quot; and students that can't get along are going to see something that won't even compile, much less do anything.  A final project like this is also something cool to show off to parents and school administration, to show that yes, kids can do some amazing things.  That AP courses don't do something like this is a fault of the instructor even considering it as an option.

As for reverse engineering and disassemblers, again I think it is a lack of imagination and creativity of the people who set up the original AP Computer Science guidelines that it wasn't even considered.  My thought on these subjects was to have something that teacher could have that was very interesting, reflect on the experiences that students have gone through over the full length of the course, and introduce the idea that even with all of the material they have covered with the course that it is just the very beginning of a huge field of human knowledge that they have just taken some very baby steps into.  Generally the last few days of class in a school year (especially for High School students) they are hardly paying attention anyway over what is being presented, and some teachers don't like to &quot;teach for the test&quot;.  If done properly, this can give an instructor the chance to make the last few days of class something very memorable and give them a reason to even show up to class (think a High School senior on his last day of class?  Are they even going to be attending?).  These topics also wouldn't be interfering with any final assignments that had to be handed in, as they are more lecture oriented as well.  In short, a chance for an instructor to &quot;let their hair down&quot; and have fun with their kids.  I am not advocating that an AP student is going to be writing a disassembler, but that perhaps they should have it explained what would go into a disassembler and how it can be useful.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:48, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

: I agree completely that most computer science classes are taught in a very dry technical matter. In our class, every program was treated as an assignment rather than a creative or collaborative effort. We were never given a group assignment throughout the entire year mostly because some of the kids were very anti social (a caricature of a typical high school hacker). Our instructor was a very smart guy that knew a lot of stuff but he was a very procedural teacher that didn't require your creativity, just the bare minimum. Also he would always touch upon the topics that all of us wanted to do, such as hacking another computer over the school network or setting up a keylogger, and would even tell us the best way to do it, but we were never given the chance to work on it as a class project. Being the network administrator of the school district, it was easy to understand why, but it did get kind of annoying. He stuck with the curriculum and we worked on projects such as finding the most efficient path in a field. That could definately be applied to a game, but we never went much further than just finding the path.

: So if you can present this book in a way that teaches or reviews every topic that is in the curriculum of an AP Compsci class, but in a matter that takes on projects such as games, disassemblers and all that fun stuff, then sure I'm all for this. All I meant to say last night was that they were never even mentioned in any actual AP Compsci textbook. I'm more interested in how you will approach those subjects now that I understand where you are planning on going with them. [[User:Themikeflynn|Themikeflynn]] 19:22, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

: Well, at least in my school district, the APs are a full month and a half before school ends, so we used that time to work on a final project, often in pairs. I would also like to comment that that was a very helpful part of the class, because I learned that you ''cannot'' program anywhere near what you thought you could. On another note, this project, and other &quot;needed&quot; stuff like GUI, I/O, etc. not taught in AP CS AB should go ''after'' the AP CS material, because it is not tested.

Hi, y'all. I ([[User:Kjosib|Kjosib]]) am willing to help write some of this textbook. You might want to see what's been done with the intro and its talk page to see where I'm coming from. I've been programming professionally for some number of years, and my formal education was at UTexas. I'm going to be reviewing the updates to Java since I last used it professionally (2003) in the next while, and I should be able to help with a fair amount of the materials. I don't mind writing to the topics on the sylabus, because that's roughly what people are expected to learn in the corresponding real class. I've not seen the actual test in many years, so I won't be influenced by it. Besides, when I took it, the test was in Pascal. So anyway, I feel qualified, and if no one else does, I'm going to start posting more bits as and when I have time.

:I hope that you do so.  I was the person who wrote the initial outline, but got stretched very, very thin with projects going off in a couple hundred directions here on Wikibooks, together with the demands of being an administrator on two projects now (Wikibooks and Wikiversity).  That and I took a bit of a Wikibreak this past month just to take care of my personal life.

:Still, the direction I tried to go with the outline was to cover important topics that are sometimes missed in introductory classes.  This in particular was why I added the software engineering section almost right at the beginning, as this is something that kids interested in software development as a career should know as well as those who are to be general citizens should also be aware of even if it isn't explictly on the AP-CS test.  I could give countless examples from the Space Shuttle main computer software to the software disaster at the Denver Colorado Airport, where substantial quantities of money are spent on software engineering by taxpayers, often with litle or no accounting.  BTW, the Space Shuttle computer software is something of a model of success and is more of an example of how public agencies should be contracting with computer programmers.

:As I tried to indicate, I also wanted to introduce the idea of GUI programming right from the beginning, hence the idea that classes, methods, and OOP programming concepts are something that will be also taught lightly in the beginning but elaborated upon later.  Command-line programming is something that will be all but ignored and only dealt with as a special topic, not the primary way for beginning programmers to get their feet wet.  This isn't the 1970's and a command line prompt is hardly even seen by computer users any more.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

We need to keep in mind that the rank beginner must be mentally prepared to read the book, follow the work, and learn enough to pass the AP test, at least at the A level. The College Board does not test user input in any form. As far as I'm concerned, that means you can put all the &quot;input&quot; in the source code in the form of initializers, and treat the programming process as a way to get the computer to solve hard problems for you. In this vein, it may be wise to emulate the instructional style of Barron's ''Calculus the Easy Way'', in which an intrepid adventurer lands on the shores of a beleagured country desperately in need of solutions to calculus problems. I might concoct a Tron-like adventure wherein you must program your way out of a cardboard box.

It's true that modern beginners don't generally grok command lines. One way or another, you'll have to compile and run Java programs if you expect to learn Java and pass the test. That means that students must have a Java development environment set up on their computers. There are many. Some require the use of a command line, and some don't, but all provide console output, which is good because it's on the test.

The classic &quot;Hello World!&quot; program is similar to the first day in a decent foreign language class. You experience a greeting and salutation in the language you've set to learn, and soon enough you can participate in or initiate such action yourself. Nothing seems to make any sense for the first few weeks, but once you've studied for a while, it's hard to imagine not understanding such a simple utterance. The essential need is for a simple exchange which can be explained simply. GUI systems are not up to the &quot;first week of programming&quot; test. Furthermore, they are not generally illustrative of deep concepts in computer science. Instead, they tend to focus more on the software engineering and usability issues of complex systems.

GUI programming can be very satisfying, any many students may be motivated by the opportunity to construct programs which use a GUI. However, I don't mean to contribute to a book on GUI programming in particular. For starters, you'd have to pick a GUI framework. Then, you'd need to cover all manner of things about that framework. This is already done perfectly well by the people that created the GUI framework in the first place. The only obstacle is that you must know how to program and how to read code and its documentation, which this course can help.

Anything on GUI creation which is consistent with the goal of getting students past the AP test is fair game for inclusion in the book. However, please keep in mind that a GUI is not on the test. If the course introduces a concept, it should be for the furtherance of student understanding or motivation. You can probably get away with introducing some GUI work part way through. However, let's not go hog-wild. I think that some basic 2-D graphics programming is a good idea, and it can also motivate some interesting problems. For example, let's code some animation, perhaps simulating some physics along the way. This is closely related to game programming, and you'll keep interest that way.

I think that many, but not all, of the topics on the AP test can be covered by developing parts of video games. If some related exercises are left to the reader, then many students will have plenty of motivation to continue learning even after the course is done.

:I may end up taking this whole outline and moving it to another book, because as you are pointing out, the folks who make the AP CS test are hard core command line folks and we can't get around that.

:Of course, this is &quot;teaching for the test&quot;, which I hate and deplore, but in this situation it may be more of a ncecssity.  If this textbook is to be taken seriously, we may have to completely cull the GUI material.

:On the other hand, as I was trying to point out, in the real world GUI programming is going to be the rule rather than the exception, and any programmer who doesn't understand GUI programming, and I mean living and breathing it, is not going to go too far.  Furthermore, I fail to see how with modern RAD-GUI development environments that it is any more difficult to program for a GUI than a CLI, and perhaps more complicated for the CLI.  That the test does not cover GUI development I find is a short coming of the test itself and its designers.  Of that I feel I can be critical of the AP test.

:BTW, GUI development does not mean hard core computer graphics design and priciples.  It just means throwing a few buttons and dialog boxes on a screen and pressing the compile button.  A good RAD environment can have a rank beginner be able to do this in five minutes, with some hand-holding by an instructor.  I would bet you could get a beginning programmer to develop a GUI window with the words &quot;Hello world&quot; and an OK button to close in far less time than you could get one to write a CLI version that does the same thing with string output functions.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:38, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Developmental Delay and Mental Retardation'''

==Introduction==

==Contracting==
*What is your understanding of why you were referred?
*What is your main concern?
*I understand that some members of your family have MR
*Do you know what caused their MR?
*You were referred to GC because sometimes there is an underlying genetic condition that is the cause MR
*Sometimes a cause of MR remains unknown
*Obtain prenatal history

==Pedigree==
*Learning problems or MR
*Were they in special classes at school
*Do they live with someone who cares for them
*Do you know of any tests that were done to try and determine the cause?
**Developmental delays
**Birth defects (heart defects, cleft lip or palate)
**History of pregnancy losses
**Anyone who died young or unexpectedly
**Chronic health problems
**Anyone with seizures
**Anyone with speech problems

==Etiology of Mental Retardation==
*Many causes of developmental delay and MR
*Common causes are genetic syndromes, multifactorial conditions, environmental exposures, infections during pregnancy, drug and alcohol use during pregnancy, problems with the birth or delivery, prematurity
*Cause in many individuals remains unknown
*In mild MR, a specific risk factor has been identified in about 43% of the cases studied. Only 24% of these cases yield a fairly clear or convincing diagnosis. 2, 3 Of those, 14% are classified as genetic and 10% environmental.
*With moderate-severe MR, a cause is determined in up to 64% of cases with 45% of those being linked to genetic causes and 19% to environmental factors. 4
*The seemingly lesser role of genetics in milder retardation may have something to do with the fact that some who fall into the mild MR category may simply represent the low end of the normal range of human intelligence.
*Severe mental retardation is more likely to have a genetic component (50% of cases have a major chromosomal cause).
*Down's syndrome accounts for 5% of mild MR cases and 30% of severe MR cases, 6, 7
*telomere deletions or duplications account for about 7.5% of MR 19
*Fragile X is seen in 5% of both mild and moderate-severe MR. 8, 9
*more than 500 other genetic diseases, mostly very rare, have also been associated with MR 10

==Incidence==
*2-3% of the general population is affected with some level of mental retardation
*85-90% of patients with mental retardation fall into the mild range (IQ of 50-70)
*Most live at home or in the community and have some level of independence.

==Recurrence Risks==
*This is largely dependent on the cause of the mental retardation.
*If cause is unknown, recurrence can be quoted as 1-25%, (this takes into account causes ranging from a non-genetic environmental exposure to an autosomal recessive condition)
*Studies have shown that a couple who has had one child with MR are about ten times more likely to have another
*Study at Greenwood genetic center preliminary results
**452 probands with average IQ of 41.1 and head circumference in 43%ile with idiopathic MR and a subsequent sibling
**502 male and 468 female subsequent sibs
**21% of brothers and 14% of sisters also had MR.
**Recurrence in blacks was 18.3% and whites 17%
**Higher recurrence risks were positively correlated with higher IQ
*Question remains of whether it is genes, environment or a combination

==Clinical Features==
*Mild mental retardation: IQ 50-70
*Moderate mental retardation: IQ 35-50
*Severe mental retardation: 20-35
*Profound mental retardation: IQ less than 20

==Testing==
*IQ testing and a developmental assessment are common first steps

      <text xml:space="preserve">== No original research ==

I think that the entire concept of a wiki requires a common ''truth'' for the content to converge.  Without a common truth, I can say one thing, you can claim the opposite, and we can keep overwriting the other indefinitely.  This makes it an obvious choice to require [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV]] content.  Some level of [[Wikibooks:Verifiability|verifiability]] is implicit in NPOV -- if you cannot verify content, how can you demonstrate that it is indeed neutral.  That being said, I think that original research can be both NPOV and verifiable, in which case there is no reason to exclude it from Wikibooks.  Encyclopedias are seldom the receptacle of novel information, so it makes sense to me that Wikipedia would exclude original research.  What is required is a guideline/policy that permits the community to prevent content from cycling indefinitely, such as can happen with any content that is not verifiable.  Incidentally, this is what permits science to progress: verifiability (or rather the inability to disprove things leads people to postulate commonly recognized theories).  --[[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 03:54, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

:Thank you for your comments... I didn't quite know what should be done with a No Original Research policy, and that is why I didn't just put it into the Wikibooks namespace and start a poll. And although verifiability and NPOV are related, they are vastly different. Thanks again. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:36, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

::I think the biggest reason to have the no original research (NOR) policy is because we want wikibooks to be a repository for information, not theory. Also, we don't want wikibooks to become the poor man's substitute for a scholarly journal: scientific study and research needs to go through the proper, time-tested channels of peer reveiw and critique before they can be accepted as being &quot;fact&quot; and put into a public place where people can read and learn. If somebody conducts original research, and that research is then proven to be false, what becomes of the book here? does it suddenly qualify for deletion on the grounds of non-verifiability? We run the risk of simply collecting lots of junk that can't be verified, but also can't be debunked, because it is completely original. I think this policy is starting to look pretty good, and I would probably cast a vote for it once we get the text up to 100%. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 01:57, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
----
I ([[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]) noticed the &quot;no original research&quot; policy in this sandbox. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lord_Voldemort/Quicksand&amp;oldid=287834 The current version] discourages any kind of original research, and encourages all information in Wikibooks to be based on primary and secondary sources outside oof Wikibooks.

In fact, for books like [[Modern History]], this seems reasonable. Actually, Wikipedia and Wikisource can be sources for that book. In contrast, I would get rid of [[Wikimania05]], see [[Talk:Wikimania05#Transwiki to Meta]].

However, I wonder how Wikibooks should handle the cases of [[Genetic transformator for block-based loss-less compression]] (GT) and [[Triangular Earth Calendar]] (TEC); both propose new concepts. Both are modified versions of primary source web pages, so it seems that the policy currently in this quicksand might accept them. (GT might be identical to the source document; I am not sure.) One potential problem is that the source documents might have been copied in by the authors of the source documents. This appears true, at least for TEC. (I am not sure, but Wikisource might have a rule against that.) I suppose that it is debatable whether to have modules like these two.

For [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Cookbook]], that is original work. I wrote one of the three recipes. However, they are all short examples intended to demonstrate existing features of the Unix Bourne shell program, which is not our original work. I would support a policy that kept pages like this (maybe unless they were too large?). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:11, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

:You make some good points. But overall, I think that this policy could be effective in it's current state. We should probably allow ''some'' original research, such as the Bourne Cookbook page, but those could be determined on a case-by-case basis. But Wikibooks is not a place for actual original research that is intended to turned into a thesis or research paper. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:25, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Diabetes in Pregnancy'''

==Overview of Diabetes==
*Disorder in which body doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use insulin properly
**Insulin is hormone made by pancreas
**Insulin lets body turn blood sugar into energy or store it as fat
*If diabetes is untreated, high levels of sugar accumulate in blood
**Can damage organs
***Blood vessels
***Nerves
***Eyes
***Kidneys
**Daily insulin injections may help prevent these complications
*Three types of diabetes
**Insulin-dependant diabetes mellitus (IDDM)
***Type I or juvenile diabetes
***B cells don't produce insulin
***Classic presentation
****Weight loss
****Increased appetite
****Increased thirst
****Excessive urination
****Severe cases can cause ketoacidosis
**Non-insulin dependant diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
***Type II diabetes
***Classically seen in adults who are overweight
***Insulin is present but insulin receptors unresponsive
**Gestational diabetes
***Caused by hormones or other factors that interfere with bodies ability to use insulin during pregnancy
***Many women have no symptoms
***Risk factors to develop gestational diabetes:
****Over age 30
****Obesity
****Family history of diabetes
****Personal history of gestational diabetes - 50% recurrence
****Previous baby over 9 ½ pounds
****Previous stillbirth
***Occurs most frequently in African-Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Pacific Islanders, and American Indians
***Usually develops during second half of pregnancy
***Most women can control insulin levels with diet and exercise
***Women with gestational diabetes have 50% chance of developing diabetes after pregnancy

==Diabetes in Pregnancy==
*Incidence
**About 1 in 100 women of childbearing age have diabetes before pregnancy
**About 3-5% of women develop gestational diabetes
*Risks to fetus
**In general, the more severe the diabetes, the more severe the outcome
**Poorly controlled diabetes (all types)
***Risk for congenital malformations related to severity of diabetes
****Women with IDDM and uncontrolled NIDDM have 2-3 times incidence of congenital anomalies (6-8%)
****Women with NIDDM have median risk
****Women with gestational diabetes at small increased risk
***Increased risk for macrosomia (25-45%)
****Baby 10 pounds or more at birth
****Due to extra sugar in mother's blood that crosses the placenta to fetus
****Fat tends to accumulate around shoulders and trunk
****Makes babies difficult to deliver vaginally
****Can lead to increase in shoulder dystocia, clavicular fracture, and Erb's Palsy
***Increased risk for pregnancy complications
****Miscarriage
****Pregnancy-related high blood pressure
****Polyhydramnios
****Preterm delivery - can lead to respiratory distress
****Stillbirth
***Increased risk for newborn complications
****Breathing difficulties
****Low blood sugar
****Jaundice
****Infant mortality is 30/1000 live births (4 X general population rate)
**Poorly controlled preexisting diabetes (IDDM and NIDDM)
***Malformations most likely to originate before 7th week gestation
***Includes risk for:
****Congenital heart defects (5 X average incidence)
*****Transposition of great vessels
*****VSD
*****ASD
****Renal anomalies (5 X average incidence)
*****Renal agenesis (6 X average incidence)
*****Cystic kidney (4 X average incidence)
*****Ureter duplex (23 X average incidence)
****Situs inversus (84 X average incidence)
****Anal/rectal atresia (5 X average incidence)
****Central nervous system defects
*****Neural tube defects (10 X average incidence)
*****Anencephaly (5 X average incidence)
*****Caudal regression (300 X average incidence)
**If blood sugar levels are well controlled beginning before pregnancy, risk for complications falls to almost population risk
*Women with IDDM prone to microvascular disease
**Difficult for these women to carry successful pregnancy
***Causes diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and nerve disease in peripheral limb structures
***Pregnancy puts increased demand on already stressed system
**Prevents optimal maternal-fetal blood exchange

==Management of Pregnancy==
*Should begin monitoring blood sugar before pregnancy
**Since most serious birth defects associated with diabetes originate in early weeks
**Blood sugar control begun before pregnancy reduces risk of birth defects, miscarriage, stillbirth, macrosomia, and newborn complications
**Ideally keep blood glucose levels between 60 and 120 mg/dl
*Monthly blood test to measure glycated hemoglobin
**Substance formed when glucose in blood attaches to protein in red blood cells
**Test shows how well blood sugar has been controlled for up to 3 months
**Can help determine when it is &quot;safe&quot; to conceive
**Can be used to monitor control throughout pregnancy
*Women should take multivitamin with 400 micrograms of folic acid
**Beginning at least one month before pregnancy
**Because women with diabetes at increased risk for NTDs
**No studies showing that this larger dose prevents NTDs in women with preexisting diabetes
*Women who take oral medication to control blood sugar must switch to insulin
**Oral medications may increase risk for birth defects
**Must be done prior to conception
*Glucose Challenge
**Used to screen pregnant women for gestational diabetes
**Does not need to be offered to women under 25 years because their risk is very low
**Consume drink with 50 grams of glucose and measure blood one hour later
**Women with high blood levels of glucose then take glucose tolerance test
*Glucose Tolerance Test
**Consume drink with 100 grams of glucose
**Blood samples drawn one, two, and three hours following to measure level of glucose
**Identifies women with gestational diabetes who should be monitored
*Maternal serum AFP screening
**Since women with diabetes at increased risk to have baby with neural tube defect
**Maternal serum AFP is elevated in all women with diabetes so must be interpreted with knowledge that woman is diabetic
*Frequent ultrasounds to track fetal growth during 3rd trimester
**May recommend C-section if large baby
**&quot;Non-stress&quot; test to monitor baby's heart rate

==Control of Diabetes During Pregnancy==
*Diet
**Recommend that women get nutritional counseling
**Diet may need to be modified as pregnancy progresses
**As a general rule, women should consume 2,200-2,400 calories per day
*Exercise
**Helps control diabetes by prompting body to use insulin more efficiently
**Recommended for women with gestational diabetes and some with preexisting diabetes
*Insulin Treatment
**Given to many women with preexisting diabetes
**Requirements change during pregnancy
***Usually increase after 20-24 weeks
***Stabilize by 36 weeks
**Only 10-15% of women with gestational diabetes need insulin
***Recommended if blood sugar levels don't stabilize after two weeks of diet control
***New oral medication being tested that has been shown to not increase risk of birth defects or complications
*Blood sugar levels may be difficult to control after delivery
**Especially true if woman is breastfeeding
**Blood levels usually return to normal for women with gestational diabetes

==Genetic etiology of the condition==
*Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia and relative or absolute deficiency of insulin. It is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting 5-10% of the adult population in the western hemisphere. There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and represents about 10% of all cases. It results from the destruction of the Beta cells of the pancreas, which is an auto-immune process. Type 2 is non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and represents around 90% of the cases. It has a poorly defined pathogenesis, but may cause resistance due to a decrease in insulin receptors and interact with outside factors such as obesity.
*Inheritance: the genetics of diabetes mellitus is complex, with multifactorial inheritance indicating an interaction of both genetic and environmental factors. The disease itself is not inherited; rather it is a susceptibility to the disease. (Type 2 has a greater genetic component.)
*Risk factors: family history, obesity, lack of exercise, age over 30. Ethnic backgrounds of African American, Latino, Native American, and Asian have twice the risk for developing diabetes than Caucasians.

==Incidence and carrier frequency==
*Type 1 (IDDM) has an incidence of about 1 in 200 Caucasians and usually manifests early in life. Risk to sibling is 6% and risk to offspring is 2.5%. The male gender may have an influence on predisposition.
*Type 2 (NIDDM) has a recurrence risk to siblings and offspring for over disease of 5-10%, while there is a recurrence risk for abnormal glucose tolerance of 15-25%.
*Diabetes mellitus frequently accompanies the symptoms of Fredriech's Ataxia. This appears to be the case in this family. Therefore, Mr. and Mrs. R's offspring may be at a lower risk.

==Clinical features==
*In both types, insulin deficiency leads to hyperglycemia which is responsible for complications like microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) and macrovascular disease (atherosclerosis).
*Type 1: The typical patient is a thin, ketosis-prone juvenile who requires insulin to live. It usually occurs in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood with acute onset of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, severe hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis.
*Type 2: The typical patient is an overweight adult whose diabetes can be managed by diet or oral medication (although they may receive insulin.) It is usually much less dramatic and presents in an overweight person later in life. Symptoms include tiredness, frequent urination, thirst, blurred vision, and frequent infections with slow-healing sores.
*During pregnancy, the need for insulin is often increased (diabetogenic).

==Age of onset, natural history, and life span==
*It is important to note that either type can occur at any age, although Type 1 is usually younger (before 30) while Type 2 is usually older (after 40).
*Manifestations can range from asymptomatic glucose intolerance, to acute medical emergencies, to chronic complications.

==Testing==
*Blood tests: elevation of plasma glucose (fasting level of at least 140 mg/dl)
*Urinalysis for glucose and ketone bodies
*Glucose tolerance tests/insulin assays
*Molecular analysis of HLA genes (IDDM)

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==
*Insulin, dietary management, and oral hypoglycemic agents, exercise
*Eye exams and podiatry care is important
*In pregnancy, there is a dose-response effect where the better the glycemic control in the first trimester, the lower the risk of birth defects in the fetus.

==Differential diagnoses==
*Gestational Diabetes: have an insulin resistance . . . the pancreas is working correctly, but the tissue is resistant . . . first recognized during pregnancy (screened at 24-28 weeks) and then usually returns to normal. Teratogenic effect seems to increase when insulin is required during the third trimester (in 20-30% of the women) and if control it is poor during the first trimester.
*Two types: Type 1 - must have insulin along with diet control 
*Type 2 - can control blood sugars by diet alone
*Risk factors: family history of diabetes, advanced maternal age (AMA), obesity, and a history of macrosomia.
*Up to 50% of women with gestational diabetes may develop overt diabetes in 5-8 years following their pregnancy.
*Diabetes is associated with a number of genetic syndromes (over 60).

==Psychosocial issues==
*The risk for a major congenital malformation in the infant of a diabetic mother is estimated to be two to three times greater than the general population.
*Risks to the mother include miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, and caesarian delivery while risks to the fetus include congenital anomalies (caudal regression, NTDs, renal and cardiac abnormalities), macrosomia, hydramnios, and perinatal morbidity or mortality
*Various community resources and support groups (some web based).

==Ingredients==

* 10 1/2 oz. soft (silken) tofu
* 1 1/2 cup water
* 1 med onion, chopped
* 8 oz mushrooms, thickly sliced
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1/2 cup dry red wine
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* salt to taste

==Procedure==

* in a blender, blend tofu and 1/4 cup water for about 2 minutes, or until smooth
* add remaining 3/4 cup water and process until blended
* in a large skillet, sauté onion for about 5 min
* add mushrooms and thyme, sauté 5 min more
* add wine and simmer for 5 min
* add tofu mixture and simmer until mushrooms are wilted

Using less water and/or adding some flour turns this into a delicious cream sauce for pasta.

The '''Introduction to Editors''' briefly introduces the reader to the common Unix text editors and provides links to more information.

Many readers will be familiar with text editors that have graphical user interfaces similar to Notepad from Windows, TextEdit (in unstyled text mode) from Mac OS X, GEdit from GNOME, or KEdit or KWrite from KDE. Other readers will only know about word processors, which are like text editors, but have additional features for applying style and layout to the text. Text editors only deal with sequences of text characters, all in the same font.

The approach of this chapter is to introduce the earliest Unix text editors and progress to the Notepad-style editors. The early editors lack many common features of editors.

=== The need for a text editor ===
One who uses the command line, but knows not how to use a text editor, can still create text files using the '''cat''' tool and the shell redirection feature.

 $ '''cat &gt; newfile'''
 We the people, promoting the common keyboard
 and preserving a more perfect docmument for all,
 do ordain and establish three lines of text.

(''Note:'' after entering '''&lt;tt&gt;cat &gt; newfile&lt;/tt&gt;''', the cursor awaits for text to be inputted by the user (in this example: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;We the people,&lt;/tt&gt; [...]&quot;).  After all the desired text has been entered, one should type RETURN CONTROL-D to exit the &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; tool.)

Suppose there is a want to change this file. In this example, &quot;docmument&quot; has an incorrect spelling; it should be [[wikt:document|document]]. Other wants could be revisions to this sentence and the addition of more sentences.

One can append to the file with &lt;tt&gt;'''cat &gt;&gt; newfile'''&lt;/tt&gt;, but that leaves the first lines unmodified. One can replace it with &lt;tt&gt;'''cat &gt; newfile'''&lt;/tt&gt; again, but that requires retyping the entire file. (Users of graphical user interfaces such as [[Guide to X11|X11]] have an advantage: they can use the mouse to copy and paste the text before &quot;docmument&quot;, type the correction, then copy and paste the remainder of the text.)

An interesting possibility is if there is a way to delete the extra &quot;m&quot; from &quot;docmument&quot;, and to handle more complex tasks like inserting words and rearranging text.

=== ed ===
One of the first editors that did this was '''ed''', short for &quot;edit&quot;. This has many features of Windows Notepad, but also lacks many. Observe what happens when one starts &quot;ed&quot;. Here, &quot;newfile&quot; is the name of the text file to edit.

 $ '''ed newfile'''
 139

A number (here &quot;139&quot;) appears. Then the program seems to stop, but no shell prompt appears. This is actually &quot;ed&quot; waiting for commands. On many computers, &quot;ed&quot; actually lacks a prompt.

The &quot;139&quot; indicates that &quot;ed&quot; read in 139 characters that are now ready for editing. We say that the file is ''open''. To be more correct from the perspective of a [[Programming:C|C programmer]], the file was opened and copied into a [[wikt:buffer|buffer]]. The buffer, not the file is open. This means that the disk or storage device will not be bothered until we ''save'' the file. Other text editors still follow this behavior, opening files, copying them into buffers, and requiring the user to ''save'' to write the file back to disk.

Notice that unlike many editors, &quot;ed&quot; has not yet shown the text of the file. We type a command &lt;tt&gt;''',p'''&lt;/tt&gt; to do this.

 $ '''ed newfile'''
 139
 ''',p'''
 We the people, promoting the common keyboard
 and preserving a more perfect docmument for all,
 do ordain and establish three lines of text.

The command, roughly translated, is that for every line in the file (&quot;,&quot;), &quot;p&quot;rint that line to standard output.

Now to do some actual editing, we use a command &lt;tt&gt;'''2s/docmument/document'''&lt;/tt&gt;.

 $ '''ed newfile'''
 139
 ''',p'''
 We the people, promoting the common keyboard
 and preserving a more perfect docmument for all,
 do ordain and establish three lines of text.
 '''2s/docmument/document'''
 and preserving a more perfect document for all,

For line &quot;2&quot;, &quot;s&quot;ubstitute the first instance of &quot;docmument&quot; with &quot;document&quot;. Here &quot;ed&quot; prints the changed line from the buffer.

We run two more commands, &quot;w&quot; to write the buffer back into &lt;tt&gt;newfile&lt;/tt&gt; on disk, and &quot;q&quot; to quit &quot;ed&quot;. If we forget &quot;w&quot;, then our edit is lost.

 $ '''ed newfile'''
 139
 ''',p'''
 We the people, promoting the common keyboard
 and preserving a more perfect docmument for all,
 do ordain and establish three lines of text.
 '''2s/docmument/document'''
 and preserving a more perfect document for all,
 '''w'''
 138
 '''q'''

We made only one minor change, but this already required four commands. Even worse, &quot;ed&quot; error messages are not useful when we mistype commands. Many Unix users never bother to learn &quot;ed&quot;. For those readers with interest, this book has a chapter [[../ed and sed/]] (when someone writes that chapter).

=== ex ===

=== vi ===
At some point, Unix systems introduced video screens that allow Unix to draw anywhere on the screen. Someone decided that it would be good to create a &quot;visual editor&quot; that allows the user to move the cursor through the file (as it appears with &quot;cat&quot; or the ed &quot;p&quot; command) and make changes. The name of this program is '''vi''', which is short for &quot;VIsual editor&quot;. Thus, the namers of this program intended one to call it &quot;vee eye&quot;, not &quot;vee&quot; nor &quot;six&quot;.

Observe what happens when one starts &quot;vi&quot;. First you type the command:

 $ '''vi newfile'''

Then the screen clears and becomes like this:

 We the people, promoting the common keyboard
 and preserving a more perfect document for all,
 do ordain and establish three lines of text.
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 newfile: unmodified: line 1

The screen might look different if you have a different version of &quot;vi&quot;. Your screen also probably has more than eight lines. However, all versions of &quot;vi&quot; have these two features:
* a &quot;~&quot; shows a nonexistent line (though you could type a line with only &quot;~&quot; to be confusing)
* there is a status line at the bottom, here it reads &quot;newfile: unmodified: line 1&quot;

On many computers, you can use the arrow keys to move the cursor. If that does not work, you can use the standard &quot;vi&quot; keys:
* '''[h]''' moves left, '''[j]''' moves down, '''[k]''' moves up, '''[l]''' moves right

For example, one can press '''[l]''' for fifteen times to move the cursor from the &quot;W&quot; in &quot;We&quot; to the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;promoting&quot;. (In fact, as a shortcut, vi lets one press '''[1] [5] [l]''' (one, five, ell). This gives the number &quot;15&quot; to the '''[l]''' command, which in this case means to repeat the command fifteen times.) So it is possible to move the cursor through the file, which was not possible with ed.

But what if we want to type the letter &quot;l&quot; instead of moving the cursor? Press '''[i]''', which is a command to switch the vi editor from ''command mode'' to ''insert mode''. Then type something. Here, the user, with the cursor at &quot;p&quot; in &quot;promoting&quot;, typed '''[i]''' and then &quot;nominally &quot; (including one space):

 We the people, nominally promoting the common keyboard
 and preserving a more perfect document for all,
 do ordain and establish three lines of text.
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 &lt;!-- status --&gt;

Note that some copies of &quot;vi&quot;, such as this one, by default never show at the screen whether the editor is in command or insert mode.

To exit insert mode, press '''[ESC]''' escape. To save and quit the editor, type '''[:] [w] [q] [RETURN]''' which inputs &quot;wq&quot; to the colon prompt.

To learn more about vi, read the Wikibook, [[Learning the vi Editor]].

=== vim ===

In new generation of Linux and Unix operating systems, the more improved version of VI editor was released called vim (version 7 latest).
VIM incorporates almost all the features of VI and more, including color coding screen, highlights, and spell check within the document.

=== emacs ===
emacs was developed at around the same time as vi, and served as a different
paradigm to text editing. It allows customization via an in-editor programming
language called emacs-LISP, and is a modeless editor (as opposed to vi, a modal editor).

emacs is started much the same way as vi -
 $ emacs newfile

It will show a screen resembling the below:

 We the people, promoting the common keyboard,
 and preserving a more perfect document for all,
 do ordain and establish three lines of text.
 
 
 --- GNU EMACS ----------------------------------

Moving around the file is accomplished with the arrow keys.

Entering text is accomplished by simply typing it, and other
basic functions such as deleting are accomplished using the
customary keyboard keys.

For example, in order to add the text '''protecting''' in place of '''preserving''', simply
move the cursor down to the space between the words '''preserving''' and '''a''', then press the 
DELETE key ten times. Then, simply key the word '''protecting'''.

To save the file, use the keyboard shortcut '''CTRL-x CTRL-s''', that is ''hold the control key and press the letter x. Let go of the control key. Then, hold the control key and press the letter s.''
(To save the file with a new name, then type '''CTRL-x CTRL-w''' and emacs will prompt for the name of the new file.)  After having saved the file, press '''CTRL-x CTRL-c''' to close down emacs and return to the shell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gene Roddenberry==
[[Image:Sciencefiction.png|right]]
The two most popular perceptions of humanity's future are: the '''cyclical pattern''' envisioned in [[w:Gene_Roddenberry|Gene Roddenberry's]] tales of [[w:Star_Trek|sailing the stars]] in place of the oceans; and the '''maturation pattern''' envisioned in [[w:Raymond_Kurzweil|Ray Kurzweil's]] books about how macro-evolution keeps building upon itself to create ever increasingly complex patterns through stages of atomic organization, DNA formation, compounding neural patterns, the building of technology, and the approaching [[w:Technological_singularity|merger of technology and human intelligence]].  Roddenberry's vision of the future claims to be science fiction while Kurzweil's claims to be science.  In order for methods of Futurology to be reliable, we have to quantify the difference.

In his 2001 essay, The Law of Accelerating Returns, [3], Ray Kurzweil proposed a generalization of Moore's law that forms the basis of many people's beliefs regarding a &quot;Technological Singularity&quot;. Moore's law describes an exponential growth pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Kurzweil extended this to include technologies from far before the integrated circuit to future forms of computation. He declared that, whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He predicts that such paradigm shifts will become more and more common as time goes on. He believes that the exponential growth of Moore's law will continue beyond the use of integrated circuits into technologies that will lead to the &quot;Singularity&quot;, which he defines as a technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history.

==Harry Turtledove==
[[Image:Harry Turtledove 2005.jpg|thumb]]
Harry Norman Turtledove (born June 14, 1949), is a historian and prolific novelist who has written historical fiction, fantasy, and science fiction works. He is probably the best-known and most popular author of the genre of alternate history.

Turtledove has been dubbed &quot;The Master of Alternative History&quot;. Within that genre he is known both for creating original Alternative History scenarios such as survival of the Byzantine Empire and for giving a fresh and original treatment to themes previously dealt with by many others, such as the victory of South in the American Civil War and of Nazi Germany in the Second World War.

A recurring theme in Turtledove's fiction is the realistic description of war from the point of view of ordinary soldiers. Turtledove's soldiers are usually depicted sympathetically, though far from uncritically - with the same character who perpetrated acts of appalling cruelty in one episode shown under different circumastances to be capable of compassion and generosity. The above is true also for soldiers fighting for the side which is the clear villain of the piece, such as Nazi Germany and its numerous Alternative History and Fantasy analogues in Turtledove's fiction. His depiction of war always includes civilians whose life is impacted as well as soldiers on the battlefield itself.

Even manifest arch-villains, such as people involved in genocide, are hardly ever cardboard villains in Turtledove's books. In some series the reader can follow, step by step from book to book, the slippery slope by which an originally decent character gets to the point of committing mass murder.

Turtledove's books are almost invariably written in the third person, and the omniscient author is always present to a degree more characteristic in 19th century literature than at most other contemporary works. Turteldove often goes to the trouble of explaining to the reader details of a historical, linguistic or technological theme which are relevant to the scene but are clearly either unknown to the viewpoint characters in the situation described or taken by them for granted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I found the discussion of the the simulation argument and Nick Bostrom's ideas inadequate and somewhat misleading.  Even though it is true that Bostrom says that conscious states could arise in random associations of dust particles or interstellar gas, his main thrust is that given an infinite universe (or even nearly infinite) any thing that could happen however improbable will happen given enough time.  His case for human beings being part of a simulation is based on a different proposition, e.g. that given the probability of future generations of humans having the ability to create a simulated universe or 'ancestor simulations' containing conscious entities, the probability of any human existing as part of an ancestor simulation was greater than not.

I find Bostrom very much a physicalist (or perhaps a functionalist) in that I don't think he ever considers the possibility of conscious states divorced from some physical substrate, merely that there be 'some' substrate and to that it operates in a way to be functionally equivalent to the human mind.

:The discussion could certainly be extended, not least with references to earlier versions of the argument by other authors. Bostrom simply states that conscious experience will supervene on the form of his device without providing futher justification (see quote in article). It is this that makes it seem as if he believes in the non-physical. His argument might actually have fallen apart if he could state the physical basis for consciousness because, unless consciousness were a property of Turing machines, his &quot;simulation&quot; would simply be a part of the world containing a conscious entity and anybody can create such a &quot;simulation&quot; by allowing procreation.

==How carnivores are related==


Carnivores are meat eaters. Among the mammals, one entire order is noted for this: '''Carnivora''', which including all cats big and small as well as all hyenas, bears, seals, otters, and animals resembling weasels, wolves, mongooses, and raccoons. Except for the giant panda, all members of Carnivora are deadly hunters. That includes dogs, even if they are well-behaved. All are strong, powerful, intelligent, cunning, agile animals with sharp teeth and claws. All but the panda are fast enough to catch prey.

All living members of Carnivora are related to each other, having descended from the ancestor ''Miacis'', a small meat-eating weasel-like tree climber which lived between 36 million to 58 million years ago, or the Eocene period, in North America, Europe and Asia. It had a larger brain capacity than other carnivores of its day, which is probably why it survived to become the father of all modern carnivores.

Not all carnivorous animals are members of Carnivora. Dolphins and whales are formidable hunters and voracious eaters of meat (typically fish), but they are no closer to being cats than are the Great Apes that eat meat (especially humans, chimpanzees, and baboons). Neither are small mammals called '''Insectivora'''  (like shrews) that feed on insects and other tiny creatures.

==How old is ''Family Felidae''?==
The fossil record of Family Felidae extends to the Late Eocene, 34 million years ago.  If each of those years lasted a second, the Cat Family would have been around for roughly one year and five weeks.  By comparison, the Great Pyramid at Giza would have been around for only 83 minutes, and the Internet for less than 15 seconds (as of 2008).  The first known feline was ''Aelurogale''.  Its descendent, ''Proailurus'', gave rise to the major branches of the cat family we see today as well as the two sabre-toothed cat lines.  ''Proailurus'' lived in Europe from 30-20 million years ago.

==Notable fossil cats==
* Smilodon - ''Smilodon fatalis'' and others - Often called the &quot;Sabre-toothed Tiger&quot; though it is not a tiger, and &quot;Sabre-toothed Cat&quot; though it was not the only line of cats with sabre teeth.  The most widely recognized of the fossil cats, it lived in North and South America from 3 million to 10,000 years ago.  A fully grown Smilodon weighed about 450 pounds (203 kg) and had fangs 7 inches (17 cm) long that were used to subdue its large prey.

* The American Lion - ''Panthera atrox'' - It lived from 25,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago in North America.  In life, this cat was about 1/4 larger than the African lion, even bigger than the Siberian tiger.  The average male at 11.5 feet (3.5 m) in length would have averaged about 520 pounds (235 kg).  Females were smaller, averaging about 385 pounds (175 kg).  Fossil evidence indicates it had the most highly developed brain of any known cat.

* The Eurasian Cave Lion - ''Panthera spelaea'' - It lived from 30,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago from as far west as England to as far east as Siberia.  The largest cat that ever lived, it was 25% larger than the African lion and even bigger than the American Lion.  Ancient cave paintings and carvings indicate this cat had faint stripes, a hint of a mane in some males, tufted tails, and protruding ears.

* Miracinonyx - ''Miracinonyx trumani'' and others - Sometimes referred to as the &quot;American Cheetah,&quot; it is remarkably cheetah like and relied upon the same sprinting tactic to overtake its prey.  It is thought to have a common ancestor with the Puma.   Miracinonyx lived from 3 million to 10,000 years ago in the prairies and open plains of North America where it specialized in hunting newly-evolved swift herbivores such as the Pronghorn.

==Cats and humans in history==
[[Image:Egyptcat.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Egyptian statue of a cat]]
For many years the domestic cat was described as a separate species from all other cats, Felis catus.  It is now thought to be a subspecies (slight variation) of the Wildcat (''Felis sylvestris'') and is given the name ''Felis sylvestris catus''.  Archeological evidence shows a relationship between man and cat for the past 8,000 years.  The most unusual relationship existed among the Ancient Egyptians who considered cats as children of the goddess Bast.  When a cat died, family members showed grief by shaving off their eyebrows, and cats were routinely mummified and laid to rest with great reverence.

Certain other cats have been kept over the years for different reasons, but these relationships have never been maintained long enough to result in true domestication.  The proper term for cats such as lions or cheetahs that accept human companionship is &quot;human socialized&quot;.  This indicates that these animals still possess their entire range of wild instincts, which makes properly and safely handling them more of a challenge.  There are paintings and engravings of ancient rulers with big cats seated near their throne.  Many people kept cheetahs for hunting swift prey.

Certain fossil species such as Smilodon, the Cave Lion and the American Lion were hunted by early humans, who may have contributed to their extinction.  Hopefully no future scholars will find us responsible for the disappearance of more splendid animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I haven't yet read through the entire article on the clarinet, but I think that the content of the section on Tone is excellent. It really is true that, in essence, without a good tone, there really is nothing, no matter how fast or fluidly one may play. It seems to me that this point deserves the emphasis it's been given. Very good emphasis, and very good style. Thanks.

== Breathing exercises ==

This book needs to mention circular breathing, as the Clarinetist relies on it to play continuous music.[[User:203.214.4.49|203.214.4.49]]Febuary 2006 (UTC)</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Abyab. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Abyab~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The '''Java platform''' is the name given to the computing platform from Oracle that helps users to ''run'' and ''develop'' Java applications. The platform does not just enable a user to run and develop a Java application, but also features a wide variety of tools that can help developers work efficiently with the Java programming language.

The platform consists of two essential softwares:
* the '''Java Runtime Environment (JRE)''', which is needed to ''run'' Java applications and applets; and,
* the '''Java Development Kit (JDK)''', which is needed to ''develop'' those Java applications and applets. If you have installed the JDK, you should know that it comes equipped with a JRE as well. So, for all the purposes of this book, you would only require the JDK.

In this section, we would explore in further detail what these two software components of the Java platform do.

==Java Runtime Environment (JRE)==
Any piece of code written in the Java programming language can be run on any operating system, platform or architecture &amp;mdash; in fact, it can be run on any device that supports the Java platform. Before Java, this amount of ubiquity was very hard to achieve. If a software was written for a Unix-based system, it was impossible to run the same application on a Windows system &amp;mdash; in this case, the application was native only to Unix-based systems.

A major milestone in the development of the Java programming language was to develop a special runtime environment that would execute any Java application ''independent'' of the computer's operating system, platform or architecture.

The '''Java Runtime Environment (JRE)''' sits on top of the machine's operating system, platform and architecture. If and when a Java application is run, the JRE acts as a liaison between the underlying platform and that application. It interprets the Java application to run in accordance with the underlying platform, such that upon running the application, it looks and behaves like a native application. The part of the JRE that accomplishes this complex liaison agreement is called the '''Java Virtual Machine (JVM)'''.

{{Java/Illustration

|caption=Java applications can be ''written once'' and ''run anywhere''. This feature of the Java platform&lt;br&gt;is commonly abbreviated to '''WORA''' in formal Java texts.
|image=[[File:Explaining Java Runtime Environment.svg|center]]
}}

===Executing native Java code (or ''byte-code'')===
Native Java applications are preserved in a special format called the '''''[[Java Programming/Byte Code|byte-code]]'''''. Byte-code remains the same, no matter what hardware architecture, operating system, or software platform it is running under. On a file-system, Java byte-code resides in files that have the &lt;code&gt;.class&lt;/code&gt; (also known as a '''''class file''''') or the &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; (also known as a '''''Java archive''''') extension. To run byte-code, the JRE comes with a special tool (appropriately named '''java''').

Suppose your byte-code is called &lt;code&gt;SomeApplication.class&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to execute this Java byte-code, you would need to use the following command in Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Linux or Mac OS):
{{XConsole|1='''Execution'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java SomeApplication
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

If you want to execute a Java byte-code with a &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; extension (say, &lt;code&gt;SomeApplication.jar&lt;/code&gt;), you would need to use the following command in Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Linux or Mac OS):
{{XConsole|1='''Execution with a jar'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java -jar SomeApplication.jar
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

{{XNote|1=Not all Java class files or Java archives are executable. Therefore, the '''java''' tool would only be able to execute files that are executable. Non-executable class files and Java archives are simply called '''''class libraries'''''.}}

===Do you have a JRE?===
Most computers come with a pre-installed copy of the JRE. If your computer doesn't have a JRE, then the above commands would not work. You can always check what version of the JRE is installed on the computer by writing the following command in Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Linux or Mac OS):
{{XConsole|1='''Java version'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java -version
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

===Java Virtual Machine (JVM)===
Quite possibly, the most important part of the JRE is the '''Java Virtual Machine (JVM)'''. The JVM acts like a ''virtual'' processor, enabling Java applications to be run on the local system. It's main purpose is to interpret (''read'' translate) the received byte-code and make it appear as native code. The older Java architecture used this process of '''interpretation''' to execute Java byte-code. Even though the process of interpretation brought the WORA principle to diverse machines, it had a drawback &amp;mdash; it consumed a lot of time and clocked the system processor intensively to load an application.

{{Java/Illustration
|number=2
|caption=A JVM interpreter ''translates'' the byte-code line-by-line to make it appear as if a native application is being executed.
|image=[[File:How JVM Interpreter works.svg|center]]
}}

====Just-in-Time Compilation====
Since version 1.2, the JRE features a more robust JVM. Instead of interpreting byte-code, it down-right converts the code straight into equivalent native code for the local system. This process of conversion is called ''[[w:just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compilation]]'' or ''JIT-compilation''. This process only occurs when the byte-code is executed for the first time. Unless the byte-code itself is changed, the JVM uses the compiled version of the byte-code on every successive execution. Doing so saves a lot of time and processor effort, allowing applications to execute much faster at the cost of a ''small'' delay on first execution.

{{Java/Illustration
|number=3
|caption=A just-in-time compiler only compiles the byte-code to equivalent native code at first execution. Upon every successive&lt;br&gt;execution, the JVM merely uses the already ''compiled'' native code to optimize performance.
|image=[[File:How JIT Compilation works.svg|center]]
}}

====Native optimization====
The JVM is an intelligent ''virtual'' processor. It has the ability to identify areas within the Java code itself that can be optimized for faster and better performance. Based on every successive run of your Java applications, the JVM would optimize it to run even better.

{{XNote|1=There are portions of Java code that do not require it to be JIT-compiled at runtime, e.g., the [[Java Programming/Reflection|Reflection API]]; therefore, code that uses such functions are not necessarily fully compiled to native code.}}

====Was JVM the first ''virtual machine''?====
Java was not the first virtual-machine-based platform, though it is by far the most successful and well-known.  Previous uses for virtual machine technology primarily involved [[w:emulators|emulators]] to aid development for not-yet-developed hardware or operating systems, but the JVM was designed to be implemented entirely in software, while making it easy to efficiently port an implementation to hardware of all kinds.

==Java Development Kit (JDK)==
The JRE takes care of running the Java code on multiple platforms, however as developers, we are interested in writing pure code in Java which can then be converted into Java byte-code for mass deployment. As developers, we do ''not'' need to write Java byte-code, rather we write the code in the Java programming language (which is quite similar to writing C or C++ code).

Upon downloading the JDK, a developer ensures that their system has the appropriate JRE and additional tools to help with the development of applications in the Java programming language. Java code can be found in files with the extension '''.java'''. These files are called '''''Java source files'''''. In order to convert the Java code in these source files to Java byte-code, you need to use the '''Java compiler''' tool installed with your JDK.

===The Java compiler===
The '''Java compiler''' tool (named '''javac''' in the JDK) is the most important utility found with the JDK.  In order to compile a Java source file (say, &lt;code&gt;SomeApplication.java&lt;/code&gt;) to its respective Java byte-code, you would need to use the following command in Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Linux or Mac OS):
{{XConsole|1='''Compilation'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
javac SomeApplication.java
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

This command would convert the &lt;code&gt;SomeApplication.java&lt;/code&gt; source file into its equivalent Java byte-code. The resultant byte-code would exist in a newly created file named &lt;code&gt;SomeApplication.class&lt;/code&gt;. This process of converting Java source files into their equivalent byte-codes is known as '''''compilation'''''.

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=A list of other JDK tools}}
There are a huge array of tools available with the JDK that will all be explained in due time as you progress with the book. These tools are briefly listed below in order of their usage:

===Applet development===
* &lt;code&gt;appletviewer&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Java applets require a particular environment to execute. Typically, this environment is provided by a browser with a Java plug-in, and a web server serving the applet. However, during development and testing of an applet it might be more convenient to start an applet without the need to fiddle with a browser and a web server. In such a case, Oracle's appletviewer from the JDK can be used to run an applet.

===Annotation processing===
: ''For more about annotation processing, [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/GettingStarted.html read this]''

In Java 1.5 (alias Java 5.0) Oracle added a mechanism called ''annotations''. Annotations allow the addition of meta-data to Java source code, and even provide mechanisms to carry that meta-data forth into a compiled &lt;code&gt;.class&lt;/code&gt; files.

* &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; An annotation processing tool which digs through source code, finds annotation statements in the source code and executes actions if it finds known annotations. The most common task is to generate some particular source code. The actions apt performs when finding annotations in the source code are not hard-coded into apt. Instead, one has to code particular annotation handlers (in Java). These handlers are called annotation processors. It can also be described in a simple way without the Oracle terminology: apt can be seen as a source code preprocessor framework, and annotation processors are typically code generators.

===Integration of non-Java and Java code===
* &lt;code&gt;javah&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; A Java class can call native, or non-Java, code that has been prepared to be called from Java. The details and procedures are specified in the JNI (Java Native Interface). Commonly, native code is written in C (or C++). The JDK tool javah helps to write the necessary C code, by generating C header files and C stub code.

===Class library conflicts===
* &lt;code&gt;extcheck&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; It can be used prior to the installation of a Java extension into the JDK or JRE environment. It checks if a particular Jar file conflicts with an already installed extension. This tool appeared first with Java 1.5.

===Software security and cryptography tools===
The JDK comes with a large number of tools related to the security features of Java. Usage of these tools first requires study of the particular security mechanisms. The tools are:

* &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; To manage keys and certificates
* &lt;code&gt;jarsigner&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; To generate and verify digital signatures of JARs (Java ARchives)
* &lt;code&gt;policytool&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; To edit policy files
* &lt;code&gt;kinit&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; To obtain Kerberos v5 tickets
* &lt;code&gt;klist&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; To manage Kerberos credential cache and key table
* &lt;code&gt;ktab&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; To manage entries in a key table

===The Java archiver===
* &lt;code&gt;jar&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; (short for Java archiver) is a tool for creating Java archives or jar files &amp;mdash; a file with &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; as the extension. A Java archive is a collection of compiled Java classes and other resources which those classes may require (such as text files, configuration files, images) at runtime. Internally, a jar file is really a [[w:ZIP (file format)|.zip file]].

===The Java debugger===
* &lt;code&gt;jdb&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; (short for Java debugger) is a command-line console that provides a [[w:Debugging|debugging]] environment for Java programs. Although you can use this command line console, IDE's normally provide easier to use debugging environments.

===Documenting code with Java===
As programs grow large and complex, programmers need ways to track changes and to understand the code better at each step of its evolution. For decades, programmers have been employing the use of special programming constructs called comments &amp;mdash; regions that help declare user definitions for a code snippet within the source code. But comments are prone to be verbose and incomprehensible, let alone be difficult to read in applications having hundreds of lines of code.

* &lt;code&gt;javadoc&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Java provides the user with a way to easily publish documentation about the code using a special commenting system and the javadoc tool. The javadoc tool generates documentation about the Application Programming Interface (API) of a set of user-created Java classes. javadoc reads source file comments from the &lt;code&gt;.java&lt;/code&gt; source files and generates HTML documents that are easier to read and understand without looking at the code itself.

* &lt;code&gt;javap&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Where Javadoc provide a detailed view into the API and documentation of a Java class, the javap tool prints information regarding members (constructors, methods and variables) in a class. In other words, it lists the class' API and/or the compiled instructions of the class. javap is a formatting disassembler for Java bytecode.

===The native2ascii tool===
&lt;code&gt;native2ascii&lt;/code&gt; is an important, though underappreciated, tool for writing properties files &amp;mdash; files containing configuration data &amp;mdash; or resource bundles &amp;mdash; files containing language translations of text.

Such files can contain only ASCII and Latin-1 characters, but international programmers need a full range of character sets. Text using these characters can appear in properties files and resource bundles only if the non-ASCII and non-Latin-^1 characters are converted into [[Java Programming/Syntax/Unicode Escape Sequences|Unicode escape sequences]] (\uXXXX notation).

The task of writing such escape sequences is handled by &lt;code&gt;native2ascii&lt;/code&gt;. You can write the international text in an editor using the appropriate character encoding, then use &lt;code&gt;native2ascii&lt;/code&gt; to generate the necessary ASCII text with embedded Unicode escape sequences. Despite the name, &lt;code&gt;native2ascii&lt;/code&gt; can also convert from ASCII to native, so it is useful for converting an existing properties file or resource bundle back to some other encoding.

&lt;code&gt;native2ascii&lt;/code&gt; makes most sense when integrated into a build system to automate the conversion.

===Remote Method Invocation (RMI) tools===

===Java IDL and RMI-IIOP Tools===
{{TODO|1=Add section}}

===Deployment &amp; Web Start Tools===
{{TODO|1=Add section}}

===Browser Plug-In Tools===
{{TODO|1=Add section}}

===Monitoring and Management Tools / Troubleshooting Tools===
With Java 1.5 a set of monitoring and management tools have been added to the JDK, in addition to a set of troubleshooting tools.

The monitoring and management tools are intended for monitoring and managing the virtual machine and the execution environment. They allow, for example, monitoring memory usage during the execution of a Java program.

The troubleshooting tools provide rather esoteric insight into aspects of the virtual machine. (Interestingly, the Java debugger is not categorized as a troubleshooting tool.)

All the monitoring and management and troubleshooting tools are currently marked as &quot;experimental&quot; (which does not affect jdb). So they might disappear in future JDKs.
{{Hidden end}}

===Java class libraries (JCL)===
In most modern operating systems, a large body of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer's job.  This code is typically provided as a set of [[w:Library (computer science)#Dynamic linking|dynamically loadable libraries]] that applications can call at runtime.  Because the Java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system, applications cannot rely on any of the existing libraries.  Instead, the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of standard class libraries, containing much of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems.

The Java class libraries serve three purposes within the Java platform.  Like other standard code libraries, they provide the programmer with a well-known set of functions to perform common tasks, such as maintaining lists of items or performing complex string parsing.  In addition, the class libraries provide an abstract interface to tasks that would normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system.  Tasks such as network access and file access are often heavily dependent on the native capabilities of the platform.  The Java java.net and java.io libraries implement the required native code internally, then provide a standard interface for the Java applications to perform those tasks.  Finally, some underlying platforms may not support all of the features a Java application expects.  In these cases, the class libraries can either emulate those features using whatever is available, or provide a consistent way to check for the presence of a specific feature.

==Similar concepts==
The success of the Java platform and the concepts of the write once, run anywhere principle has led to the development of similar frameworks and platforms. Most notable of these is the Microsoft's [[w:.NET Framework|.NET framework]] and its open-source equivalent [[w:Mono (software)|Mono]].

===The .NET framework===
The .NET framework borrows many of the concepts and innovations of Java &amp;mdash; their alternative for the JVM is called the [[w:Common Language Runtime|Common Language Runtime (CLR)]], while their alternative for the byte-code is the [[w:Common Intermediate Language|Common Intermediate Language (CIL)]]. In fact, the .NET platform had an implementation of a Java-like language called [[w:J Sharp|Visual J#]] (formerly known as [[w:J plus plus|J++]]).

J# is normally not supported with the JVM because instead of compiling it in Java byte-code, the .NET platform compiles the code into CIL, thus making J# different from the Java programming language. Furthermore, because J# implements the .NET Base Class Libraries (BCL) instead of the Java Class Libraries, J# is nothing more than a non-standard extension of the Java programming language. Due to the lack of interest from developers, Microsoft had to withdraw their support for J#, and focused on a similar programming language: C#.

===Third-party compilers targeting the JVM===
The word Java, by itself, usually refers to the Java programming language which was designed for use with the Java platform. Programming languages are typically outside of the scope of the phrase &quot;platform&quot;.  However, Oracle does not encourage the use of any other languages with the platform, and lists the Java programming language as a core part of the Java 2 platform. The language and runtime are therefore commonly considered a single unit.

There are cases where you might want to program using a different language (say, [[w:Python (programming language)|Python]]) and yet be able to generate Java byte-code (instead of the Python compiled code) to be run with the JVM. Many third-party programming language vendors provide compilers that can compile code written in their language to Java byte-code. For instance, Python developers can use [[w:Jython|Jython]] compilers to compile Python code to the Java byte-code format (''as illustrated below'').

{{Java/Illustration

|caption=Third-party JVM-targeted compilation for non-Java source compilation to Java byte-code. Illustrated example&lt;br&gt;shows Python source being compiled to both Python compiled code and Java byte-code.
|image=[[File:Third-party JVM-targeted Compilation.svg|center]]
}}

Of late, JVM-targeted third-party programming and scripting languages have seen tremendous growth. Some of these languages are also used to extend the functionalities of the Java language itself. A few examples include the following:
* [[w:Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]]
* [[w:Pizza (programming language)|Pizza]]
* [[w:Generic Java (programming language)|GJ]] (Generic Java) &amp;ndash; later officially incorporated into Java SE 5.
* [[w:NetREXX|NetREXX]]

[[Image:Werner Heisenberg at 1927 Solvay Conference.JPG|thumb|right|[[w:Werner Heisenberg|Werner Heisenberg]]]]
At the smallest levels of our universe there is chaos.  Because of the [[w:Uncertainty_Principle|Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] we can only describe &quot;truth&quot; to within a certain tolerance.  This doesn't mean that we can't call anything &quot;truth,&quot; it just means that &quot;truth&quot; is the same as &quot;something likely to be true&quot; except with a smaller [[w:Standard_deviation|standard deviation]].

As [[w:Quantum_Mechanics|quantum mechanics]] grew in popularity over the twentieth century, a [[w:Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics|new type]] of mathematics developed to describe our world in terms of ''probability'' instead of ''absolutes''.  One of the most basic ingredients of this new mathematical structure is that of [[w:Time_evolution|time evolution]].  Given the [[w:State_%28physics%29|state]] and the [[w:Observable|properties]] of a system, time evolution quantifies how the system will change over time.  In other words, it predicts the future.

By using the [[w:Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics#Mathematical_structure_of_quantum_mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]], futurologists objectify the probabilities of the future using the quantum tools that were originally established for objectifying the probabilities of the present.
==Schrödinger's Cat==
[[Image:Schrödinger cat.png|thumb|200px|[[Wikipedia:Schrödinger's Cat|The Cat Experiment]]]]
Schrödinger's cat is a seemingly paradoxical thought experiment devised by Erwin Schrödinger that attempts to illustrate the incompleteness of an early interpretation of quantum mechanics when going from subatomic to macroscopic systems. The experiment proposes:
:A cat is placed in a sealed box. Attached to the box is an apparatus containing a radioactive nucleus and a canister of poison gas. This apparatus is separated from the cat in such a way that the cat can in no way interfere with it. The experiment is set up so that there is exactly a 50% chance of the nucleus decaying in one hour. If the nucleus decays, it will emit a particle that triggers the apparatus, which opens the canister and kills the cat. If the nucleus does not decay, then the cat remains alive. According to quantum mechanics, the unobserved nucleus is described as a superposition (meaning it exists partly as each simultaneously) of &quot;decayed nucleus&quot; and &quot;undecayed nucleus&quot;. However, when the box is opened the experimenter sees only a &quot;decayed nucleus/dead cat&quot; or an &quot;undecayed nucleus/living cat.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Diabetic Embryopathy'''

==Etiology and natural history==

*Diabetic embryopathy is a clinical diagnosis based on one or more congenital anomalies or fetal/neonatal complications in a baby that are attributed to his/her mother's diabetes
*Three main kinds of diabetes mellitus; if a mother has any of these three types, there is a significant risk for pregnancy complications and future health problems for mother and her offspring
**Type I
***Insulin dependent
***Juvenile onset
***Prone to ketosis
***Body does not produce insulin because cells that produce insulin are attacked by immune system
***Multifactorial causes, but those with family history are at higher risk
***Tx: daily insulin injections
**Type II
***Non-insulin dependent
***Adult onset
***Not prone to ketosis
***Body does not produce enough insulin or cells cannot use insulin properly
***Inherited as an incompletely penetrating AR trait, but is definitely multifactorial
***Tx: diet, exercise, and sometimes medication
**Type III (Gestational diabetes)
***Onset during pregnancy
***Multifactorial causes, but those with family history of any diabetes are at higher risk
***Tx: consistent monitoring of blood sugar level, diet and exercise; occasionally, insulin is required
***Occurs in 1-4% of all pregnancies (higher in African American and Hispanic populations)
***20-50% of women who develop gestational diabetes will develop type II diabetes in the next 5-10 years.
*High blood sugar levels and ketones (substances that in large amounts are poisonous to the body) pass through the placenta to the baby, increasing the chance of birth defects
*When extra sugar is in a mother's blood during pregnancy, the baby is &quot;fed&quot; extra sugar, too, leading to a bigger baby that is harder to deliver
*It is not well-understood if the administration of insulin has teratogenic effects on the fetus; however, outcomes are definitely better when insulin is used to treat insulin-dependent maternal diabetes than when not

==Clinical features==
*All maternal and fetal features noted here are more severe and/or common when diabetic control is poor during pregnancy; nevertheless, even with good diabetic control, these features are observed
*Maternal morbidity factors in diabetic pregnancies which can increase a baby's risk for birth defects:
**Ketoacidosis
**Polyhydramnios
**Preeclampsia/chronic hypertension
**Preterm labor
**Cesarean section
*Fetal complications and birth defects associated with maternal diabetes
**Cardiac anomalies: most commonly VSD or TGV
**DiGeorge anomaly: due to abnormal neural crest cell migration; affects normal fetal development of the heart, thymus, and parathyroid glands
**NTD's: thought to be due to maternal diabetic factors causing improper embryonic folding; most commonly spina bifida and anencephaly
**Macrosomia: occurs in ~ 1/3 of all diabetic pregnancies; can cause life-long obesity for child
**IUGR: thought to be due to nutrient limitation associated with maternal hypertension.
**SAB: debated somewhat, but appears to be increased in pregnancies with poor diabetic control
**Caudal regression: agenesis of sacrum and lumbar spine, hypoplasia of lower extremities; thought to be due to improper embryonic folding caused by maternal diabetic factors
**Abnormal postnatal neurologic development: thought to be due to effects of ketosis
*Perinatal and neonatal complications associated with maternal diabetes
**Fetal asphyxia: can cause cerebral palsy as well as affecting many other systems such as pulmonary, GI, and cardiovascular
**Preterm birth: can lead to respiratory distress syndrome; occurs in ~ 30% of diabetic pregnancies, even when diabetic control has been meticulous
**Hypoglycemia: can cause seizures, coma, and brain damage if not recognized and treated quickly
**Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia: thought to be caused primarily by premature birth and its affects on parathyroid function
**Hyperbilirubinemia: thought to be caused primarily by premature birth
**Cardiomyopathy and/or cardiomegaly: most commonly seen in macrosomic infants of poorly controlled diabetic mothers

==Surveillance and Treatment==
*Preconceptionally
**Counseling recommended for all women with overt diabetes or a history of gestational diabetes
**Severity of woman's disease should be considered
**Woman should be apprised of possible complications to herself and her child
*During pregnancy
**Should be handled by a team of healthcare workers including: perinatologist, endocrinologist, dietician, and social worker
**Patient should be seen every 4-8 weeks, and should be considered &quot;high risk&quot;
**Mother should be closely monitored for diabetic control so that adjustments can be made for insulin, diet, and exercise
***Insulin therapy can be altered in many ways, including continuous subcutaneous infusion if necessary
***Must be careful to not over-insulinize mother and cause hypoglycemia
**Surveillance for health risks to mother should be closely monitored, including: cardiovascular health, renal function, blood pressure, weight gain
**Maternal serum screening should be done at 16 weeks
**Fetus should be monitored regularly via level II ultrasound for detection of macrosomia, IUGR, cardiac anomalies, NTDs, and any other associated conditions
*At birth
**Delaying delivery until term is often contraindicated when baby is macrosomic or when mother is preeclampsic
**Cesarean section rate is about 30-50% in diabetic pregnancies
**Delivery should occur at facility prepared to deal with fetal and maternal complications associated with diabetic pregnancy
*Postpartum management
**Infant should be closely monitored for associated conditions; EKG and serum tests should be run
**Mother's insulin should be closely monitored; many women need less insulin directly following delivery

==Psychosocial issues==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Down Syndrome - Trisomy 21'''

==Introduction==
*What have you been told about why you were referred to Genetics?
*Was a prenatal diagnosis of Down Syndrome made?
*Were chromosome studies performed?
*What do you already know about Down Syndrome?
*What are your main concerns? What would you like to gain from this session?

==Intake and Family History==
*Explain that all of their concerns will be addressed later in the session, but that I would like to take a medical history and family history first.
*The history may help us to explain your concerns better.
*The questions I ask are all standard questions we ask to everyone and does not necessarily mean that any thing you did during pregnancy is responsible for causing a problem with your child.
*A pedigree helps us identify any health problems that seem to &quot;run in the family&quot;. This may include things that may not be directly related to Down Syndrome.
*While taking the pedigree ask about any family members who have had miscarriages, birth defects, mental retardation, learning difficulties, or health problems
*Obtain as much psychosocial history as possible throughout the session and address any other questions near the end when available resources are provided and when psychosocial issues or concerns are ascertained and addressed.

*Obtain as much psychosocial history as possible throughout the session and address any other questions near the end when available resources are provided and when psychosocial issues or concerns are ascertained and addressed.

==Physical Characteristics==
*Children with Down Syndrome are all unique individuals in personality and appearance.
*They do however have certain physical characteristics in common with other children with Down Syndrome. These Include:
**Muscle hypotonia (low muscle tone)
**Flattened midface due to underdevelopment
**somewhat depressed nasal bridge and small nose
**Oblique palpebral fissures (an upward slant to the eyes)
**Epicanthal folds (small skin folds on the inner corner of the eyes)
**Dysplastic ear, small, low-set, lopped pinnae
**Simian crease (60%) A single deep crease across the center of the palm
**Hyperextensible joints
**Clinodactyly (Dysplastic middle phalanx) of the fifth finger, fifth finger has one flexion furrow instead of two (single interdigital crease)
**Brachydactyly (shortened fingers)
**Excessive space between large and second toe (sandal toe)
**Small mouth, protruding tongue
**brushfield spots (white fluffy spots on iris)

*It is important to note that these children generally look much more like their parents than other Down syndrome patients.

==Alternative Diagnosis==
*Down Syndrome is common and distinctive and is not often confused with other syndromes.
*Confusion most common in &quot;normal neonates with one or more of the common signs or minor anomalies, but absence of other common signs and the facial gestalt should avoid the error.&quot;
*Smith Magenis syndrome has some overlapping features including:
**brachycephaly, round face, upslanting palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia, small wide nose, Wolfflin-Kruckmann iris spots that may be confulsed with Brushfield spots
**other signs of Down Syndrome are absent
*Zellweger syndrome, a peroxisomal disorder which shares findings including:
**hypotonia, sarge fontanels, flat occiput and face, anteverted nares, epicanthal folds, Brushfield spots, cataracts, abnormal helices, single palmar crease, cardiac septal defects
**distinguishing signs include: severe early developmental delay, seizures, a high forehead, shallow orbits, hepatomegaly, joint contractures, confirmed by finding elevated plasma very-long -chain fatty acids

==Developmental Issues==
*Mental challenges
**occurs in most patients with Down Syndrome. With the advent of early intervention and inclusive educational models, there are more individuals with Down syndrome who test within normal IQ range than was previously seen. 
**usually mild - moderate mean IQ is 45-48 and upper limit about 70 (mental age equivalent for mean is 5.5 years and ranges from 1-9 years) but IQ is poor measure of the spectrum of abilities that may be highly variable.
**no way to predict the severity, but can get a better idea of the degree of mental retardation around the age of two
*&quot;Children with Down syndrome learn to sit, walk, talk, play, toilet train and do most other activities - only somewhat later than their peers without Down syndrome.&quot;
*&quot;Early intervention services, which begin shortly after birth, help children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential.&quot;
*Most will continue to require some level of day-to-day supervision throughout life, however every year there are more individuals who live independent lives. 
*Some individuals with Down syndrome are able to drive, and it is becoming more common in several countries.

==Life Expectancy and Special Health Concerns==
*80% live to age 55 and many live even longer
*mortality rates remain high during the first 5 years because of congenital heart defects, infection, pneumonia, leukemia
*Congenital heart disease in approximately 40-50% of patients
**VSD or ASD are most common types
**AV canal defects and other heart anomalies are also found
**(all newborns should be seen by cardiologist for an echocardiogram)
*Pulmonary hypertension
**common and can mask a heart defect by making a murmur difficult to hear
*GI anomalies in 10-15 %
**Duodenal atresia
**Tracheoesophageal fistula
**imperforate anus
**Hirschsprung disease
**constipation common during infancy
*Hearing
**(have hearing checked at birth via auditory brainstem response test (ABR) and every 6 months until 3 years old via behavioral audiology once developmental age of 7-8 months is reached)
**Frequent ear infections
**sinusitis
**conductive hearing loss
*Opthalmologic
**Refer for screening by 6 months of age and yearly or for any of the following if suspected:
**Congenital cataracts
**Estropia
**Glaucoma
**Strabismus
*Obstructive sleep apnea of some degree in over 60% due to small oropharynx with relatively large tongue.
**Manifest by loud snoring, stop breathing, waking up a lot throughout the night
*Hypothyroidism in 10-15% (should screen at 6 months and yearly)
*Atlanto-axial instability
**x-ray findings of cervical spine instability in 10%
**only 1-2% develop spinal compression
**(x-ray should be scheduled between 3-5 years of age or as needed for special olympics)
*Hematologic
**Increased risk of leukemia (15-20 times greater than general population)
**Majority of cases occur in first 3 years of life with high cure rate
**Transient form can be seen in newborn and disappear during first 2 - 3 months of life
*Alzheimer disease
**Increased risk of about 25% compared to 6% among general population
**onset in 40's or 50's
*Most females are fertile, but have reproduction problems (irregular ovulation, miscarriage, preterm labor, etc.)
*Almost all males are infertile due to defective spermatogenesis

0 = 0

==Recurrence Risk for next pregnancy==
*1% if nondisjunction or maternal age-adjusted risk if that is greater (this represents an increased risk for patients under age 30 and we're unsure why)
*recurrence risk for familial 14/21 translocation varies according to which parent is affected by balanced Robertsonian translocation (3-5% males 10-15% females)
*100% if parent has 21/21 translocation (rare)
*no increased risk if child has a de novo translocation

==Prenatal Diagnosis==
*Screening tests
**Triple screen can often indicate an increased risk but not diagnostic (70% ascertainment and 5% false positive)
**Level II ultrasound can pick up signs seen in Downs syndrome, but not diagnostic about 60-66% of fetuses with Down Syndrome are detected
*Diagnostic testing
*chorionic villus sampling usually performed at around 10-12 weeks LMP
*amniocentesis usually performed 15-20 weeks after LMP

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Get a feel for how well they have adjusted to and accepted the idea of having a child with Down Syndrome. &quot;How are you feeling about having a child with Down Syndrome?&quot;
*Normalize any feelings of grief that they might be experiencing &quot;Many people feel sad and feel like they have lost something when they find out that something might be wrong with their child.&quot;
*Explain that feelings of guilt and blame can be common too, but stress that nothing they could have done would have caused or prevented this.
*How have other family members and friends reacted? How much support are your receiving? (perhaps if they have other children see who helps take care of them)
*Alternative placement could be discussed - explain that adoptive homes are available through Down Syndrome Association (waiting list)

==Resources==
*Provide with written materials
*Arrange Individualized Family service Plan (IFSP) children birth to 3 and Individualized educational Plan (IEP) from age 4 until end of formal schooling
*Early Intervention Programs via County Board of MR/DD probably not available for Kentucky residents (Infant program which involves weekly visits at home by a therapist)
*Financial assistance (Supplemental Security Income? SSI)
*Follow up letter

== Interrupt ==

Sometimes things will happen in a system when the processor is simply not ready. In fact, sometimes things change that require immediate attention. Can you imagine, sitting at your PC, that you were to hit buttons on the keyboard, and nothing happens on your computer?
&lt;BR&gt;
Maybe the processor was busy, and it just didnt check to see if you were hitting any buttons at that time. The solution to this problem is something called an &quot;Interrupt.&quot; Interrupts are events that cause the microprocessor to stop what it is doing, and handle a high-priority task first. After the interrupt is handled, the microprocessor goes back to whatever it was doing before. In this way, we can be assured that high-priority inputs are never ignored.

== Hardware and Software ==

There are two types of interrupts: Hardware and Software. Software interrupts are called from software, using a specified command. Hardware interrupts are triggered by peripheral devices outside the microcontroller. For instance, your embedded system may contain a timer that sends a pulse to the controller every second. Your microcontroller would wait until this pulse is received, and when the pulse comes, an interrupt would be triggered that would handle the signal.

== Interrupt Service Routines ==

Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) are the portions of the program code that handle the interrupt requests. When an Interrupt is triggered (either a hardware or software interrupt), the processor breaks away from the current task, moves the instruction pointer to the ISR, and then continues operation. When the ISR has completed, the processor returns execution to the previous location.

Many embedded systems are called '''interrupt driven systems''', because most of the processing occurs in ISRs, and the embedded system spends most of its time in a low-power mode.

Some people split an ISR into two parts: top-half (fast interrupt handler, First-Level Interrupt Handler (FLIH)) and bottom-half (slow interrupt handler, Second-Level Interrupt Handlers (SLIH)). Top-half is a faster part of ISR which should quickly store minimal information about interrupt and schedule slower bottom-half at a later time.

We discuss two-level interrupt handling and other ways of writing interrupt handlers in [[../Microprocessor Architectures#Interrupt architecture | interrupt architecture]].

== Interrupt Vector Table ==

The &quot;Interrupt Vector Table&quot; is a list of every interrupt service routine.
It is located at a fixed location in program memory.
&lt;BR&gt;
(Some processors expect the interrupt vector table to be a series of &quot;call&quot; instructions, each one followed by the address of the ISR.
Other processors expect the interrupt vector table to hold just the ISR addresses alone.)

You must make sure that every entry in the interrupt vector table is filled with the address of some actual ISR, even if it means making most of them point to the &quot;do nothing and return from interrupt&quot; ISR.

== Interrupt flags ==

The PIC18 and PIC16 series of processors have a single interrupt handler,
a single global interrupt enable bit, and a whole array of bits in the interrupt hardware.
Each possible source of interrupts has a pair of bits in the interrupt hardware --
a &quot;flag&quot; bit that is set whenever some piece of hardware wants attention, as if it's waving a flag trying to attract attention,
and an &quot;enable&quot; bit that controls whether the processor will ignore that flag, or stop everything
and run the interrupt handler.
(Confusingly, some people refer to both bits as &quot;flags&quot; -- in this section, we refer to the &quot;request attention&quot; bits as flag bits, and the &quot;ignore or not&quot; bits as enable bits).

When an interrupt occurs on an 8-bit PICmicro (PIC18 or PIC16), the hardware clears the global interrupt enable bit, then starts running the one and only interrupt handler.
The interrupt handler software must somehow check all the things that could have possibly caused the interrupt --
typically by checking each interrupt flag one by one --
and handle each one (if necessary).

The 680x0 and x86 and dsPIC and PIC24 and many other processors have many interrupt vectors.
When some piece of hardware requests attention on such a processor,
the hardware vectors to and runs the specific interrupt handler for that particular bit of hardware.

== Writing interrupt routines ==

Many people write interrupt routines in C.
A programmer who uses &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;
declares an interrupt handler very similar to declaring a normal function, something like this:&lt;ref&gt;
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void __attribute__ ((interrupt)) universal_handler ();
&lt;/source&gt;

Alas, there is no standard way to write interrupt handlers in portable C.
Every C compiler seems to use its own keywords
incompatible with the keywords for any other C compiler.
Even with gcc, the favored interrupt declaration varies from one processor to another.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/manual/x918.html &quot;Writing interrupt service routines in C for the Texas Instruments MSP430&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html &quot;writing interrupt handlers in C for the Atmel AVR&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other programmers use C compilers that do not support
writing interrupt handlers directly in C.
They are forced to write the interrupt handler in assembly language,
doing by hand the things the compiler does for the previous group of people:

An interrupt routine typically begins with a bunch of boilerplate code
that pushes the status register and other stuff to the stack,
and ends with another bunch of boilerplate code to restore all that stuff
so whatever code was interrupted can continue from exactly where it left off.
That boilerplate code is very different from one processor family to another --
and has some key differences from the normal
[[Embedded Systems/Mixed C and Assembly Programming#Calling Conventions | calling convention]]
prologue and epilogue.

The compiler (or an assembly language programmer) writes in the interrupt vector table a pointer to that interrupt handler.

One extremely common problem is trying to do &quot;too much&quot; in an interrupt routine.
Alas, often the symptoms only occur when two different interrupt routines are triggered more-or-less simultaneously, leading to difficult-to-debug intermittent errors and a lot of finger-pointing. Unfortunately, the person who wrote one interrupt routine points out that his routine works fine when run alone, and the person who wrote the other interrupt routine points out that his routine works fine when run alone, and all too often they each blame the other person for the problems that occur when both interrupts occur.
One common symptom of an interrupt routine (possibly the UART interrupt handler, but often some other seemingly unrelated interrupt routine) taking &quot;too long&quot; is losing some, but not all of the characters in a stream of characters coming in over the UART.&lt;ref name=&quot;ashby_overrun&quot;&gt;
Robert Ashby.
[https://web.archive.org/web/20081203130504/http://archive.chipcenter.com/eexpert/rashby/rashby073.html &quot;Catching the Overrun&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is difficult to calculate how much time an interrupt handler will take,
it is common to directly measure how long interrupt handlers actually take.
One popular debugging technique is to write interrupt handlers such that
the interrupt handler sets a test pin high at the beginning of every interrupt routine, and
the interrupt handler clears the test pin low at the end of every interrupt routine.
An o'scope attached to that pin shows the actual execution time of that interrupt handler.&lt;ref name=&quot;ashby_overrun&quot; /&gt;

==General Information==
*Dystrophinopathies
**Characterized by a spectrum of muscle disease that ranges from mild to severe
**Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy is severe
***Skeletal muscle is primarily affected in both
***DMD is rapidly progressive and presents in early childhood.
****Patients are often wheelchair-bound by age 12
***Becker is characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness
****Patients remain ambulatory into their 20s
*Dystrophin gene
**Xp21.2
**Encodes protein dystrophin
**Often deletions or duplications involving exons of this gene
**Molecular genetic testing is available clinically
*Prevalence
**1 in 5,600 live male births
**1/3 of patients are new mutations and the mother is not a carrier

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical
**Family history
***Compatible with X-linked recessive inheritance
**Creatine Phosphokinase (CK) concentration
***Evaluated by blood test
***Elevated serum CK concentration results from progressive elimination of dystrophic muscle fibers.
****Can also result from strenuous exercise
***CK concentration gradually decreases with advancing age due to the progressive elimination of these muscle fibers.
***100% of males with DMD have a serum CK concentration &gt;10x normal
***~50% of female carriers have a concentration 2-10x normal
****Some investigations have shown a wide variability in DMD carriers
****Many have levels within the normal range, so other tests are necessary
****CPK is not completely reliable
**Muscle biopsy
***Histology
****Shows non-specific dystrophic changes
***Western blot and immunohistochemistry
****Dystrophin protein is often completely or almost completely absent
**Clinical findings
***Progressive symmetrical muscle weakness, proximal greater than distal
***Symptoms before age 5 years
***Wheelchair dependency before age 13 years
*Molecular genetic testing
**Deletions involving one or more exons of the DMD gene
***~65% of males with DMD have deletions
***Most deletions occur in two hotspots clustered around the first 20 exons and around exons 45 to 55.
***Testing is done by PCR or southern blot
***Available on a clinical basis
**Duplications of one or more exons of the DMD gene
***~6% of males with DMD have a duplication
***Testing is done by southern blot or quantitative PCR
***Available on a clinical basis
**Other mutations in the DMD gene
***~30% of males with DMD have other mutations including small deletions or insertions, single base changes, or splicing mutations
***Analysis is available on a research basis only
**Carrier testing may be performed but requires quantitative analysis for gene dosage which can be difficult to perform and interpret
**Prenatal testing is available

==Clinical Description==
*Males
**DMD usually presents in early childhood with delayed milestones
***This included delays in sitting and standing
***First symptoms are typically:
****General motor delay
****Gait problems including persistent toe-walking and flat-footedness
****Delay in walking
*****Mean age of walking is about 18 months
****Learning difficulties
****Speech problems
**Mean age of diagnosis without a family history is about 4 years
***Range of diagnosis is 16 months to 8 years
**DMD is rapidly progressive
***Proximal weakness causes a waddling gait and difficulty climbing
***Boys use the Gower maneuver to rise from a supine position, using the arms to supplement weak pelvic girdle muscles
***The calf muscles are hypertrophic and firm to palpation
***Occasionally there is calf pain
***Affected children are wheelchair-bound by age 12
***Mean age of death is 17 or 18 years of age
**Cardiomyopathy
***Incidence increases steadily in the teenage years
****1/3 of patients are affected by age 14
****½ by age 18
****All patients are affected after age 18
***Few affected males survive beyond the third decade
****Respiratory complications and cardiomyopathy are common causes of death
**Cognitive impairment
***Some degree of nonprogressive impairment is common
***Affects the verbal ability more than nonverbal performance
**Phenotype correlates with the degree of expression of dystrophin
***Expression is largely determine by the reading frame of the spliced message
*Females
**Occasionally have DMD clinical features as the result of X chromosome rearrangements involving the DMD locus (Xp21.2)
**Carriers can have DMD because of Turner syndrome of nonrandom X chromosome inactivation
**76% of DMD carriers have no signs or symptoms
*Management
**There is no treatment for DMD
***Prednisone therapy is controversial due to side effects
****Some report improvement in strength and function which begins within 10 days and plateaus after 3 months
****Long term benefit has not been demonstrated
**Appropriate management can prolong survival and improve quality of life
***Physical therapy to promote mobility
****Range-of-motion exercises
***Braces to delay the onset of contractures
***Monitoring and surgical intervention for orthopedic complications
****Scoliosis, kyphosis, or lordosis
***Routine monitoring for evidence of cardiomyopathy
**All carriers should have a complete cardiac evaluation at least once

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
**A group of disorders clinically similar to DMD
**Occurs in both sexes
**Caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcoglycans and other proteins that interact with dystrophin
*Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
**Associated with limb contractures and cardiac arrhythmia
**X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms
**Caused by mutations in the LMNA gene
*Spinal muscular atrophy
**Caused by mutations in the SMN gene
**Characterized by:
***Poor muscle tone
***Symmetric muscle weakness that spares the face and ocular muscles
***Evidence of anterior horn cell involvement
****Includes fasciculations of the tongue and absence of deep tendon reflexes
*Dilated cardiomyopathy
**Can be sporadic or familial
*No other phenotypes are associated with mutations in the DMD gene

==Inheritance==
*X-linked recessive
**Carrier females have a 50% chance of transmitting the DMD mutation in each pregnancy
**With each pregnancy, a carrier has a 25% chance of having an affected child
*Risk to family members
**A woman with an affected son and one other affected relative in the maternal line is an obligate heterozygote
**A woman with more than one affected son and no other family history can have:
***A germline mutation
****DMD disease-causing mutation present in every cell
***Germline mosaicism
****Mosaicism for a DMD disease-causing mutation which includes the germline
****The frequency of germline mosaicism in DMD is estimated at 12% to 20%
**If proband is only affected family member, must determine if mother and other females are carriers
***The proband may have a de novo DMD disease-causing mutation
****The mutation could have occurred in the egg at the time of conception
****The mutation could have occurred after conception and therefore is present in some but not all cells of the proband's body.
****The likelihood that the mother is a carrier is low
***The proband's mother may have a de novo mutation
****2/3 of mothers of sporadically occurring males with DMD are carriers
****Could have occurred if:
*****Mutation occurred in the egg or sperm at the time of her conception and is present in every cell of her body (germline mutation)
*****Mutation is present in some but not all cells of her body (somatic mosaicism)
*****Mutation is present only in her egg cells (germline mosaicism) and is not detected in a blood sample.
***The proband's mother may have inherited a DMD mutation from her mother who is a carrier, her mother or father who has somatic mosaicism, or her mother or father who has germline mosaicism.

==Risk Assessment==
*Sporadic versus inherited
**If inherited, sister has 50% chance of being a carrier
**Bayes analysis takes into account 3 unaffected male siblings
***Sister has a 1/18 or 5.5% chance of being a carrier
**1/3 of cases are due to sporadic mutation

==Review and summarize major points==

==Elicit final questions and concerns==

==Ordering the test==
*Patient must sign consent form for DNA analysis
**Use blue ink so it is obvious which is the original
**Give the patient a copy
**Put the original in the chart
*Use special specimen processing request form
**Make a copy for the chart
**Give a copy to Lori Martineek at E352
*Blood is drawn at Test Referral Center
**Pt must have consent form, 2-ply specimen processing request form, and DNA analysis requisition
**Tell pt to make sure her name is on the tube of blood
**TRC will FedEx to Dr. Prior's lab
*Contact Dr. Thomas W. Prior to inform him that you are sending the sample
**Prior-1@medctr.osu.edu
**Give him clinical history and lab report # from prior testing

==Arrange for Follow-up==
*How do you want to receive the test results?
**Results may take 2-3 weeks
**We will only be able to give the results to the person tested, not to mother
*Give potential risk figures if positive and emphasize that she can come back for more information at any time
**Some people may wait for years until they are thinking of starting a family
*Send a clinic letter after the results are back

==Introduction==

==Contracting==

==Family Hx==

==Medical hx==
*
**Have you ever had muscle weakness
**Difficulty going up/down stairs?
**Muscle cramps easily?
**Ever had your heart monitored by EKG? Result?
**Ever had a CPK test (blood test)
**Ever had a muscle biopsy?

**Muscle weakness?
**Difficulty going up and down stairs?
**Muscle cramps easily?
**Ever had a heart EKG? Result?
**Ever had a CPK test?
**Ever had a muscle biopsy test?

==Why we are talking about this stuff? DMD - the basics==
*What do you know about DMD?
*Prevalence = 1/5600
*Characteristics
**Delays in motor milestones (sitting, standing, walking 20%)
**Progressive symmetrical muscle weakness (proximal greater than distal)
**Calf hypertrophy
**Onset before age of 5 (dx age is usually 4 years 10 months)
**Wheelchair dependency by 13
**Serum CK levels are &gt;10X the normal range
**Cardiomyopathy 100% by age 18
**Death by 30's by respiratory/cardiomyopathy
*Cause
**Change in a gene (DMD) Xp21.3-p21.2 that produces dystrophin, which is a protein in muscle cells, and neurons and holds them in the right place to do their functions. Without it, or with decreased levels of it, the muscle complex is not properly formed.
**Based on family hx (assuming no other affected in upper generations), obligate carrier , germline mutation or germline mosaicism in Pam's mother
*Inheritance - what it means for you!!!
**X linked recessive
**means that since her brothers were affected, we know that Pam has a 50% risk of being a carrier.
**Means that if Pam is a carrier, Sarah has a 50% risk of being a carrier.
**If Sarah is a carrier, she has a 50% chance of passing it on = an affected son or carrier daughter.

==So, what do we do when we suspect a person has DMD/is a carrier? = Testing options==
*Ideally we would test an affected individuals (Pam's brothers)
**Clinical exam
**Family hx
**CPK test
**muscle biopsy
**DNA test
***70% of males with DMD can be diagnosed by running PCR looking for deletions of the exons in the DMD gene. (will find 98% of the deletions identifiable by cDNA hybridization) - clinical
***Small changes in the gene can only be found on research basis only.
*Testing carriers
**Serum creatine phosphokinase concentration levels
***noninvasive blood test
***CK is an enzyme that is present in muscle cells and helps to give our body energy. When muscle degeneration occurs, muscle cells burst open and the CK is released into the blood. So, the test looks at the blood serum (without cells) and measures the levels of CK present. the more there is, the more likely muscle is being broken down.
***50% of female DMD carriers are found to have 2-10 X normal levels
***Normal range is 22-198 U/L (units per liter)
***Hints: do not exercise 24 hours before the test.
**Muscle biopsy
***Invasive test of removing a piece of skeletal muscle.
***Results of carriers will show a mosaic pattern of normal levels of dystrophin and non-normal levels.
***Using linkage studies when affected individuals are willing to participate in testing. Linkage - If we had access to both boy's tissue blocks we could run an informative test.
**Direct DNA testing
***difficult technically because of the presence of two x chromosomes.
***600-700 dollars (billed to insurance)
***We do testing at Baylor Medical Center
***turn around time = 2-3 weeks (say about 4 weeks)
*Prenatal testing
**CVS/amniocentesis to determine the sex of the baby
***if a boy, there is a 50% chance he is affected
**If familial mutation is identified, they can determine the presence of the gene.
**Muscle biopsy for fetus
***VERY specialized - could not be done in Cincinnati

==Questions to consider before testing==
*Why is this information important to you?
*What will you do if the result is uninformative?
*How will knowing you are a carrier affect you?
*THIS IS AN OPTION!!! NOT A REQUIREMENT!!!
*Have you considered how this may affect your reproductive decisions?
*There are a variety of ways to be tested and different levels of complexity, invasiveness and accuracy.
*DNA testing can bring up issues of paternity revelation
*Consent
**the test is &gt;99% accurate but there may be error in the lab
**We will be testing only for those mutations that are recognized as important based on family history
**DNA may be used for research purposes.
**How do you want your results given to you?

==Important management for DMD carriers==
*Although 76% of carriers show no signs at all
*8% have a risk of dilated cardiomyopathy and should be worked up at least once if carrier status is suspected or proven
*19% left ventricle dilation.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

What follows is a simple demo of some of the container
types. It does not cover everything, but should get you
started.

{{Ada/2005}}

==== First Example: Maps ====

The program below prints greetings to the world
in a number of human languages. The greetings are stored
in a table, or hashed map. The map associates every
greeting (a value) with a language code (a key).
That is, you can use language codes as keys
to find greeting values in the table.

The elements in the map are constant strings of international
characters, or really, pointers to such constant strings.
A package &lt;tt&gt;Regional&lt;/tt&gt; is used to set up both
the language IDs and an instance of
{{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Hashed_Maps}}.

  {{Ada/Sourceforge|regional.ads}}

 {{Ada/keyword |with}} Ada.Containers.Hashed_Maps;  {{Ada/keyword |use}} Ada.Containers;
 
 {{Ada/keyword |package}} Regional {{Ada/keyword |is}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword |type}} Language_ID {{Ada/keyword |is}} (DE, EL, EN, ES, FR, NL);
    {{Ada/comment| a selection from the two-letter codes for human languages}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword |type}} Hello_Text {{Ada/keyword |is}} {{Ada/keyword |access}} {{Ada/keyword |constant}} Wide_String;
    {{Ada/comment| objects will contain a «hello»-string in some language}}
 
 
    {{Ada/keyword |function}} ID_Hashed (id: Language_ID) {{Ada/keyword |return}} Hash_Type;
    {{Ada/comment| you need to provide this to every hashed container}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword |package}} Phrases {{Ada/keyword |is}} {{Ada/keyword |new}} Ada.Containers.Hashed_Maps
      (Key_Type =&gt; Language_ID,
       Element_Type =&gt; Hello_Text,
       Hash =&gt; ID_Hashed,
       Equivalent_Keys =&gt; &quot;=&quot;);
 
 {{Ada/keyword |end}} Regional;

Here is the program, details will be explained later.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|hello_world_extended.ads}}

 {{Ada/keyword |with}} Regional; {{Ada/keyword |use}} Regional;
 {{Ada/keyword |with}} Ada.Wide_Text_IO; {{Ada/keyword |use}} Ada;
 
 {{Ada/keyword |procedure}} Hello_World_Extended {{Ada/keyword |is}}
 
    {{Ada/comment| print greetings in different spoken languages}}
 
    greetings: Phrases.Map;
    {{Ada/comment| the dictionary of greetings}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword |begin}}  -- Hello_World_Extended
 
    Phrases.Insert(greetings,
                   Key =&gt; EN,
                   New_Item =&gt; {{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;));
 
    {{Ada/comment| or, shorter,}}
    greetings.Insert(DE, {{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;Hallo, Welt!&quot;));
    greetings.Insert(NL, {{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;Hallo, Wereld!&quot;));
    greetings.Insert(ES, {{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;¡Hola mundo!&quot;)); 
    greetings.Insert(FR, {{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;Bonjour, Monde!&quot;));
    greetings.Insert(EL, {{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;Γειάσου κόσμος&quot;));
                                        {{Ada/comment| Καλημέρα κόσμε?}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword |declare}}
       {{Ada/keyword |use}} Phrases;
 
       speaker: Cursor := First(greetings);
    {{Ada/keyword |begin}}
       {{Ada/keyword |while}} Has_Element(speaker) {{Ada/keyword |loop}}
          Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line( Element(speaker).{{Ada/keyword |all}} );
          Next(speaker);
       {{Ada/keyword |end}} {{Ada/keyword |loop}};
    {{Ada/keyword |end}};
 
 {{Ada/keyword |end}} Hello_World_Extended;

The first of the &lt;tt&gt;Insert&lt;/tt&gt; statements
is written in an Ada 95 style:

   Phrases.Insert(greetings,
                  Key =&gt; EN,
                  New_Item =&gt; {{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;));

The next insertions
use so called distinguished receiver notation which you
can use in Ada 2005. (It's O-O parlance. While
the Insert call involves all of: a Container object (greetings),
a Key object (EN),
and a New_Item object ({{Ada/keyword |new}} Wide_String'(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)),
the Container object is distinguished
from the others in that the Insert call provides it (and only it) with the other
objects. In this case the Container object will be modified by the
call, using arguments named Key and New_Item for the modification.)

   greetings.Insert(ES, {{Ada/keyword|new}} Wide_String'(&quot;¡Hola mundo!&quot;));

After the table is set up, the program goes on to print all the greetings
contained in the table. It does so employing a cursor that runs
along the elements in the table in some order. The typical scheme
is to obtain a cursor, here using &lt;tt&gt;First&lt;/tt&gt;, and then
to iterate the following calls:

# &lt;tt&gt;Has_Element&lt;/tt&gt;, for checking whether the cursor is at an element
# &lt;tt&gt;Element&lt;/tt&gt;, to get the element and
# &lt;tt&gt;Next&lt;/tt&gt;, to move the cursor to another element

When there is no more element left, the cursor will have the
special value &lt;tt&gt;No_Element&lt;/tt&gt;.
Actually, this is an iteration scheme that can be used with all
containers in child packages of {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers}}.

==== A slight variation: picking an element ====

The next program shows how to pick a value from the map,
given a key. Actually, you will provide the key.
The program is like the previous one, except that it doesn't
just print all the elements in the map, but picks one
based on a Language_ID value that it reads from standard
input.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|hello_world_pick.adb}}

 {{Ada/keyword |with}} Regional; {{Ada/keyword |use}} Regional;
 {{Ada/keyword |with}} Ada.Wide_Text_IO; {{Ada/keyword |use}} Ada;
 
 {{Ada/keyword |procedure}} Hello_World_Pick {{Ada/keyword |is}}
 
   ... as before ...
 
  {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
      {{Ada/keyword |use}} Phrases;
  
      {{Ada/keyword |package}} Lang_IO {{Ada/keyword |is}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} Wide_Text_IO.Enumeration_IO(Language_ID);
      lang: Language_ID;
   {{Ada/keyword |begin}}
      Lang_IO.Get(lang);
      Wide_Text_IO.Put_Line( greetings.Element(lang).{{Ada/keyword|all}} );
   {{Ada/keyword |end}};
  
 {{Ada/keyword |end}} Hello_World_Pick;

This time the &lt;tt&gt;Element&lt;/tt&gt; function consumes a Key (lang)
not a Cursor. Actually, it consumes two values, the other value being
&lt;tt&gt;greetings&lt;/tt&gt;, in distinguished receiver notation.

==== Second Example: Vectors and Maps ====

Let's take bean counting literally. Red beans, green beans, and white
beans. (Yes, white beans really do exist.) Your job will be to collect a number
of beans, weigh them, and then determine the average weight of red,
green, and white beans, respectively. Here is one approach.

Again, we need a package, this time for storing vegetable
related information. Introducing the &lt;tt&gt;Beans&lt;/tt&gt; package
(the Grams type doesn't belong in a vegetable package, but it's there
to keep things simple):

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|1/beans.ads}}

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Vectors}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Beans {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Bean_Color {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}R{{Ada/delimiter|,}} G{{Ada/delimiter|,}} W{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | red, green, and white beans}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Grams {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|delta}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}01 {{Ada/keyword|digits}} 7{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | enough to weigh things as light as beans but also as heavy as}}
    {{Ada/-- | many of them}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Bean {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    {{Ada/-- | info about a single bean}}
       {{Ada/keyword|record}}
          kind{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Bean_Color{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
          weight{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Grams{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
       {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|subtype}} Bean_Count {{Ada/keyword|is}} Positive {{Ada/keyword|range}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 1_000{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | numbers of beans to count (how many has Cinderella have to count?)}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|package}} Bean_Vecs {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} Ada{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Containers{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Vectors
      {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Element_Type =&gt; Bean{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
       Index_Type =&gt; Bean_Count{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Beans{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The &lt;tt&gt;Vectors&lt;/tt&gt; instance offers a data structure similar to an array
that can change its size at run time. It is called &lt;tt&gt;Vector&lt;/tt&gt;.
Each bean that is read will be appended to a &lt;tt&gt;Bean_Vecs.Vector&lt;/tt&gt; object.

The following program first calls &lt;tt&gt;read_input&lt;/tt&gt; to
fill a buffer with beans. Next, it calls a function that computes
the average weight of beans having the same color. This
function:

 {{Ada/keyword |with}} Beans{{Ada/delimiter |;}}   {{Ada/keyword |use}} Beans{{Ada/delimiter |;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword |function}} average_weight
   {{Ada/delimiter |(}}buffer{{Ada/delimiter |:}} Bean_Vecs{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Vector{{Ada/delimiter |;}} desired_color{{Ada/delimiter |:}} Bean_Color{{Ada/delimiter |)}} {{Ada/keyword |return}} Grams{{Ada/delimiter |;}}
 {{Ada/comment | scan `buffer` for all beans that have `desired_color`. Compute the}}
 {{Ada/comment | mean of their `.weight` components}}


Then the average value is printed for beans of each color and
the program stops.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|1/bean_counting.adb}}

 {{Ada/keyword |with}} Beans{{Ada/delimiter |;}}
 {{Ada/keyword |with}} average_weight{{Ada/delimiter |;}}
 {{Ada/keyword |with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Wide_Text_IO}}{{Ada/delimiter |;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword |procedure}} bean_counting {{Ada/keyword |is}}
    {{Ada/keyword |use}} Beans{{Ada/delimiter |,}} Ada{{Ada/delimiter |;}}
 
    buffer{{Ada/delimiter |:}} Bean_Vecs{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Vector{{Ada/delimiter |;}}

All container operations take place in function &lt;tt&gt;average_weight&lt;/tt&gt;.
To find the mean weight of beans of the same color, the function
is looking at all beans in order. If a bean has the right color,
&lt;tt&gt;average_weight&lt;/tt&gt; adds its weight to the total weight, and
increases the number of beans counted by 1.

The computation visits all beans. The iteration that is necessary
for going from one bean to the next and then performing the above steps
is best left to the &lt;tt&gt;Iterate&lt;/tt&gt; procedure
which is part of all container packages. To do so, wrap
the above steps inside some procedure and pass this procedure
to &lt;tt&gt;Iterate&lt;/tt&gt;. The effect is that &lt;tt&gt;Iterate&lt;/tt&gt; calls your
procedure for each element in the vector, passing a cursor
value to your procedure, one for each element.

Having the container machinery do the iteration can also be
faster than moving and checking the cursor yourself, as was
done in the &lt;tt&gt;Hello_World_Extended&lt;/tt&gt; example.

This approach is straightforward. However, imagine larger vectors.
&lt;tt&gt;average_weight&lt;/tt&gt; will visit all elements repeatedly
for each color. If there are M colors and N beans,
&lt;tt&gt;average_weight&lt;/tt&gt; will be called M * N times, and with each new
color, N more calls are necessary. A possible alternative is to collect all
information about a bean once it is visited. However, this will
likely need more variables, and you will have to find a way to return more
than one result (one average for each color), etc. Try it!

A different approach might be better. One is to copy beans of different
colors to separate vector objects. (Remembering Cinderella.) Then
&lt;tt&gt;average_weight&lt;/tt&gt; must visit each element only one time. The
following procedure does this, using a new type from &lt;tt&gt;Beans&lt;/tt&gt;,
called &lt;tt&gt;Bean_Pots&lt;/tt&gt;.

    ...
    {{Ada/keyword |type}} Bean_Pots {{Ada/keyword |is}} {{Ada/keyword |array}}{{Ada/delimiter |(}}Bean_Color{{Ada/delimiter |)}} {{Ada/keyword |of}} Bean_Vecs{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Vector{{Ada/delimiter |;}}
    ...

Note how this plain array associates colors with Vectors.
The procedure for getting the beans into the right bowls uses
the bean color as array index for finding the right bowl (vector).

As a side effect of having chosen one vector per color, we can determine
the number of beans in each vector by calling the &lt;tt&gt;Length&lt;/tt&gt; function.
But &lt;tt&gt;average_weight&lt;/tt&gt;, too, computes the number of elements in the vector.
Hence, a summing function might replace &lt;tt&gt;average_weight&lt;/tt&gt; here.

==== All In Just One Map!  ====

The following program first calls &lt;tt&gt;read_input&lt;/tt&gt; to fill a buffer
with beans. Then, information about these beans is stored in a table,
mapping bean properties to numbers of occurrence. The processing that
starts at &lt;tt&gt;Iterate&lt;/tt&gt; uses chained procedure calls typical of the
{{Ada/package|Ada|Containers}} iteration mechanism.

The Beans package in this example instantiates another
generic library unit, {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Ordered_Maps}}.
Where the {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Hashed_Maps}} require a hashing
function, {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers|Ordered_Maps}} require a comparison
function. We provide one, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, which sorts beans first by color,
then by weight. It will automatically be associated with the corresponding
generic formal function, as its name, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, matches that of the generic formal
function, &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.

this variation on &lt;tt&gt;bean_counting&lt;/tt&gt; packs them all as local

Like in the greetings example, you can pick values from the table.
This time the values tell the number of occurrences of beans with
certain properties. The &lt;tt&gt;stats_cw&lt;/tt&gt; table is ordered by key, that
is by bean properties. Given particular properties, you can use the
&lt;tt&gt;Floor&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Ceiling&lt;/tt&gt; functions to approximate the bean in
the table that most closely matches the desired properties.

It is now easy to print a histogram showing the frequency with which
each kind of bean has occurred. If N is the number of beans of a kind,
then print N characters on a line, or draw a graphical bar of length
N, etc. A histogram showing the number of beans per color can be drawn
after computing the sum of beans of this color, using groups like in the
previous example. You can delete beans of a color from the table using
the same technique.

Finally, think of marshalling the beans in order starting at the least
frequently occurring kind. That is, construct a vector appending first
beans that have occurred just once, followed by beans that have occurred
twice, if any, and so on. Starting from the table is possible, but be
sure to have a look at the sorting functions of
{{Ada/package|Ada|Containers}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Some information about Italian language ==

=== Range ===

Italian, a romance language, is spoken mainly in Italy, where it is the main official language. It is also official language in the Republic of San Marino, and the Ticino canton of Switzerland. It is also the second official language of Vatican City, after Latin. It is also spoken by some minorities in Slovenia and coastal Croatia.

=== Languages and dialects ===

Italian language is characterized by its numerous varieties. There is at least one dialect for each region, named after the region or the main town of the region. Even when speaking Italian, most Italians have a regional accent. It is actually normal to hear many different ways of saying the same phrase while merely moving through Italy from region to region.

Italian dialects are actually very different from standard Italian, and hardly understandable even by Italians from other regions of Italy.  Many of these ''dialects'' are considered to be languages in English but the Italian government recognises only one official Romance language: Italian. An exception is Tuscany, the motherland of Italian. The Tuscan dialect is very similar to Italian, so that all Italians can understand it. 

Italian dialects must not be confused with all the recognized minority languages, including ''Sardo'' (''[[Sardinian|Sardu]]'') in Sardinia, ''German'' in Trentino-Südtirol and ''Friulano'' and ''Slovene'' in Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

=== History ===

Standard Italian is a literary language, originated as the vulgar written language of Tuscany in XII century. It became a national literary language thanks to the great literary works of [[w:Francis of Assisi|Francis of Assisi]], [[w:Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[w:Francesco Petrarca|Petrarca]], [[w:Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], and others.

For centuries, it was used only for written texts and operas. Even theater plays were in dialect.

When Italy became a united nation, in 1861, Italian was chosen as the official language, but only 4% of the population was able to speak it.

The diffusion of Italian among the population was caused first by the national military conscription, then by internal migrations, and at last by cinema and television. Actually, the most standard Italian is the one used to dub foreign films.

Until World War II, internal migrations were mainly from the countryside to the big towns, and in particular toward Rome.
Therefore, in big towns the common language became a mix of the languages of surrounding regions.

After World War II, internal migrations were mainly from the impoverished south to the industrialized north, mainly Turin and Milan.
Therefore, Turin and Milan became the Italian towns where the Italian language is spoken more, as it is the only common language among the various people living there, while in other towns and in the countryside dialects were used more than Italian until few years ago.

Nowadays, the fact that young Italians are exposed more to cinema and television than to their parents speeches is causing a fading out of dialects.

=== Features ===

Most Italian names come from the singular [[w:Ablative case#Latin|Latin ablative case]]; for example, the Italian for &quot;wolf&quot; is &quot;lupo&quot;, ablative case of &quot;lupus&quot;. Also the names of ancient Romans come from their Latin ablative case; for example, the Italian for emperor &quot;Nero&quot; is &quot;Nerone&quot;. 

Almost all Italian words longer than three letters end with a letter &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, or &quot;o&quot;.

In every Italian word, except the very long ones, exactly one syllable is stressed; it may be the last, the last but one, that is the most common case, the last but two, or, in very rare cases, the last but four.
Every time a word with two or more syllables has the last syllable stressed, the last letter is marked by an accent, in written Italian.
There are six possible accented letters: &quot;à&quot;, &quot;è&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;ì&quot;, &quot;ò&quot;, &quot;ù&quot;.
Notice that the &quot;e&quot; letter may has two kinds of accents, named &quot;grave&quot; (or &quot;open&quot;) and &quot;acute&quot; (or &quot;closed&quot;).
Sometimes to disambiguate pronunciation and meaning, accents are used also for inner letters of a word; for example, &quot;légami&quot; (that means &quot;rope mi&quot;) and &quot;legàmi&quot; (that means &quot;links&quot;, &quot;bonds&quot;) have different stress and consequently different meaning.
Accents on monosyllabic words are used to distinguish words; for example &quot;e&quot; (that means &quot;and&quot;) from &quot;è&quot; (that means &quot;is&quot;), or &quot;la&quot; (that means &quot;the&quot; for singular feminine names) from &quot;là&quot; (that means &quot;over there&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Dialogues==
Languages need verbs and people need to communicate.  Every language needs action words and &quot;state of being&quot; words.  They tell us what is going on.  Sometimes we just need more information, too.  In this lesson you will learn the formation of questions and several verbs (with conjugations) plus a few more useful phrases.

===Dialogue one / ''Dialogo uno''===

The setting: Paola and Marco are having breakfast at a bar.

: '' Paola'' : Salve, vorrei un cornetto e un cappuccino, per favore.
: '' Marco'' : Per me invece un espresso, grazie.
: '' Barman'' : Volete altro?
: '' Marco'' : No, grazie.
: '' Paola'' : Quanto viene?
: '' Barman'' : Sono 3 euro e 10.

====Vocabulary====
{|
|-
|'''(io) vorrei...'''|| I would like...
|-
|'''cornetto'''|| croissant
|-
|'''per me...'''|| for me...
|-
|'''invece...'''|| instead (''however'', in this context)
|-
|'''per favore'''|| please 
|-
|'''volete altro?'''|| anything else? (lit. Do you want other?)
|-
|'''quanto viene?'''|| how much does it (all) cost? 
|-
|'''sono 3 (euro) e 10 (centesimi).'''|| it is 3 (euros) 10 (cents).
|}

===Dialogue two / ''Dialogo due''===

The setting: Daniele asks for directions to the Leaning Tower in Pisa.

: '' Daniele'' : Scusi, dove devo andare per arrivare alla Torre Pendente?
: '' Helper'' : Allora, vada sempre diritto, poi giri a destra.
: '' Daniele'' : Grazie.
: '' Helper'' : Si figuri.

====Vocabulary====
{|
|-
|'''scusi...'''||excuse me...
|-
|'''dove devo andare per arrivare alla Torre Pendente?'''|| how can I get to the Leaning Tower? (lit. Where should I go to get to the Leaning Tower?)
|-
|'''allora, ...'''|| well, so...
|-
|'''vada sempre diritto, poi giri a destra'''|| go straight forward, then turn right.
|-
|'''prego. / si figuri. / di niente.'''|| you are welcome.
|}

==How to formulate a sentence in Italian==
There is not a rigid schema to follow for formulating sentences in Italian. There is actually no difference between questions, answers and affirmations, except for the different spoken pronounciation of questions (indicated by the &quot;?&quot; symbol), but it does not differ particularly from English.

What is different, and often hard to understand, however, is the possible absence of the subject. In these cases, the subject is said to be implied (&quot;sottinteso&quot; in Italian) and is usually understandable by the different form of the verb, that is directly associated to the subject itself. See the auxiliary verbs below for a real example, and keep them in mind, because they are used more often than you would think.

===Auxiliary verbs (present form)===
The auxiliary verbs are two, ''essere'' (to be) and ''avere'' (to have). They are both irregular ones, and are used for both their actual meaning and for construction of all other non-auxiliary verbs in forms other than the present.  Note that the pronouns ''egli'', ''ella'' and ''essi'' are rarely used in spoken Italian nowadays.  Also note that the formal singular you is spelt ''Lei'', with a capital ''L'' to differentiate it from ''lei'' used for 'she'.

|'''Subject''' (''common form'')&lt;br/&gt;- (''implied form'')
|'''Verb''' 
|'''Object(s)''' (''when necessary'')
|'''?'''
|}
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Form 2''' (without phrase inversion)
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse;margin-top:0.5em;border: 1px #666666 solid;&quot;
|-
|'''Proposition''' (''when necessary'')
|'''Subject''' (''common form'')&lt;br/&gt;- (''implied form'')
|'''Verb'''
|'''Object(s)''' (''when necessary'')
|'''?'''
|}

===Some Important Verbs===
Verbs are actually the kernel of a language; without them, it would be impossible to build relevant phrases and talk to a native speaker.
Italian has two auxiliary verbs, ''essere'' (to be) and ''avere'' (to have). In addition to that, the language permits also the use of a number of ''verbi servili'' (modal verbs), some auxiliary verbs that may be used in particular cases, and need to be accomplished with another verb in order to have an actual meaning. These verbs are ''dovere'' (to have to), ''potere'' (to be able), and ''volere'' (to want).

Other verbs seen before are:
* ''andare'' (to go)
* ''venire'' (to come)
* ''arrivare'' (to arrive)
* ''girare'' (to turn)
* ''stare'' (to stay, to stand)
* ''vedere'' (to see)
* ''chiamare'' (to call)
* ''sapere'' (to know (something))
* ''conoscere'' (to know (someone))

About how to conjugate these verbs, you should take a look at the [[../Verbs|dedicated section]]; of course, there are some verbs which do not fit on these rules: they are called ''verbi irregolari'' (irregular verbs). ''Andare'', ''venire'' and ''sapere'', for example, are irregular verbs.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In Java, programs are not compiled into executable files; they are compiled into [[w:Bytecode|bytecode]] (as discussed [[Java Programming/The Java Platform|earlier]]), which the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) then executes at runtime. Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt; compiler. The bytecode gets saved on the disk with the file extension &lt;code&gt;.class&lt;/code&gt;. When the program is to be run, the bytecode is converted, using the [[w:Just-in-time compiliation|just-in-time]] (JIT) compiler. The result is machine code which is then fed to the memory and is executed.

Java code needs to be compiled twice in order to be executed:
# Java programs need to be compiled to bytecode.
# When the bytecode is run, it needs to be converted to machine code.

The Java classes/bytecode are compiled to machine code and loaded into memory by the JVM when needed the first time. This is different from other languages like C/C++ where programs are to be compiled to machine code and linked to create an executable file before it can be executed.

== Quick compilation procedure ==
To execute your first Java program, follow the instructions below:

{|style=&quot;padding-left:1.5em;&quot;
|-
|
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|1.
|Proceed only if you have successfully installed and configured your system for Java as discussed [[Java Programming/Installation|here]].
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|2.
|Open your preferred text editor &amp;mdash; this is the editor you set while installing the Java platform.
|-
|
|For example, '''Notepad''' or '''Notepad++''' on Windows; '''Gedit''', '''Kate''' or '''SciTE''' on Linux; or, '''XCode''' on Mac OS, etc.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|3.
|Write the following lines of code in a new text document:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 2.5: HelloWorld.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|4.
|Save the file as '''HelloWorld.java''' &amp;mdash; the name of your file should be the same as the name of your class definition and followed by the &lt;code&gt;.java&lt;/code&gt; extension. This name is ''case-sensitive'', which means you need to capitalize the precise letters that were capitalized in the name for the class definition.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|5.
|Next, open your preferred command-line application.
|-
|
|For example, '''Command Prompt''' on Windows; and, '''Terminal''' on Linux and Mac OS.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|6.
|In your command-line application, navigate to the directory where you just created your file. If you do not know how to do this, consider reading through our crash courses for command-line applications for [[Windows Batch Scripting#CD|Windows]] or [[Linux Guide/Using the shell#Using cd|Linux]].
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|7.
|Compile the Java source file using the following command which you can copy and paste in if you want:
{{XCode|1='''Compilation'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
javac HelloWorld.java
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
{{XWarning|If you obtain an error message like &lt;code&gt;error: cannot read: HelloWorld.java 1 error&lt;/code&gt;, your file is not in the current folder or it is badly spelled. Did you navigate to the program's location in the command prompt using the [[w:cd (command)|cd]] (''c''hange ''d''irectory) command?

If you obtain another message ending by &lt;code&gt;1 error&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;... errors&lt;/code&gt;, there may be a mistake in your code. Are you sure all words are spelled correctly and with the exact case as shown? Are there semicolons and brackets in the appropriate spot? Are you missing a quote?

== Automatic Compilation of Dependent Classes ==
In Java, if you have used any reference to any other java object, then the class for that object will be automatically compiled, if that was not compiled already. These automatic  compilations are nested, and this continues until all classes are compiled that are needed to run the program. So it is usually enough to compile only the high level class, since all the dependent classes will be automatically compiled.

{{XCode|1='''Main class compilation'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
javac ... MainClass.java
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

However, you can't rely on this feature if your program is using reflection to create objects, or you are compiling for servlets or for a &quot;jar&quot;, package. In these cases you should list these classes for explicit compilation.

{{XCode|1='''Main class compilation'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
javac ... MainClass.java ServletOne.java ...
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

== Packages, Subdirectories, and Resources ==
Each Java top level class belongs to a package (covered in the chapter about [[Java Programming/Packages|Packages]]). This may be declared in a &lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt; statement at the beginning of the file; if that is missing, the class belongs to the unnamed package.

For compilation, the file must be in the right directory structure. A file containing a class in the unnamed package must be in the current/root directory; if the class belongs to a package, it must be in a directory with the same name as the package.

The convention is that package names and directory names corresponding to the package consist of only lower case letters.

=== Top level package ===
A class with this package declaration

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.1: Package declaration'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package example;
&lt;/source&gt;}}

has to be in a directory named &lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Subpackages ===
A class with this package declaration

{{XExample|1='''Code section 2.2: Package declaration with sub-packages '''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.en;
&lt;/source&gt;}}

has to be in a directory named &lt;code&gt;en&lt;/code&gt; which has to be a sub-directory of &lt;code&gt;wikibooks&lt;/code&gt; which in turn has to be a sub-directory of &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; resulting in &lt;code&gt;org/wikibooks/en&lt;/code&gt; on Linux or &lt;code&gt;org\wikibooks\en&lt;/code&gt; on Windows.

Java programs often contain non-code files such as images and properties files. These are referred to generally as ''resources'' and stored in directories local to the classes in which they're used. For example, if the class &lt;code&gt;com.example.ExampleApp&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;icon.png&lt;/code&gt; file, this file could be stored as &lt;code&gt;/com/example/resources/icon.png&lt;/code&gt;. These resources present a problem when a program is complied, because &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt; does not copy them to wherever the &lt;code&gt;.class&lt;/code&gt; files are being complied to (see above); it is up to the programmer to move the resource files and directories.

== Filename Case ==
The Java source file name must be the same as the public class name that the file contains. There can be only one public class defined per file.  The Java class name is case sensitive, as is the source file name.

The naming convention for the class name is for it to start with a capital letter.

== Compiler Options ==

=== Debugging and Symbolic Information ===
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Complete this section.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Ant ==
:''For comprehensive information about all aspects of Ant, please see the [[Programming:Apache Ant|Ant Wikibook]].''

The best way to build your application is to use a build tool. This checks all the needed dependencies and compiles only the needed class for the build. [[Java Programming/Compilation#Ant|Ant]] tool is one of the best and the most popular build tools currently available. Ant is a build management tool designed to replace MAKE as the tool for automated builds of large Java applications. Like Java, and unlike MAKE, Ant is designed to be platform independent.

Using [[Java Programming/Compilation#Ant|Ant]] you would build your application from the command line by typing:

{{XCode|1='''Ant building'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
ant build.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

The &lt;code&gt;build.xml&lt;/code&gt; file contains all the information needed to build the application.

Building a Java application requires certain tasks to be performed defined in a &lt;code&gt;build.xml&lt;/code&gt; file.  Those tasks may include not only compiling the code, but also copying code, packaging the program to a Jar, creating EJBs, running automated tests, doing ftp for the code to remote site, and so on. For some tasks a condition can be assigned, for example to compile only changed code, or do the task if that was not already done so.  Tasks dependency can also be specified, which will make sure that the order of executions of the tasks are in the right order. For example, when compiling the code before packaging it to a jar, the package-to-jar task depends on the compilation task.

{{XNote|In rare cases, your code may appear to compile correctly but the program behaves as if you were using an old copy of the source code (or otherwise reports errors during runtime.) When this occurs, you may need to clean your compilation folder by either deleting the class files or using the Clean command from an IDE.}}

The &lt;code&gt;build.xml&lt;/code&gt; file is generally kept in the root directory of the java project. Ant parses this file and executes the tasks therein. Below we give an example &lt;code&gt;build.xml&lt;/code&gt; file.

Ant tool is written in Java and is open source, so it can be extended if there is a task you'd like to be done during the build that is not in the predefined tasks list. It is very easy to hook your ant task code to the other tasks: your code only needs to be in the classpath, and the Ant tool will load it at runtime. For more information about writing your own Ant tasks, please see the project website at http://ant.apache.org/.

}}

The next most popular way to build applications is using an [[Java Programming/Java IDEs|Integrated Development Environment]] (IDE).

== The JIT compiler ==

The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is the compiler that converts the byte-code to machine code. It compiles byte-code once and the compiled machine code is re-used again and again, to speed up execution.  Early Java compilers compiled the byte-code to machine code each time it was used, but more modern compilers cache this machine code for reuse on the machine. Even then, java's JIT compiling was still faster than an &quot;interpreter-language&quot;, where code is compiled from '''high level language''', instead of from byte-code each time it was used.

The standard JIT compiler runs ''on demand''. When a method is called repeatedly, the JIT compiler analyzes the bytecode and produces highly efficient machine code, which runs very fast. The JIT compiler is smart enough to recognize when the code has already been compiled, so as the application runs, compilation happens only as needed. As Java applications run, they tend to become faster and faster, because the JIT can perform runtime profiling and optimization to the code to meet the execution environment. Methods or code blocks which do not run often receive less optimization; those which run often (so called ''hotspots'') receive more profiling and optimization.

===Before You Begin===
All the commands given to Maple are in the areas marked with &gt;.&lt;br&gt;
These are the input areas.&lt;br&gt;
Press enter to execute the command.

 &gt; sample code;

The lines of code must end with either a semicolon or a colon. Note the difference between them:

 &gt; p - ln( p );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p-\ln  \left( p \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 &gt; p - ln (p ):

If the line of code ends with a semicolon, the order is validated and the software displays the answer in the output area. If the line of code ends with a colon, the order is validated, but the answer is not displayed.

===Simple computations with Maple===
 &gt; (1-1/7)*(1+2/3)^2;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\frac {50}{21}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; (25)^(1/2);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;5\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; factorial(15);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1307674368000\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; 15!;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1307674368000\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; sqrt(81);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;9\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; sqrt(56.81);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;7.537240874\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; %^2;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;56.81\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Using variables with Maple===
Like any other programming language, Maple allows us to assign values to named variables. This often 
makes programs more readable and it allows us to save results for use later in the calculation.
Here, 2.14 is assigned to the variable ''p''. We can then compute &lt;math&gt;p-\ln  \left( p \right) &lt;/math&gt; so that ''p'' is evaluated (replaced by)  2.14:
 &gt; p:=2.14;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;p:=2.14\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; p - ln(p);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.379194171\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
You can also use more than one variable in a single expression:
 &gt; x := 2*a-p;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x:=2\,a- 2.14&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; x-sqrt(a*p);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\,a- 2.14- 1.462873884\,\sqrt {a}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; expr := a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;expr:={a{x}} ^{2}+bx+c=0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Commands to manipulate expressions in Maple===
Maple has a wide range of commands to help you manipulate expressions:
 &gt; f := (a+b)^6;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f:=\left (a+b\right )^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; expand(f);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{a}^{6}+6\,{a}^{5}b+15\,{a}^{4}{b}^{2}+20\,{a}^{3}{b}^{3}+15\,{a}^{2}{b}^{4}+6\,a{b}^{5}+{b}^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; factor(%);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (a+b\right )^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; %%;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{a}^{6}+6\,{a}^{5}b+15\,{a}^{4}{b}^{2}+20\,{a}^{3}{b}^{3}+15\,{a}^{2}{b}^{4}+6\,a{b}^{5}+{b}^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; sin(x)^2+cos(x)^2;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (\sin(x)\right )^{2}+\left (\cos(x)\right )^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; simplify(%);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here, the ''%'' symbol recalls the last computation made by Maple. ''%%'' means you recalls the computation made two steps back. ''%%%'' will recall the answer to the computation make three steps back.  If you wish to recall answers father back, you will have to have assigned them to a variable. 

You can also substitute values for the variables in an expression with the commands ''subs''  and two-argument ''eval'':
 &gt; subs( x=2, x^2+x+1 );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;7\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; eval( x^2+x+1,x=2 );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;7\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The command ''subs'' makes syntactic substitution,
 &gt; subs( y=0, sin(y) );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sin(0)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
while ''eval'' performs substitution followed by evaluation
 &gt; eval( sin(y), y=0 );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; eval(f, a=c);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (c+b\right )^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; eval(f, [a=2, b=4/5]);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{7529536}{15625}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The command ''subs'' substitutes bound (dummy) variables while ''eval'' does not:

 &gt; subs(x=u,int(f(x),x=0..1) );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int _{0}^{1}\!f \left( u \right) {du}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 &gt; eval(int(f(x),x=0..1),x=u );

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int _{0}^{1}\!f \left( x \right) {dx}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The command ''eval'' does simultaneous substitution while the command ''subs'' does sequential substitution:

 &gt; subs( x=y, y=x, [x,y] );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[x, x]\, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;          

 &gt; eval([x,y], {x=y, y=x});
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[y, x] \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

The following are equivalent:

Simultaneous substitution
 &gt; subs( [x=y, y=x], [x,y] );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[y, x]\, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

 &gt; eval([x,y], {x=y, y=x});
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[y, x] \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

and

Sequential substitution
 &gt; subs( x=y, y=x, [x,y] );
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[x, x] \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

 &gt; eval(eval([x,y], x=y), y=x);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;[x, x] \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 


The command ''evalf'' calculates a floating point (numeric) approximation of an expression. You may also specify the desired precision.
 &gt; evalf(sqrt(3));
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.732050808\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; evalf(sqrt(3), 50);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.7320508075688772935274463415058723669428052538104\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; evalf[50](sqrt(3));
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.7320508075688772935274463415058723669428052538104\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


''print'', ''lprint'' and ''printf'' are commands used to display a mathematical expression. ''print'' displays the expression using the current pretty-printing method. ''lprint'' displays the expression in 1D format (no pretty-printing), as one would type  as input to Maple. ''printf'' is the same function used in C or C++ language, where you can display variables using formats: %d represents an integer variable, %f a floating number and \n breaks a line of text:
 &gt; f:=a-3/a+1/(a*a+1);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f:=a-\frac{3}{a}+\frac{1}{{a}^{2}+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; print(f);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;a-\frac{3}{a}+\frac{1}{{a}^{2}+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; lprint(f);
a-3/a+1/(a^2+1)&lt;br&gt;
 &gt; printf(&quot;%d %f \n&quot;,123,1234/567); 
123 2.176367&lt;br&gt;

===Defining a function with Maple===
The simplest form to define a function uses the arrow (map) operator ''-&gt;''

 &gt; f := t -&gt; sin(t) - t;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f:=t\rightarrow \sin(t)-t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; f(3*x + 2);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sin(3\,x+2)-3\,x-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note:

 &gt; f := x-&gt;2*x+2;

defines ''f'' as a function, i.e. 

 &gt; f(u);

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2u+2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 &gt; f(x):=2*x+2;

defines ''f as a procedure with a &quot;remember table&quot; that is assigned only for the argument  ''x'': 

 &gt; f(u);

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{f}(u)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

 &gt; f(x)=2*x+2;
 
is an equation.

===Calculus with Maple===
Derivatives of expressions can be taken with the diff command:
 &gt; diff(f(t), t);
Multiple partial derivatives can be given as a list.  To take the derivative of g with respect to u then v:
 &gt; diff(g(u,v,w), [u,v]);

Maple can also take the derivative of functions using the ''D'' operator
 &gt; D(f);
If a function has more than one variable, the variable can be specified as an index:
 &gt; D[1](g);

Notice the difference between ''diff'' and ''D'': ''diff'' operates on an expression, and returns an expression while ''D'' operates on a function and returns another function.

Maple can be used to find a primitive, indefinite integral or anti-derivative of an expression. For example, to get indefinite integrals of the function ''f(t)'' according to ''t'' and the function ''g(u,v,w)'' according to ''v'', the following commands can be entered:
 &gt; Int(f(t), t) = int(f(t), t);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \left(\sin(t)-t\right)\,dt=-\cos(t)-\frac{1}{2}\,{t}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; Int(g(u,v,w), v) = int(g(u,v,w), v);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \left( \frac{1}{u}+e^{u+v}+(u-v+w)^{2}\right)\,{dv}=\frac{v}{u}+
{e^{u+v}}-\frac{1}{3}(u-v+w)^{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note the difference between the commands ''Int'' and ''int''. The former is the inert form, it just displays the integral. The latter is the active form and computes its value. 

Maple can also compute definite integrals:
 &gt; Int(f(t),t=0..Pi)=int(f(t),t=0..Pi);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int^{\pi}_{0}\left(\sin(t)-t\right)\,dt=2-\frac{1}{2}\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To evalue an inert integral, one can use the command ''value'':
 &gt; value(Int(f(t), t));
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\cos(t)-\frac{1}{2}\,{t}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The other use of this inert form is the numerical approximation of definite integrals:
 &gt; evalf(Int(f(t),t=0..Pi));
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.57079633&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This should give the same answer as ''evalf(int(f(t), t=0..Pi))'' but it is computed differently.  When the inert form of the integral is used Maple computes an approximation of the area under the curve using the definition of definite integration.  When then ''int'' form is used, and exact value for the definite integral is computed, and then that value is numerically approximated.  Using the inert form to compute the approximation directly can be much faster for large problems.

===Limits, sums and products with Maple===
You can also find numeric and symbolic values of sums, limits and products using respectively the functions ''sum'', ''limit'' and ''product'':
 &gt; limit((2*t-3)/(3*t+4),t=infinity);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; limit((2*t-3)/(3*t+4),t=-4/3,right); #right-bound of the limit
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; Sum(i^2,i=1..10)=sum(i^2,i=1..10);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{10}i^2=385&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; Product(1/i,i=1..10)=product(1/i,i=1..10);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{10}\frac{1}{i}=\frac{1}{3628800}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The commands ''Sum'' and ''Product'' are inert, they do not actually compute the sum or the product.

===Solving equations with Maple===
The ''solve(eqn,x)'' function tries to find the value of ''x'' in ''eqn''. You can also use more variables or more equations using ''solve({eqn1,eqn2,...},{x,y,...}):
 &gt; solve(2*t+3=-t+6*sqrt(2));
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-1+2\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; solve(t-15/4*u=5/2*(u-t)+3,u);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{14}{25}t-{12}{25}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; solve({a-b=2,a+3*b=7},{a,b});
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left\{a=\frac{13}{4},b=\frac{5}{4}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Sometimes, the exact solution of an equation might not be found. You can then use the ''fsolve()'' to get a numerical approximation:
 &gt; fsolve(cos(t)=t);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;0.7390851332&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; fsolve({t^3+u=1,u-(t-1)^3=t},{t,u});
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{t=0.6941457205, u=0.6655340191\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Giving names to solutions===
The solution can be stored in a variable, as any other expression
 &gt; solution := solve({a-b = x, a+b = 1/x}, {a, b});
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
solution := \left\{ b = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{x^2-1}{x}, ~a = \frac {1}{2} \frac {x^2+1}{x} \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
In the example, variable ''solution'' is assigned value, than can be used in following calculations. Sometimes, it worth to keep parts of the solution in independent variables. It can be done with appropriate substitution. For the ability to reproduce each step of calculus, it is better not to replace variables (a,b) used to write the original equaitons, but create the new names, for example, ''solutiona&quot; and &quot;solutionb&quot;:
 &gt; solutiona := eval(a, solution)
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
solutiona :=  \frac {1}{2} \frac {x^2+1}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; solutionb := eval(b, solution)
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
solutionb := -\frac{1}{2} \frac{x^2-1}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Then, these expressions can be accessed through their identifiers in some plots or future calculation.

===Plotting functions with Maple===
To plot a  function ''f(x)'', use the command ''plot(f(x),x)'':
 &gt; plot(sin(t)/t,t=-20..20,title=&quot;function t ---&gt; sin t / t&quot;);
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Maple11.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt; plot3d(x*exp(-x^2-y^2),x=-2..2,y=-2..2,color=x,orientation=[120,75]);
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Maple12.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Reference Guide To CA Unicenter NSM 3.1 (and TNG 2.2, 2.4 and TND 3.0) ==

This aim of this book is to be the solid reference to Unicenter NSM that you always wished you had every week you work with this tool, and to demonstrate real world ways to deliver value from a toolset that is enormous, complex and deeply mysterious to most of its users.

The book aims to cover:
* Unicenter NSM procedures with worked examples
* its obscure command line utilities, and their syntax, with examples that work
* hiterto unknown or lost sources of knowledge about this product
* how to leverage &quot;field developed utilities&quot;
* how to work around all the things in the product which work in a less than ideal manner in your envrionment.

At this point the initial contributors envisage these sections below.

== Tips on understanding the architecture ==

This section should include architectural level content that describes how the product works for example, what each element such as the enterprise manager, DSM does, and how they relate to each other. Often understanding the NSM framework is like peeling an onion over many years, each layer of understanding reveals another question.

== Top ways to deliver value from the suite ==

With an admin manual running to thousands of pages it can be daunting to see how to get value quickly from the toolset.

== Command reference ==

An encyclopedia of NSM commands, each command should have as much detail as possible about:
* its category and usage
* what versions of NSM it works on
* when you might want to use it
* some examples of use

[[CA Unicenter NSM Textbook/Command Reference]]

== Tools and how to use them ==

An encyclopedia of NSM tools and utilities, each tool desciption should have as much detail as possible about:
- its category and usage
- what versions of NSM it works on
- when you might want to use it
- some step by step procedures

== Other reference information ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objects ==

Objects are a very common way to manage and access data in REBOL. In fact most of the REBOL system is built with objects. The SYSTEM object can be considered the spine of REBOL, the place where all non-core functions and data reside. It's the place you can find all of VID, the various networking protocols and all mezzanine functions.

=== Using Objects ===

Objects are made with the MAKE function.

Example:

 &gt;&gt; shopping-basket: make object! [fruits: 5 vegetables: 3]
 &gt;&gt;

Note that nothing is returned on the console. Objects can hold all types of data, even other objects.

A bigger example, as you'd normally write it in your program code:

 shopping-basket: make object! [
   fruits: 5
   vegetables: 3
   dairy-products: 7
 ]

==== Accessing Objects ====

If you want to view an object, you might have noticed that typing the name in doesn't return anything:

 &gt;&gt; shopping-basket
 &gt;&gt;

You can use different methods for viewing the object data:

 &gt;&gt; probe shopping-basket
 make object! [
   fruits: 5
   vegetables: 3
 ]

A nicer overview can be returned with:

 &gt;&gt; ? shopping-basket
 SHOPPING-BASKET is an object of value: 
    fruits          integer!  5 
    vegetables      integer!  3 
    total           integer!  8 

Or:

 &gt;&gt; print dump-obj shopping-basket 
    fruits          integer!  5 
    vegetables      integer!  3 
    total           integer!  8

These functions can't be used in programs to get values from an object, since they only print information in the console. They don't produce a return value.

One way is to use path notation:

 &gt;&gt; shopping-basket/fruits
 == 5

There are multiple ways to access object data, both for manipulation and viewing.

==== Referring to Self ====

An object can refer to itself or other variables and functions within itself using SELF:

 &gt;&gt; shopping-basket: make object! [fruits: 5 vegetables: 3 total: self/fruits + self/vegetables]
 &gt;&gt; shopping-basket/total
 == 8

Note, that the usage of SELF in the above example is not necessary, though.

The following questions cover general information about ''Blender 3D: Noob to Pro'' and the software it is designed to teach, ''Blender''.

__TOC__

===What is Blender?===

Blender is a full-blown 3D content creation suite, usable for 3D editing, animation, texture mapping, compositing and rendering; as well as 2D video and audio editing/sequencing. 

It runs on: 
* Windows — XP, Vista, and 7, 32- and 64-bit
* Mac OS X — PowerPC and Intel, 32- and 64-bit
* Linux — Intel x86 and AMD, 32- and 64-bit
* BSD
* Solaris
* Irix. 

It is free, open-source software, available from [http://www.blender.org blender.org].

Blender '''2.73a''' is the latest stable release as of January 2015. Beginners are urged to learn using stable 2.5x versions, as there has been a significant UI overhaul since 2.49 and future tutorials will likely be written or recorded with the new interface. However, keep in mind that many existing tutorials were written for 2.49. If you're having trouble finding a button or tool that has moved, try pressing Spacebar to search for Blender functions. 

For more about Blender's history, functionality, and media productions which have utilized Blender, see the [[w:Blender (software)|Blender entry in Wikipedia]].

===What is this book? And what isn't it?===

''Noob to Pro'' is a collection of tutorials. Following these tutorials you can go from ignorant new Blender user (noob) to proficient Blender power user (pro). Though the tutorials are not strictly linked, we recommend going through them in order. Earlier tutorials introduce skills and information you'll be expected to know in later sections.

''Noob to Pro'' isn't a compendium or reference manual. Use it with other resources, including those in Blender's Help menu. ''Noob to Pro'' provides links to outside resources. We're part of the Blender community!

===How accurate is the information in this book?===

Blender is still under development! Its appearance, tools, and capabilities change from time to time. For instance, Blender 2.5x alters both the graphical user interface and the Python scripting interface and may also change some keyboard shortcuts.

Most of the tutorials should work with any recent version of Blender.  ''Blender 3D: Noob to Pro'' readers are encouraged to edit the WikiBook in order help to keep it up to date.

===I have a question, where can I get help?===

Search or post questions at [http://www.blenderartists.org/forum BlenderArtists] a large, easy-to-use, English-language forum. [http://wiki.blender.org/ BlenderWiki] contains a large database of documentation. Find similar forums in other languages at [http://www.blender.org/community/user-community/ blender.org's community page]. The discussion pages there are also useful. 

If your question turns out to be very common, please take a moment to see if it can be added to the book!  It is best if it can be smoothly incorporated with an existing page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On bounded lattices the information about preimages outside the boundaries of the observed string &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be described by two boundary preimage vectors (left &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; and right &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt;). The observed string &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as part of an infinite string &lt;math&gt;\beta_L \alpha \beta_R&lt;/math&gt;. Boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; describes preimages of the semi-infinite string &lt;math&gt;\beta_L&lt;/math&gt; and boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt; describes preimages of the semi-infinite string &lt;math&gt;\beta_R&lt;/math&gt;. Vector elements are the numbers of preimages that can be traced from the boundary to infinity for each of the overlaps at the boundaries. Element at position &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; in the left boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; specifies the number of preimages &lt;math&gt;p_{-\infty \leftrightarrow o_L}(\beta_L)&lt;/math&gt; that can be traced from left infinity to the overlap &lt;math&gt;o_L&lt;/math&gt; at the left boundary of the observed string. The definition of the right boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt; is similar.

:&lt;math&gt; b_L = [ p_{-\infty \leftrightarrow o_L=0}, p_{-\infty \leftrightarrow o_L=1}, \dots, p_{-\infty \leftrightarrow o_L}, \dots, p_{-\infty \leftrightarrow o_L=k^{m-1}-1} ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; b_R = [ p_{0=o_R \leftrightarrow +\infty}, p_{1=o_R \leftrightarrow +\infty}, \dots, p_{o_R \leftrightarrow +\infty}, \dots, p_{k^{m-1}-1=o_R \leftrightarrow +\infty} ]^T &lt;/math&gt;

Since we usually don't care about the state of the CA outside the observed string, unrestricted boundary vectors can be used.
\paragraph{Definition} For the \emph{unrestricted boundary vector} it is assumed that each of the boundary overlaps can be used to trace exactly one path to infinity. Therefore the unrestricted boundary vector contains all ones.

:&lt;math&gt; b_u = [1,1,\dots,1]^T &lt;/math&gt;

'''Note''' The below definitions rely on assumptions that are not proved yet, so the definitions my be wrong.

''General boundary vectors'' &lt;math&gt;b_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_R&lt;/math&gt; describe general infinite strings &lt;math&gt;\beta_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_R&lt;/math&gt;. It is assumed that this strings end with an unrestricted boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_u&lt;/math&gt; in the infinity.

:&lt;math&gt; b_L^T = \lim_{|\beta_L|\rightarrow\infty} b_u^T \, D(\beta_L) \qquad
        b_R   = \lim_{|\beta_R|\rightarrow\infty} D(\beta_R) \, b_u &lt;/math&gt;

Since an infinite string can have an infinite number of preimages, this definition is rarely useful. Boolean values can be used instead of integers to state if the overlap can be used for tracing or not. The equations are identical, only the scalar multiplication operator used for matrix multiplication is replaced by an XOR logical operation. Another option is using probabilities.

Another common boundary is an infinite periodic string with a finite period. Some commonly used boundaries can be defined this way. The ''periodic boundary vectors'' &lt;math&gt;b_{\bar{L}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_{\bar{R}}&lt;/math&gt; describe infinite periodic strings with finite periods &lt;math&gt;\overline{\beta_L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\beta_R}&lt;/math&gt;. This strings end with the same boundary vector &lt;math&gt;b_{\bar{L}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_{\bar{R}}&lt;/math&gt; in the infinity. The preimage matrix of a sting of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; period strings &lt;math&gt;\overline{\beta}^n&lt;/math&gt; is computed as &lt;math&gt;D(\overline{\beta}^n)=D^n(\overline{\beta})&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; b_{\bar{L}}^T = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_{\bar{L}}^T \, D^n(\overline{\beta_L}) \qquad
   b_{\bar{R}}   = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} D^n(\overline{\beta_R}) \, b_{\bar{R}} &lt;/math&gt;

The problem with this definition is thet there may by many different vectors that fulfil the criteria. There is an example of periodic boundaries with a finite number of preimages at the end of the paper.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

== Analog Modulation Overview ==

Let's take a look at a generalized sinewave:
:&lt;math&gt;
x\left( t \right) = A\sin \left( {\omega t + \theta } \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
It consists of three components namely; amplitude, frequency and phase. Each of which can be decomposed to provide finer detail:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = A s(t) \sin ( 2 \pi [f_c + kf_m(t)] t + \alpha \phi(t) )&lt;/math&gt;

== Types of Analog Modulation ==

We can see 3 parameters that can be changed in this sine wave to send information:

*&lt;math&gt;A s(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This term is called the &quot;Amplitude&quot;, and changing it is called &quot;Amplitude Modulation&quot; (AM)
*&lt;math&gt;kf_m(t)&lt;/math&gt; This term is called the &quot;Frequency Shift&quot;, and changing it is called &quot;Frequency Modulation&quot;
*&lt;math&gt;\alpha \phi (t)&lt;/math&gt;. this term is called the &quot;Phase angle&quot;, and changing it is called &quot;Phase Modulation&quot;.
* The terms frequency and phase modulation are often combined into a more general group called &quot;Angle Modulation&quot;.

== The Breakdown ==

Each term consists of a coefficient (called a &quot;scaling factor&quot;), and a function of time that corresponds to the information that we want to send. The scaling factor out front, A, is also used as the transmission power coefficient. When a radio station wants their signal to be stronger (regardless of whether it is AM, FM, or PM), they &quot;crank-up&quot; the power of A, and send more power out onto the airwaves.

== How we Will Cover the Material ==

We are going to go into separate chapters for each different type of modulation. This book will attempt to discuss some of the mathematical models and techniques used with different modulation techniques. It will also discuss some practical information about how to construct a transmitter/receiver, and how to use each modulation technique effectively.</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Polyjuice Potion''''' allows the taker to assume the physical appearance of another person. The potion takes a month to brew, and must include part of the person you wish to look like.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

One of the ingredients of Polyjuice Potion is boomslang skin. The boomslang is a very real venomous snake, native to Africa.

The potion is used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] to question [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] about the Heir of Slytherin, with almost no result. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], by accidentally attempting to change into a cat, demonstrates the problems with using potions without being quite sure of the effects they will have.

The potion is also used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] by the false [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]].

It is also used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] by Draco's sidekicks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] when Draco wants them to be inconspicuous guards for what he is doing.

Finally, it is used extensively by Harry, Ron, and Hermione in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] when they need to disguise themselves. It is used first by Mad-Eye Moody to create six replicas of Harry as a way of confusing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] who are trying to stop his departure from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']]. It is then used by Harry to disguise himself as &quot;Cousin Barny&quot; at the wedding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]. Harry, Ron, and Hermione use it to enter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|the Ministry]], Harry and Hermione use it to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] incognito, and Hermione uses it to enter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]] disguised as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]].

== Analysis ==

It must be extremely useful to appear to be someone else. The potion is remarkably comprehensive in its actions; the false Moody, transformed by the potion, is missing an eye and a leg, and these grow back when he is deprived of the potion. In fact, one assumes they must grow back each night, as the effects of the potion last only an hour. One must question whether the suppressed limb must be exercised to avoid it atrophying... did the false Moody have to exercise each day in his normal shape to avoid the effects of nine months without moving the suppressed leg?

The process of changing to a new shape by means of the potion is described as being quite painful, while the reversion to original self is so painless that neither Ron nor Harry notices it happening in themselves. As the false Moody was not apparently in pain when he drank from his hip flask (which contained, apparently, the Polyjuice Potion that retained his appearance), we can assume that it is the process of changing that is painful; maintenance in the unnatural shape should be much less so.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One wonders what happened when Crabbe or Goyle, standing guard duty, ran out of time? They did not seem to have any additional potion with them, and it is certain that a 6th-year Crabbe or Goyle would not have fit into the robes of the students they chose to disguise themselves as, which were typically first- to third-year girls. Possibly they had additional stock of prepared potion with them, but we never see them drinking any of it. However, throughout the seventh book, the effects of the potion seem to wear off at much more convenient times than we would expect; rather than a fixed hour in duration, for instance, Harry's disguise as &quot;Barny&quot; seems to last for the duration of the wedding, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione's disguises as they invade the Ministry not only seem to remain in place for the entire time that they are in the Ministry, but seem to wear off very conveniently just as they leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] for the forest where the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] had been played two years before. This convenient duration of the potion effects seems to be one of a number of places where the author is altering the magic she has created in order to make a better story.

== Copyright violation ==

There does not seem to be any permission from http://alamanya.free.fr to translate pages from that site and make them available on this site with the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. I have added a &quot;possible copyright violation&quot; sign to the [[Maple]] module.

By the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]], the contributors of these [[Maple]] modules should explain if they have permission to use these modules, or else risk having these modules deleted. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:42, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

If there was permission to use the material, can someone post evidence of that? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:42, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

Before begginning this wikibook, I talked with the webmaster of http://alamanya.free.fr (Alain Le Stag) to ask him if it was ok to translate parts of the totality of his webpages and he agreed. However, this agreement has only been made through e-mail, so there are no any proof of this. But you can be sure that he does not mind and told me everything was fine with this project.

I just added some stuff to get it started.  I do have a couple of questions though.  Are the images suitable?  Not too large?  Leave any suggestions or complaints you have.  --[[User:J Darnley|J Darnley]] 22:32, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Marx didn't reject metaphysics simply because he said [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people Religion ... is the opium of the people].  He was critiquing religion, not dismissing it outright.

Marx was always concerned with metaphysics, the philosophy of the nature of reality, because he was always concerned with reality and how it is transformed, particularly the reality of oppressed peoples. [[User:Rantingsteve|Steve W.]]</text>

== What is Modern History? ==
For the purpose of this book, modern history starts in 1490 and continues until some end point after  Beaconsfield mine collapse in 2006, but before the US Presidential Election of 2008.

Existing free texts on this topic include Wikibooks [[World History]], and [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]. This book takes a different approach from both texts. The intention is to provide features:
* This book contains external links, especially to other Wikibooks and wikis such as Wikisource, Wikipedia, and the Alternate History Wikicity.
* This book presents questions based on a short list of [[#Themes|themes]] and answers them.
* This book can be read as a chronological narrative, unlike Wikipedia which requires much jumping between articles.

To start creating this book, create stubs that link to Wikisource and Wikipedia.

=== Start of this book ===
By [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Modern_History&amp;action=history our measurement], this book began 13 November 2004 when [[User:DorianGray]] created [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Modern_History&amp;oldid=66953 the first page]. A year later, at 23 November 2005, [[User:Kernigh]] posted the first of the themes and began expansion of this book. On 9 May 2006, the [[Modern History/Front Cover|Front Cover]] was posted

=== Themes ===
For consistency, this book will follow the same themes through the text. The themes are Population, Governance, Philosophy, Invention, Combat, and Trade.

* '''Population''' [P] refers to groups of persons, such as ethnic or social groups.
* '''Governance''' [G] refers to rule over a population or populations. Many empires expanded in modern history until several states gained independence.
* '''Philosophy''' [Ph] refers to the ideas of a thinkers that came up with ideas that radically changed thought as we know it today.
* '''Invention''' [I] refers especially to new or recovered technology. Modern history was the time of the industrial revolution and eventually the computer revolution.
* '''Weapons''' [W] refers to the tools of war used in battle, be it knives, guns or bombs
* '''Combat''' [C] refers to wars, battles, and other destructive competition. In modern history, wars became more deadly until the largest war so far, World War II.
* '''Trade''' [T] refers to any exchange of goods or services, from the exchange of some money for a slice of bread to the many ships crossing the Pacific.
* '''Exploration''' [E] refers either to unknown lands being doscovered or to not well known lands being explored.

== Overview of modern history ==
History may be divided into many categories ([[Ancient History]], [[The Dark Ages]], [[Medieval History]], [[Age of Empires]], [[Space Age]], etc). Modern history relates to events that have occurred in the timeframe roughly starting around the American and French Revolutions. Many textbooks date the 'beginning' of Modern History at the Industrial Revolution (the 18th-19th centuries).

Events from around the turn of the 20th century to the present day are usually described as Contemporary History. This book includes events from this time, except that it is not meant to provide a commentary on current events. Thus, this book will cover Beaconsfield mine collapse in 2006, but not yet the US Presidential Election of 2008.

=== 15th century ===
(currently begins in 1490)

=== 16th century ===
(1501-1600)
=== 17th century ===
(1601-1700)
=== 18th century ===
(1701-1800)

=== 19th century ===
(1801 to 1900)
This period of history saw much change in world history. The end of the Napolenic wars, the crowning of Queen Victoria, this was one of the greatest periods of world history. Thinkers during this time include Karl Marx, Benjamin Disraeli and Charles Darwin. We also have the 2nd French Revolution, Revolutions in South America, the unification of Italy and Germany and the American Civil War, all important events in world history.
{{Modern History/stub}}

=== 20th century ===
The century from 1901 to 2000 saw perhaps the greatest changes in humanity's culture and technology in history. It saw the decline of the great houses of Europe. The great empires of Russia, Britain, the Ottomans and Austria were destroyed by conquest or weakened structure. The United States came from being a relatively insignificant country with an isolationist policy to one of the major players on the international stage.

The manipulation of electricity having become easier and cheaper, electronic products became more and more widespread, especially the Digital Computer. The internal combustion engine was refined and improved. The wholesale embracing of the mass-production line increased the industrial output of countries per capita to a level never seen before.

The 20th Century also saw the way warfare was conducted turned upside down. The first fifty years were host to the first truly 'World Wars'. The First World War was the bloodiest war in history on a casualty-to-combatant ratio, and also forced the armies of the world to adapt to new tactics and the countries to amend their strategies. The economic and military restrictions placed on the losing powers lead to the Second World War, which was the bloodiest war in the world in terms of sheer casualties. The creation of the Atomic (and later Nuclear) bomb proved for the first time that humanity, for the first time, was capable of fully destroying itself. The concentraion of Petroleum in the Gulf of Arabia, led to vast changes in this region.
The idealogical struggle between Capitalism and Stalinism led to a prolonged cold war.

==21st Century==
The 21st century began on the [[1st January 2001]]. However, most people alive then considered the [[1st January 2000]] as the beginning of the century, with large celebrations and the infamous [[Y2K]] scare, followed by an Election (E2K) in the [[US]]. In 2001, on the infamous [[Eleventh of September]], the US was attacked. This resulted in the [[War on Terrorism]].</text>

= The Predicate Language =

This page informally describes our '''predicate language''' which we name &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  A more formal description will be given in subsequent pages.

== Language components ==

Use of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs in the context of a ''domain'' of objects.  Ascribing a property to everything is interpreted as ascribing it just to everything in the domain.

=== Terms ===

''Variables'' will be lower case letters '''''n''''' through '''''z'''''.  Variables serve roughly as placeholders or perhaps pronouns, particularly in general statements about all or some objects.  A variable could serve as the 'it' in 'For any number, if it is even then it is not odd'.

''Operation letters'' of zero or more places will consist of lower case letters '''''a''''' through '''''m'''''.  Since the same letters are used for operation letters of any number of places, some disambiguation will be necessary.  For now, just let the context decide the number of places.  Note, though, that variables always have zero places.

''Terms'' can be one of the following.

* A variable.
* A zero-place operation letter.
* An ''n''-place operation letter (''n'' being 1 or greater) followed by a parenthesised list of ''n'' terms.  Examples include 
:: &lt;math&gt;f(c)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;g(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

''Names'' are terms in which no variables occur.  Names name.  In particular, they name  objects in the domain.  Variables, and so terms containing variables (i.e., terms that are not names), do not name.

For the remainder of this page, assume the following translations.

: &lt;math&gt;c\ :\ \ \mbox{Cain}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)\ :\ \ \mbox{the father of}\ x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g(x, y)\ :\ \ \mbox{the greater of}\ x\ \mbox{and}\ y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

With the right set of characters in the domain, biblical tradition has

: &lt;math&gt;c\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(c)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

naming Cain and Adam respectively.  The term

: &lt;math&gt;g(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

doesn't name anything.  However, if we abuse &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; a bit by permitting numerals to serve as zero place operation letters, then the terms

: &lt;math&gt;g(7, 3)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g(3, 3)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

name 7 and 3 respectively (assuming that 7 and 3 are in the domain).

=== Primitive formulae ===

''Predicate letters'' of zero or more places will consist of capital letters '''A''' through '''Z'''.  The same letters will be used for predicate letters of any number of places, so, as with operation letters, we will need to disambiguate. Again as with operation letters, we will let context decide the number of places for now.  Notice that zero-place predicate letters are sentence letters we are familiar with from [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic | sentential logic]].

''Primitive formulae'' can be one of the following.

* A zero-place predicate letter (that is, a sentence letter).
* An ''n''-place predicate letter (''n'' being 1 or greater) followed by a parenthesised list of ''n'' terms.  Examples include
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(f(c))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}(g(x, y), u, v)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; translates 'Snow is white', then it is true.  However, it is false if it translates 'Snow is blue'.

Suppose we add 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x)\ :\ \ x\ \mbox{is bald}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b\ :\ \ \mbox{Yul Brenner}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k\ :\ \ \mbox{Don King}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

to the translations above.  Then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(f(c))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true or false according with whether Adam was bald.  We say that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true of all bald things and false of all non-bald things.  Thus the first of

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(b)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(k)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true while the second is false.  For confirmation of these truth evaluations, see pictures accompanying the [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]] articles on [[w:Yul Brenner|Yul Brenner]] and [[w:Don King|Don King]].  (Note.  The picture of Don King has been removed from the Wikipedia article.  However, he rather famously is not bald.)

Now add

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}(x, y, z)\ :\ \ x\ \mbox{is between}\ y\ \mbox{and}\ z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

to the translations above.  Then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}(g(x, y), u, v)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is neither true nor false because, as above, 

: &lt;math&gt;g(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

does not name anything.  For that matter, neither do the variables &lt;math&gt;u\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  But if we again abuse &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; a bit by permitting numerals to serve as zero place operation letters, then the first of

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}(g(3, 3), 1, 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}(g(7, 3), 1, 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true while the second is false.

=== Sentential connectives ===

The predicate language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will use sentential connectives just as they were used in the sentential language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  These were:

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot,\ \land,\ \lor,\ \rightarrow,\ \mathrm{and}\ \leftrightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using the translations already set above (together with letting numerals be zero-place operation letters),

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(f(d)) \lor \mathrm{G}(g(7, 3), 1, 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true while

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(f(d)) \land \mathrm{G}(g(7, 3), 1, 4)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is false.

=== Quantifiers ===

''Quantifiers'' are special symbols that allow us to construct general sentences which are about all thing or about some (at least one) things.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Universal quantifier:}\ \forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; translates to English as 'for all ''x'''.
:* &lt;math&gt;\forall x\ \mathrm{F}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''universal generalization''.
:* &lt;math&gt;\forall x\ \mathrm{F}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  is true if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x),\!&lt;/math&gt;  is true of all objects in the domain.  Roughly speaking, it is true if 
::: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(a_1) \land \mathrm{F}(a_2) \land ... \land \mathrm{F}(a_n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: where each &lt;math&gt;(a_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; names an object in the domain and all objects in the domain are named.  This is only a rough characterization, however.  First, we do not require that all objects in the domain have a name in the predicate languange.  Second, we allow there to be infinitely many objects in the domain but do not  allow infinitely long sentences.
:* Some authors use &lt;math&gt;(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This notation is semi-obsolete and is becoming ever less frequent.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Existential quantifier:}\ \exists\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;\exists x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; translates to English as 'there exists an ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; or, perhaps a bit more clearly, 'there exists at least one ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;\exists x\ \mathrm{F}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''existential generalization''.
:* &lt;math&gt;\exists x\ \mathrm{F}(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true of at least one object in the domain.  Roughly speaking, it is true if 
::: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(a_1) \lor \mathrm{F}(a_2) \lor ... \lor \mathrm{F}(a_n)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: where each &lt;math&gt;(a_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; names an object in the domain and all objects in the domain are named.  This is only a rough characterization, however.  First, we do not require that all objects in the domain have a name in the predicate languange.  Second, we allow there to be infinitely many objects in the domain but do not  allow infinitely long sentences.

== Translation ==

Using the translation scheme

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F}(x)\ :\ \ x\ \mbox{is a number}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{G}(x)\ :\ \ x\ \mbox{is prime}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we translate as follows.

: All numbers are prime.
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x(Fx \rightarrow Gx)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Some numbers are prime.
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x(Fx \land Gx)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: No numbers are prime. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''(two equivalent alternatives are given)''
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x(Fx \rightarrow \lnot Gx)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x(Fx \land Gx)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Some numbers are not prime.
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x(Fx \land \lnot Gx)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Now using the translation scheme

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}(x)\ :\ \ x\ \mbox{is a person}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}(x, y)\ :\ \ x\ \mbox{loves}\ y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g\ :\ \ \mbox{George}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;m\ :\ \ \mbox{Martha}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we can translate as follows.

: George loves Martha.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}(g, m)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Martha loves George.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}(m, g)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: George and Martha love each other.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}(g, m) \land \mathrm{L}(m, g)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


We can further translate as follows.

: Everybody loves everybody. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''(the second alternative assumes only persons in the domain)''
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (\mathrm{P}(x) \rightarrow \forall y (\mathrm{P}(y) \rightarrow \mathrm{L}(x, y)))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \mathrm{L}(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Somebody loves somebody. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''(the second alternative assumes only persons in the domain)''
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x (\mathrm{P}(x) \land \exists y (\mathrm{P}(y) \land \mathrm{L}(x, y)))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists x \exists y \mathrm{L}(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Everybody loves somebody (or other). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''(the second alternative assumes only persons in the domain)''
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (\mathrm{P}(x) \rightarrow \exists y (\mathrm{P}(y) \land \mathrm{L}(x, y)))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y \mathrm{L}(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Somebody is loved by everybody. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''(the second alternative assumes only persons in the domain)''
: &lt;math&gt;\exists y \forall x (\mathrm{P}(y) \land (\mathrm{P}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{L}(x, y)))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists y \forall x \mathrm{L}(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Everybody is loved by somebody (or other). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''(the second alternative assumes only persons in the domain)''
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y (\mathrm{P}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{P}(y) \land \mathrm{L}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y \mathrm{L}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Somebody loves everybody. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''(the second alternative assumes only persons in the domain)''
: &lt;math&gt;\exists y \forall x (\mathrm{P}(y) \land (\mathrm{P}(x) \rightarrow \mathrm{L}(y, x)))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists y \forall x \mathrm{L}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

== Overview ==

The '''''Floo Network''''' is the network of fireplaces able to be reached by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo Powder]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When we first see people traveling by Floo Powder, no mention is made of the Network as a separate entity; you simply travel until you reach the correct fireplace. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], where the Network is first mentioned by name, we are told that the fireplace at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Number 4, Privet Drive]] has been temporarily added to the Floo Network. And in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] it is mentioned that the Floo network is being monitored. This possibility that it could be monitored rules out its use for getting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] out of Privet Drive and into a safe house in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

== Analysis ==

The Floo Network can be used for travel or for communications – you can allow just your head to travel, and leave your body where it is. This ability to communicate by allowing just your head to travel is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] on several occasions, by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] on two occasions, and by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] on one occasion.

There is apparently a sub-office of the Ministry of Magic, called the Floo Regulation Panel in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], which is responsible for keeping the Floo Network operating.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] we are told that the Floo network has been connected to Hogwarts to allow students to return to school after Christmas. This seems a little odd, as we already know that the fires in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gryffindor House|Gryffindor tower]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] masters' offices, and the headmasters' study are connected to the network; presumably this means that the fires in the Head of House offices have been set to respond to people desiring to travel to Hogwarts. Perhaps it is possible to make a &quot;concealed&quot; entry in the Floo network; you need to know the name of a fireplace before you can get there, perhaps it is possible to have some fireplaces be &quot;ex directory&quot; so that you need to be told the name, which presumably would not be obvious, before going to that grate. In this case, &quot;connecting to the Floo network&quot; would actually mean &quot;publishing a new name for the head of house's fireplace&quot;. 

Alternately, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] appeared in the fireplace in his own office in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], in almost every other case we only saw the use of the Floo network into Hogwarts for communication. It is possible that there is some mechanism that prevents anything larger than a head from traveling to any other fireplace in Hogwarts. Such a security mechanism would certainly be a reasonable precaution for a school. In this case, &quot;connecting to the Floo network&quot; would involve removing the size limitation so that a whole person could travel to that fireplace.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] is on the Floo network – Harry is able to use the Floo network to talk to people there. As its existence is only known to members of the Order of the Phoenix, how is it possible for the Floo Regulation Panel to keep it connected? Is it even necessary for them to act to keep it connected?
# Would Floo network connection be a paid service, like phones? You have to buy Floo powder, do you think you'd also have to buy connection to the Floo network?

|5.1&amp;nbsp;After&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;feast&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
|&amp;nbsp;
|1 After these things, there was a Festival of the Judeans; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
|&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline;&quot;&gt;IHS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ENG.&lt;U&gt;Jesus&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;AR.Yeshua&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jesus: universal language&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|5:2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a &lt;i&gt;pool&lt;/i&gt;, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
|Swimming pool&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;kappa;&amp;omicron;&amp;lambda;&amp;upsilon;&amp;mu;&amp;beta;&amp;eta;&amp;theta;&amp;rho;&amp;alpha;&lt;/b&gt; (2861)
|2 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, called in Aramaic, 'Bethesda,' having five covered colonnades.
|&lt;small&gt;AR.&lt;U&gt;Bethesda&lt;/U&gt; (''N.I.V.'')&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|5:3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
|&amp;nbsp;
|3 Under these porches there used to lay a great number of invalids, people who were blind or lame or with withered limbs. &amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
|&amp;nbsp;
|4 For at times an angel went down into the pool and disturbed the water. Whoever then stepped in first, after the water moved, was cured of suffering, whatever the ailment happened to be.
|&lt;small&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;

|5 And there was a man there who had been infirm for thirty-eight years.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he says unto him, Will you be made whole?
|&amp;nbsp;
|6 Jesus saw him lying there, and knowing that he had been in that condition for a long time, asked him, &quot;Do you wish to be made strong again?&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|7 &quot;Sir,&quot; replied the invalid man, &quot;I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed: when I try to move someone else steps down before me.&quot; 
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:8 Jesus says unto him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.
|&amp;nbsp;
|8 &quot;Rise up,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;take your mat with you and walk.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
|&amp;nbsp;
|9 Immediately, the man was restored to health, and he took up his mat and began to walk. That day was the Sabbath.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
|&amp;nbsp;
|10 So the Judeans said to the man who had been cured, &quot;It is the Sabbath: you must not carry your mat.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up your bed, and walk.
|&amp;nbsp;
|11 &quot;He who cured me,&quot; he replied, &quot;said to me, `Take your mat with you and walk.' “
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto you, Take up your bed, and walk?
|&amp;nbsp;
|12 “Who is the man,&quot; they asked, &quot;that said to you, `Take your mat with you and walk'?&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:13 And he that was healed know not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
|&amp;nbsp;
|13 But the man did not know who cured him; for Jesus had passed through the crowd unnoticed.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:14 Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.
|&amp;nbsp;
|14 After a time, Jesus found him in the Temple and said, &quot;You are now restored to health. Do not sin anymore, or something worse may befall you.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
|&amp;nbsp;
|15 The man went and told the Judeans that it was Jesus who had restored him to health;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
|&amp;nbsp;
|16 and on this account the Judeans began to persecute Jesus&amp;mdash;because He did these things on the Sabbath.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:17 But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.
|&amp;nbsp;
|17 His reply was, &quot;My Father continues to work, and so do I.&quot;
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
|&amp;nbsp;
|18 Then the Judeans were more eager to put Him to death, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also spoke of God as being His Father, thus making Himself equal with God.

|5:19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things whatsoever he does, these also does the Son likewise.
|&amp;nbsp;
|19 Jesus answered by saying, &quot;In all truthfulness, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of Himself&amp;mdash;He can only do what He sees the Father doing; for whatever HE does, the Son does in like manner.
|&lt;small&gt;COPT.&lt;U&gt;answered&amp;nbsp;saying&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;AR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(3:10)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|5:20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that all of you may marvel.
|&amp;nbsp;
|20 The Father loves the Son and reveals to Him all that HE is doing. And greater deeds than these will HE reveal to Him, in order that you may wonder.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:21 For as the Father raises up the dead, and replenishes life to them; even so the Son gives life to whom he will.
|&amp;nbsp;
|21 For as the Father awakens the dead and gives them life, so the Son gives life to whom He wills.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:22 For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son:
|&amp;nbsp;
|22 For the Father judges no one, but has committed judgment wholly to the Son,
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|23 that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father which has sent Him.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word, (o. logos) and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
|&amp;nbsp;
|24 &quot;In all truthfulness, I tell you, the one that listens to my teaching and &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/font&gt; in HIM who sent me has eternal Life, and does not come under judgment, but has passed from death into Life.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
|&amp;nbsp;
|25 &quot;Truthfully again, I tell you that a time is coming, even now comes, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:26 For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;
|&amp;nbsp;
|26 For just as the Father has life, so HE has given to the Son to have that life in Himself.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:27 And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
|&amp;nbsp;
|27 And HE has given Him authority to act as Judge, because He is the Son of Man.

|-
|5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
|&amp;nbsp;
|28 Do not wonder at this. An hour will come when all the dead in the graves will hear His voice,
|&amp;nbsp;

|5:29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the &lt;i&gt;resurrection of life&lt;/i&gt;; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

|-
|5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|30 &quot;I can do nothing on My own. As I hear, so I judge; and Mine is a just judgment, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of HIM who sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
|&amp;nbsp;
|31 &quot;If I give evidence on Myself, My witness cannot be accepted.

|-
|5:33 All of you sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
|&amp;nbsp;
|33 &quot;You sent to John, and he was a witness to the truth.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:34 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that all of you might be saved.
|&amp;nbsp;
|34 But the evidence which I receive is not from any man; though I say all this that you may be saved.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:35 He was a burning and a shining light: and all of you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
|&amp;nbsp;
|35 He was the lamp that did burn and did shine, and for a time you were willing to bathe in his light.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:36 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|36 &quot;But I have a greater witness than John; for the work the Father has appointed me to complete&amp;mdash;the very work which I am doing&amp;mdash;affords testimony concerning me that the Father has sent me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:37 And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. All of you have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
|&amp;nbsp;
|37 And the Father who sent me bore witness of me. None of you have ever heard HIS voice or seen what HE is like.
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|5:38 And all of you have not his word (o. logos) abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him all of you believe not.
|&amp;nbsp;
|38 Neither have you HIS word abiding within you, for you refuse to &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/font&gt; Him whom HE has sent.

|-
|5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them all of you think all of you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
|&amp;nbsp;
|39  &quot;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you will find eternal Life; these Scriptures testify about me;

|&amp;nbsp;
|40 But you are unwilling to come to me that you may have Life.

|41 &quot;I do not accept honor from such people.

=== Independence for the United States ===
{{wikipedia|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}
{{wikisource|Paris Peace Treaty}}

* [P] In comparison to the British, who are the settlers that established the United States?
* [G] What was the form of government of Great Britain?
* [G] What was different in the form of the government of the US from that of Britain?

Great Britain was the combination Scotland, Wales, and especially England on a large island near the continent of Europe. Settlers mostly from England had traveled west across the Atlantic ocean and had settled on a part of the east coast of the continent of North America, occupying areas where some indigenous peoples of the Americas had lived. These settlers had established colonies of under the jurisdiction of Britain. Beginning in 1775, some of the colonies them revolted against the British government. Thirteen of the colonies declared independence in 1776. The British military and the &quot;loyalists&quot; fought against the &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Continental&quot; rebels in the American Revolutionary War. The two European states of Spain and especially France intervened against Britain to support the rebels; Continental forces backed by the French navy forced the withdrawal of the main British forces in 1781. The &quot;Americans&quot; and the British met in Paris in 1783 for the treaty to end to war.

On the British side was King George III, whose nominal description in the treaty is &quot;Prince George the Third, by the grace of God, king of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith, duke of Brunswick and Lunebourg, arch-treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire etc.&quot;. This is a traditional expression of monarchy, in which God grants rule of a realm of Christians to an inherited position called a monarch. In actuality, King George III was leader of Great Britain, Ireland, and part of the Holy Roman Empire, but not any part of France. For the purposes of this treaty, he is the King of Great Britain. Despite being King, much actual power is found at the Parliament, which is not (FIXME what was role of Parliament at this time?)

The American side has no monarch. Article 1 of the treaty gives that this side consists of twelve &quot;sovereign and independent&quot; states. However, these are represented by a Congress as the &quot;United States of America&quot;. The lack of a monarch makes the treaty seem unequal, but is necessary because the states are formed from state constitutions. The United States is a supranational entity under the Articles of Confederation with borders (article 2 of the treaty) extending beyond the borders of the member states. These borders exclude other territory retained by Britain.

== The Pacific in 1783 ==
* TODO write questions

On the Pacific coast of South America, the major political entity was the Viceroyalty of Peru. As part of a series of conquests of territory, the forces of Spain had overrun the Inca Empire. This a series of actions by Spain, justified by the Pope, to spread the rule of Roman Christianity.

The Spanish placed the capital city of Lima and the regional capital of Santiago, Chile on the coast. The old Inca capital was Cusco farther inland. The economy consisted mostly of forcing the native population to labor for the Spaniards and exporting to Spain. (TODO: what was exported?) Lima was remote from Spain because the route by ship involved passing around the tip of South America and also crossing the Atlantic ocean. (The Viceroyalty of the River Plate had split in 1776 because of the inconvenience of routing trade through Lima on the Pacific coast, instead of using Buenos Aires on the Atlantic coast.)

Farther north, there was more Spanish colonies. The northernmost regions of the Viceroyalty of Peru were, since 1734, separated from that viceroyalty as the Viceroyalty of New Granada, with a capital at Bogota, which was not a port city. Wikipedia claims that ''travel and communications inside the Viceroyalty (were) difficult''.

The northernmost possession of the Viceroyalty of New Granada was Panama. North of that existed the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This administered the territory in the Americas north of Panama. Its capital was Mexico City. Across the Pacific ocean, in the west, this viceroyalty possessed the Philippines.

In China, the Qing Dynasty ruled. Qianlong Emperor ruled while Heshen took much power.

Obviously...
[http://supportconnect.ca.com supportconnect.ca.com]
The best place to go is to open Product Home Pages, then Unicenter Network and Systems Management in the drop down list. 
There are a number of links here but the most useful is the Latest Implementation CD, which has an excellent range of technical resource info, how to guides, and information about various obscure CA tools and utilities.

'''Unicenter Network and Systems Management: Working With Agents 3.1'''
This is pdf guide book available from CA that describes in detail the operation of the DSM and communication, and possible methods for configuring agents.

'''Diagnostics Guide'''
The CA pdf Diagnostics Guide for Unicenter® TNG 2.4 Unicenter® Network and Systems Management 3.0 has an excellent guide to things to try and diagnose faults and problems.


== Web Discussion Groups ==
Tek-tips maintain an active Unicenter newsgroup at: [http://www.tek-tips.com Tek-Tips]. They also have newsgroups for many other CA products such as Brighstor/Arcserve

Apsion also have an active newsgroup for Unicenter users at: [http://www.apsion.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=7 Apsion Unicenter Forum]


== SNMP Resources ==
No one can really leverage this toolset without understanding SNMP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Syntax ==
unifstat
unifstat -c *|component -u *|sub-component
unifstat -c xxx lists status of a component only

== Examples ==
unifstat displays all components
unifstat -TRP show status of TRP service (catrapd)

== Categories ==
Enterprise Manager, Common services, catrapd, OPR

== When You Might Use It ==
Shows the status of enterprise management components as either ACTIVE or INACTIVE. When a component is disabled via EM settings, has been stopped or just crashed for no reason (as the TRP often does) the status shows as INACTIVE.

When diagnosing any EM related problem along with awservices status, this is one of top two commands to check what the problem might be. typically you would run unicntrl start all after finding your treasured component is not running anymore.

Component names include: SEC Security, RPT Reporting, SCH Scheduling, UNI Common (calendar), SCHM Workload manager, SCHA Workload agent, TRP catrapd

== Other Related Commands ==
awservices, unicntrl

== NSM Versions and Platforms Applicable ==
should be all hosts with EM installed

== Possible Bugs and Challenges ==
can be hard to figure out relationship between a component, sub-component and how this can be started or stopped using unicntrl

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some methods of '''Determining Hardware''' currently on the system:

* run '''dmesg''' (works well on *BSD)
* use KDE Info Center (K Menu -&gt; System -&gt; Info Center)

{{TODO|todonote=Describe how to determine video hardware while X11 is running (or create a page at [[Guide to X11]] and link to it).}}

{{Guide to Unix/Stub}}

=== Examples ===
Run '''dmesg''' on a *BSD system to determine the kernel version, amount of memory, and whether this computer has an audio device.
 $ '''dmesg | less'''
 ...
 OpenBSD 3.8 (GENERIC) #425: Sat Sep 10 15:49:26 MDT 2005
     deraadt@macppc.openbsd.org:/usr/src/sys/arch/macppc/compile/GENERIC
 real mem = 268435456 (262144K)
 avail mem = 236363776 (230824K)
 using 1254 buffers containing 13418496 bytes of memory
 mainbus0 (root)
 ...
 mpcpcibr1 at mainbus0: uni-north, Revision 0x5
 pci1 at mpcpcibr1 bus 0
 ...
 macobio0 at pci1 dev 23 function 0 &quot;Apple Intrepid&quot; rev 0x00
 ...
 snapper0 at macobio0: irq 30,1,2
 ...
 audio0 at snapper0
 ...

This system has an OpenBSD 3.8 kernel, which matches the OpenBSD 3.8 operating system distribution. (Generally, the kernel on a *BSD matches some version of the system. In contrast, there are many combinations of Linux kernels and systems.)

The real memory is 262144K, but only 230824K is &quot;avail&quot;, which probably means available. Divide by 1024 to convert to megabytes, using '''bc''' or some other method:
 $ '''bc'''
 '''262144 / 1024'''
 256
 '''230824 / 1024'''
 225
 '''quit'''

This computer has 256 MB of memory, but only 225 MB are &quot;avail&quot;. Because we used bc, the answers are rounded down to integers.

This line from the dmesg output indicates the presence of an audio device:
 audio0 at snapper0

We can go up the dmesg, learning that we have audio0 at snapper0 at macobio0 at pci1 at mpcpcibr1 at mainbus0. However, we are probably only interested in &quot;audio0&quot;, which means that we have an audio device, and &quot;snapper0&quot; if we want to know the type of sound card providing this audio. On this computer, it should be possible to install programs that play sound and music.

'''Need to send an email?'''

Gmail makes it very easy to send emails to your friends. First log into your Gmail account. Once you have logged into your account, you will notice a blue colored link under the Gmail logo that reads, &quot;Compose Mail&quot;. The &quot;Compose Mail&quot; link is the link you will be pressing whenever you send an email.

'''Analyzing the screen'''

Once you click the &quot;Compose Mail&quot; link within your Gmail account, the page will change. You will be taken to a new page where you will actually write your email, or better said, compose your email. Lets analyze this new page.

First you will notice that there are three new buttons that have appeared. These buttons are in the following order: ''Send'', ''Save Now'', and ''Discard''. The ''Send'' button is only pressed once you have completed composing your email in order to send the email to the addressee. The ''Save Now'' button is used to save the email to your account's draft folder in order to access it, and maybe finish writing the email, in a later time. The ''Discard'' button is used when you would like to discard the email or better said, delete the email. Take note that when you discard an email it is deleted and unrecoverable.

Next we will notice there is a ''To:'' field on the page. This field is where you type the email address of the person you are sending the email to. For example, if you are sending an email to Linus and his email is linus@linux.org then you will type linus@linux.org into the ''To:'' field. You can also send the same email to multiple email address by adding a ''';''' between email address. For example, I can send an email to more than one friend by typing their emails into the ''To:'' field in the following format: linus@linux.org; richardstallman@gnu.org

The next text field that we see is the ''Subject'' field. This is where you type the subject of the email. The subject will be seen by the person that you are sending the email prior to he or she opening the email. It is good practice to include descriptive but short subjects whenever possible.

Last but not least, we have the body field. This field is not labeled as ''body'' but that is what it is called. The body field is where you will be writing your email.

'''How to send the email'''

Once you have filled in each field you will be able to send the email. This is done by pressing the ''Send'' button which is located on top of the screen and also at the bottom of the screen. Both ''Send'' buttons have the same function. Try to send an email to your self in order to practice the fine art of email composing.

Frozen drinks, freezes, or blended drinks all refer to drinks made by blending ice, liqueurs, and mixers.  Smoothies are popular in many parts of the United States now, and in much the same fashion involve blending ice, juice, and fruit.

Almost any of these can be made virgin by simply removing the alcohol;  it is recommended to blend the drinks virgin and pour into a glass with the alcohol waiting.  This allows a single, large blender to be made full of the drink and served to minors and other non-drinkers as well as legal drinkers; and also allows you to avoid washing the blender if you're hammering out, say, 4 Piña Coladas for some kids, 1 for the designated driver, and 2 for a couple teachers needing a good nerve relaxant.

==Making a blended drink==
Follow the below instructions when mixing a freeze.  Remember to use a heavy-duty blender capable of continuously crunching through ice; most residential-quality blenders will quickly dull, wear, or break if given the task of constantly chopping ice cubes into bits and pieces.  If you're going for simple preparation at home, make sure the blender you buy can handle ice; if you want to hold parties or open a bar as a small business, get a heavier duty one that can stand the workload.

* Make sure the blender is off.
* Stack the blender a quarter full of ice.
* Begin adding the mixers until the ice just begins to float.
* Put the lid on.  If you're wondering what will happen if you don't, then leave the lid off.
* Make sure no hair, fingers, or clothing are trapped in the blender or anywhere they can get caught up in.
* Hold the lid down with one hand.
* Start the blender at low speed.
* After a few seconds, switch to high speed until the ingredients are well blended.
* Pour the mixed drink into the glass, over whatever alcohol is being added.

This isn't exactly a meatloaf imitation, but it is a hearty version of a vegetarian classic. 

==Ingredients==
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Rice|brown rice]] (not all will be used)
*&amp;frac12; cup [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]]
*2&amp;frac12; cups [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*1 beaten [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tablespoon]] (approx.) seasoned [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
*&amp;frac12; finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 Tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

==Procedure==
Cook the lentils (in about 1&amp;frac12; cups of stock, with the bay leaf). Cover and simmer for approximately 45 minutes, or until lentils are tender but not falling apart (they should offer slight resistance to the bite). You may need to add additional stock during cooking; the lentils should remain covered. At the same time, cook the brown rice in 1 cup of stock--bring the stock to a boil, add rice, reduce heat to low, cover and cook at lowest setting for 50 minutes.

Empty about three-quarters of the rice into a bowl, along with lentils. A little liquid from the lentils should be added--maybe two to three tablespoons' worth, but not too much. To the lentil-rice mixture add the egg, onion, olive oil and bread crumbs. Adjust ratio of rice to lentils by adding more rice if desired. Add bread crumbs until mixture holds together.

Place mixture in a small greased baking dish and bake at 350&amp;deg; F for 35 minutes, or until a crust is formed around the edge. Allow to cool for at least ten minutes before cutting and serving. Serves 4.

An excilent resource for EV conversion is the [http://www.evdl.org/ EVDL (EV Discussion List)], perhaps joining and requesting help with the document would work!  You might also ask specific questions regarding areas you feel are lacking, while pointing listers to that area of the article directly. --[[User:D0li0|D0li0]] 06:57, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

==Comments from an EVDL member==
I'm forwarding these comments from an EVDL member:
* In the diagram [[:Image:WPEVStartRun.png]] image, the relay is called Ry RL, but down in the text it's referred to as Ry RS.
:(?) I did find AS, now corrected to A-S (''Alarm-Start&quot;). - [[User:Leonard G.|Leonard G.]] 06:17, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
* Just a question:  in the first part of the article, it talks about how the car should operate like an ICE vehicle, requiring the key to be turned to the Start position.  But then later in the article, it talks about breaking people of the habit of the pressing the accelerator pedal.  Maybe I'm one of those operators of older vehicles talked about, but I still press the accelerator when I start my car, whether it's fuel-injected or not.  So it seems like in the same description, it's trying to make the car start like an ICE vehicle, and yet not make it start like an ICE vehicle.
:Good point, I am taking this as saying that the prose needs work, not the design - [[User:Leonard G.|Leonard G.]] 06:17, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

* The rectangular area called In Cab confused me.  At first, I thought it was some special kind of component.  Then I came to think that, no, it's not a component at all; it just represents &quot;somewhere inside the cab.&quot;  I think this latter view is the correct one, but I'd like text and/or picture to make it clearer.  I'm also not sure what the short blue wire between &quot;Run Buss&quot; and &quot;Run:&quot; is for.  My guess is that it's for other systems that are activated only when the ignition state has been latched, but the text doesn't make that clear--and this also added to my confusion about the In Cab being a component.
:The short blue wire is the run-latch path. Ry RL is initially pulled down by the ''Start'' signal via Ry A-S (if the interlock chain is closed). The left part of the blue line applies power to Ry RL. If not latched, this would open when ''Start'' is no longer applied, so ''Ignition'' (brown) is applied via the closed contacts to the ''Run Buss'' and thence through D1 to hold the relay closed.
:Will clarify the diagram with respect to ''Cab''. ''This is currently clarified in the associated text.''

* I don't know what this means:  &quot;The run buss is grounded when not in the run state, allowing additional interlocks to be included in order to ensure proper shutdown.&quot;   Where would these additional interlock be placed?  How would they ensure proper shutdown? 
: For example, run power from the headlights through a diode to an acoustic alarm that has its negative side on the run buss. If lights are on and run buss is grounded (not running), alarm sounds. Lights off and running, reverse current flow into the low resistance lighting is blocked by the diode. Lights on and running, both ends of circuit are high, no alarm. ''A diagram showing this has been added.'' By adding a switch when the parking brake is firmly pulled then a similar alarm can be applied via clock or dome light power (on at all times), alarm if off and parking brake not well pulled.

* Finally, I had to think about diode D1.  When the key switch is in the Start position and both relays are enabled, there will be 12V on each side of the diode.  Therefore the diode won't conduct, since one side isn't lower in voltage than the other.  When the key switch is then returned to the On position, the Alarm-Start Relay will open, removing the +12V on the negative side of the diode, so the diode will start conducting, thus keeping the ''Run Latch Relay'' (Ry RL) energized.  Is that correct?  If so, maybe an explanation could be added to that effect for dummies like me.  If not, then perhaps add a description of the way it really works.
:Your description is correct. Note that without the diode that the ''Ground Not Run'' (GNR) function will short the start preventing the run-latch from pulling in.

*Thanks for your good work here ''(That's for '''YOU''', not me)''.  Hope this helps. - Bill Dennis --[[User:D0li0|D0li0]] 11:44, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

Wow this is big. Shouldn't this go in WikiBooks?

== updating bookshelf with new category engineering-automotive ==

Hi I found your wikibook, and just want to let you know that I added to the engineering bookshelf in a new category Automotive.  I found some other titles that I have put in there also.  I think we may be able to get quite a section going...  If you like I can put the development icon up looks like your book is going well!
[[User:Richimoto|Richimoto]] 02:50, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

== Hybrid ==
I suggest include information to convert a petroleum vehicle into an gas/electric [[w:hybrid vehicle|hybrid vehicle]].

== Solar power ==
I suggest include information about how to convert a petroleum vehicle into a [[w:tribrid vehicle|tribid]] or solar electric vehicle (how to install the right [[w:solar panel|solar panels]].


----
''Such skills are difficult to come by in many states since the low tax attitudes and laws have lead to the removal of shop classes of various types from the intermediate and high school programs'' In my high school, I attended in the last year of auto shop availablility, which I didn't realize at the time.(California, few years ago)

----
Think this is important and suggest put it in this or another specific wikibook.--[[User:Lagoset|Lagoset]] ([[User talk:Lagoset|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lagoset|contribs]]) 07:20, 13 May 2015 (UTC)

== List of successful conversions ==

I suggest people make a list of successful conversions so continuous improvement can happen. People would see the best conversions and have that as a starting point.
The table would include:&lt;br&gt;
car | miles/charge | max speed | total cost of conversion | type of engine (airplane, forklift ect) | ... 
If you have any other ideas for table headers, just edit this comment.

: Good. --[[User:Lagoset|Lagoset]] ([[User talk:Lagoset|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lagoset|contribs]]) 07:22, 13 May 2015 (UTC)

== Languages ==

Suggest translate to other languages, beginning with Spanish.. I am going to ask here the doubts about words when translating. Also suggest a Wikibook about [[Kit car]] (kit motorcycle, how to convert bycicle to electric bycicle...)--[[Special:Contributions/147.84.132.44|147.84.132.44]] ([[User talk:147.84.132.44|discuss]]) 08:17, 13 February 2013 (UTC)
: Good idea!.--[[User:Lagoset|Lagoset]] ([[User talk:Lagoset|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lagoset|contribs]]) 07:21, 13 May 2015 (UTC)

== Cars ==

There would be a wikibook for buses / trucks, other for cars and other for bicycles. --[[User:Lagoset|Lagoset]] ([[User talk:Lagoset|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lagoset|contribs]]) 07:08, 13 May 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, you are now embarking into the wonderful world of physics. Physics is probably the most applicable of the three pure sciences (Biology, Physics, and Chemistry). The study of physics is not meant to answer fundamental questions about our existence in this wonderful universe. In physics, scientists make observations, develop theories, experiment and revise their theories. Physics tells us how gravity behaves but does not speak to gravity's origin. Don't confuse physics and philosophy. If one desires to obtain meaningful answers to life's deepest questions, he or she should not rely exclusively on the study of physics.

Physics textbooks often explain ideas in complex terms and these terms tend to confuse most students.  This textbook will attempt to explain ideas in the simplest terms possible and avoid confusing language.

Throughout the book there will be the following conventions to help you understand physics.

'''Mnemonics'''
basically, it will represent easier ways to represent complex ideas

'''&quot;Think of it this way&quot;'''
will present applied ways to think about the concept

'''&quot;Falling apples&quot;'''
presents possibilities in which people commonly associate with the wrong idea in mind and to be sure to fix that mistake.

{{recipe}}

These '''Corn Muffins''' are moist and sweet with a slightly crunchy crust.  This recipe is based on a recipe (quintessential corn muffins) from Rose Levy Berenbaum's Bread Bible, but with yogurt substituted for the sour cream. This is also double her recipe.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup (128g) [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]
* 1 cup plus 1 TBSP (150g) bleached all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 4 TBSP plus 4 tsp (66g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1-1/3 cups [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] or sour cream
* 4 TBSP [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted

==Procedure==
# Melt the butter and allow to cool.  I find it helpful to pour the butter from ramekin to ramekin, which both lubes up the ramekins and cools the butter.
# Mix the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together.  Whisk together the egg and yogurt, and stir them quickly into the dry goods, leaving some lumps.  
# Add the melted butter and fold.
# Pour into ramekins or muffin tins
# Bake 15-18 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or until the tops are golden.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* This recipe makes a fine cornmeal, too, if poured into a 6x9 inch pan instead of muffin tins.

      <comment>/* Pegword Example */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pegword Example==
The pegword example given of a shopping list is more appropriate for a link system.  I cannot think of a good reason why you would want to recall the third item in your shopping list.  I suggest the pegword example be rewritten using U.S. Presidents, or some other example where order is useful.

After a little more thought, I realized that there's only one additional association required when using pegs vs. links, and the link between the first item and the number one actually helps you remember what the first item in the list was.  In retrospect, I withdraw my comment, but we should add some text describing this rationale.

==It's versus its==
See http://www.stormloader.com/garyes/its/#top

== I think the &quot;Drugs and Vitamins&quot; section should be moved.  ==

While they may affect memory and concentration, they are not mnemonic techniques. Reading this it seems clear that &quot;Visualization&quot; is an introduction to this module, and &quot;how to remember whatever you want&quot; is a conclusion, but &quot;Drugs and Vitamins&quot; seems tacked on and completely out of place in this section. It may be relevant to the book, but it does not belong in this section.[[User:JeffStickney|JeffStickney]] 00:42, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

== I broke the numbers and digits section off into its own module ==

While its not too long or complicated, it is abstract enough that a reader will not intuitively grasp it at a glance. If it is in its own section it will separated from distractions, and a reader will is less likely to inadvertently scroll away before he or she &quot;gets it&quot;. I'd also like to eventually add another module. I know a system that combines this number system with pegwords to memorize playing cards.[[User:JeffStickney|JeffStickney]] 01:12, 22 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''External Beam RT for unresectable disease'''

*'''Kyoto Japan''' PMID 15966192 -- ''Unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma completely reduced by external radiation therapy.'' ('''2005 Kaido''' T, Hepatogastroenterology. 2005 May-Jun;52(63):725-7.)
**Case report - 1 patient, 4 years out, with complete resolution after RT (EBRT 60 Gy in 30 sessions)

*'''Yamagata Japan''' PMID 12828045 -- ''Management of unresectable hilar bile duct cancer--preoperative diagnosis, treatment selection, and clinical outcome.'' ('''2003 Hirai''' I, Hepatogastroenterology. 2003 May-Jun;50(51):614-20.)
**Retrospective. 40 nonsurgical patients.
**Reasons for no resection: extensive vessel invasion, broad biliary extension
**RT better prognosis than no RT (p=0.01)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Portal and arterial invasion were the principal reasons for unresectability. Use of an expandable metallic stent or radiation therapy, and a total bilirubin level of less than 2 mg/dL on discharge, were factors that enhanced survival in unresectable cases, but distant metastasis, dissemination, and poor general condition or liver function were negative factors for survival.&quot;

*'''Miami 1985-97''' PMID 11677948 -- ''Management of hilar bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''2001 Bathe''' OF, Hepatogastroenterology. 2001 Sep-Oct;48(41):1289-94.)
**Retrospective. 55 patients, 19 curative resection.
**2-year survival longer in resection 47% vs. 18% (p=0.03)
**No benefit to RT (either postoperative RT or in unresectable disease)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Locoregional extent of disease is the greatest problem in cases of proximal bile duct cancers. Resection provides the best hope for long-term survival, but new adjuvant strategies are needed.&quot;

*'''Ajou Korea 1990-93''' PMID 11677950 -- ''The experiences of hilar skeletonization for the treatment of locally advanced proximal bile duct cancer.'' ('''2001 Kim''' MW, Hepatogastroenterology. 2001 Sep-Oct;48(41):1298-301.)
**Prospective. 45 patients (16 curative resection, 15 noncurative resection, 14 nonresection)
**Survival same for curative resection and noncurative resection + RT (p=NS)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;he resection is the treatment of choice for locally advanced proximal bile duct cancer, if resectable and the noncurative resection followed by postoperative external radiotherapy may be beneficial to the patients with locally advanced proximal bile duct cancer.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam Netherlands 1992-99''' PMID 11354319 -- ''Palliative treatment in patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma: results of endoscopic drainage in patients with type III and IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2001 Gerhards''' MF, Eur J Surg. 2001 Apr;167(4):274-80.)
**Retrospective. 41 patients treated with biliary drainage, 12 also PTBD
**Radiotherapy had no influence on survival (unclear from abstract if EBRT or BT)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The patients in this series had relatively long survival times, during which they had a substantial number of complications predominantly related to biliary drainage. Because biliary-enteric bypass operations result in effective relief of symptoms and excellent palliation, we suggest that when an exploration is done for patients with type III and IV tumours, a bypass should be made.&quot;

*'''Kagoshima Japan''' PMID 11064386 -- ''Length and quality of survival following external beam radiotherapy combined with expandable metallic stent for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2000 Shinchi''' H, J Surg Oncol. 2000 Oct;75(2):89-94.)
**Retrospective. 51 patients, 30 stent + EBRT vs. 10 stent alone vs. 11 PTBD alone
**Mean survival: PTBD 4.4 months vs. stent alone 6.4 months vs. stent + EBRT 10.6 months (p&lt;0.05)    
**Quality of surival: PTBD 57.7 KPS vs. stent alone 68.1 KPS vs. stent + EBRT 74.9 KPS (p&lt;0.01)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These results indicate that external radiotherapy combined with metallic biliary endoprosthesis can increase the length and quality of survival and consequently provide a definite palliative benefit for patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot; 

*'''NHS Trust UK''' PMID 9038668 -- ''A retrospective comparison of endoscopic stenting alone with stenting and radiotherapy in non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''1996 Bowling''' TE, Gut. 1996 Dec;39(96):852-5.)
**Case-control. 56 patients treated with stenting alone (28 pts) or stenting + ILRT/EBRT (28 pts)
**Median survival: stenting 7 months vs. stenting + RT 10 months (p=0.06), but survival advantage for RT during first 9 months
**More RT patients required stent changes and had longer hospital stays
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The survival advantage of radiotherapy in those with a type II/III stricture is seen only in the first 10 months after diagnosis. The costs of radiotherapy and significantly increased time spent in hospital, however, raise doubts over its routine use in the management of non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

*'''Jefferson 1983-1992''' PMID 7480704 -- ''Cholangiocarcinoma: clinical significance of tumor location along the extrahepatic bile duct.'' ('''1995 Alden''' ME, Radiology. 1995 Nov;197(2):511-6.)
**Retrospective. 81 pts, 56 proximal, 25 distal. Median follow-up 28 months
**5-year OS: proximal 13% vs. distal 53% (p&lt;0.01)
**Proximal CA (RT or resection + RT or palliation): median survival no RT 6 mo vs. RT 17 mo (p=0.01). No benefit for resection in presence of RT
**Distal CA (resection +/- RT): no benefit for RT after resection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with proximal cancer should undergo primary RT, and expectations should be limited. Patients with distal cancer should undergo resection, and RT may not be needed.&quot;

*'''Mayo 1980-84''' PMID 7537346 -- ''&quot;Natural history&quot; of unresected cholangiocarcinoma: patient outcome after noncurative intervention.'' ('''1995 Farley''' DR, Mayo Clin Proc 1995; 70:425-9)
**Retrospective. 103 patients without curative surgery. 68% biopsy-proven mets (18% LN+)
**1-year and 5-year OS: 53% and 4%
**Survival advantage if palliative surgery or other palliative intervention
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Unresected cholangiocarcinoma is a rapidly fatal process, but early intervention affects the course of the disease and likely prolongs patient survival.&quot;

*'''Cleveland Clinic 1977-85''' PMID 1709795 -- ''Role of radiation after operative palliation in cancer of the proximal bile ducts.'' ('''1991 Grove''' MK, Am J Surg 1991; 161:454-8.)
**51 patients with proximal bile duct CA, 60% local, 40% extensive hepatic infiltration or distant mets. 44 patients dilated/intubated and analyzed
**Palliative RT (mean 37.7 Gy) in 30 (59%) patients. 3 received &lt;10 Gy for intolerance or early death. 1 received BT
***Metastatic disease: median survival  2.6 months -RT vs. 1.8 months +RT (p=NS)
***Local disease: median survival -RT 2.2 months vs. 12.2 months EBRT (p=0.005)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These findings suggest that the addition of external beam radiation improves survival in patients undergoing palliative treatment of hilar tumors.&quot;

*'''Leiden Netherlands 1968-83''' PMID 1687249 -- ''External radiotherapy and extrahepatic bile duct cancer.'' ('''1991 Tollenaar''' RA, Eur J Surg 1991; 157:587-9.)
**Retrospective. 55 patients treated with surgery, 29% received adjuvant RT (40-60 Gy)
**Median survival: overall 4 months, surgery only 3 months vs. adjuvant RT 16 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot; No firm conclusion about the role of radiotherapy can be drawn from these data because the patients were not randomly chosen to receive radiotherapy and selection was therefore biased.&quot;

**Retrospective. 552 cases treated at 55 centers. Extrahepatic BD only
**Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Bile_duct/Surgery]] for surgical details
**Additional palliative RT 12 months (11-35) vs. surgical palliation only 8 months (3-14) P&lt;0.1
**However, total number of patients treated with RT in both adjuvant and palliative setting was 27

*'''Hopkins''' PMID 1688486 -- ''Management of proximal cholangiocarcinomas by surgical resection and radiotherapy.'' ('''1990 Cameron''' JL, Am J Surg 1990; 159:91-7; discussion 97-8.)
**Retrospective. 96 patients, 55% resected (41% curative resection), 45% palliative stenting. 
**5-year OS: resected 8% vs. stented 0%
**RT given as EBRT 50-60Gy + some patients BT 2Gy boost: Adjuvant RT 72% (38/53), 51% BT boost;, palliative RT 58% (25/43), 10% BT boost
***Adjuvant RT: 3-year OS 31% both groups (p=NS), but all long term survivors received RT
***Palliative RT: 1-year OS 38% RT vs 9% no RT (p&lt;0.05)
***RT significantly extended survival in patients undergoing palliative stenting, but not in those undergoing resection.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We conclude that surgical resection of proximal cholangiocarcinomas can be performed safely and that it significantly prolongs survival.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you observe the motion of a pendulum, a child on a swing, or a speaker cone playing a low frequency sound, you will notice that in each case, there is movement backwards and forwards of the same distance from a center point, or in other words, a vibration. These objects that vibrate are said to '''oscillate'''.

==Observing oscillations==
===Free oscillations===
When an object is in free oscillation, it vibrates at its '''natural frequency'''. For example, if you strike a tuning fork, it will begin to vibrate for some time after you struck it, or if you hit a pendulum, it will always oscillate at the same frequency no matter how hard you hit it. All oscillating objects have a natural frequency, at which they will vibrate at once they have been moved from the '''equilibrium position'''.

===Forced oscillations===
Imagine a building in an earthquake. The ground is moving side to side, and the building (assuming that it is strong enough to not be completely destroyed by the forces) will be moving side to side with the ground. In this case, this oscillation is not the buildings natural frequency, but it is being forced to vibrate with the ground. This is a forced oscillation.
===Examples of oscillating systems===
*A mass that is held up with a spring
*A pendulum
*A string of a guitar

==Describing oscillations==

Oscillations can be shown on a displacement-time graph, like this:

[[Image:Simple harmonic motion.png]]

Notice that the curves are smooth. This is because the object slows down before changing direction, instead of bouncing back and forth, which is what a graph with straight lines and sharp corners would describe. Movement that has a displacement-time graph with curved lines like the one above, is called '''sinusoidal motion'''.

The graph can show us the differences between several oscillating systems. For an oscillating system, the graph shows us:

*The '''displacement''' at a given point in time,
*The '''amplitude''',
*The '''period''' and,
*The '''frequency'''

===Displacement===

The displacement at a certain point in time is the distance of the object away from the centre point. The displacement is 0 at the centre, at its maximum at one end (usually on the right when right is taken as positive), and at its greatest negative value on the opposite end (usually left but, again, only when right is taken as positive). Displacement is given the symbol ''s'' or ''x''.

===Amplitude===

The amplitude is the greatest displacement of an oscillating object. It is measured from the center point to one of the maximum points of displacement. The amplitude can increase or decrease with time. Amplitude is represented by the symbol ''A''

===Period and frequency===
period is the time taken for a single oscillation.
the frequency is the number of oscillations per second

==Simple harmonic motion==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
A body executes simple harmonic motion if its acceleration is proportional to its displacement from a fixed point, and is always in the direction of that point.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

To explore simple harmonic motion (SHM) let's take the example of a spring with a mass in the absence of gravity (interestingly, you get SHM even with gravity present).  If this is our ideal spring, the force is kx where k is a measure of the stiffness of the spring and x is the displacement.  The force is toward the origin if that is the equilibrium position of the spring, so we write -kx to remind ourselves of that.  Now, Newton's second law becomes

&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -kx&lt;/math&gt;.

This differential equation is easy enough to solve, and the answer is &lt;math&gt;A cos( \omega_0 t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt; where A and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants and &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m}&lt;/math&gt;.  It does not really matter how we got the solution, because we are physicists, not mathematicians.  This is the answer we are expecting, so we try it, and lo and behold, it works.  If you do not believe me, substitute it in.  Moreoever, this is the complete solution, and you will just have to believe me on that because it is slightly more difficult to prove.

Without loss of generality, we will take &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, also called the phase shift, to be zero (if you are concerned about this, we are just defining where t=0 is).

Now, a remarkable thing we recognize about the solution is that the frequency (radians per second), &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is independent of A.  That is, no matter how big the oscillations are, the frequency is the same.  A pendulum approximately undergoes SHM, so this is why they are used in clocks, the amplitude doesn't affect the period!  By the way, we have added the subscript zero to omega because we are going to have some other omegas soon.

Some terms to remember are frequency, f (cycles per second) = &lt;math&gt; \omega_0 / (2 \pi) &lt;/math&gt; and the period, T = &lt;math&gt; 1/f &lt;/math&gt;.  These are not so important, but often people will specify the frequency or the period instead of the angular frequency, so they can be helpful.

Now, to get the velocity, differentiate the position, and to get the acceleration, differentiate the velocity.  We have,

&lt;math&gt;v = A \omega_0 sin ( \omega_0 t)&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;a = -A \omega_0^2 cos( \omega_0 t) = - \omega_0^2 x&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, we have avoided saying what A is.  It turns out, it depends on the problem, or the initial conditions.  We can say the velocity or position of the oscillator at some t is something and then use the expression for v or a to find A.  You can do the same thing with the phase if you want, but it is a little tedious and doesn't tell us much.

Notice the greatest velocity is at the equilibrium position (x = 0) of the oscillation.  We can go one making such statements, but they are all extremely obvious if you simply plot out the position, velocity, and acceleration on the same graph.

==Damping==

An object that oscillates freely oscillates at its natural frequency. If it loses no energy, it will continue to oscillate forever. Damping is when an oscillating mass loses energy. There are 3 types of damping:

1) Light - The amplitude gradually decreases over time

2) Critical - The mass would overshoot 0 displacement

3) Heavy - The displacement decreases to 0 without any oscillation. 

The cause of damping is frictional forces, e.g. Car suspension

Let's try to quantify this a bit.  Say there is a friction force which is proportional to the velocity (this is a pretty good approximation in many cases) with constant of proportionality c.  Then, by Newton's second law,

&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + c \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation is a little trickier to solve than without the friction.  I am going to use a very nice trick which you will find throughout physics, and whenever you have similar equations.  Notice that if x is a solution and y is a solution, then ax + by is also a solution, where a and b are constants (real or complex).  This property means the equation is called &quot;linear.&quot;  We know that &lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = cos(x) + i sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume x is &lt;math&gt;Ae^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we just take the real part of x and we get our answer because the equation is linear, but exponentials are so much easier to work with than sines and cosines.  The equation of motion becomes

&lt;math&gt;(-m \omega^2 + i \omega c + k) e^{i \omega t} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

So,

&lt;math&gt;(m \omega^2 - i \omega c - k) = 0&lt;/math&gt; or
&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = ic/2m \plusmn \sqrt{(c/m)^2 /4 - k/m}&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining &lt;math&gt; \gamma = c/m&lt;/math&gt;, and remembering &lt;math&gt;\omega_0^2 = k/m&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\omega = i \gamma /2 \plusmn \sqrt{-\gamma ^2 /4 + \omega_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining &lt;math&gt; \omega_\gamma = \sqrt{-\gamma ^2 /4 + \omega_0^2} &lt;/math&gt;, we have the general solution

&lt;math&gt; Ae^{-\gamma/2 + i\omega_\gamma} + Be^{-\gamma/2 - i\omega_\gamma} = e^{-\gamma/2} (A e^{i\omega_\gamma} + B e^{-i\omega_\gamma} ) &lt;/math&gt;.

All we do is take the real part of this with Euler's identity, and we have,

&lt;math&gt; C e^{-\gamma/2} cos( \omega_\gamma t + \phi) &lt;/math&gt;,

where C and &lt;math&gt;phi&lt;/math&gt; are just A and B written a different way.  You can find them if you want, but they won't be very helpful.  Notice that the oscillator oscillates with ever decreasing amplitude, but not at its &quot;natural&quot; frequency, but at a different frequency.

It is conceivable that &lt;math&gt;\omega_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is imaginary, in which case, the entire solution is just a negative exponential!  This is called critical damping, when it just turns into being an exponential instead of oscillitory motion.

==Resonance==

A mass resonates, when the driving frequency of oscillations is equal to the natural frequency of the object. (See Tacoma Narrows Bridge also known as &quot;Galloping Gertie&quot;) This means that work is done to keep drive the oscillations. 

If the driving frequency is less than the natural frequency, the amplitude decreases to a much smaller value.

This is a derrogatory and condecending statement towards English language speakers:
''thanks alot
Note this is not a sarcastic saying in Arabic. &quot;Thanks alot&quot; is often used sarcatically in English. Sarcasm is rare in Arabic, unlike English where it's similar to the plague with some speakers.''

This would be better received if merely translated as ''Thank you very much'' as this is obviously the meaning intended to convey to the reader.

Thank you. I'm Sorry. It was a casual remark, no harm was intended. The change was made. --[[User:TwoThirty|TwoThirty]] 02:41, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

==== How will it be seen if I greet in Arabic? ====
How will different Arab cultures react if a foreign western person greets them in Arabic? Will it be well received or is it sounding strange?
I am particularly interested to know how would a Saudi or a Pakistani feel if I greet them with &quot;al_salaamu `alaykum&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like every natural language Turkish has many loanwords. A good indicator of weather a word is original Turkish or a loanword is to look at the vowels in the word. If the word internally doesn't follow Vowel Harmony, you know it's probably a loan word. Also, if you find two vowels right next together within a word (impossible in standard Turkish) it's a loanword. This is one of the biggest problems Turkish speakers have with English. They can't figure out how to pronounce words that don't follow the rules they've been using their entire lives.

==Arabic==
Turkish has taken many words from Arabic (list nowhere near complete).
* '''hayat''' - حياة - ''life''
* '''bina''' - بناء - ''building''
* '''beyaz''' - أبيض - ''white''
* '''sabah''' - صباح - ''morning''
* '''kalem''' - قلم - ''pen''

* '''pantolon''' - ''pantalon'' - trousers
* '''kravat''' - ''cravate'' - tie (clothing)
* '''lavabo''' - ''lavabo'' - washbasin
* '''tuvalet''' - ''toilette'' - toilet
* '''banliyö''' - &quot;banlieue&quot; - suburban (train)
* '''mizanpaj''' - ''mise-en-page'' - layout

==Persian==
* '''banu''' - ''بانو'' - lady
* '''buse''' - ''بوسِه'' - kiss
* '''çehre''' - ''چِهرِه'' - face
* '''hane''' - ''خانِه'' - house; home
* '''hastahane''' - ''خَستِه‌خانِه'' - hospital
* '''hastegî/ hastegi''' - ''خَستِگی'' - tiredness
* '''hefte''' - ''هَفتِه'' - week
* '''her''' - ''هَر'' - each
* '''sade''' - ''سادِه'' - plain
* '''peleng''' - ''پَلَنگ'' - panther
* '''perestiş''' - ''پَرَستِش'' - praise

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jesushaces. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jesushaces~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

The GAMSAT is a tough exam - a lot is required from the student and preparing for it can be quite a nightmare.

In this text, we hope to draw together various sources already available within wikipedia and adapt them so they can fit in with the needs of the worried student actively trying to remember the difference between methane and ethanol.

== When is the GAMSAT? ==
=== UK ===
The exam in the UK takes place only once a year, usually around September. If you're ill or miss your train or sleep in, you’ll need to wait for the next year, or look into taking it in Ireland. The grade for the GAMSAT tends to be valid for 2 years so that you can sit in advance of the year you want to enter. 

=== Australia ===
The exam is held in March, with registrations closing in mid-February. The GAMSAT is held only once a year and your score will be valid for 2 years.

=== Ireland ===
The exam is held in March, with registrations closing in mid-February. The GAMSAT is held only once a year and your score will be valid for 2 years

== Exam structure ==
The exam is subdivided into three distinct sections:
=== Section I Reasoning in Humanities and Social Sciences ===
This comprises 75 Questions that focus on your ability to understand and interpret meaning from passages of text. You have 100 minutes to complete this section.

=== Section II Written Communication ===
One hour to write two essays based on one or more of the quotes presented. There are five quotes from famous or historical figures based on a theme, such as morality, crime and punishment, etc. The first essay will deal with social or cultural issues, whilst the second essay will deal with more personal issues.

=== Section III Science ===
The important part - this spans Biology, Physics but mostly Chemistry (with an emphasis on Organic chemistry). You get 2 hours 50 minutes to complete 110 questions - that's a little like one a half minutes per question - not easy, so I think the best option is to use the reading time to flick through the exam and see what there is that you can easily do and what you really can't do. Start with the easiest stuff then as your time runs out, head for the harder stuff. As wrong answers are not downgraded, be sure to answer every question (even if you have to guess some) - there's a 25% chance of you getting it right!

== Courses using the GAMSAT ==
=== UK ===
Currently there are five universities (St George's, Nottingham, Swansea, Cardiff, and Liverpool) using the GAMSAT for entry onto the Graduate Course (4 years) and one (Peninsula) using it for the Graduate entry onto the 5 year course (i.e. standard undergraduate course).

==&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6600&quot;&gt;Grammar Notes&lt;/font&gt;==

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Passive of Becoming&lt;/font&gt;===

The passive voice, indicating a state of becoming, is often expressed in English with the verb “get” or with “to be” plus the past participle. In Novial it is expressed with “bli” followed by the verb root:

*'''bli tucha''' (''gets touched'')
*'''bli tua''' (''is killed, gets killed'')

in contrast to:

*'''es tuat''' (''is killed, has been killed'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Impersonal Verbs&lt;/font&gt;===

Impersonal verbs such as those which express the weather, existence etc. are not preceded by any subject. In English the subject used is essentially meaningless and is only a grammatical requirement.

*'''pluva''' (''it is raining'')

*'''sembla ke la varta''' (''it seems that she is waiting'')

In cases such as the following the subject comes after the verb:

*'''esed markes sur li tere ''' (''there were marks on the ground  =  marks were on the ground'')

*'''ha deveni plu evidenti ke...''' (''it has become more evident that ..., that... has become more evident'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Conditional Perfect and Future Perfect&lt;/font&gt;===

The English conditional perfect, “would have done”, is expressed in a similar way in Novial, i.e. “’vud ha fa”’. Remember that the auxiliary verb “ha” is followed by the verb root:

*''' vud ha resta ''' (''would have remained'')
*''' si irge vud ha plugrandisa lu ''' (''if anyone would have increased it, if anyone had increased it'')

In English the future perfect is expressed as “shall have done” or “will have done”. Novial is similar (remember verb root after &quot;ha&quot;):

*'''Morge Charles sal ha ariva in London''' (''Tomorrow Charles will have arrived in London'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Future in the Past&lt;/font&gt;===

In English the future from a point in the past is expressed as “would do” or “was going to do”. Novial uses the past form of the future auxiliary verb, ‘’’sal’’, which is ‘’’saled’’’:

*''' Sir Charles dikted ke lo saled vada a London ''' (''Sir Charles said that he would go to London, was going to go to London'')
*''' Sir Charles saled tre bald vada a London ''' (''Sir Charles was about to go to London'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Suffix -IV(I)&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-iv(i)''' forms adjectives which mean doing naturally, or capable of doing (that can ...):

*'''hororisa – hororisiv''' (''(to) horrify – horrible, terrible'')
*'''ofense – ofensiv''' (''(to) offend – offensive'')
*'''nosa – nosiv''' (''(to) harm – harmful'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Suffix -FOY&lt;/font&gt;===

This adverbial suffix indicates a number of times or occasions something happens:

*'''un – unfoy''' (''one – once'')
*'''altri – altrifoy''' (''other – on another occasion, another time'')
*'''pluri – plurifoy''' (''several – several times'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Suffix -(T)IONE&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-(t)ione''', forms a verbal noun which does not like those in '''-o''' denote simply the action of the verb, but partly the result (as a whole) or the resulting state, partly the way or manner in which something is done. Verbs ending in '''-e''' drop the '''-e''' and add '''-ione'''; others add '''-tione''' to the root verb. Many natural forms are formed this way.

*'''nara – naratione''' (''(to) narrate – narration'')
*'''instrukte – instruktione''' (''(to) instruct – instruction'')
*'''reputa – reputatione''' (''(to) deem – reputation'')

Often the suffixes '''-(t)ione'''  and '''-o''' are equivalent, meaning the process and result:

*'''konstata – konstatatione''' (''(to) state – statement'')
*'''konstata – konstato''' (''(to) state – statement'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Suffix -ARI&lt;/font&gt;===

The suffix '''-ari''' forms adjectives which mean agreeing with or fit for: 

*'''popule – populari''' (''people – popular'')
*'''sisteme – sistemari''' (''system – systematic'')
*'''dokumente – dokumentari''' (''document – documentary'')

===&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9933&quot;&gt;Suffix -ESKA&lt;/font&gt;===

The verbal suffix '''-eska''' added to a verb denotes the beginning of an action or state. Added to an adjective it means begin to be (become):

*'''ama – ameska''' (''(to) love – (to) fall in love'')
*'''klari – klareska''' (''clear – (to) become clear'')
*'''kurse – kurseska''' (''(to) run – (to) start running'')

      <text xml:space="preserve">== To be listed here the programming language book must be at least 50% completed. ==

It is imperative for Wikibooks to concentrate on quality. Book-Quality in that respect is more important then market dominance of any particular programming language. Therefore only well written language books should be mentioned on the main page.

However if a category would become empty because of this rule we should keep the most advanced book as an example.

I have not removed any language yet as I will check current progress first. I will also first check quality of books on the [[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf|Programming languages bookshelf]] as well to see which language might be a candidate for addition.

Help is as allways welcome.

== How do you measure degree of completion? ==

Does this mean that half the chapter headings must have content or that the content of half the chapter headings must be worth having or ....  Sorry if that sounds facetious but measuring degree of completion could get contentious.  The aim is worthy nonetheless, whever you are :-).  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:30, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

: &quot;sympathic&quot; - it's not the aim to make the bookshelves as short as possible. I know a lot of programming languages and understand a fair amound of the trade. The book should have enough content that the basic features of the language are describes in about 50% and hence become usefull to someone trying to learn the language. That sounds like a lot of work but then most books are below 25% anyway - look for example and [[Programming:Action script]] - I would expect the Wikipedia article to have more text. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:16, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

MISTAKES 

--------------------
&quot;and most other empiricist authors in this field&quot; is used right after a list which includes Descartes! I'll delete it.

:Descartes was not an Empiricist but no-one can deny that his descriptions of consciousness are empirical. I have left the deletion because someone else is likely to also misinterpret the sentence. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:01, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

--------------------
The bit on naive realism is just plain wrong and should be corrected ASAP.

:Why? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:01, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

--------------------
I deleted a section at the bottom because it was simply the authors POV. It was philosophically incomprehensible. This whole page desperately needs someone with an actual Ph.D in philosophy to take a look at it, since various people have used it to showcase their own unpublished viewpoints, apparently written without any comprehension of the meaning of relevant terminology and ideas.

:Personal attacks are not allowed in Wikibooks. Please stop this immediately. The correct way to proceed is to describe what is wrong and to discuss it then fix it.

:I would stress that this book is, as mentioned in the introduction, largely about phenomenal consciousness. This section describes how philosophers have described the phenomenon of consciousness in the past - what it is like to be conscious. You may not like it but it is fully referenced. What is contentious is whether phenomenal consciousness is credible, but that discussion does not belong on this page. I have a degree in philosophy and a PhD in Biophysics. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:29, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

----
I added &quot;Experiences presuppose space and time as pure concepts of reason.&quot; to the part on Kant. IMHO this is of essence in understanding &quot;experience&quot; in The Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der Reinen Vernunft). I base this on Kants Prolegomena. [[User:Phenomena|Phenomena]] 15:22, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

--------------------
This section seems to be using the terms &quot;definition&quot; and &quot;description&quot; interchangeably, however, while there is a ''description'' of some aspects of consciousness, I see no clear ''definition'' of &quot;consciousness.&quot;  Now, there is an attempt to define it, but:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Consciousness is a multidimensional manifold with vectors pointing towards the centre (the apparent observation point).''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
does not strike me as a clear or useful definition, and instead comes off as a less than useful jumble of jargon (no offense intended) that uses other undefined objects (&quot;multidimensional manifold,&quot; &quot;vectors,&quot; and an &quot;apparent observation point&quot;) as part of the definition.   Someone should probably either change all instances of &quot;definition&quot; to &quot;description&quot; or add a clear and concise definition of &quot;consciousness.&quot;  Since the section starts off saying, &quot;Before embarking on the analysis of consciousness it is important to have a definition of what it is that we are attempting to explain,&quot; I would prefer seeing the latter though I realize it might be a bit of a tall order since it is so hard to define.  -- HiEv [[User:76.99.67.77|76.99.67.77]] 09:31, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Green's description was definitely intended for mathematicians and physicists.  I have added the following translation: &quot;A non-mathematical description of consciousness is: a collection of events arranged in time and space that form directed elements that all point at the same place and instant.&quot;  The reason I chose Green's description was that it did not belong to any current &quot;fad&quot;, is well supported by references to the literature and strikes a chord of recognition for a physical scientist.  It is is probably a more general description than &quot;intentionality&quot; or &quot;reflexivity&quot; and is able to contain these ideas as well as ideas about the specious present etc. It is also one of the few extended attempts at extracting a description of consciousness from established sources rather than making up a new description.  On the down side, it verges on the banal: &quot;consciousness is this stuff everywhere and when!&quot; [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:14, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

::I enjoy philosopher John Searle's common sense definition. It is partly a negative definition (i.e. listing what it is not) and since it is derived from common sense, it is merely a description. I quote:

:::&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:serif&quot;&gt;Now people always tell me it was very hard to define consciousness, but I think if you're just looking for the kind of commonsense definition that you get at the beginning of the investigation, and not at the hard-nosed scientific definition that comes at the end, it's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness. Consciousness consists of those states of feeling or sentience or awareness; they're the kind of things that start in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep; they go on all day until you get knocked on the head and become unconscious, or you fall asleep again, or you die, or otherwise your consciousness is shut down. And on this account, I hope it's obvious, dreams are a form of consciousness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section requires the candidate to write 2 essays in 60 minutes. Each essay is based on 5 quotes around a theme and marking priority is then given to thought and content of writing, over organisation and expression.

==The Prompts==
For each essay you will be given 5 quotes from famous or historical figures.  These topics are designed to be broad and some topics that will not be covered include: your reasons for wanting to be a doctor, specialized knowledge, religion and politics.

Writing task A generally covers social or cultural issues and lends itself more to a persuasive/argumentative style.

Writing task B generally covers more personal issues and allows the candidate to use a more emotive style if they want.

==Assessment and Scoring highly==
Essays are assessed by ticking boxes for: 
*Thought and content
*Organisation and expression


Some tips for scoring highly include:

*Appear to have thought deeply by:
**Considering both sides of an argument
**Discuss several contrasting points
**Then come to a considered conclusion

*Use a clear structured format to achieve marks for organisation


==Personal Perspectives==
The essay writing part is based upon two series of quotations on a loose topic (say honesty) and you are required to write two essays around those quotes. You have 30 minutes for each one, but it is better to think of this section as being two essays in 60 minutes when preparing for test day.  

The time allowed is intentionally very tight in terms of producing two coherent essays, so you should have practiced a general structure to apply to whatever topics appear [i.e., get used to breaking ideas down into Outline, Development, Conclusion - or whatever way you prefer to do it, but it needs to be second nature so you aren't figuring it out as you go and using up the very valuable, and very limited, time on test day]. One way to practice is to make use of listserves and forums that discuss general social, political or philosophical topics online - these give you repeated opportunities to rapidly form reactions to a wide variety of concepts. 


----


Another thing you shouldn't overlook, is having a variety of sources to back up your argumentation. Reading through a book of quotes will probably help build up your quote knowledge and they always come in handy.


For example, the topic that I got was on Pain (GAMSAT 2006) - one of the quotes was about how pain made us more able to appreciate joy. Immediately, I remembered what [[wikipedia:C.S._Lewis|C.S. Lewis]] said on the topic - well actually, I remembered what Anthony Hopkins said in Shadowlands - that pain was God's sculpting tool to make us more perfect human beings. But did I agree with this point of view? I created a counterargument based on masochism - if pain was so profitable to our joy why not seek it out? I also thought about how people often become emotionally crippled by pain, years or even decades after the even occurred. Was it somewhat belittling their suffering to say they are in fact cumulating a greater ability for joy? After some furious jotting, I had a loose plan and proceeded to write it up. 


----


Above all other advice, remember that the essay section is not an examination of your politics or opinions - the people marking it are looking at your use of language and ability to make coherent arguments. So long as what you say makes sense, and appears to display your degree-level education, you will get credit for it.


Below are some general essay writing tips which should hopefully help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">C. S. Lewis was one of the greatest Christian Writers of our age. His &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; still stirs considerable controversy. He wrote from the perspective of a devil giving advice to another devil in how to tempt a Christian. In doing so, he reveals to us how we let evil into our own lives. Lewis's work has influenced three generations of Christian thinkers and will continue to be a seminal Christian work.

'''''Synopsis of the Screwtape Letters''''':
&quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is fiction. But only fiction in the sense that the characters and the dialogue sprang from the imagination of one of the greatest modern Christian writers. Yet in our terrestrial reality the issues confronted in this book play out in our lives every day. 

The book contains thirty-one letters from Screwtape to his nephew, Wormwood, who is screwtape's underling in fiendishness. Screwtape is an upper-level functionary in the complex bureaucracy of the underworld. The &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; are friendly advice from this elder statesman to a front-line tempter on how to procure the soul of his &quot;patient&quot;, a young Christian man just trying to live out his everyday life. 

We get the letters only from one side of the correspondence (Screwtape's), yet the story of the meanderings of the Christian &quot;patient's&quot; soul is clearly read between the lines. The letters begin with Wormwood's failure to keep his subject from becoming a Christian. The urbane Screwtape informs him that, although this is an alarming development, his patient is by no means lost to the dark forces of evil. 

World War II serves as the backdrop for the Letters. Yet war and strife do not play a significant roll in the work. The book is about more everyday and universal problems. Problems every individual must deal with even today. 

Thus, each letter addresses various aspects of the travails of the human soul and how the devil tempts that soul away from goodness and toward evil - not evil on a grand scale, but evil on a petty scale. They show how evil can seep into a Christian's relationships with friends and family, in his views on the church, even in his practice of prayer. 

As each letter unfolds, we find the Christian &quot;patient&quot; slipping more and more out of the hands of Wormwood and his temptations. Screwtape's advice to the tempter becomes more firm and yet more subtle. And, by degrees, we come to see the workings of evil in our own hearts. &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is a book that entertains while it instructs. It is a book to be treasured and studied.

'''Analysis of the Screwtape Letters''':
The correspondence of devils would not be an easy composition for most writers. Yet C. S. Lewis was a master at revealing subtleties of the diabolical mind. We find Screwtape to be urbane, intelligent, witty and even charming. These qualities are tools. Like a hammer or a screwdriver, in the right hands they can build a cathedral. In the wrong hands they could destroy a high-speed turbine in motion. 

Through the &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; we come to realize that evil seldom pops up as the genocidal maniac slaughtering millions (though it does on occasion show up in the guise of a Stalin or a Hitler). For individuals, it generally takes the form of little urgings that come from within, telling us to respond brusquely to a family member or to frown on that poor soul in the neighboring pew with the funny hat. 

It is evil in our everyday lives that Screwtape addresses, petty evils that add up in the end to the destruction of our morality, the demise of our individuality and the utter destruction of our souls. 

The book is sprinkled with advice from Screwtape to his nephew, Wormwood, telling him what he must do to gain the soul of a Christian for the underworld. This mostly involves &quot;muddying the waters&quot;. That is: not allowing the &quot;patient&quot; to clearly see the truth. Thus we are shown how evil is overcome by simple, clear actions and thought. 

In the end we find that the battle between good and evil is fought out on the field of our relationships with others and most of all our relationship with God. 

Each Letter has something important to say, and should be read and reviewed in detail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The physics content of the GAMSAT seems to vary greatly - the 20% theory seemed from my experience to be a rather inflated estimate. Still common themes tend to emerge over the years - favourite areas seem to be relatively simple electrics (although I was confronted with a hideously difficult question looking at how to reduce voltage - so going beyond the simple basics may be a good idea!), gravity related areas, optics...


==Physics Core Topics==
The GAMSAT is designed to test year 12 physics topics.


===Favourite Topics===
These topics tend to recur.

*'''Vectors &amp; Kinematics'''
**vectors and scalars, displacement, velocity, acceleration, linear motion, projectile motion.
*'''Electric Fields'''
**potential, field strength, Capacitance, combining capacitors, energy stored in a capacitor.
*'''Lenses'''
**convex, focal length, concave, magnification.


===Additional Core Topics===
*'''Mechanics'''
**moments, Newton's law of motion, friction and equilibrium
*'''Work, Energy &amp; Momentum'''
**power, work, mechanical energy, kinetic and potential energy, conservation of momentum, internal energy, Ideal gases
*'''Elastic properties of solids'''
**Hooke's law, elasticity, stress, Young's modulus, strain
*'''Current electricity'''
**resistors in parallel and series, resistance, Ohm's law, current and drift velocity, emf and voltage
*'''Magnetic Fields'''
**field strength, force on a moving charge, fields due to currents
*'''Waves'''
**oscillations, resonance, wave measurements, supersition and interference, simple harmonic motion.
**Refractive index
**The photoelectric effect, work constant of metals
*'''Radioactive decay'''
**rate of decay and half life, emissions, stable and unstable nuclei
*'''Sound'''
**decibels, intensity, sound level


===Other Topics===
The above list has deliberately excluded some key year 12 topics, that are not commonly covered in the GAMSAT.
These include:
*quantum duality
*particle accelerators
*astrophysics


==Personal Perspective==
Some topics that came up in a single GAMSAT include:

* Forces at rest
* Force and Motion

==Introduction==
====The Five Factors that Contribute to Stuttering====

&lt;p&gt;At least five factors contribute to stuttering. No single stuttering therapy is a &amp;quot;miracle cure&amp;quot;&amp;#151;or even more than moderately effective. Treating stuttering requires a &lt;i&gt;multifactoral&lt;/i&gt; approach&amp;#151;different treatments for the five factors. The five factors are:&lt;/p&gt;

=====Auditory Processing Underactivity=====

&lt;p&gt;Brain scans have found that the auditory processing area is underactive during stuttering. It appears that stutterers can't integrate what we hear ourselves saying with how we feel our muscles moving. [[Electronic altered auditory feedback]] devices appear to correct this neurological abnormality. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Auditory Processing and Anti-Stuttering Devices]].&lt;/p&gt;

=====Speech Motor Control Overactivity=====

&lt;p&gt;Brain scans have also found that the speech motor (muscle) control area is overactive. Stutterers overtense their respiration (breathing), vocal folds, and lips, jaws, and tongues (articulation muscles). These overtensed muscles lock up or fail to coordinate, making speech impossible. [[Fluency shaping therapy]] trains stutterers to speak with relaxed speech production muscles. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Speech Motor Learning and Control]].&lt;/p&gt;

=====Dopamine=====

&lt;p&gt;A third neurological abnormality associated with stuttering involves too-high levels of the neurotransmitter &lt;i&gt;dopamine&lt;/i&gt; in the left caudate nucleus speech motor control area. This appears to contribute to speech muscle overactivity. [[Dopamine antagonist medications]] treat this abnormality. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Genes, Dopamine, and Anti-Stuttering Medications]].&lt;/p&gt;

=====Response Selection to Stress=====

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is a response to stress, but a response that sets up a vicious cycle. [[Personal construct therapy]] and other therapies train stutterers to handle stress in ways that result in fluent speech. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Response Selection Under Stress]].&lt;/p&gt;

=====Psychological Effects=====

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering causes psychological fears and anxieties. For some individuals, these fears and anxieties are more disabling than their physical stuttering. Some individuals use stuttering as an excuse for deeper problems, such as inability to maintain relationships. Some individuals obsessively try to hide their stuttering, e.g., counterproductively refusing to go to speech therapy for fear that someone may see them entering the speech clinic. These individuals may need treatment with a psychologist in addition to speech therapy. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Psychological Issues]].&lt;/p&gt;

=====Treating the Five Factors=====

&lt;p&gt;Most stutterers have one or two factors strongly. The other factors may be less significant. You might find a speech clinic that treats you successfully, especially if the speech clinic combines two or more therapies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a speech-language pathologist can treat at most three of the five factors. Electronic devices can treat one or two factors. Medications treat one factor. You'll likely have to go to several speech clinics, and possibly buy an electronic device or get a medication prescription, to treat all of the factors that contribute to your stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;
		
=====Additional Factors=====

&lt;p&gt;A sixth, seventh, eighth, and additional stuttering factors will likely be discovered. Likely other genes contribute to stuttering. The neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] might play a role.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Some advances in stuttering will be in the form of co-existing conditions. In other words, in the future children (and adults) will be tested for a variety of disorders, and treatment designed accord-ingly. E.g., a child with stuttering and phonological dysfunction will be treated differently than a child with stuttering and ADHD. An adult with stuttering and social phobia will be treated differently from an outgoing mentally retarded adult who stutters.&lt;/p&gt;

====Stuttering Therapy Long-Term (In)Effectiveness====

=====Satisfaction with &amp;quot;Smooth Speech&amp;quot; Fluency Shaping=====

&lt;p&gt;In a study of a &amp;quot;smooth speech&amp;quot; fluency shaping stuttering therapy program, about 95% of stutterers were &amp;quot;very satisfied&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;satisfied&amp;quot; with their speech at the end of the treatment. A year later, their satisfaction dropped to 43%. (Craig, A., Calver, P. &amp;quot;Following Up on Treated Stutterers: Studies of Perceptions of Fluency and Job Status.&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Speech and Hearing Research&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;34&lt;/i&gt;, 279-284, April 1991.)&lt;/p&gt;

=====ISTAR Comprehensive Stuttering Program=====

&lt;p&gt;A rigorous study followed 42 stutterers through the three-week program at the Institute for Stuttering Therapy and Treatment (ISTAR) [http://www.ualberta.ca/~istar/] in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fluency shaping program was based on slow, prolonged speech, starting with 1.5 seconds per syllable stretch, and ending with slow-normal speech. The program also works on reducing fears and avoidances, discussing stuttering openly, and changing social habits to increase speaking. The program includes a maintenance program for practicing at home. The therapy program reduced stuttering from about 15-20% stuttered syllables to 1-2% stuttered syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 to 24 months after therapy, about 70% of the stutterers had satisfactory fluency. About 5% were marginally successful. About 25% had unsatisfactory fluency. (Boberg, E., &amp;amp; Kully, D. &amp;quot;Long-term results of an intensive treatment program for adults and adolescents who stutter.&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Speech and Hearing Research&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;37&lt;/i&gt;, 1994 1050-1059.)&lt;/p&gt;

=====Attrition in a Long-Term Study=====

&lt;p&gt;A study of a &amp;quot;prolonged speech&amp;quot; stuttering therapy program had 32 stutterers initially speak about five times slower than normal speech, then gradually increase their speaking rate. Six subjects (19%) failed to learn the &amp;quot;prolonged speech&amp;quot; technique during the two-week residential therapy program. Eight subjects (25%) completed the residential training but refused to participate in a six-week, weekly therapy &amp;quot;phase II&amp;quot; program. Six subjects (19%) completed the six-week &amp;quot;phase II&amp;quot; program but refused to participate in the year-long &amp;quot;maintenance&amp;quot; program with infrequent therapy at the speech clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year later, the twelve subjects (38%) who stayed in the program were able to speak nearly fluently. Was this therapy program a success? 100% of the stutterers who completed the program were successful. But two-thirds of the stutterers didn't complete the program. (Onslow, M., et al., &amp;quot;Speech Outcomes of a Prolonged-Speech Treatment for Stuttering,&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Speech and Hearing Research&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;39&lt;/i&gt;, 734-749, 1996.)&lt;/TD&gt;
	
=====SLPs vs. Parents vs. Computers=====

&lt;p&gt;A study of 98 children, 9 to 14 years old, compared three types of stuttering therapy. The three types of therapy were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Intensive &amp;quot;smooth speech.&amp;quot; This trained relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing; a slow speaking rate with prolonged vowels; gentle onsets and offsets (loudness contour); soft articulation contacts; and pauses between phrases. The children did this therapy in a speech clinic for 35 hours over one week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Home-based &amp;quot;smooth speech.&amp;quot; This was similar to the first group, but parents were included, and encouraged to continue therapy at home. Therapy was done in a speech clinic for six hours once a week for four weeks (24 hours total).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Electromyographic biofeedback. The children used an EMG biofeedback computer system about six hours a day for one week (30 hours total). The EMG system monitored the child's speech-production muscle activity. The children were instructed to tense and then relax their speech-production muscles. The goal was to develop awareness and control of these muscles. The children then worked through a hierarchy from simple words to conversations, while keeping their speech-production muscles relaxed. After mastering this while watching the computer display, the children did the exercises with the computer monitoring but not displaying their muscle activity. The speech pathologists did relatively little with the children: &amp;quot;Constant clinician presence was not necessary as the computer provided feedback as to whether the child was performing the skills correctly.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth (control) group didn't receive any stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each therapy program, all three therapies reduced stuttering below 1% on average. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year after the therapy program, the percentage of children with disfluency rates under 2% were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;48% of the children from the clinician-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;63% of the children from the parent-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;71% of the children from the computer-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The control group had no improvement in fluency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results for children with disfluency rates under 1% were even more striking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10% of the children from the clinician-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;37% of the children from the &amp;quot;parent-based&amp;quot; program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;44% of the children from the computer-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;I.e., the computers were most effective, the parents next most effective, and the speech-language pathologists were least effective in the long term. At the 1% disfluency level, the computers and the parents were about &lt;i&gt;four times&lt;/i&gt; more effective than the speech-language pathologists. (Craig, A., et al. &amp;quot;A Controlled Clinical Trial for Stuttering in Persons Aged 9 to 14 Years&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 39:4,&lt;/i&gt; 808-826, August 1996.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, all three groups had average stuttering reductions between 76% and 79%. This may have been due to the more dysfluent children receiving additional speech therapy. (Hancock, et al. &amp;quot;Two- to Six-Year Controlled-Trial Stuttering Outcomes for Children and Adolescents,&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Speech and Hearing Research&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;41&lt;/i&gt;:1242-1252, December 1998.)&lt;/p&gt;

=====Computer System for Reducing Short Phonation Intervals=====

&lt;p&gt;Another study had five stutterers use a computer that trains reduction of short phonation intervals. Normal speakers switch their vocal folds on and off many times each second, as they pronounce vowels and voiced consonants, such as /b/ and /g/, and then unvoiced consonants such as /s/ and /t/. A core stuttering behavior is an inability to quickly switch from voiceless to voiced sounds, i.e., to instantly switch on your vocal folds. The computer program trained stutterers to slow down that part of speech without slowing down other parts of speech (and so maintain natural-sounding speech). One year post-therapy all five subjects were able to speak nearly fluently. Larger clinical trials are scheduled for 2006. (Ingham, et al., (2001), &amp;quot;Evaluation of a Stuttering Treatment Based on Reduction of Short Phonation Intervals,&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;44&lt;/i&gt;, 1229-1244.)&lt;/p&gt;

=====Two Long-Term Studies of Anti-Stuttering Devices=====

&lt;p&gt;A university provided delayed auditory feedback (DAF) anti-stuttering devices to nine adult stutterers. The stutterers used the devices thirty minutes per day. Three months later the subjects' speech had improved more than 50%, when they weren't using the devices (see [[Long-Term Effects of DAF]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another study had eight stutterers use a hearing aid-style DAF/FAF anti-stuttering device five to eight hours per day for four months. The device improved the subjects' speech while they were wearing it, but no speech improvement was found when they weren't wearing the devices (see [[Long-Term Effects of DAF/FAF]]).&lt;/p&gt;

=====Stuttering Modification Therapy=====

&lt;p&gt;The above studies examined &lt;i&gt;fluency shaping therapy&lt;/i&gt; programs. Fluency shaping focuses on physical speech production. Psychological treatment is a secondary part of therapy. The goal is to speak fluently and not stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, &lt;i&gt;stuttering modification therapy&lt;/i&gt; (sometimes called Van Riper therapy) focuses on psychological change. Reducing the physical manifestations of stuttering is secondary. The assumption is that stutterers will never be able to talk fluently, so don't let stuttering stop you from talking or doing what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one study has examined stuttering modification therapy. Nineteen adult stutterers participated in the 3.5-week Successful Stuttering Management Program (SSMP, developed by Dorvan Breitenfeldt) program [http://www.ssmpmanual.com/]. Immediately post-treatment their speech had improved 10%. Six months later this modest gain had all but disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several measures of anxiety found a 10-15% psychological improvement. The researchers cautioned that six months isn't a long follow-up, and that this psychological improvement might not last, given the absence of improved speech. The researchers concluded, &amp;quot;&amp;#133;the SSMP appears to be ineffective in producing durable improvements in stuttering behaviors.&amp;quot; (Blomgren, M., Roy, N., Callister, T., Merrill, R. &amp;quot;Intensive Stuttering Modification Therapy: A Multidimensional Assessment of Treatment Outcomes,&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Speech and Hearing Research&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;48&lt;/i&gt;:509-523, June 2005.)&lt;/p&gt;

=====Evidence-Based Practice=====

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;No Child Left Behind&amp;quot; Act, Medicaid, and insurance companies now require healthcare practitioners to provide evidence for clinical decisions. This evidence is expected to be in the form of scientific research showing that a therapy is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) [http://www.asha.org/] is now promoting such evidence-based practice to speech-language pathologists. One of their goals is to develop clinical practice guidelines for each field, including stuttering. Some speech-language pathologists object to evidence-based practice. One speech-language pathologist questioned, &amp;quot;Does that mean that just because I haven't read any fluency articles [in scientific journals] that I don't know what I'm doing or I don't know what's good for my patients?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But evidence-based practice doesn't mean that clinical decisions can be made only according to scientific research. ASHA's guide-lines also list two other factors: clinical expertise, and the goals and values of the client. &amp;quot;Clinical expertise&amp;quot; means that perhaps the speech-language pathologist in the last paragraph makes good judgments, despite never having read scientific research. (Banotai, Alyssa. &amp;quot;Emphasis on Evidence,&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;ADVANCE for Speech-Language Pathologists &amp; Audiologists&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;15&lt;/i&gt;:46, November 14, 2005, page 7.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;goals and values&amp;quot; are important in treating stuttering. For example, a speech therapy program that is ineffective in producing fluency may be a good program for individuals whose goal isn't perfect speech, or who value the diversity of different people talking in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective program (judging from these studies) appears to be ISTAR. Yet it was successful for only 70-75% of the stutterers. 25-30% of the stutterers weren't helped.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rules given for single-square encyprtion are incorrect.  When encrypting a digraph of two letters not in the same row or column, the first letter of the cyphertext is the &quot;opposite corner&quot; that is in the same row as the first letter of the plaintext.  Thus, AT is encrypted as ZE, not EZ as stated in the article.  The Wikipedia article on Playfair (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher) gets it correct.

One could certainly argue that the system described here is (marginally) more secure than the one that Sir Charles Wheatstone devised, but all the same it is not Playfair.</text>

::If you want to use my information and add it to your project, then message me. I don't see a good reason for two college help books to exist--unless yours is going to be completely different. However, my book is primarily focused around the US post-secondary education. I wish I could do worldwise, but I'm a U.S. student. Then again, my book is biased by a U.S. outlook.
::I do admire your ability to create such a text. Because I am an undergraduate still (but with experience), I figure your writing skills could compensate where mine could not; however, I've been improving my English usage. Message me if you are interested.--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 12:48, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

== Scope of this book ==

What is the definition of [[wikt:college|college]] for this book?

The outline above seems like it might work for &quot;colleges&quot; in the United States. These are schools providing undergraduate education (typically two-year community colleges, or four-year universities which also have graduate schools). These schools take graduates from the &quot;K-12&quot; system, which is the primary-secondary education system that ends with high school. However, the word &quot;college&quot; can also have other meanings, including secondary schools and groups of electors.

However, I do not know if this book was intended for &quot;colleges&quot; in some other country. The authors of this book need to set the scope; what do they say when they say &quot;college&quot;? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:46, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

:I think it's pretty clear that this book works for colleges in the United States, as opposed to &quot;electoral colleges&quot; or secondary schools. I shall add a paragraph about the scope of the book at the beginning, to make it clear. Perhaps I should change the title? -- [[User:MLandry|MLandry]] 20:56, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

It is a joke! &quot;How to Succeed in an Electoral College&quot; might be an interesting, but unnecessary read. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:38, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

:Oh. Um, OK. [[User:MLandry|MLandry]] 16:03, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

I am pursuing my second bachelor's degree in mathematics, right now at a community college, but I will eventually transfer to the [[w:University_of_North_Texas|UNT]]. My first bachelor's degree was in English at [[w:TCU|TCU]]. As far as I see it, math is just another language, so it is not as big of a jump as some people say it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sub-Title: How to build inner-peace, lasting personal relationship and progressive nation.

The Arabic word: الإسلام‎ (al-’islām) means &quot;to accept, assent, surrender or submit&quot; to what is essentially a scriptural discipline. Most people believe that Islam is a religion. Even some of the followers of Islam believe it is indeed a religion and just started by Prophet Muhammad around 1, 5 millennium ago.

In classical Arabic, Islam is not a proper noun, but a reference to acceptance or assent. Therefore, this book uses the term &quot;The Assent&quot; to refer to Islam as a monotheistic way of Life, common to all major religions. This book then uses the term &quot;Islam&quot; to refer it as the religion of follower of Prophet Muhammad. Similarly, The Assenter refers to trhe followers of the way of life, while Moslems refers to the followers of the religion. The title of this book uses the word Islam instead of Islamic to further emphasize its descriptive use rather than a proper noun.

This book discusses Islam as a way of life behind the religion. This way of life was broadly followed by people all around the world many millennia before the reformation initiated by 'the recitation'. This is generally known by its Arabic name: القرآن‎ al-qur’ān,” (also sometimes transliterated as  Qur’ān, Koran, Alcoran or Al-Qur’ān) This scriptural text  is still today studied and revered as the authentic Word of God by many people around the world. 

Most Moslems today regard their religion as the complete and universal version of a monotheistic faith revealed to many times and places before, including, notably, to the prophets Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Islamic tradition holds that previous messages and revelations have been changed and distorted over time, so that the path of Islam was and still is eternal, and the Holy Prophet merely corrected an aberration. For this reason, the Moslems when mentioning the name of the prophet Muhammad usually add &quot;Peace be upon him&quot; as a reminder of his central theme.   

==Chapters==
The complete title of this book is, &quot;Islam Way of Life, How to build Inner-Piece, Lasting Personal Relationship and Progressive Nation&quot;.

*In '''[[/Straight Path/]]''', we will learn that the inner-peace, having no fear nor regret, is something natural and common among Abrahamic Religions. 
*In '''[[/Spirituality/]]''', we will learn on how the followers of Prophet Muhammad grow spiritual relationship with the Creator and Maintainer of the universe.
*In '''[[/Limits/]]''', we will learn that God's Legal Limits are both flexible and aimed to protect common interests, such as Human Rights. 
*In '''[[/Guidance/]]''', we will learn that God's Book is not only a guidance for humankind, but also a critical test. So, use it wisely.
*In '''[[/Success/]]''', we will learn on how to have a fulfilling life and move the society forward.
* '''[[/Practising Islam/]]''' step-by-step implemention of the religion, such as the Believe System, Religious Rituals and guide of raising an Islamic family. 
* '''[[/Legislation/]]''' implementation of Islam in Public Policies, comparing legislations among Islamic and Secular countries around the world.

The Assent as a message has many ideals but also has challenges. The first three chapters of this book talk about those underlying and common ideals in practical way. The two chapters after those will talk about the challenges. Those five chapters hopefully bring new understanding both to those who already practice the discipline in one way or another, but also reduce the fear of people who reject the idea of an Islam way of life as something strange and unapproachable. The last chapter is about how to contribute to the development of the society and its challenges.

==Appendixes==
There are two appendixes for this book.
*'''[[/Glossary/]]''' list the keywords used in this book and the reasons why.
*'''[[/Bibliography/]]''' contains the sources used to compile this book.

==Other books==
This book is positioned as a quick introduction as well as a quick reference to Islam as a Personal Way of Life, Personal Religion and Source of Public Policies. Therefore, any discussion about history or ritual details are outside the scope of this book. There are other books that covers materials that are out of scope for this introductory book:
* '''[[Islam In The World]]''' about Muslims' current affairs in the world.
* '''[[Koranic Law of Nature]]''' explains the relationships between God and the Nature, religion and science.
* '''[[Koranic Prayers]]''' collections of prayers taken from the Koran.
* '''[[God and Religious Toleration/Islam]]''' about a world of love and peace.

== Outline ==

Hi.  You have created a page called [[Outline]]. I think this page need to be moved as it is not clear which book it is a part of.  See the Naming conventions page.  [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:24, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:Hello, Mpspence. I moved the above comment from your user page. Because your outline is now at [[Acoustics: Filter Design Outline]], I moved [[Outline]] to [[Acoustics: Filter Design Outline (old version)]]. This left a redirect from &quot;Outline&quot; to &quot;Acoustics: Filter Design Outline (old version)&quot;. I marked the redirect at &quot;Outline&quot; for deletion.

:That should have fixed the problem that &quot;Outline&quot; violated [[WB:NP]], with no action necessary from you. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

The design of acoustic filters will be reviewed along with 1-D wave propagation in pipes. For 1-D wave propagation, information required to understand filter design will only be covered. Also, along with covering filter design for ideal long wavelength filters (using lumped element method); a number of practical filters which could be implemented will be covered. Real life examples will be shown to relate theory to practice. Other topics briefly touched upon could include impedance relations, power transmission, resonance, attenuation, or lumped elements.

Thanks, but no thanks. 
First, I did concern about the quality of WikiBooks, so I have interwikis and delete a much a article that does not live up to WikiBooks standard.
Second, I found this &quot;Morality of Islam&quot; study is worth to be in WikiBooks along with &quot;History of Islam&quot;. 
Islamic Studies has 4 parts: 
* Islam as History/Civilization
* Islam as Religion with Beliefs and Rituals
* Islam as Way of Life/Thinking (Moral and Attitude)
* Islam as Law Sources
Therefore, if you or any of Admin deletes one parts of Islamic Studies and keep the others, it will *come back* on another name no matter how hard you tried.
Third, I can only promise you one thing. Deleted article might come back with new content and title within the same domain, such as &quot;Study of Morality in Islam&quot; or &quot;Islamic Morality&quot; or &quot;Islam Moral Guide&quot;, but I will try my best effort to provide totally new content that more inline with Wikibooks policies.

Well, I have just &quot;Move&quot; the article to a new name based on [[Wikibooks:Naming Policy]]. If you wish you can tag it for possible Copyright violation.

&lt;center&gt;''What do you do with a B.A. in English,''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''What is my life going to be?''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''Four years of college and plenty of knowledge,''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''Have earned me this useless degree.''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;--'''Princeton (from [[w:Avenue Q|Avenue Q]])'''&lt;/center&gt;


Referring to the quote above: The author's best guess is that Princeton, a central character from the Broadway play ''Avenue Q'', never considered why he was going to college in the first place. An English degree can be incredibly useful if you want to become a writer or an English teacher; however, Princeton appears to be neither. This quote, however, could have been about nursing or engineering if you will never have anything to do with those subjects after you graduate. Many students are falling into the predicament of graduating with a degree they do not use afterwards. 

While it is true that merely having any degree will open doors to some graduate programs and jobs, the realization that obtaining a certain degree will not open the doors you want can be frustrating. Some fields require you to have a Bachelor's degree in that field in order to obtain a certain job or graduate degree. Getting another Bachelor's degree may be challenging when the student loans of the first degree are not paid yet.

To possibly avoid these problems, it may be worthwhile to consider the following analogy: At NASA, there's a division called Spacecraft GNC, which stands for Guidance, Navigation, and Control. Or, as NASA insiders put it: &quot;Where am I?&quot; &quot;Where do I want to go?&quot; and &quot;How will I get there?&quot; These are actually quite practical questions that can be applied to going to college, as well as where spacecraft will go. Like NASA scientists need to know where their spacecraft are at all times, you need specific reasons for all three of these questions; or you may end up in a lot of student loan debt with little to show for it if you manage to graduate from college without a goal in mind.


=== Navigation: &quot;Where am I?&quot; ===

The reason for this question is to assess your environment, what you're doing right now, and what your needs and desires are. Answers to this question need to be specific. An example of a specific answer to this question is:

* '''I'm 24, living in my parents' house, and interested in learning more about the sciences in a classroom environment.''' ''(This is specific and provides a good reason to attend a school. Note that it does not necessarily pick a specific major, but it does give direction and motivates you to do something about the situation of living with your parents.)''

An example of a nonspecific answer would be:

* '''I'm drifting with no drive.''' ''(Ideally you would go to college with a purpose or a mission to remind yourself about why you are going there. Perhaps you could work for a few years and explore a few new areas through research before committing to the expensive endeavour that is college.)''

=== Guidance: &quot;Where do I want to go?&quot; ===

This question asks whether you actually want to go to college and what goal you have in mind for your future. A specific answer for this question is:

* '''I want to help women and minorities get more involved with the sciences by teaching them in secondary school.''' ''(This suggests a more educational outlook on a potential major, than, say, the goal of becoming a scientist would.)''

A nonspecific answer for this question is:

* '''I need a place to go and something to do since my parents are kicking me out of the house.''' (''This is another good reason to get a job and give yourself time to figure out what you want to do, instead of wasting time and money on a degree you may not feel like getting right now.)''

=== Control: &quot;How will I get there?&quot; ===

This question establishes a major and other things you will accomplish while you are at college.

==1. What's the difference between exoskeletons and endoskeletons?  Which type of skeleton do humans have?==
An exoskeleton is a hard shell on the outside of a creature (such as an insect
or a lobster).  An endoskeleton is the system of bones on the inside of a
creature (such as a human, dog, cat, or a bird).

==2. List three functions of the skeletal system. ==
# The skeletal system provides support to a body.  Without a skeleton, a Pathfinder would be a shapeless blob.  
# The marrow inside bones produces blood cells. 
# The skeletal system protects the internal organs from physical harm.
# Bones serve as a place where the body can store minerals for later use.
# Bones also serve as levers against which the muscles pull to accomplish motion.

==3. Is bone a living tissue?  Explain why or why not.==
Bone is living tissue.  Were it not so, it could not produce blood cells, nor
could bones heal after being broken.  Bones cells continually regenerate
themselves.

==4. Describe the structure and development of bone.==
[[Image:Illu_compact_spongy_bone.jpg|450px|right]]
Bone is a relatively hard and lightweight composite material, formed mostly of calcium phosphate. It has relatively high compressive strength but poor tensile strength. While bone is essentially brittle, it is somewhat elastic due to its organic components (chiefly collagen). Bone has an internal mesh-like structure, the density of which may vary at different points.

[[Image:Illu_long_bone.jpg|right]]

Bone can also be either woven or lamellar. Woven bone is put down rapidly during growth or repair. It is so called because its fibres are aligned at random, and as a result has low strength. In contrast lamellar bone has parallel fibres and is much stronger. Woven bone is often replaced by lamellar bone as growth continues.

Bone growth begins with points in the cartilage. Most bones appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin primary [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification ossification] after birth. Secondary [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification ossification] occurs after birth, and forms the ends of the long bones (the epiphyses) and the outer parts of irregular and flat bones. The main shaft (diaphyses) and the ends of long bones remain separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the metaphysis) until the child reaches skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), which is when the cartilage [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification ossifies], fusing the two together.

Marrow can be found in many of the larger bones. In newborns, all such bones are filled exclusively with red marrow, but as the child ages it is mostly replaced by yellow marrow (or fatty marrow). In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the flat bones of the skull, the ribs, the vertebrae and pelvic bones.

==5. Identify the following bones of the skeletal system: Carpals, clavicle (collar bone), coccyx (tail bone), cranium, femur, fibula, humerus, mandible, maxillary bones, metacarpals, metatarsals, patella, pelvis, phalanges, radius, ribs, scapula (shoulder blade), sternum (breast bone), tarsals, tibia, ulna, and vertebrae.==

'''Carpals''' are bones found in the hand. They are also called wrist bones as they are in the wrist. There are eight carpals in each hand. 

'''The Clavicle or Collarbone''' is a long bone that serves as a strut between the scapula and the sternum. It is the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally. It makes up part of the shoulder and the pectoral girdle, and is palpable in all people; in people who have less fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible, as it creates a bulge in the skin. It receives its name from the Latin: clavicula (&quot;little key&quot;) because the bone rotates along its axis like a key when the shoulder is abducted.

'''The skull or cranium bone''' is a bony structure in the head of most vertebrates (in particular, craniates) that supports the structures of the face and forms a protective cavity for the brain. The skull is composed of two parts: the cranium and the mandible. The skull forms the anterior most portion of the skeleton and is a product of encephalization, housing the brain, many sensory structures (eyes, ears, nasal cavity), and the feeding system.

Functions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow stereoscopic vision, and fixing the position of the ears to help the brain use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.

The English word &quot;skull&quot; is probably derived from Old Norse &quot;skalli&quot; meaning bald, while the Latin word cranium comes from the Greek root κρανίον (kranion).

The skull is made of a number of fused flat bones.

'''The femur or thigh bone''', is the most proximal (closest to the center of the body) bone of the leg in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the rear legs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body.

'''The fibula or calf bone''' is a leg bone located on the lateral side of the tibia, with which it is connected above and below. It is the smaller of the two bones, and, in proportion to its length, the slenderest of all the long bones. Its upper extremity is small, placed toward the back of the head of the tibia, below the level of the knee joint, and excluded from the formation of this joint. Its lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia, and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.

'''The humerus'''is a long bone in the arm or forelimb that runs from the shoulder to the elbow.

Anatomically, in modern humans, it connects the scapula and the lower arm (consisting of the radius and ulna), and consists of three sections. The upper extremity consists of a rounded head, a narrow neck, and two short processes (tubercles, sometimes called tuberosities.) Its body is cylindrical in its upper portion, and more prismatic below. The lower extremity consists of 2 epicondyles, 2 processes (trochlea &amp; capitulum), and 3 fossae (radial fossa, coronoid fossa, and olecranon fossa). As well as its true anatomical neck, the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus is referred to as its surgical neck due to its tendency to commonly get fractured, thus often becoming the focus of surgeons.

'''The mandible''',is a lower jaw or jawbone is a bone forming the skull with the cranium.

In lobe-finned fishes and the early fossil tetrapods, the bone homologous to the mandible of mammals is merely the largest of several bones in the lower jaw. In such animals, it is referred to as the dentary bone, and forms the body of the outer surface of the jaw. It is bordered below by a number of splenial bones, while the angle of the jaw is formed by a lower angular bone and a suprangular bone just above it. The inner surface of the jaw is lined by a prearticular bone, while the articular bone forms the articulation with the skull proper. Finally a set of three narrow coronoid bones lie above the prearticular bone. As the name implies, the majority of the teeth are attached to the dentary, but there are commonly also teeth on the coronoid bones, and sometimes on the prearticular as well.

'''The maxillae''',is consist of upper palate of mouth or maxilla or two halves that are fused at the intermaxillary suture to form the upper jaw. This is similar to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two halves at the mandibular symphysis.

'''The Metacarpus''' is the intermediate part of the hand skeleton that is located between the phalanges (bones of the fingers) and the carpus which forms the connection to the forearm. The metacarpus consists of metacarpal bones. Its equivalent in the foot is the metatarsus.

The '''metatarsus or metatarsal bones''' are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. Lacking individual names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted with Roman numerals). The metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones of the hand. The lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.

This image shows all the bones listed above.  It should be noted that the maxillary bones are the bones of the face.  Also note that the ulna connects to the humerus and is larger than the radius.  The radius connects to the ulna.  The phalanges are both the finger bones and the toe bones.

==6. What is a joint?==
A joint is the place where two bones come into contact with one another.

==7. List three types of joints found between bones.==
'''Fibrous''' joints are where the bones are connected together by a fibrous connective tissue.  These joints allow for little to no movement.  An example of fibrous joints are the joints between the various bones in the cranium.  

'''Cartilagenous''' joints are connected by cartilage.  These joints allow for little movement.  An example of a cartilagenous joint is the joint between the ribs and the sternum.  

'''Synovial''' joints are separated by an empty space called a synovial cavity.  These joints allow the most movement.  Examples of a synovial joints are the elbow and the knee.

==8. Name and describe six types of freely movable joints. Be able to locate an example of each of these in your body.==
[[Image:Gelenke_Zeichnung01.jpg|400px|center|Joints: 1-Ball and socket; 2-Ellipsoid; 3-Saddle; 4-Hinge; 5-Pivot]]
# '''Ball and Socket''' joints can be found in the hip.  These joints allow for movement in many directions.
# '''Ellipsoid''' joints can be found in the knee.  When the knee is extended, it does not allow rotation.  When it is flexed, it allows for limited rotation.
# '''Saddle''' joints can be found in the fingers and thumbs.  
# '''Hinge''' joints can be found in the elbow between the humerus and the ulna.  A hinge joint works just like a door hinge, allowing motion in only one direction.
# '''Pivot''' joints can also be found in the elbow between the ulna and the radius.  This type of joint allows one bone to rotate about the other.
# '''Gliding''' joints can be found between the carpals in the wrists.  These joints allow limited movement between the bones as one glides past the other.

==9. Be creative and construct a model of one of the six freely movable joints.==
Approaches to constructing a model include:
# Form the bones with clay and then let them harden.
# Cover wooden dowels with papier-mâché.
# Make a wire frame and cover that with papier-mâché.
# Carve bones out of soft wood (such as balsa or pine).
# Make an impression in wet sand and fill with plaster.
# Make cross-sections out of paperboard and glue them together.
# Make the bones from sugar cookie dough and then bake them (a saddle joint or gliding joint works best for this approach).
# Use Pathfinders to model the bones and muscles in a joint. A simpler joint like the elbow is easiest. Make sure each Pathfinder knows the name and function of the body part he/she is modeling.
Be sure to review requirement 17 before starting.  It's important to know how this model will be used during the design phase.

==10. What is another name for a broken bone?  List 3 types of breaks that can occur in bones. Describe how bones heal and how doctors can help this process.==
Another name for a broken bone is &quot;fracture.&quot;  There are two main types of fractures, '''open''' and '''closed'''.  In an open fracture (also called a compound fracture), the bone protrudes through the skin.  This is a very serious condition as it allows infection to enter the body.  In a closed fracture (also called a simple fracture), the bone stays inside the body.

Sub-categories of fractures include:

'''Transverse''' - the break in the bone is at a right angle to the long axis of the bone.

'''Comminuted''' - the bone breaks into three or more pieces.

'''Greenstick''' - the bone breaks on one side, and the other side is bent.  This is very similar to what happens when a green twig is snapped: it doesn't come all the way apart, but it is clearly broken on one side.

'''Stress''' - a hairline crack in the bone.  The bone does not separate into two pieces.

Living bones are in constant change.  Cells die and are replaced on a regular basis.  Because of this, a bone will heal all by itself if allowed to.  Doctors can help this process in two ways.  First, they can '''set''' the bone.  This is done by making sure the pieces of the bone are aligned properly.  In a comminuted fracture this may involve surgery.  The second way that doctors help bones to heal is by immobilizing them - that is, keeping them from moving around.  This can be done by surrounding the broken limb with a cast, or it can be done by embedding pins inside the body. Some bones do not need to be immobilized when broken (such as the nose).

==11. What is osteoporosis?  Who can get it? List at least 5 health habits that deal with maintaining healthy bones and muscles.==
Osteoporosis is the depletion of minerals from the bone.  Minerals in bones give them their strength, so a bone with a low '''b'''one '''m'''ineral '''d'''ensity (or BMD) is more susceptible to breakage, even when stressed only lightly.  Anyone can get osteoporosis, but it is more common in postmenopausal women.  Some of the risk factors of getting osteoporosis cannot be reduced by modifying behavior (such as being a woman, having dementia, having a family history of weak bones, or being of European descent), but other factors are easily avoided by healthful living.  These health habits include:
# Avoid soft drinks, especially those containing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid phosphoric acid].
# Avoid alcohol.
# Avoid tobacco.
# Maintain a healthy body weight.  Those with abnormally low body weight are more susceptible to osteoporosis.
# Make sure your diet has plenty of calcium.
# Make sure your diet has plenty of vitamin D.
# Get plenty of exercise.

==12. What is the function of the muscular system?==
The muscular system is the system in humans and in animals that facilitate motion.  This motion can be either internal (a beating heart) or external (walking).

==13. Name and describe three types of muscles tissue, Give one example of each.==
# '''Cardiac''' muscles are found only in the heart.  These muscles are what make your heart beat.  Cardiac muscles are the only muscles in the body consisting of branching fibers.
# '''Skeletal''' muscles are attached to the skeleton and are responsible for voluntary (and sometimes involuntary) bodily movement.
# '''Smooth''' muscles are responsible for internal, involuntary (and sometimes voluntary) movement of the organs such as breathing and moving food through the digestive tract.

==14. Be able to identify the following muscles on your body:==
Masseter, Trapezius, Deltoid, Pectoralis, Biceps, Abdominal, Quadriceps,
Triceps, Latissimus dorsi, Gluteus maximus, Hamstrings, Gastrocnemius,
and Soleus.

[[Image:Muscles_labeled.jpg|400px]]

The trapezius, triceps, latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, hamstrings, gastocnemius, and soleus are located on the back of a human, and the arrows indicate their location.  

The gluteus maximus is more commonly known as the buttock.

The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are considered to be the same muscle by some anatomists because they share a tendon.  The soleus is beneath the gastrocnemius which is closer to the skin.  Together, they form the muscle more commonly known as the calf.

==15. Describe the process that causes a muscle to contract.==
[[Image:Skeletal_muscle.jpg|800px]]
# When the muscle is in a resting state, thin strands of a protein called tropomyosin are wrapped around the actin filaments, blocking the myosin binding sites. This keeps the myosin from binding to actin.
# Molecules called troponin are attached to the tropomyosin.
# When calcium is introduced into the muscle cell, calcium ions bind to troponin molecules.
# Calcium then pulls troponin, causing tropomyosin to be moved as well, therefore causing the myosin binding sites on the actin to be exposed.
# Myosin binds to the now-exposed binding sites.
# As soon as the myosin head binds to actin, the head bends at its hinge.
# Once the head bends, the myosin loses energy, and remains attached to the actin.
# When re-energized by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the myosin head detaches from the actin filament, and is ready to attach and bend again.
# The collective bending of numerous myosin heads (all in the same direction), combine to move the actin molecules closer together. This results in a muscle contraction.

==16. Describe the difference between voluntary and involuntary muscles.==
Voluntary muscles are attached to the skeletal frame and are generally under the control of the person to whom they belong.  These are the muscles in the arms and legs (and elsewhere).  Involuntary muscles are controlled by the autonomic system without the conscious control by the individual.  Your heart continues to beat, you continue to breathe, and you digest your food even when you are not thinking about it.

==17. Using your model in #9, show how muscles, bones, and joints work together to produce movement.==
Please note that the answers given here are only possibilities.  If you know a creative way to do this, you are encouraged to add it.

*Use rubberbands or elastic as muscles.  Stretch them such that the joint can be moved by hand and then snap back into position when the rubber band (muscle) contracts.  

*If you use cookie dough, you may have a hard time keeping the bones from breaking.  You may wish to form the dough around something a little more substantive, such as a dowel, a stick of celery, or perhaps a carrot.  In this case you may use Twizzlers as muscles.  Although they will not contract, they look kind of like muscles and taste pretty good.

*If you use clay, plaster, or papier-mâché, be sure to make anchor points for the muscles before the &quot;bones&quot; harden.  Try using cup hooks or eye hooks for this purpose.  If using a wire frame, you can make the anchors out of the wire.

*If you use Pathfinders to model the joint, have them pull alternately (since muscles do not push) on the Pathfinders who are modeling the bones of the joint, to achieve the proper motion of the joint in all of its proper directions. This is usually more easily achieved if everyone is lying down, so gravity is less of a factor.

==18. Find 3 texts in the Bible that mention bones and/or muscles.  Tell about each one in your own words.==
Note: In many translations of the Bible, the term &quot;flesh&quot; is used to describe muscles.  Here are several passages featuring bones and muscles.  Encourage your Pathfinders to look through more than the required three verses. It will be easier for them to describe the passage in their own words if they have made a connection with the verses.

* Genesis 2:21-24
* Exodus 12:46
* Job 40:16
* Job 10:10-12
* Psalm 22:14
* Ezekiel 37:1-12
* John 19:36
* Psalm 139:13-16

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to wikibooks.  Which other wiki texts are you working on?  Are they books here on this site?  Chapters from existing books of yours that need wikification, would be welcome as raw text. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 05:30, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

I'm confused what you are doing [[What Is Stuttering? | here]], I almost gave it a speedy deletion tag, but I see that it is new. If it is a page in a book, you should start a book and then make that page a page of that book. &quot;What Is Stuttering&quot; is not &quot;book&quot; material. Of course, it is welcome to stay if you have a bigger book planned for it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:24, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

&quot;What Is Stuttering?&quot; is the first chapter of the book. I have about a dozen more chapters, you can see them at http://www.universitycollegepress.com/Books/NoMiracleCures/. I'm new to wiki-ing, some things confuse me. I'm trying to set up each chapter as a seperate file, to not exceed the 32K limit. I can't find a style guide explaining how to do the references and footnotes. Also how did you put your signature at the end of your note?

: Oh, i see now. We have a naming convention here in wikibooks, and I moved your page to: [[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/What_Is_Stuttering?]]

: As for signature, that is &lt;nowiki&gt; --~~~~ &lt;/nowiki&gt;. Actually, the 4 ~ would do it, but generally people put -- before their sigs. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:35, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, you did exactly what I wanted. I couldn't figure it out.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 02:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Lol, you have done it again :) What you do is add Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/ to the beginning of the links. So you go &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/What_Is_Stuttering?]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for [[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/What_Is_Stuttering?]] and so on, and so forth. I'll move the other page you created. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:49, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

: Additionally, you can go
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/What_Is_Stuttering? |What Is Stuttering?]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for [[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/What_Is_Stuttering? |What Is Stuttering?]]

:: Actually, I'll just do that on the [[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering|main]] page for you. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:51, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

== Deletion of Pages ==

Please don't blank pages that you want to delete.  It causes us no end of grief here and with other Wikimedia projects.  If you can, please use the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|comment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' markup template on the page if you want to delete something from here.  We will find the page sooner and be able to deal with the deletion without having to fight through other pages first.

Thank you, though, for trying to help make Wikibooks a better place.  We do appreciate people like you trying to help find stuff that really doesn't belong.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:36, 23 January 2006 (UTC)


OK, thanks. Figuring out how to structure the Russian grammar pages took several false tries. :-) --[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 17:14, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Merge ===

If you merged to pages it might be easier to #redirect to the old page then to mark them for delete. Problem is: I can't delete the page until I have seen the page it was merged to check if the merge was truely performed. Or I know you to be a trustworthy contributer.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:03, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

I wanted to comment the URL for the new, merged file but last night Comcast slowed to a crawl and I was too frustrated to wait another fifteen minutes to look up a URL. And this is 8 megabit service. :-(--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 17:34, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

===Another PDF edition?===
I have just had a glance at your book and see that there have been many changes. If you would like me to produce a PDF edition 2.0 to replace the existing just drop me a line at my talk page when you are ready. Alternatively you could do it.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:19, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

:Sorry, I had a brainstorm and figured out a better way to structure the book. My new idea is to design the book to encourage user contributions. If this works, people should be adding material every week. Maybe we shouldn't have a PDF version?--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 17:19, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

::See how it goes - if the book is truly dynamic a PDF would be a bad idea, if it is stable it might help readers to download the whole thing. Leave it for 6 months? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:20, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

:I don't foresee making any major changes. Is there a way to view how many people are reading the book. No one is making changes, so I wonder if anyone is reading it?--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 20:37, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

== Conflict of interest? ==

Thomas, as the owner of a company that sells anti-stuttering devices, you have a vested interest in putting these devices in the best possible light.  I am not necessarily questioning either your motives or the accuracy of the information you have posted, but you need to disclose your financial interest clearly in each article about anti-stuttering devices.  You can only improve your credibility by doing so.  The need for complete honesty is particularly necessary in a medical topic such as stuttering--with all the snake-oil &quot;cures&quot; out there, people looking for help need the most reliable information about treatments. You are a leader in the stuttering community, and as such you have a duty to ensure that they get the best possible information, with ''all'' biases properly disclosed.

Pending disclosure on your part, I have added provisional disclaimers to these articles.

== re:&quot;Basic Book Design&quot; ==

Hey Tdkehoe, I was wondering if you'd heard of http://www.lulu.com/ ? I'm not suggesting them as an alternative to Wikibooks, but just another possibility. It's certainly possible to free-license something and still sell it. (I haven't used them yet, but I'm thinking about it. They seem pretty decent but no personal experience to speak of.) cheers, [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 08:20, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

:Their prices are good, about the same as any digital book printer, and less than half the price of Amazon's BookSurge.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 14:43, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Stuttering]] Conflict of interest ==

Hello Tom, how are you? We've received reports from people at Wikipedia that you have a conflict of interest because of your work. This has also led to some accusations that some of your contributions to the stuttering book, especially where it concerns products from your company, are biased. 

This isn't as big a problem here on Wikibooks as it is on Wikipedia, but it still needs to be corrected. We are going to read through the book, and make sure that everything is properly unbiased, and that there are no significant problems arising from this conflict of interest. I know that it is natural to add bias when you write, especially on topics for which you are an &quot;expert&quot;. I know that there have been occasions when I needed to take a step back and try to view my own contributions from a neutral perspective, because I was adding bias of my own. It's not a problem when it happens, so long as people are willing to work to fix it. 

We're going to do what we can to fix the book and remove any problems. If you could do me a favor, please try to avoid adding additional bias to the book. I know that it's hard, but it's a policy here and we need to try and maintain object neutrality. Please let me know if you have any questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:12, 2 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

I am uncertain and will continue reading and cogitating upon it at another time. 8) [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 06:06, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

== The uncertainty principle has nothing to say about a single particle ==

The description of the uncertainty principle seems to go beyond what quantum mechanics can actually say. The result can only be obtained for an average of an ensemble of measurements. These could either be a series of measurements at the same time or a set of measurements one after the other.

To show that an individual measurement is not covered, consider putting a beam of electrons into a sharply defined state of momentum. This causes the position in the direction of the motion to be uncertain. You can then stop an arbitrary individual electron at a precise position. At the time of that measurement the position and momentum of the electron are precisely known. Of course, subsequent to the measurement that electron is no longer in a precise state of momentum.

In addition, this can only be done for an arbitrary electron of the set - there is no way to do this for a defined electron.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Literature may refer to any number of poetic, dramatic, fictional or nonfictional works from anywhere in the world. When people think of Literature they often picture dusty  old libraries crammed full of leather bound books. They think of the English novelists of the 18th and 19th centuries or the ancient Greek dramatists. The mythology of Africa and the haikus of Japan are not often included in this rather limited view of what constitutes &quot;Literature&quot;. That is the purpose of this book; to open up you, the reader, to literature through space and time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''waltz''' is a smooth, progressive dance in 3/4 or 6/8 time, done primarily in closed position. It first became fashionable in Vienna in about the 1780s, then spread to many other countries within the next few years. The waltz, and especially its closed position, became the example for the creation of many other ballroom dances. Subsequently, new types of waltz have developed, including many folk dance and several ballroom dance types. 

In contemporary ballroom dance, fast versions of the waltz are called Viennese waltz.

International Standard Waltz has only closed figures; that is, the couple never leaves closed position.  

Contrast American Style Waltz,in which some figures involve breaking contact entirely.  For example, the Syncopated Side-by-Side with Spin includes a free spin for both the man and lady.  Open rolls are another good example of an open dance figure, in which the lady alternates between the man's left and right sides, with the man's left or right arm (alone) providing the lead. 

See http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/International-American.htm for a more information regarding the differences between International and American Waltz.

A typical waltz figure (from the man's perspective) starts lowered into the knees and travelling forward with a strong heel lead.  Count 2 rises and is taken on the ball of the foot, and count 3 starts on the ball of the foot and lowers to the heel as the couple begins to lower in preparation for the next measure.  A smooth rise-and-fall action is a primary characteristic of this dance.

Hey, you notice how I've re-set up the Warrior Skills and Builds section so far? If you need help adding those kinds of links, I'll just walk in and modify your writing. It is somewhat hard to understand though, took me a bloody week learning how to do that correctly.

But if you think you can learn by reading my code, by all means, go ahead. Save me some trouble :-p --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:21, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

 Why did the chicken cross the road?

Ballroom Dancers' response:

“Crossing the road followed line of dance.”

“To get the judges' attention.”

“The road lead, the chicken followed.”

I edited the first few paragraphs (it's not a pirate!).  I would use a link about Helmholtz.  Generally too wordy: try make sentences shorter and include more visuals.  --[[User:LM|me513]]




== Proposal ==
According to a recent discovery in archeology, the earliest musical instrument, which should be probably simple flutes or whistles made from bone, can be traced back to more than 100,000 years ago. Since then, music has been played an important role in our daily lives. People, especially musicians, tend to utilize ''color'' words, shimmer, darkness, or even some abstract words, relaxation, repose, to describe music, but not many people really figure out how musical instruments ''sing''. I would like to examine the physical principles and phenomenon behind the veil. For personal interest, I chose violin as my topic. The phonation of violin can be produced through the interaction between the bow and strings, vibration of the body, and air resonating inside the body. I will illustrate the vibration pattern of the strings, which is the famous Helmholtz motion, how the vibration produced by the stings be passed to the body, and the importance of the air inside the body. The principle and phenomenon discovered here can also be analogized to other musical instruments.

Hey dragontamer, I really wanted to get your opinion of the editorial board proposal that i've been working on. I'm envisioning this board as being a more formal replacement for the [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]] project page, although I dont think acceptance of one necessarily dictates a rejection of the other. 

I really want to get some input on this, I'm very interested in getting this proposal (or a similar one) accepted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cuban Rumba == 
Rumba is a latin dance that arose in Havana in the 1890s.  As a sexually-charged Afro-Cuban dance, rumba was often suppressed and restricted because it was viewed as dangerous and lewd.

Later, Prohibition in the United States caused a flourishing of the relatively-tolerated cabaret rumba, as American tourists flocked to see crude ''sainetes'' (short plays) which featured racial stereotypes and generally, though not always, rumba.


There are several rhythms of the Rumba family, and associated styles of dance:

Today social Rumba is usually danced very slowly with a romantic quality and sexy flair, which results from Cuban motion. 

The American style is done in a &quot;Box&quot; pattern to a Slow Quick Quick timing.

==waqf (pausal pronunciation)==
What are the pausal forms of all the pronouns. Pausal form/(with waqf): the way it can be pronounced at the end of a sentence (if one pauses while reading).
      naHnu =&gt; naHn (I'm guessing)
anta =&gt; ant            an-tun-na =&gt; an-tun
an-ti =&gt; ant           
huwa  =&gt;  ?       hun-na=&gt;hun
hiya  =&gt;  ?
The same in both pronunciations:
ana,hum,antumaa,humaa,antum
Please correct any mistakes I made, and provide some answers. Thank you.

Shouldn't that be moo-fau instead of moo-foo?

Please be more specific, I don't know which part you are talking about. As far as I can see there is no place where it should be &quot;moo-fau&quot; instead of &quot;moo-foo&quot;.--[[User:TwoThirty|TwoThirty]] 16:40, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

== A mistake? ==
In the following line:
تـُو a waaw with a fatHa (pronounced: too)
I'm almost sure that's supposed to say a Dammah. But I don't know Arabic really, so I don't feel confident enough to change it. Also, the section following is supposed to be a list of examples where the waaw has a symbol on it, but I don't see anything in it (using latest version of Firefox in Windows XP).[[User:Clum|Clum]] ([[User talk:Clum|talk]]) 18:41, 8 December 2007 (UTC)</text>
